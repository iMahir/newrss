Vance and Walz will be onstage to talk up their candidate — and run down the other party’s. Vance has spent months hitting Vice President Kamala Harris on her record on the border and immigration. Walz, meanwhile, has hit Vance and former President Donald Trump on their opposition to reproductive rights, tying them to the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360318/project-2025-trump-policies-abortion-divorce\">highly unpopular Project 2025</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Follow here for the latest news news, analysis, and explainers, and sign up for <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/the-election-explained-politics-newsletter\"><strong>The election, explained</strong>,</a> our pop-up newsletter about the 2024 race.</p>\n<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/373954/tim-walz-piglet-factory-farming-climate\">The ugly reality behind Tim Walz’s farm-friendly image</a>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/368150/tim-walz-dnc-speech-accept-nomination\">Tim Walz’s DNC speech used Midwestern dad energy to sell a liberal agenda</a>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/366201/tim-walz-record-governor-progressive-agenda\">Is Tim Walz a progressive or a centrist — or both?</a>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/366195/jd-vance-tim-vance-military-record-national-guard\">How to think about the attacks on Tim Walz’s military record</a>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/365535/tim-walz-minneapolis-burning-riot-george-floyd-minnesota-2020-protest\">How Tim Walz actually handled the George Floyd protests in Minnesota</a>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/363473/jd-vance-weird-voting-parents-demeny-postliberalism\">Where J.D.

The storm <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/weather/live-blog/helene-deadly-storm-live-updates-rcna173203\">destroyed homes, businesses, and roadways</a>, left <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/09/30/helene-aftermath-live-updates-monday-north-carolina/75447978007/\">millions without power</a> and cell service, and stranded people in <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-north-carolina-asheville-f02869c7d01e68f2d7f0553abb82252f\">western North Carolina in the midst of  several feet of floodwater</a>. More than <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/374794/helene-flooding-hurricane-asheville-carolina\">130 deaths</a> have been reported across six states, including Florida, Tennessee, Georgia, and North Carolina.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Supplies are <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-asheville-flooding-north-carolina-tennessee-078a298cdcaaf46749f3f6683a4e1057\">being airlifted</a> into impacted areas of North Carolina and the National Guard has been deployed to <a href=\"https://www.army.mil/article/280098/national_guard_assists_with_hurricane_helene_response_in_southeast\">assist in rescue efforts</a>. As relief continues, many across the country are looking to offer their support.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Here are some ways you can help the burgeoning relief effort and what to avoid in order to not hinder emergency and rescue crews on the ground in these pivotal early days.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What you can do right now</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the immediate aftermath of the storm, do not send donations or supplies that have not been specifically requested by state and local organizations, according to the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency. In <a href=\"https://x.com/tennesseeema/status/1840439256327827927?s=46\">a statement on X</a>, TEMA said it is not accepting volunteers or donations “until the life safety mission is complete.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">While local communities appreciate the volunteer spirit during disasters, please DO NOT send donations that have not been requested by state or local authorities.<br><br>TEMA is not accepting volunteers or donations until the life safety mission is complete.

If you are local to the areas impacted by Helene, connect with established local or national charitable organizations to ensure you’re donating exactly what is needed and in the necessary quantities (usually in bulk). Used clothing is never necessary, per FEMA.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">North Carolina Emergency Management <a href=\"https://x.com/NCEmergency/status/1840456630095184040\">advised against traveling to western North Carolina</a> in order to keep roads cleared for rescue and utility crews. If you have a trip planned to an affected community in the immediate aftermath of a disaster, consider delaying or canceling your trip: <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/368920/what-to-do-natural-disaster-vacation-travel-earthquake-wildfire-hurricane-flooding\">tourists may complicate search and rescue efforts.</a> The state also asks that people <a href=\"https://www.ncdps.gov/our-organization/emergency-management/hurricane-helene#ThestormhasnowendedandmyhomeorcommunityhasdamageWhatisnext-8119\">do not send physical donations and volunteers</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">⚠️ DO NOT travel to western NC.

Until a disaster area has been declared safe to enter and volunteer needs are identified, stay home and donate instead. Volunteers should only come once they have been given an assignment with an established organization that has asked for assistance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Volunteers will be <a href=\"https://www.nvoad.org/volunteer/\">needed in the months following a disaster</a>, according to Voluntary Organizations Active In Disaster, so be patient. You can check for opportunities at <a href=\"https://www.nvoad.org/volunteer/\">the National Voluntary Organizations Active In Disaster</a>, which coordinates disaster response across a number of organizations nationwide.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

But given that poultry companies typically pack anywhere from<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.thepoultrysite.com/articles/fad-broilers-brooding\">20,000</a> <a href=\"https://www.aces.edu/blog/topics/farm-management/new-farmers-guide-to-the-commercial-broiler-industry-poultry-husbandry-biosecurity-basics/#:~:text=It%20is%20common%20for%20there,those%20birds%20have%20fewer%20chickens.\">to 52,000 chickens</a> into each barn, which can run as big as nearly twice the length of a football field, an estimated 2.14 million to 5.56 million birds are likely to have died. (The true total could be modestly different, as some birds could’ve survived damages, and some barns could’ve been temporarily empty, as companies clear them out for a few weeks between flocks.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some of the nation’s largest poultry companies — including <a href=\"https://www.wattagnet.com/broilers-turkeys/article/15704638/us-poultry-industry-harshly-hit-by-hurricane-helene\">Aviagen</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-30/hurricane-helene-halts-poultry-plants-damages-pecan-trees\">Pilgrim’s Pride</a> and <a href=\"https://www.porkbusiness.com/news/industry/hurricane-helene-shutters-poultry-plants-smithfield-did-not-suffer-material\">Wayne-Sanderson Farms</a> — suspended operations at their local facilities due to power outages in recent days. A spokesperson for Clemson University&#8217;s agriculture program told Vox that while this is a fluid situation and it is still evaluating the hurricane’s damages, 45,000 chickens died at one South Carolina poultry operation due to generator failure.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Virtually all chickens raised for meat in the US are confined in these sprawling warehouses, which bear no resemblance to the small barns of America’s agricultural past. These factory farm operations often have at least several sheds, housing hundreds of thousands of birds on one site at the same time. If enough facilities are compromised during a natural disaster like Hurricane Helene, millions of animals can perish, their last moments likely frightening and painful.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Their deaths also threaten the economic health of farmers and the poultry industry. Georgia’s agriculture commissioner, Tyler Harper, has <a href=\"https://agr.georgia.gov/sites/default/files/documents/emergency-response/9-29-24-hurricane-helene-emergency-appropriations-letter.pdf\">requested</a> immediate federal relief for the state’s agricultural sector.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When hurricanes strike factory farms, they can also flush untold amounts of animal manure into groundwater or rivers and streams, exacerbating the challenges that governments and their residents face in the wake of pounding storms.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/7Xyjx-factory-farm-animals-release-nearly-1-trillion-pounds-of-manure-annually-that-s-twice-as-much-as-humans-2.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,17.604058897911,100,64.791882204178\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hurricane Helene is the latest — but not the first — striking, high-stakes example of how our factory farming system imposes tremendous cruelty onto animals and also imperils human health. The industry has no reason to change, even after a catastrophe like this, because taxpayers cover much of the economic loss meat companies incur from natural disasters.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">How taxpayers subsidize factory farming’s risks</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is far from the first time a hurricane has torn through the Southeast’s poultry industry. It’s happened multiple times over the last quarter-century, a period in which Big Ag has only <a href=\"https://www.ewg.org/research/innovative-ewg-study-uses-ai-find-357m-poultry-north-carolinas-factory-farms\">doubled down</a> on building more, and bigger, factory farms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 1999, Hurricane Floyd put much of eastern North Carolina underwater, killing an <a href=\"https://www.weather.gov/ilm/floyd\">estimated</a> 2.4 million chickens, 100,000 pigs, and half a million turkeys. North Carolina pig farms store the animals’ waste in giant manure “lagoons,” and several <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/09/22/650698240/hurricane-s-aftermath-floods-hog-lagoons-in-north-carolina#:~:text=In%201999%2C%20flooding%20from%20Hurricane,to%20The%20New%20York%20Times.&amp;text=Hurricane%20Floyd%20forced%20North%20Carolina%20to%20make%20changes.\">overflowed</a> during Floyd, sending toxic sludge containing bacteria and viruses (including <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/6/29/17517906/romaine-lettuce-e-coli-outbreak-over\">E. coli</a>) into waterways and drinking water, <a href=\"https://climate.ncsu.edu/blog/2019/09/farmers-felt-floyds-full-force-beginning-in-onslow-county/\">according</a> to the state’s climate office.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Chicken factory farms store manure in giant pits or as large mounds, creating a similar pollution risk as hog farms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/2016/10/25/post-matthew-water-how-bad-is-it/\">Hurricane Matthew</a> in 2016 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/21/hurricane-florence-flooding-north-carolina\">Hurricane Florence</a> in 2018 also caused devastation in North Carolina, killing millions of chickens and thousands of pigs, both of which caused damage to some manure lagoons, resulting in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/21/hurricane-florence-flooding-north-carolina\">“fecal soup”</a> discharge. Later the same year, Hurricane Michael <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220212232153/http://agr.georgia.gov/hurricane-michael-devastates-georgias-agricultural-industry.aspx\">destroyed</a> over 80 chicken barns in Georgia that housed more than 2 million chickens.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Manure can seep into groundwater and contaminate private wells that many rural communities rely on for drinking water, a perennial concern <a href=\"https://hazards.colorado.edu/article/hogs-and-hurricanes-while-flood-water-recedes-animal-waste-pollution-doesn-t\">heightened</a> after major storms.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/GettyImages-1037412200.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.729273205801,100,78.541453588399\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"A flooded hog farm in North Carolina after Hurricane Florence in 2018. | Alex Wroblewski/Bloomberg via Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Alex Wroblewski/Bloomberg via Getty Images\" /><img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/WAM7693.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.669135487166,100,78.661729025667\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Farmed chickens died in the flooding in North Carolina after Hurricane Florence in 2018. | Jo-Anne McArthur/We Animals\" data-portal-copyright=\"Jo-Anne McArthur/We Animals\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite that history, the poultry and pork industries haven’t done much to mitigate the risks posed by natural disasters by, say, raising fewer animals on their farms or making major changes to how they manage the enormous amounts of manure their animals generate. That’s because US taxpayers bear much of the cost, both for the environmental cleanup and the dead chickens and pigs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When natural disasters hit a typical chicken farm, the meat company — which technically owns the chickens, not the farmer — receives <a href=\"https://www.fsa.usda.gov/Assets/USDA-FSA-Public/usdafiles/FactSheets/2024/fsa_lip_livestock_3_2024.pdf\">$3 per mature bird</a> from the US Department of Agriculture, about 75 percent of the bird’s market value. The farmer that supplies to the meatpacker receives just 33 cents per bird.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many chicken farmers, most of whom raise birds on a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23207301/costco-rotisserie-chicken-poultry-farming-inflation\">contract basis</a> for meat companies, are already toiling in precarious economic conditions. Hurricanes and other natural disasters can make it much worse.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The federal government also reimburses economic losses from other severe weather, like heat waves and cold snaps, and disease outbreaks. Over the last two years, a highly pathogenic strain of bird flu — known as H5N1 — has resulted in the death of <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/data-map-commercial.html\">more than 100 million</a> poultry birds, and the federal government has given well over <a href=\"https://www.agriculture.com/usda-has-spent-usd1-billion-fighting-bird-flu-8424034#:~:text=Since%20bird%20flu%20outbreaks%20began,Health%20Inspection%20Service%20on%20Monday.\">$1 billion</a> to the poultry industry, much of it going to the largest companies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Livestock production is both a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/362224/environment-groups-meat-industry-lies-global-warming-climate-change-wwf\">leading driver of climate change</a> and, as Hurricane Helene demonstrates, a victim of it. As global warming increases the frequency and intensity of natural disasters, policymakers should question the factory farming model. Instead, as a recent <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24079424/factory-farming-facts-meat-usda-agriculture-census\">federal accounting</a> of the US agricultural system shows, we’re doubling down on it, raising more and more animals on bigger and bigger farms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“In addition to all the environmental problems associated with the factory farm model, and the public health problems that it causes, at the end of the day the extreme concentration of animals is just a fundamental vulnerability,” said Chris Hunt, deputy director of the nonprofit Socially Responsible Agriculture Project. “It’s a vulnerability to unexpected shocks to the system … The fact that poultry is not only concentrated on [factory farms], but is also concentrated geographically, is certainly problematic.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Houses ripped from their foundations. Entire towns reduced to mud and debris.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On Thursday night, Hurricane Helene slammed Florida as a Category 4 storm with winds reaching 140 miles per hour. Along the coast, Helene knocked down trees and power lines, and caused <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/09/28/helene-storm-surge-city-impact/\">record storm surge</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet some of its most devastating impacts were farther inland as the storm moved across the Southeast. Even before the bulk of the storm arrived in North Carolina, Helene started dumping rain in southern Appalachia —&nbsp;and loads of it. Over the last several days some regions in western North Carolina, near the city of Asheville, recorded more than <a href=\"https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc4.html?fbclid=IwY2xjawFnj-FleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHQqOqR_oagJDph7eil_N509txd3OqBKDRXp32EW-RoBFI7FQBsXg0QAghg_aem_P0uioRN-URPjEzaFxpwkmA\">2.5 feet</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Was able to talk to my husband in Asheville for the first time in over 24 hours today.

That number is almost certain to rise. Hundreds of people are still unaccounted for, in part because millions of households have lost power and there are still widespread cell outages. Many roads are also inaccessible, making rescue operations challenging.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Stunned by the devastation, some residents <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/09/28/helene-flooding-carolinas-tennessee-destruction/\">have compared</a> flooding in parts of North Carolina to the impacts from Hurricane Katrina, which made landfall in Louisiana in 2005. Katrina claimed <a href=\"https://www.weather.gov/mob/katrina\">more than 1,800 lives</a>. In the weeks to come, Helene may become one of the deadliest US hurricanes in recent history.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The eighth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, Helene is yet another reminder that climate change — which can intensify hurricanes and flooding — costs human lives. Record-warm water in the Gulf of Mexico <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/373874/hurricane-helene-florida-forecast-warm-ocean-water\">supercharged the storm</a> and loaded it with moisture. Generally speaking, hot air also holds more water. Together these dynamics helped turn Helene into a deadly, super-wet storm.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And as these last few days have revealed, it’s not just coastal communities that are vulnerable. Asheville <a href=\"https://www.thenewlede.org/2022/08/dubbed-a-climate-haven-a-north-carolina-community-braces-itself/\">has been dubbed a climate haven</a> —&nbsp;a refuge from the impacts of warming and its consequences. But in reality, few places are completely safe.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/GettyImages-2174887967.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.4613147178592,100,93.077370564282\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"The main street in Tarpon Springs, Florida inundated with water on September 27. | Joe Raedle/Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Joe Raedle/Getty Images\" />\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">1) How bad is the damage?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Helene’s path of destruction began in the eastern Caribbean, where the storm formed early last week. Helene brushed Cancun as a tropical storm, flooding the streets and downing trees, before churning across the warm Gulf of Mexico and intensifying into a major hurricane. On Thursday evening, it slammed into the Big Bend of Florida —&nbsp;the region where the panhandle meets the peninsula —&nbsp;as a Category 4 storm.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Landfall caused record-breaking storm surge, a rise in sea level, along parts of Florida’s Gulf Coast, including in Tampa Bay and the small island of Cedar Key. Some areas saw water levels rise 15 feet above ground level, according to <a href=\"https://x.com/NHC_Surge/status/1839677998880227563\">preliminary modeling</a> by the National Hurricane Center.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The storm left Florida <a href=\"https://x.com/VortixWx/status/1840740671667228942\">homes in ruins</a>. Officials estimate that Helene destroyed around a quarter of all homes on Cedar Key, which lies about 130 miles north of Tampa, <a href=\"https://www.palmbeachpost.com/story/news/2024/09/29/reality-of-hurricanes-devastation-setting-in-along-with-relief/75430622007/\">according to</a> the Palm Beach Post.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Much of the worst damage, however, was in regions less familiar with the threat of tropical storms: the mountains of Georgia, Tennessee, and especially North Carolina. The main problem in the southeastern US was abundant, unceasing rain, which began falling before Helene made landfall in Florida. It caused rivers to swell in populated areas like Atlanta and Asheville. Asheville is the largest city in western North Carolina, with roughly 95,000 residents.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Videos and images over the weekend showed much of Asheville’s River Arts District —&nbsp;which hugs the French Broad River, southwest of downtown —&nbsp;utterly inundated with water, which nearly submerged buildings. Many of the shops and businesses, which are a lifeblood of the region, are unsalvageable, Will Hofmann, of the Asheville Citizen Times, <a href=\"https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2024/09/29/tropical-storm-helene-floods-wipe-out-asheville-river-arts-district/75433499007/\">reports</a>. In Buncombe County, which envelops Asheville, 40 people have died due to the storm and its impacts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">State officials <a href=\"https://drivenc.gov/\">said</a> all roads in western North Carolina, including parts of Interstate 40, were closed and should only be used by emergency vehicles. In nearby Tennessee, meanwhile, more than a dozen bridges are closed and five of them “are completely gone,” the state’s Department of Transportation <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/share/v/keWHTMT8dia6dF6g/\">said</a> Sunday.&nbsp;Many roads and areas in Great Smoky Mountains National Park are also <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grsm/planyourvisit/conditions.htm\">closed</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Power outages and water shortages are also rampant across the Southeast. As of late Tuesday morning, more than 1.5 million people were without electricity across South Carolina, Georgia, North Carolina, Florida, and Virginia, according to <a href=\"http://poweroutage.us\">PowerOutage.us</a>. Parts of western North Carolina are under a boil water advisory, due to a disruption in the public water supply. Repairs to Asheville’s water system could take weeks, <a href=\"https://www.ashevillenc.gov/news/tropical-storm-helene-recovery-resources/\">officials said</a>. </p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/GettyImages-2173905556.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.736293776186,100,78.527412447627\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Rainwater filled the streets of Atlanta, Georgia on September 27. | Megan Varner/Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Megan Varner/Getty Images\" />\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">2) How much will the storm cost?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Similarly, it will take weeks to get a full tally of all the damage, though initial estimates suggest it will be in the billions of dollars. <a href=\"https://www.corelogic.com/press-releases/corelogic-hurricane-helene-wind-storm-surge-cause-an-initial-estimated-3-5-billion-in-insured-losses/\">CoreLogic</a>, an analytics firm, put its initial tally between $3 billion and $5 billion in insured losses. <a href=\"https://www.theinsurer.com/news/moodys-analytics-says-helene-like-idalia-but-worse-with-cost-estimated-at-up-to-34bn/\">Moody’s Analytics</a> expects a toll from $20 billion to $34 billion. <a href=\"https://www.accuweather.com/en/hurricane/helene-aftermath-dozens-dead-historic-flooding-millions-without-power-amid-catastrophic-destruction/1697545\">AccuWeather</a>, meanwhile, is setting the price tag between $145 billion and $160 billion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These are all coarse initial estimates, but they indicate the magnitude of the devastation. The higher projections would put Helene in the top tier of costliest storms in the US. Hurricane Katrina, currently the most expensive weather disaster in US history, extracted about <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-20-633r\">$170 billion from the economy</a>. <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2018/01/08/hurricane-harvey-was-years-costliest-us-disaster-125-billion-damages/\">Hurricane Harvey</a> in 2017 cost about $125.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The dollar value, however, doesn’t tell the whole story. Damage estimates are typically based on insurance claims, but with rising premiums across the country, more homes and businesses are <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/06/23/americans-not-buying-homeowners-insurance/74144566007/\">not seeking financial protection</a>. The insured value of a property doesn’t directly translate into suffering, either. A multimillion-dollar coastal vacation home getting swept down a hillside will register as a higher loss on an insurance company’s balance sheet than a destroyed mobile home that’s the sole residence and store of wealth for a family.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">3) Why was flooding in North Carolina so extreme?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The simplest reason is that Helene was huge, stretching more than <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/09/26/hurricane-helene-storm-size-miles/\">more than 400 miles wide</a>, so its impacts —&nbsp;the wind and rain —&nbsp;reached well beyond the eye. Most hurricanes are around <a href=\"https://www.weather.gov/source/zhu/ZHU_Training_Page/tropical_stuff/hurricane_anatomy/hurricane_anatomy.html\">300 miles in diameter</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What’s more is that the storm crossed an exceptionally warm ocean before reaching the mainland. The evaporation of that warm ocean water, which sends columns of moisture into the atmosphere, is what fuels hurricanes, and loads them up with moisture that later falls as rain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even before Helene made landfall in Florida, bands of moisture from the hurricane were pulled into Appalachia. Satellite imagery showed almost the entire East Coast shrouded in cloud cover. That means that some regions were already starting to flood even before the bulk of Helene arrived.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/1250x750.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,1.0066828416975,100,97.986634316605\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"A satellite image taken on September 25. | NOAA\" data-portal-copyright=\"NOAA\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Recent rainfall in these areas, especially the southern Appalachians, have left the grounds saturated and the river tributaries running high,” the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) <a href=\"https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/communities-need-to-prepare-for-catastrophic-life-threatening-inland-flooding-from-helene-even-well\">warned</a> last Wednesday. “Additional rainfall from Helene will exacerbate the existing flood risk.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s also worth noting that this is a wet region of the country.

What all those storms have in common is that they made landfall in the continental US at high intensities in populated areas: Harvey struck the Texas coast at <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2018/01/08/hurricane-harvey-was-years-costliest-us-disaster-125-billion-damages/\">Category 4 strength</a>, Katrina rammed into Louisiana and Mississippi as a <a href=\"https://www.weather.gov/mob/katrina\">Category 3 storm</a>, while Helene was a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/26/weather/video/landfall-hurricane-helene-storm-florida-john-berman-lcl-digvid\">Category 4</a> when it hammered Florida’s Big Bend region.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2021/8/29/22647117/hurricane-ida-categories-explained\">hurricane category ranking system</a> is mainly based on wind speed, while the most dangerous element of these storms is the sheer quantity of water in the form of rainfall and storm surge. All three of these storms caused extensive flooding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Their destruction also compounded on top of local vulnerabilities. Houston suffered intense flooding after Harvey because of the inordinate amount of rain it received, but also because the city is densely populated, relatively flat, and close to sea level. Sections of New Orleans sit below sea level and when Katrina struck, the city’s flood control infrastructure <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/orleans/how-nf.html\">catastrophically failed</a>. Helene landed in Florida’s Big Bend region, which is still recovering <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/23850601/hurricane-idalia-florida-wind-forecast-storm-surge-flood-rapid-intensification\">from the last major hurricane</a>, before moving further inland and dumping rain on regions that have much less experience and infrastructure to cope with extraordinary volumes of water.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A <a href=\"https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2024/05/07/population-growth-in-most-states-lags-long-term-trends\">growing number of people</a> are also living in areas most likely to get hammered by hurricanes, and these states are building more property and infrastructure to accommodate them. That means that when a storm does make landfall, it puts more people in danger and damages more homes, offices, roads, and power lines.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">5) What is the government doing to help?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Before Helene made landfall, forecasters at NOAA put out a <a href=\"https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/communities-need-to-prepare-for-catastrophic-life-threatening-inland-flooding-from-helene-even-well\">rare news release and blunt warning</a> about the storm’s impending damage. The agency said that the hurricane would cause “catastrophic, life-threatening inland flooding.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The governors of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina heeded these alerts and submitted <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/09/27/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administrations-life-saving-and-life-sustaining-response-efforts-to-hurricane-helene/\">emergency declaration requests</a> to the White House.&nbsp;Evacuation orders were issued for <a href=\"https://www.readync.gov/stay-informed/evacuation-orders\">parts of North Carolina</a>, <a href=\"https://www.tn.gov/tema/news/2024/9/28/flash-report--5-hurricane-helene.html\">Tennessee</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.flgov.com/2024/09/25/governor-ron-desantis-issues-updates-on-state-preparedness-efforts-ahead-of-hurricane-helene/\">Florida</a>, but <a href=\"https://www.firstcoastnews.com/article/news/local/taylor-county-sheriffs-office-birthday-on-body/77-d6ee689f-bac3-445d-acc0-a7ff258f958a\">some residents didn’t obey them</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Disaster declarations allow the Federal Emergency Management Agency to get involved in the response with emergency shelters, medical aid, and grants for helping people recover. More than <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/29/us/helene-destruction-florida-north-carolina.html\">1,270 rescuers</a> were sent to the afflicted areas. States also <a href=\"https://www.army.mil/article/280098/national_guard_assists_with_hurricane_helene_response_in_southeast\">mobilized National Guard units</a> to assist with rescue and relief efforts. During a press conference on Monday, President Joe Biden said<a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?538815-1/president-biden-remarks-federal-response-hurricane-helene\"> he may have to call Congress back into session</a> to get more funding to help with the response. Both former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris altered their presidential <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-harris-change-campaign-plans-address-hurricane-helene/story?id=114346629\">campaign schedules</a> in response to the hurricane.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/news/biden-pledges-help-for-helene-victims-for-as-long-as-it-takes-db864385\">Trump criticized Biden</a> for not being in Washington, DC, during the storm, but Biden said he’s been following the situation and will visit areas hit hard by the disaster once rescue operations wind down. Trump is also <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/09/29/trump-hurricane-helene-be-okay/\">planning to visit Georgia</a> to get an update on the storm.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ad hoc networks of local volunteers have also sprung up to provide assistance and relief, even <a href=\"https://wlos.com/news/local/sunday-helene-asheville-updates-death-toll-rises-schools-close-resources-coming\">deploying private airplanes and helicopters</a> to bring supplies to areas now isolated by floods and destroyed roads.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">6) What did climate change have to do with it?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s uncommon —&nbsp;though not unheard of —&nbsp;for tropical storms to travel through southern Appalachia.&nbsp;As shown in the graphic below, several systems (or their remnants) have reached this region in the last few centuries.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-30-at-9.19.16 AM.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,9.7980553477936,100,80.403889304413\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Tropical storms and hurricanes have run through western North Carolina in the past. | NOAA\" data-portal-copyright=\"NOAA\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet it’s now well known that rising global temperatures can make the impacts of these storms much worse. Hotter air and water make the strongest hurricanes stronger and fuel <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2022/9/28/23376761/hurricane-ian-rapid-intensification-climate-change\">rapid intensification</a>, where a storm’s winds pick up by 35 miles per hour or more in less than 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Warmer air holds onto more moisture, which means that hurricanes dish out more rain. A <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/14oq65lavZ7ho3-gdxE-tutDEcsxSHfUj/view\">rapid assessment</a> of Helene by scientists at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory suggests that climate change caused “over 50 percent more rainfall during Hurricane Helene in some parts of Georgia and the Carolinas.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We estimate that the observed rainfall was made up to 20 times more likely in these areas because of global warming,” the scientists wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A hotter climate also causes sea levels to rise —&nbsp;because warm water expands and also melts polar ice —&nbsp;which worsens the impact of storm surge. That tends to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/23850601/hurricane-idalia-florida-wind-forecast-storm-surge-flood-rapid-intensification\">create more flooding</a> in the wake of a hurricane.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Helene appeared in one of the hottest years on record, with ocean temperatures near record highs and atmospheric conditions that scientists say are <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/24145756/la-nina-2024-el-nino-heat-hurricane-record-temperature-pacific\">suited for hurricane formation</a>. NOAA predicted that this year’s hurricane season would be <a href=\"https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/noaa-predicts-above-normal-2024-atlantic-hurricane-season\">above average</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div><div><iframe title=\"How climate change makes hurricanes worse\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_0TCrGtTEQM?rel=0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;\"></iframe></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Risks are only mounting for communities in the Southeast. According to the most recent <a href=\"https://nca2023.globalchange.gov/chapter/22/\">National Climate Assessment</a>, a US government report, growing populations in regions hit by Helene, particularly in cities, has created new vulnerabilities to warming. “Over the last few decades, economic growth in the Southeast has been concentrated in and around urban centers that depend on climate-sensitive infrastructure and regional connections to thrive,” the report states.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">7) How can I help?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For one, check out <a href=\"https://x.com/klcpegher/status/1840431100851585076\">local news outlets</a>, which have the most current information about what’s happening on the ground in places like Asheville. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Blue Ridge Public Radio has compiled <a href=\"https://www.bpr.org/bpr-news/2024-09-28/list-ways-to-donate-and-help-flood-victims-in-western-north-carolina-after-hurricane-helene\">a list</a> of ways to help victims in western North Carolina.

FEMA also has <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20240928/how-help-after-hurricane-helene\">links to state volunteer groups</a> assisting with the recovery.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20240928/how-help-after-hurricane-helene\">state emergency responders</a> have websites set up to collect donations for hurricane relief. Civic groups and food banks in affected communities are also collecting goods and money to help people who were hurt by the storm.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Local emergency managers are also providing guidance for what resources they do and don’t need. Please take this to heart. The Tennessee Emergency Management Agency, for instance, specifically asks people not to self-deploy to disaster areas and to only donate things requested by local emergency coordinators. FEMA is also encouraging people in the region to <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20240928/how-help-after-hurricane-helene\">coordinate with text messages</a> instead of phone calls to leave phone lines open and to donate cash instead of goods.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Update, October 1, 9:10 am ET: </strong>This story was published on September 30 and has been updated multiple times, most recently with new information about the effects of Hurricane Helene.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

The plaintiffs in <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/garland-v-vanderstok-2/\"><em>Garland v. VanDerStok</em></a> ask the Court to effectively neutralize a federal law requiring gun buyers to submit to a background check, as well as a separate law requiring guns to have a serial number to allow law enforcement to track firearms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The case involves “ghost guns,” weapons that are sold dismantled and in ready-to-assemble kits. Three Trump appointees on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a href=\"https://casetext.com/case/vanderstok-v-garland-2\">previously concluded</a> that guns sold in these kits are exempt from the laws requiring background checks and serial numbers, thus making it easy for people with violent felony convictions to obtain guns simply by buying them in a disassembled state.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">By law, the background check and serial number <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/921\">requirements apply to</a> “any weapon &#8230; which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive.” They also apply to “the frame or receiver of any such weapon,” the skeletal part of a gun that houses other components, such as the barrel or firing mechanism. Thus, if someone purchases a series of firearm parts intending to build a gun at home, they still must face a background check when they purchase the gun’s frame or receiver.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ghost gun makers seek to evade these requirements by selling a kit with an incomplete frame or receiver — although, according to the Justice Department, it’s often <a href=\"http://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-852/315742/20240625172334020_23-852%20VanDerStok.pdf\">trivially easy</a> to convert the kit’s incomplete part into a fully functional frame or receiver. Some kits can be turned into a working firearm after the buyer drills a single hole in the kit’s frame. Others require the user to sand off a small plastic rail.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Fifth Circuit backed these attempts to evade the law. It claimed that frames missing a single hole are “<a href=\"https://casetext.com/case/vanderstok-v-garland-2\">not yet frames or receivers</a>.” The three Trump judges also argued that ghost gun kits may not “readily be converted” into a working gun because this phrase “cannot be read to include any objects that could, if manufacture is completed, become functional at some ill-defined point in the future” — even if only a negligible amount of work is required to make the gun function.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So the question now is whether a majority of this Supreme Court, which often <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2022/6/23/23180205/supreme-court-new-york-rifle-pistol-clarence-thomas-second-amendment-guns\">takes an expansive view of gun rights</a>, will sign onto this attempt to neutralize the background check and serial number laws.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The good news for supporters of gun regulations is that the Court has already signaled that it will not do so. The Court first heard this case, albeit in an expedited process, in August 2023, and it voted to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/8/8/23824635/supreme-court-ghost-guns-garland-vanderstok-amy-coney-barrett-shadow-docket\">temporarily leave</a> the background check and serial number requirements in full effect while the case made its way through the lower courts. The bad news is that the vote in that August 2023 decision was 5-4, with Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett joining the Court’s three Democrats. So if just one justice flips, the <em>VanDerStok </em>plaintiffs could prevail.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">At what point does a gun become a gun?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>VanDerStok</em> turns on the question of when a partially manufactured gun becomes sufficiently gun-like that it should be regulated as if it were a fully operational firearm. Congress, by applying the relevant laws to operational guns, frames, receivers, and items that “may readily be converted” into an operational gun, clearly intended that a gun need not be fully complete to be regulated.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the same time, it’s also clear that there is a point when an incomplete gun is not yet subject to the background check and serial number laws. For example, if someone buys a bucket full of raw steel and wood that a skilled gunsmith, after many hours of work using the proper tools, could turn into a firearm, that bucket does not need to come with a background check.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Up until very recently, this question of “at what point does a gun become sufficiently complete to trigger certain federal laws?” would have been resolved by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF). In <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/467/837/\"><em>Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council</em></a> (1984), the Supreme Court held that, when an agency is given the power to issue regulations interpreting a federal law (and ATF has that power over the gun laws at issue in <em>VanDerStok</em>), courts should typically defer to how the agency decides to resolve any ambiguities in that law.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thus, in a less imperious Supreme Court, <em>VanDerStok</em> would be an easy case. ATF <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-852/315742/20240625172334020_23-852%20VanDerStok.pdf\">issued a regulation in 2022</a> that clarifies that the background check and serial number laws do apply to ghost guns. Under <em>Chevron</em>, that should be enough to resolve this case.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Last June, however, the six Republican justices <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/357900/supreme-court-loper-bright-raimondo-chevron-power-grab\">voted to overrule <em>Chevron</em></a>. Their decision in <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-451_7m58.pdf\"><em>Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo</em></a> (2024) establishes that henceforth, whoever controls a majority of the Supreme Court will have the final word on thousands of policy questions that, under <em>Chevron</em>, used to be resolved by federal agencies. So <em>VanDerStok</em> will give us an early window into how these justices intend to use their new, self-given policymaking authority.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If these justices concern themselves with the text of federal gun law, however, it’s still difficult to see how they could affirm the Fifth Circuit’s decision to exempt ghost guns from the background check and serial number requirements.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The reason why is that federal gun law does not simply announce a vague standard — that incomplete guns that “may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive” are still subject to federal regulation. It also provides an example of a particular kind of not-yet-ready-to-fire gun that is subject to the background check and serial number laws. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The relevant federal law explicitly states that a “starter gun” — that is, a gun with a plugged barrel that is designed to fire blanks, and that is typically used to begin track or swim races — does count as a gun that is subject to federal regulation. So if someone buys a starter gun, they must submit to a background check, even though starter guns cannot be used to shoot anyone without significant alterations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In its brief, the Justice Department suggests that this reference to starter guns was inserted into the statute because of a “<a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-852/315742/20240625172334020_23-852%20VanDerStok.pdf\">do-it-yourself gunsmith</a>” who “distributed firearms to gang members by buying starter pistols in bulk.” He would then disassemble these starter guns and “using an electric hand drill mounted in a drill press stand, bore[d] out the plugged barrel and enlarge[d] the cylinder chambers to accommodate .22-caliber cartridges.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s significantly more work than is required to assemble many ghost guns. The fact that Congress intended to regulate devices that need to be disassembled and “bored out” using reasonably specialized equipment before they could be used as weapons suggests that Congress also intended for an already-disassembled gun that is missing a single hole in its frame or receiver to be subject to regulation. A ghost gun is much closer to being a fully operational firearm than a starter gun.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Still, while <em>VanDerStok</em> should not be a difficult case, the fact that four justices previously voted to exempt ghost guns from background checks and serial numbers suggests that this Court will make this case more difficult than it needs to be.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In overruling <em>Chevron</em>, the Court declared that it should have far more control over US policy than it has had in recent decades. Now we’re going to get a taste of how this GOP-dominated Court intends to use that power.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Morgan and Goldman Sachs both now have major footprints in the city, and several hedge funds have sprung up there as well. A slew of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/technology/join-us-in-miami-love-masters-of-the-universe.html\">Silicon Valley companies set up shop in Miami</a> after the pandemic, too, in search of lower taxes and fewer Covid restrictions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Maybe it&#8217;s not so surprising, then, that Miami, newly flush with major corporations, has seen a bigger office comeback post-Covid than almost any other American city, <a href=\"https://www.placer.ai/blog/placer-ai-office-index-august-2024-recap\">according to data from Placer.ai</a>, a startup that measures foot traffic to offices.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yesterday, <em>Today Explained</em> kicked off a miniseries on work after the pandemic by looking at how American workers were leaving the country <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-of-work/374273/portugal-remote-digital-nomad-work-life-balance\">in search of work-life balance</a> and finding it in Portugal, where the country’s unique digital nomad visa programs have led to a flourishing expat remote-worker community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For today’s installment, the <em>Today, Explained</em> podcast team returned stateside, venturing to Miami to find out more about why companies there are calling knowledge workers into the office once again, and what it can show us about the delicate dance that employers all over the nation face as they try to rebuild their corporate cultures.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-megaphone-fm wp-block-embed-megaphone-fm\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div><iframe title=\"The office vs. everyone else by Today, Explained\" src=\"https://player.megaphone.fm/VMP6724847136\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Going back to office for the “culture”&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Four years after the pandemic, only about 35 percent of Americans with jobs that can be worked remotely still work entirely from home, according to a <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/03/30/about-a-third-of-us-workers-who-can-work-from-home-do-so-all-the-time/\">2023 report from Pew</a>. They tend to be knowledge workers – people whose jobs demand that they’re sitting at a computer the bulk of the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So why are Miami’s knowledge workers going into offices instead of staying home?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The very same industries that are pouring into the South Florida city — financial services and tech — are the ones telling workers that it’s time to invest in “culture.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I think people are actually opting in to work in this culture,” Alex DiLeonardo, chief people officer for Citadel Securities, told us when we visited the financial firm’s sleek headquarters in the Brickell neighborhood of Miami in September.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">DiLeonardo used a lot of HR speak, but what he described to us was a vibes-y idea among employers that collaboration and values are forged from human interaction. The best way they think they can foster that creative “culture”? To make workers come into the office. At Citadel Securities, that means in-office, five days a week. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The idea of a workplace “culture” almost <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/15/23307268/apple-hybrid-working-model-return-to-office-september\">always</a> <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/jpmorgan-managing-directors-asked-work-office-five-days-week-memo-2023-04-12/\">shows</a> <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/09/disney-ceo-bob-iger-tells-employees-to-return-to-the-office-four-days-a-week.html\">up</a> when a CEO calls people back to the office. Last month, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy informed employees that they would be required to return to the office five days a week. <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/ceo-andy-jassy-latest-update-on-amazon-return-to-office-manager-team-ratio\">In a statement</a> titled “Strengthening our culture and teams,” Jassy made this case for in-office work: “[C]ollaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective; teaching and learning from one another are more seamless; and, teams tend to be better connected to one another.”</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/IMG_2128.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,30.366492146597,100,39.267015706806\" alt=\"A skyscraper with paned windows.\" title=\"A skyscraper with paned windows.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"The Miami offices of Citadel Securities. | Victoria Chamberlin/Vox\" data-portal-copyright=\"Victoria Chamberlin/Vox\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s what Hasan Altaf was looking for when he recently graduated from college. “I think in the office, it&#8217;s just creativity, collaboration, everything,” he told us. <br><br>Altaf, 22, is now a software engineer at Citadel Securities in Miami. During the pandemic, he spent eight months working an internship fully remote and said the whole thing felt kind of empty. “I felt disconnected with my team. [T]hey were just, like, faces on a screen. I never met them in person.” Now, he’s got an easy commute by metro, there are killer views of the ocean and city from the building, and he gets to absorb lessons from his colleagues in real time. “The juices are flowing here.” <br><br>To be clear, not everyone is fully opting into office life: One expert we talked with told us only about 20 percent of the 100,000 workers he’s surveyed want to be in an office five days a week. Another 30 percent wanted to work from home 100 percent of the time. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While people are back in the office at greater rates in Miami, in general, workers across the country want more flexibility.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Companies vs. the worker</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many workers have gotten a taste of a different kind of life over the past four years, and for the vast majority, working from home has afforded an unprecedented sense of work-life balance, <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/03/30/about-a-third-of-us-workers-who-can-work-from-home-do-so-all-the-time/\">according to Pew</a>.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many of them resent giving up the flexibility of hybrid or fully at-home work in favor of ideating in an <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2019/11/the-truth-about-open-offices\">open-concept office</a> in hard pants. A <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/majority-remote-workers-would-quit-if-forced-return-office-1952885#:~:text=In%20FlexJobs'%20recent%20report%2C%2057,to%20return%20to%20the%20office.\">recent survey of remote workers</a> found that nearly 60 percent said they would quit if asked to return to the office.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And there’s evidence that flexible models might be good not just for workers but for companies,&nbsp; too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">According to a recent <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/business/hr-payroll/remote-work-statistics/#sources\">USA Today Blueprint survey</a>, 58 percent of white-collar workers prefer a hybrid model (working from home at least three days a week).&nbsp;A <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/real-estate/our-insights/americans-are-embracing-flexible-work-and-they-want-more-of-it\">McKinsey survey</a> this summer found that&nbsp;87 percent of workers would say yes to flexible work if it’s offered.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This means a company that adopts a fully in-office policy team could see the plan backfire, according to <a href=\"https://nbloom.people.stanford.edu/bio\">Nick Bloom</a>, a professor of economics at Stanford University who studies workplace trends.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“[O]ne way this plays out is they have a ton of quits. They find it harder to hire,” Bloom said. “I know from talking to my own undergrads and MBAs, they don&#8217;t want to go in five days a week. So it&#8217;s going to be harder to hire them,” he said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A lot of firms get hung up on the idea of productivity, Bloom said. Companies, he argues, should measure their office policies against profitability.<em> </em>Not paying for an office is a huge cost saver. “It also turns out, if you&#8217;re hiring folks remotely, you can hire a lot better employee for your money because you&#8217;re not looking locally, you&#8217;re looking nationally or even globally.” The talent pool is the entire world.<br><br>Bloom recently <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07500-2\">published a study</a> looking closely at this question of productivity. Working with a giant Chinese travel company, Bloom and his team compared two cohorts: The first worked in the office five days a week and the second was offered a hybrid schedule. They found that the hybrid workers were happier with their jobs and that fewer quit. They also found that performance reviews were not affected. People got their work done and they were happier.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">“Give me a good reason to come in every day” </h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Chatting up workers in Miami, we heard some complaints: “Give me a good reason to come in every day.” “I don’t need my boss babysitting my work.” “Commuting sucks.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A lot of people, though, were willing to meet the CEO culture warriors halfway and acknowledged that some time in the office was great for getting to know the people they worked with. They were also able to build trust with colleagues and learn by watching others do their jobs. For companies in the tech and financial spaces that are so vital to Miami’s rebirth, having workers meet them in the middle helps them navigate a number of issues beyond “culture,” too, including data privacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/i-rH3XvS8-X2.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.717639621171,100,78.564720757659\" alt=\"An aerial photo of the seashore in Miami, featuring a four-lane road parallel to the beach and a high-rise hotel and pool opposite.\" title=\"An aerial photo of the seashore in Miami, featuring a four-lane road parallel to the beach and a high-rise hotel and pool opposite.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"Why would you want to go to the office if you lived here? | Victoria Chamberlin/Vox\" data-portal-copyright=\"Victoria Chamberlin/Vox\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Workers will be the ultimate judge of whether Citadel Securities and other companies with the strictest office policies are right for them. If they disagree, they might just choose to develop their careers elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For DiLeonardo, these complicated choices are just part of the new world order of work — and maybe even a sign of how far work culture has come.<br><br>“As somebody who spent my entire career in the people space, I think it&#8217;s great that all of these different forms of working are causing organizations and societies to ask questions about how best to enable individuals to succeed in their different roles and their different careers,” he said.&nbsp; “But I also think that leaves a ton of room for organizations to choose the kind of environment that they provide and be very clear in the social contract about what it means to work at this&nbsp; company.”&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

And it’s spreading.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Early Sunday morning, a fire erupted at <a href=\"https://www.biolabinc.com/\">BioLab</a>, a chemical plant specializing in pool and spa water care, in Conyers, just 30 miles east of Atlanta in Rockdale County. It’s unknown what caused the fire as of publication, but <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=506209848917302\">local fire department officials</a> say water from the triggered sprinkler system had reacted with the various chemicals in the building.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Around <a href=\"https://www.rockdalecountyga.gov/updates-on-bio-fire-9-29-24/\">11</a> am ET on Sunday, officials requested that all church services be closed. By 11, several local roads were closed, and by around 1 pm officials ordered <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/29/us/chemical-bio-lab-fire-georgia.html\">about 17,000 people in Conyers to evacuate</a>, as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Georgia’s environmental protection division ran air quality tests, where they <a href=\"https://www.rockdalecountyga.gov/rockdale-county-remains-closed-with-shelter-in-place-continuing/\">detected</a> chlorine around the facility. Chlorine is a <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ershdb/emergencyresponsecard_29750024.html#:~:text=Chlorine%20is%20a%20toxic%20gas,a%20chemical%20warfare%20choking%20agent.\">toxic gas</a> that can have negative short- and long-term health effects. Around noon, as first responders were putting the initial fire out and removing products from the facility, the fire reignited. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We are all focused on remediating the situation as rapidly as possible,” the company said in its most recent <a href=\"https://www.biolabinc.com/news-events/\">statement</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Officials then instituted a shelter-in-place order <a href=\"https://www.rockdalecountyga.gov/updates-on-bio-fire-9-29-24/\">late Sunday evening</a> for Rockdale County, which comprises around 90,000 people. Fulton County, which includes parts of Atlanta, has <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta-news/metro-atlanta-chemical-plant-fire-leads-to-evacuation-of-17000/NLTZ6RLMIZCERF76B7FHUQFRYE/\">reported</a> “a haze and strong chemical smell” this morning, which local officials <a href=\"https://x.com/AFCEMA/status/1840759612619776475\">stated</a> is likely due to the BioLab fire.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Although acute exposure to chlorine gas causes various <a href=\"https://wwwn.cdc.gov/TSP/MMG/MMGDetails.aspx?mmgid=198&amp;toxid=36#:~:text=harmful%20chlorine%20gas.-,Acute%20exposure%20to%20chlorine%20gas%20initially%20causes%20coughing%2C%20eye%20and,pain%2C%20inflammation%2C%20and%20blisters.\">symptoms</a>, including coughing, irritation in the eyes and nose, skin irritation, and a burning sensation in the chest, multiple agencies said that the chlorine in the air does not pose a threat to most people. At time of publication, health agencies have not identified any specific high-risk populations such as those with preexisting respiratory conditions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All of this comes after <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/climate/374867/hurricane-helene\">Hurricane Helene’</a>s wreckage, leaving resources and communication from local officials stretched thin. It’s an alarming glimpse at what can happen when multiple disasters occur at once, and it highlights the need for better preparation for such cases.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Delays in official communication</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A shelter-in-place order is still in effect in Rockdale County. Officials recommend local residents keep their windows and doors closed and the AC off, presumably to prevent toxic gasses from getting in. All Rockdale County government facilities are closed, as are several roads in the area. County officials advised businesses to keep their operations <a href=\"https://www.rockdalecountyga.gov/rockdale-county-remains-closed-with-shelter-in-place-continuing/\">closed</a> until the shelter-in-place order is lifted.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On its Facebook page, the county posted a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/RockdaleGov/\">video</a> showing the aftermath of the fire. The front, left, and right sides of the plant “totally collapsed,” according to Marian McDaniel, the county’s chief of fire rescue. She said that once they’ve removed debris from the fire, they will bring down the remaining side and retrieve the remaining “product” from the ruins of the facility.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Nothing that we can do or will be done to make this product any worse than it already is,” McDaniel told the press. The clouds and smoke should go away once the remaining chemicals are removed from the building.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But as the gas dissipates, which may take days, it’s also moving toward other parts of Georgia — cities and towns that may not have had clear directions on what to do.&nbsp;That’s on top of dealing with the fallout from Helene.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Georgia Emergency Services and Homeland Security Agency <a href=\"https://x.com/AFCEMA/status/1840819308697387256\">issued</a> a local area emergency Monday afternoon to residents living within a 50-mile radius of the BioLab fire, a full day later. At that point, thousands of residents in nearby Fulton and Gwinnett Counties had already left their homes to go to school, work, doctor’s appointments, and more, unsure why the air smelled adjacent to a swimming pool.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Atlanta Fire Rescue Department conducted air quality tests Monday afternoon to detect chlorine and other chemicals in the air across the city. They <a href=\"https://x.com/ATLFireRescue/status/1840801429067301325\">said</a> they’ve found “no immediate life safety issues,” but didn’t provide further information about chlorine levels. They also have requested additional testing from state and federal agencies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Georgia’s Department of Public Health has <a href=\"https://dph.georgia.gov/smoke-biolab-chemical-fire\">added</a> that there is “no significant toxicity identified in the smoke” so far, but that people with heart or lung disease may be particularly affected and experience symptoms, such as shortness of breath. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">What’s next?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While the immediate focus is on cleaning up the damaged facility, there are still a lot of unanswered questions about how the BioLab fire will affect neighboring communities in the future.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Currently, there is no publicly available information about how much chlorine has escaped into the air or what levels local residents are being exposed to. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Long-term <a href=\"https://cairntechnology.com/long-term-effects-chlorine-exposure/#:~:text=The%20long%2Dterm%20effects%20of%20chlorine%20exposure%20can%20include%20the,damage%2C%20which%20could%20be%20irreparable.\">exposure</a> to chlorine can cause prolonged health issues such as potentially irreparable lung damage. Even a one-time exposure to high levels of chlorine can have negative health effects, which makes the question of how much is currently in the air over Georgia only more pressing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This isn’t the first fire to break out at this BioLab plant in Conyers — there have been at least <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/business/chlorine-product-maker-biolab-has-history-of-fires-and-chemical-leaks/ET4CU6BAVVD55C2BMLTT7PQ2TY/\">three in the past two decades</a>. The last fire happened just four years ago.<strong> </strong>It raises the question of accountability, whether the plant has done anything to meaningfully prevent these disasters, and the impact of repeated exposure to chemical fires and leaks on communities. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s also too early to tell what, if any, accountability BioLab will face after this fire. According to the <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta-news/metro-atlanta-chemical-plant-fire-leads-to-evacuation-of-17000/NLTZ6RLMIZCERF76B7FHUQFRYE/\">Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a>, the chairman of Rockdale County’s governing body, Oz Nesbitt, said that the Board of Commissioners will be speaking with BioLab’s leadership about “their safety and their mitigation plan and their security plan inside their operations.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While multiple agencies responding to the incident have assured residents that the fire poses little to no harm to human health, many residents are unsatisfied and have left comments on Rockdale County’s Facebook page expressing their <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/RockdaleGov/posts/pfbid04rsy9TbWaHTKuVLaLgq8zBj3HQdsyZQRMG88xjxd8t3PHzxeTvY9ep5cnc2DjNvPl\">concern and frustration</a> about the uncertainties. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Who is going to jail over this?” wrote one commenter. “Just asking, considering how many people are going to be injured by this, and how much damage will be done to the local environments? This facility is a known problem, and has been for years.”&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

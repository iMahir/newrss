    <title>Scientists advise EU to halt solar geoengineering</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="puc3RF"&gt;Scientific advisers to the European Commission are calling for a moratorium across the EU on efforts to artificially cool Earth through solar geoengineering. That includes controversial technologies used to reflect sunlight back into space, primarily by sending reflective particles into the atmosphere or by brightening clouds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dA5m8X"&gt;Proponents argue that this can help in the fight against climate change, especially as planet-heating greenhouse gas emissions continue to climb. But small-scale experiments have triggered backlash over concerns that these technologies could do more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T8XZVO"&gt;The European Commission asked its &lt;a href="https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2777/391614"&gt;Group of Chief Scientific Advisors&lt;/a&gt; (GCSA) and &lt;a href="https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2777/951016"&gt;European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies&lt;/a&gt; (EGE) to write up their opinions on solar geoengineering, which were published today alongside a &lt;a href="https://scientificadvice.eu/advice/solar-radiation-modification/"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; synthesizing what little we know about how these technologies might work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Xh9F7g"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Experiments have triggered backlash over concerns that these technologies could do more harm than good&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5c8AZg"&gt;There’s “insufficient scientific evidence” to show that solar geoengineering can actually prevent climate change, says the opinion written by the GCSA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LVBXyc"&gt;“Given the currently very high...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Manchester City is letting fans design its new kit with AI</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A screenshot of an AI-generated soccer uniform design" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4es_ATglVmgGU7a4RbnMGOdmv6A=/0x0:984x656/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73776830/ai_manchester_city_cats.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Will Manchester City’s next uniform feature AI-generated cats?&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: Puma AI Creator&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aONj43"&gt;Manchester City is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mancity.com%2Fnews%2Fclub%2Fpuma-ai-kit-creator-launch-63869006&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F12%2F9%2F24317157%2Fmanchester-city-puma-ai-uniform-design" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;holding a competition&lt;/a&gt; that asks fans to generate its future kit design with AI. Players will wear the winning design during the 2026-2027 season as City’s official third kit, and it will even be sold to fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HEJDTY"&gt;The club partnered with Puma to launch &lt;a href="https://aicreator.puma.com/create"&gt;a text-to-image&lt;/a&gt; uniform generator powered by the AI company DeepObjects. To use the tool, you’ll have to create an account and enter a prompt that describes the look you’re going for. You then have to choose a style the AI will use when generating your design, such as “abstract,” “emotive brushstrokes,” or “dream visions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fQMNoik9zzJi-QdKxVcfzObLwhI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25782035/ai_uniform_design.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Puma AI Creator&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This wasn’t quite what I was envisioning when I entered a prompt for “soccerballs shooting through space like stars on a galaxy background.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ofeucp"&gt;The Puma AI Creator will then generate four different design options that appear on a virtual uniform, allowing you to customize the collars, trim colors, and badges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NES3Z0"&gt;You get 15 credits to create designs (generating one design costs one credit), but you can only enter two of your creations in the contest, which ends December 20th. Fan ratings, along with experts from Manchester City and Puma will help determine the winner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TL41uVUhpAMHxToPQbPNZF4DbAs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25782278/manchester_city_goalkeeper.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Manchester City&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;City players designed this goalkeeper kit with AI.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cQ9sPB"&gt;Manchester City says its players, Ederson, Stefan Ortega, and Rico Lewis first used the Puma AI Creator to design a goalkeeper kit “creatively inspired by the net of a football goal.” It will be the first AI-generated soccer uniform to be worn on the pitch, according to the club.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eSA9YP"&gt;The announcement comes at an awkward time for City, which is mired in a poor run of form and &lt;a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/man-city-115-charges-timeline-30549136"&gt;awaiting the verdict of an investigation into breaching Premier League financial rules&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Pay’s first competitor on the iPhone has arrived in Norway</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Image showing tap to pay with Vipps app." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UnflyrfcyY7rb_8Zj8fLkUOaLiU=/0x128:1117x873/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73776771/VippsNO_1600x1600_hero_02_copy__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iPhone owners in Norway can now select Vipps as their default mobile payment app.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Vipps&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zcI5F1"&gt;A Norwegian payment app called Vipps is &lt;a href="https://vipps.no/nyheter/2024/12/03/naa-kan-du-taeppe-med-vipps-i-butikken"&gt;the first service to take advantage&lt;/a&gt; of a new, more open iOS ecosystem thanks to EU regulations. Starting today, Norwegians can use Vipps for tap-to-pay transactions and online payments, and they can even set the app as the default payment option on their iPhones, as reported by &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/09/vipps-mobilepay-first-iphone-apple-pay-alternative/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rzCfHu"&gt;It’s all thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/19/24043965/apple-iphone-nfc-payments-open-up-third-party-developers-european-union-antitrust"&gt;commitments Apple made&lt;/a&gt; in response to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21292651/apple-eu-antitrust-investigation-app-store-apple-pay"&gt;scrutiny from EU regulators&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="o9kGwF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"10 years later, Apple Pay is amazing — and about to change ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/5/24235874/apple-pay-10-years-open-nfc-ios"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DaSK2P"&gt;Since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/9/6128371/apple-pay-hands-on"&gt;its launch a decade ago&lt;/a&gt;, Apple Pay has been the only way to use tap to pay on an iPhone. That’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/14/24220323/apple-iphone-tap-to-pay-nfc-api"&gt;changing with iOS 18.1&lt;/a&gt;, which makes tap-to-pay via NFC available to third-party developers for the first time. Apple committed earlier this year to open up the API &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/2/23048116/apple-pay-eu-antitrust-nfc-payment-wallet"&gt;after EU regulators ruled Apple Pay anti-competitive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mXa4kJ"&gt;This pressure from the EU has recently forced Apple to open up the famously locked-down iPhone in unprecedented ways, from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/10/24171315/apple-messages-rcs-ios-18-imessage-green-bubble"&gt;adding RCS support&lt;/a&gt; to letting you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/22/24226110/apple-iphone-ipad-default-apps-eu-competition"&gt;delete pretty much any app you want&lt;/a&gt; from your phone. But unlocking the NFC chip is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/5/24235874/apple-pay-10-years-open-nfc-ios"&gt;a particularly interesting test case&lt;/a&gt; since it could usher in a whole bunch of new and helpful ways to use your phone — or create a mess of competing payment and ID storage platforms that don’t cooperate with each other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K1pwbz"&gt;Either way, it’s going to be a big deal, and the first step forward into that new era comes from a small financial organization in Scandinavia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WqktiA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It sure sounds like Trump would be okay with a TikTok sale</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A picture of Donald Trump talking with Kristen Welker." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k0bzTrlupMK44X9lzAOVGmV4C6k=/69x0:2931x1908/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73776743/2188309592.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Donald Trump speaks with Kristen Welker on&lt;/em&gt; Meet the Press. | Photo: Peter Kramer / NBC via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xJofCB"&gt;President-elect Donald Trump gave a murky answer when NBC’s Kristen Welker asked whether he would protect TikTok from its impending ban during a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-interview-meet-press-kristen-welker-election-president-rcna182857"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meet the Press&lt;/em&gt; interview&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday. He didn’t say he would save the app from its ban but did seem to imply that ByteDance should sell it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="stHcli"&gt;After its argument that the ban is unconstitutional came up short in the DC Circuit Court of Appeals last week, ByteDance is requesting an injunction to stop the ban from taking effect until the Supreme Court can hear its appeal, and it now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24316941/tiktok-divest-ban-court-ruling-breakdown-first-amendment"&gt;faces an uphill legal battle&lt;/a&gt;. If ByteDance’s motion isn’t granted, it has to sell TikTok by January 19th or face its expulsion from the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lCPjhE"&gt;Welker asked Trump what he would do after ByteDance’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24316941/tiktok-divest-ban-court-ruling-breakdown-first-amendment"&gt;failed appeal of the ban&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="af5pQN"&gt;This week a federal court upheld a law that could result in TikTok being banned. You said you’re going to rescue TikTok when you get into office. Are you going to take steps to protect it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="vdW1nw"&gt;Trump’s response praised his campaign’s use of the platform before deflecting the question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="vs8OE3"&gt;I used TikTok very successfully in my campaign. I have a man named TikTok Jack, he was very effective, obviously, because I won youth by 30 percent. All Republicans lose youth. I don’t know why. Maybe it’s changing. And last time we were down 30 percent with youth. This time we were up 35 percent with youth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UjV50e"&gt;And I used TikTok, so I can’t really, you know, I can’t totally hate it. It was very effective. But I will say this, if you do do that, something else is going to come along and take its place. And maybe that’s not fair. And really, what the judge actually said was that you can’t have Chinese companies. In other words, they have the right to ban it if you can prove that Chinese companies own it. That’s what the judge actually said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="q6X6lr"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@nbcnews/video/7446130950444010795" data-video-id="7446130950444010795" data-embed-from="oembed" style="max-width:605px; min-width:325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@nbcnews" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@nbcnews?refer=embed"&gt;@nbcnews&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;President-elect Donald &lt;a title="trump" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/trump?refer=embed"&gt;#Trump&lt;/a&gt; weighs in on a potential ban on TikTok that could take effect one day before he assumes the White House if the app’s Chinese parent company does not divest. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - nbcnews" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7446130921360968491?refer=embed"&gt;♬ original sound - nbcnews&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7yJLTS"&gt;Pressed again on if he would “protect TikTok” once he’s in office, Trump responded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ThEKkN"&gt;I’m going to try and make it so that other companies don’t become an even bigger monopoly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="69UYYt"&gt;A TikTok sale to an American company would be one way to achieve that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XB8nGC"&gt;Trump’s position has been murky since he started positioning himself opposite of the Biden administration’s support of a ban — something Trump pushed for during his last term. Over the last several months, that’s included his &lt;a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113081258242253706"&gt;Truth Social video&lt;/a&gt; urging people who “want to save TikTok” to vote for him and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2Fvideo%2F2024%2F03%2F11%2Fformer-president-donald-trump-i-consider-facebook-to-be-an-enemy-of-the-people.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F12%2F9%2F24317094%2Fdonald-trump-tiktok-ban-sale-meet-the-press-interview" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;CNBC &lt;/em&gt;in March&lt;/a&gt; that getting rid of the platform would only benefit Facebook, which he called an “enemy of the people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6VWQN2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vvF1Tj"&gt;Police have arrested Luigi Mangione, a 26-year-old software developer, in connection with the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Mangione, of Maryland, was detained at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania on Monday morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yrG38t"&gt;Mangione was taken into custody on local firearm charges, New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch told reporters. He has not been charged in connection with the shooting but is “believed to be our person of interest,” Tisch said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bcw4Gk"&gt;Police have been searching for Thompson’s killer for nearly a week, despite the shooting taking place in public outside a Manhattan hotel. The manhunt has thus far relied on just &lt;a href="https://x.com/NYPDnews/status/1865633072185495574"&gt;a few grainy images of a man&lt;/a&gt; whose face is largely obscured by a mask and hoodie. Investigators have reportedly been &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/brian-thompson-unitedhealthcare-news-12-6-24/index.html"&gt;looking for more surveillance images of the suspect&lt;/a&gt; to load into facial recognition software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0VjKUF"&gt;Police were led to Mangione via a “combination of old-school detective work and new age technology,” Tisch said. “We deployed drones, K9 units, and scuba divers. We leveraged the domain awareness system, argos cameras, and conducted aviation canvases.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D0xKTv"&gt;Despite scant visual evidence, a McDonald’s employee recognized Mangione on Monday morning and called police, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/09/nyregion/uhc-ceo-murder-suspect"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. “He was just sitting there eating,” Joseph Kenny, the New York Police Department’s chief of detectives, said at a press briefing Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZcC4td"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UdaqEezK2Ks?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jQs8nV"&gt;Mangione reportedly had a gun, a silencer, and four fake IDs in his possession. The gun appeared to be a 3D-printed “ghost gun,” Kenny told reporters. After being apprehended, Mangione showed police a fake New Jersey ID, Kenny said. The ID was the same one used to check into a hostel in Manhattan on November 24th, eight days before the shooting. Sources also &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/09/us-news/person-of-interest-in-fatal-shooting-of-unitedhealthcare-boss-brian-thompson-idd-as-luigi-mangione-an-ex-ivy-league-student/"&gt;tell the &lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that he was carrying a “manifesto” criticizing the US healthcare industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YhklfC"&gt;Three bullets recovered from the scene of the shooting had “deny,” “defend,” and “depose” written on them in permanent marker, two police officials &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/unitedhealthcare-ceo-manhattan-shooting-death-7f6581ba6b0b520938d82c361e77a83c"&gt;told the &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last week. Police &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/internet-sleuths-say-wont-help-find-unitedhealthcare-ceo-suspect-rcna183228"&gt;later clarified&lt;/a&gt; that one of the bullets had “delay” written on it, not “defend.” The words &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/unitedhealthcare-ceo-shooting-delay-deny-defend-depose-ee73ceb19f361835c654f04a3b88c50c"&gt;are reminiscent of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Delay, Deny, Defend: What Insurance Companies Don’t Pay Claims and What You Can Do About It&lt;/em&gt;, the title of a 2010 book by Rutgers Law professor Jay M. Feinman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MU2ayI"&gt;The shooting’s apparent anti-insurance motivation has led to &lt;a href="https://networkcontagion.us/reports/praise-for-united-healthcare-ceo-assassination-goes-viral/"&gt;expressions of support&lt;/a&gt; across the political spectrum for the assailant. Online sleuths have identified several online profiles that appear to be linked to Mangione, including a Goodreads account on which he left a favorable review of &lt;em&gt;Industrial Society and Its Future&lt;/em&gt;, the manifesto written by Ted Kaczynski.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rivian’s new Joshua Tree outpost is what EV charging should be  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Rivian EV charging station Joshua Tree" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_cRPVIVSWC5xDE6MHPpNaxJdx7E=/0x6:6791x4533/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73776588/Rivian_J_Tree_4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Rivian&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IK3RJm"&gt;When I first started testing electric vehicles, finding a charging station was the means to an end. I didn’t care what it looked like or what neighborhood it was in — it was a minor miracle that I found a charger, any charger, to juice up. But now consumers want more. Heck, I want more, and I don’t even own an EV. After all, this is a place where you’ll spend at least 20 minutes to shove some electrons into your vehicle. Is a bathroom too much to ask for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QeUmpu"&gt;Rivian has heard the call and has answered with its own chain of outpost charging stations. The first one &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/19/24201215/rivian-brings-ev-charging-to-yosemite"&gt;opened up in Yosemite&lt;/a&gt;, California, this past summer, and now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24313327/rivian-ev-charging-open-up-joshua-tree"&gt;one is right in my own backyard in Joshua Tree&lt;/a&gt;, just six miles away from the town’s national park entrance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IjDSUD"&gt;Charge up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="d5xWJj"&gt;First, let’s talk about charging. There are 12 900-volt 300kW CCS chargers, and the outpost is open to any EV, although Teslas will need an adapter. There is one pullthrough spot for folks with a trailer, but if others are charging across the lot from that space, it might be a tight turn for longer rigs. Rivian owners can pay through the app or tap their credit cards at the charger at 46 cents per kWh, while non-Rivian cars can tap...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OpenAI has finally released Sora</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A screenshot of Sora" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VB-1jw6l8PkztEkYpaIolUHM2uU=/170x0:2147x1318/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73776425/openai_sora_explore.10.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Free users can still browse a feed of AI-generated videos created by the community.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: OpenAI&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QcIUWq"&gt;OpenAI launched Sora, &lt;a href="https://openai.com/index/sora-is-here/"&gt;its text-to-video AI model&lt;/a&gt;, on Monday as part of its 12-day &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24314146/openai-12-days-ship-mas-chatgpt-sora-o1-update"&gt;“ship-mas” product release series&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24312352/openai-sora-o1-reasoning-12-days-shipmas"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; it would. It’s available today on &lt;a href="http://Sora.com"&gt;Sora.com&lt;/a&gt; for ChatGPT subscribers in the US and “most other countries,” and a new model, Sora Turbo. This updated model adds features like generating video from text, animating images, and remixing videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PGQ6Ts"&gt;With a ChatGPT Plus subscription, &lt;a href="https://openai.com/sora/"&gt;OpenAI says&lt;/a&gt; you can generate up to 50 priority videos (1,000 credits) at resolutions up to 720p with 5-second durations. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24314147/openai-reasoning-model-o1-strawberry-chatgpt-pro-new-tier"&gt;$200 per month ChatGPT Pro subscription that launched last week&lt;/a&gt; comes with “unlimited generations” and up to 500 priority videos while bumping the resolution to 1080p and the duration to 20 seconds. The more expensive plan also allows subscribers to download videos without a watermark and perform up to five generations simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7og9SF"&gt;OpenAI &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/15/24074151/openai-sora-text-to-video-ai"&gt;first teased&lt;/a&gt; its text-to-video AI model, Sora, in February, and earlier today, Marques Brownlee, aka MKBHD, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24317090/openai-sora-text-to-video-ai-generator-confirmed-release"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; the launch with&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY2x0TyKzIQ"&gt; a preview&lt;/a&gt; based on his experiences testing Sora so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zD5WJa"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2jKVx2vyZOY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="AqgADM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OpenAI’s 12 days of ‘ship-mas’: all the new announcements","url":"https://www.theverge.com/24314146/openai-12-days-ship-mas-chatgpt-sora-o1-update"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r7EjAS"&gt;During the livestream, OpenAI showed off Sora’s new explore page with a feed of AI-generated videos created by other community members. The company &lt;a href="https://openai.com/sora/"&gt;highlighted a feature&lt;/a&gt; called “storyboards” that let you generate videos based on a sequence of prompts, as well as the ability to turn photos into videos. OpenAI also demonstrated a “remix” tool that lets you tweak Sora’s output with a text prompt, along with a way to “blend” two scenes together with AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bD1lHy"&gt;OpenAI says videos generated with Sora will have visible watermarks and C2PA metadata to indicate they’re made with AI. Before uploading an image or video to Sora, OpenAI prompts you to check off an agreement that says what you’re uploading doesn’t contain people under 18, explicit or violent content, and copyrighted material. It says the “misuse of media uploads” could result in an account ban or suspension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GiX9TX"&gt;“We obviously have a big target on our back as OpenAI,” OpenAI vice president of research Aditya Ramesh said during the livestream. “We want to prevent illegal activity of Sora, but we also want to balance that with creative expression. We know that... will be an ongoing challenge, we might not get it perfect on day one. We’re starting a little conservative, and so if our moderation doesn’t quite get it right, just give us that feedback.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Edysfk"&gt;If you don’t have a ChatGPT subscription, you’ll still be able to browse through the feed of AI-generated videos created by other people using Sora. While the model will become available in the US and many other countries today, &lt;a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1866187529650917618"&gt;OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said&lt;/a&gt; that it may “be a while” for a launch in “most of Europe and the UK.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TBc5jW"&gt;The release of Sora comes just a week after a group of artists, who claimed to be part of the company’s alpha testing program, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/26/24306879/openai-sora-video-ai-model-leak-artist-protest"&gt;leaked&lt;/a&gt; the product in protest of being used by OpenAI for what they claim was “unpaid R&amp;amp;D and PR.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Pixel Tablet has returned to its Black Friday all-time low price </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel Tablet resting on a dock." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mMxvW1izhDTUVXWDDqg--mtqb34=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73776256/236705_Google_Pixel_Tablet_DSeifert_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s Pixel Tablet uniquely turns into a smart display of sorts when you buy the charging speaker dock.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7UiJnr"&gt;Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/21/24302508/google-pixel-tablet-2-canceled-rumor"&gt;might soon stop selling tablets&lt;/a&gt; altogether, which is a shame, because we were fans of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23765921/google-pixel-tablet-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Pixel Tablet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when it was released last year. Yet while we may never see a&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Pixel Tablet 2, luckily the original slate is still around and receiving a steep discount. Normally $399, right now the base Google Pixel Tablet with 128GB of storage has returned to its Black Friday price of $279 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Tablet-Extra-Long-Porcelain/dp/B0CZMFZ84J?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://howl.link/hb6vyghwauykp"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://store.google.com/config/pixel_tablet" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;directly from Google&lt;/a&gt;. You can buy it with a charging speaker dock starting at $459 ($140 off) from the &lt;a href="https://howl.link/fovblvdr0flpn"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://store.google.com/config/pixel_tablet" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="hYNdFG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google’s abandoned Pixel Tablet might’ve launched with this pen","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24317008/googles-abandoned-pixel-tablet-mightve-launched-with-this-pen"},{"title":"Google’s abandoned Pixel Tablet 2 had a better display and 5G upgrades","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/2/24311118/google-canceled-pixel-tablet-2-better-display-5g-tensor-g4"},{"title":"The Verge’s 2024 holiday gift guide","url":"https://www.theverge.com/24224043/holiday-gift-guide-2024-best-ideas-unique-tech-gadgets"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SZKsyL"&gt;If you’re looking for an Android tablet that’s great for watching movies, web browsing, video chatting, and other basic tasks, the Pixel Tablet remains an excellent option. Powered by Google’s Tensor G2 chip, it’s a snappy entertainment device. Its sharp 11-inch LCD display offers wide viewing angles ideal for streaming, while its four speakers provide clear audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cqd2La"&gt;It’s the optional magnetic charging speaker dock that really makes the Pixel Tablet stand out, though. The dock effectively turns the Pixel Tablet into smart display similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20855944/google-nest-hub-max-review-assistant-smart-display-price-specs-features"&gt;Nest Hub Max&lt;/a&gt;, allowing it to deliver a full, room-filling sound quality that outperforms the tablet’s built-in speakers. That means you can also enjoy some Nest Hub Max capabilities, using the tablet to control smart home devices with just your voice via Google Assistant, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="a736At"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:12085747"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="v4mpaU"&gt;A few more deals worth a look&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="id__w8xdnn87i3m"&gt;The&lt;strong&gt; UE Wonderboom 4&lt;/strong&gt; is on sale at an all-time low price of $59.99 ($40 off) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BRXJ9WTD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1835426-REG%2Flogitech_984_001878_ultimate_ears_wonderboom_4.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F12%2F9%2F24317037%2Fgoogle-pixel-tablet-ue-wonderboom-4-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike its predecessor, the Bluetooth speaker now supports USB-C for faster charging and sports a new megaphone feature that amplifies your voice. It also still sports an IP67 rating, meaning it’s waterproof and dustproof so you can take it outdoors without worrying.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WkXKDH"&gt;The new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24271197/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-e-reader-12th-gen-2024"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kindle Paperwhite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;is back on sale for $134.99 ($25 off) at &lt;a href="https://howl.link/y2klei94x7ltd"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-kindle-paperwhite-2024-black%2F-%2FA-91563138&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, which is $5 shy of the all-time low price we saw first set during Black Friday. The latest Paperwhite is faster than its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22745670/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2021-review-usb-c-signature-edition-display-e-reader-books"&gt;predecessor&lt;/a&gt;, with a larger seven-inch display and long battery life. It also retains all the features we loved in the last-gen model, including IPX8 waterproofing and a USB-C port. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GRqK2k"&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;1080p Ring Pan-Tilt Indoor Cam&lt;/strong&gt; is down to $49.99 ($30 off) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CG2VS5FD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://howl.link/95mpfgkpnbvkm"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fring-pan-tilt-indoor-cam-with-360-horizontal-pan-coverage-live-view-two-way-talk-hd-video%2F-%2FA-93001874%3Fpreselect%3D91368473%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, matching its all-time low. Its mechanically rotating head offers 360-degree panning and is capable of tilting up and down, so you can see every corner of the room it’s in. The camera also supports two-way talk and can even sound a siren, while you can get motion alerts with person detection if you subscribe to the Ring Protect Plan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>OpenAI’s video generator Sora is launching today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vector illustration of the Chat GPT logo." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JTeGcPZIan729gl8v_ZS8Vck4W4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73776240/STK155_OPEN_AI_CVirginia_A.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LdZbuR"&gt;OpenAI’s highly-anticipated AI text-to-video generator, Sora, will become available to everyone today. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY2x0TyKzIQ"&gt;In a video posted on Monday&lt;/a&gt;, Marques Brownlee confirmed its imminent release and detailed his experience using Sora over the past few weeks, calling the results “horrifying and inspiring at the same time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNwt54"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/15/24074151/openai-sora-text-to-video-ai"&gt;OpenAI first revealed&lt;/a&gt; Sora in February but only made the tool available to a select number of visual artists, designers, and filmmakers to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NGmh9m"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OY2x0TyKzIQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="02ltVJ"&gt;Brownlee shows how Sora can convert your text prompt into a video, which you can then customize with additional text prompts as part of its “remix” tool. You can also use Sora to transform a photo into a video, as well as use its storyboard feature to “string together” several text prompts that Sora will attempt to blend into cohesive scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QLLWyc"&gt;During his video, Brownlee points out that Sora currently struggles with generating realistic physics and often shows objects that disappear or pass through each other. He also found that Sora often rejects prompts that include public figures and copyrighted characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RykedQ"&gt;Sora will launch today, and will most likely be announced during the 12 days of “ship-mas” video OpenAI plans on releasing at 1PM ET. Last Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24314147/openai-reasoning-model-o1-strawberry-chatgpt-pro-new-tier"&gt;OpenAI announced a $200 / month ChatGPT Pro subscription&lt;/a&gt; and the full release of its o1 reasoning model.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>China opens an antitrust investigation into Nvidia</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vector collage of the Ndivia logo." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hbv7vgApbWFtXTlHVchpaJAgpzs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73776229/STK083_B_NVIDIA_D.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Cath Virginia / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ma8R6o"&gt;China is investigating Nvidia over antitrust violations, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/technology/china-nvidia-investigation-antitrust-ai.html"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; over claims the chipmaker failed to follow conditions set during China’s approval for its $6.9 billion acquisition of Israeli network hardware company Mellanox in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bYXqbz"&gt;While&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21258419/nvidia-ampere-gpu-ai-data-centers-specs-a100-dgx-supercomputer"&gt; announcing the DGX A100 GPU&lt;/a&gt; after acquiring Mellanox, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said this while explaining its importance to his company:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="qHMOH9"&gt;“If you take a look at the way modern data centers are architected, the workloads they have to do are more diverse than ever,” explains Huang. “Our approach going forward is not to just focus on the server itself but to think about the entire data center as a computing unit. Going forward I believe the world is going to think about data centers as a computing unit and we’re going to be thinking about data center-scale computing. No longer just personal computers or servers, but we’re going to be operating on the data center scale.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="pAr9RJ"&gt;Since then, the boom in demand for AI chips and servers has driven Nvidia’s value from under $200 billion to over $3 trillion in 2024, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/18/24181393/nvidia-most-valuable-company-microsoft-apple-google"&gt;surpassing Microsoft, Apple, and Google&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UV1yUf"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-09/china-targets-nvidia-for-potential-breaches-of-anti-monopoly-law"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Chinese regulators say Nvidia failed to follow agreements to provide new Mellanox product information within 90 days to other chipmaking firms in the country to avoid a monopoly. At the same time, the US Justice Department is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/3/24235233/nvidia-doj-ai-antitrust-investigation"&gt;also investigating the company for monopolistic behavior&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rxNeWh"&gt;The Biden administration also placed new sanctions on China last week to make it more difficult to produce advanced AI chips there, as it also restricts the capabilities of exports by companies like Nvidia. China retaliated with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24311929/china-us-export-chipmaking-components-sanctions"&gt;new limitations on key mineral exports to the US&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi’s next EV will be the YU7, coming summer 2025</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Xiaomi YU7" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_pW0Ly-_Ok_Beyj-to4bHKPnj6U=/338x0:3983x2430/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73776181/001Un9Srly1hwexpu8tj4j63c01vie8302.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Xiaomi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dF8VOX"&gt;Xiaomi is continuing to dive deeper into China’s competitive EV market with the reveal of a new model, the YU7 SUV, coming in the summer of 2025. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pFVeE0"&gt;The YU7 is an all-electric SUV with a similar design to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/26/24083366/xiaomis-su7-electric-car-is-here"&gt;the SU7 sedan&lt;/a&gt;, the electronics giant’s first electric model released earlier this year. That vehicle has received a lot of press and praise, including from Ford CEO Jim Farley, who personally drove one after having it flown into the US from Shanghai. Farley loved it so much that he said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/23/24277919/ford-ceo-thinks-xiaomis-electric-car-is-fantastic"&gt;he didn’t want to give it back&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DGTTD9"&gt;We don’t have much detail about the YU7 beyond the name and a few images shared on Weibo by Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun. While the SU7 competes with the Tesla Model 3 and other electric sedans in China, the YU7 is expected to land in the growing electric SUV market, currently dominated by the Model Y and others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6hTE4dIMod4MgEtQplQmwzxUcL4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25781394/001Un9Srly1hwexpwoojyj63c01vi4qr02.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KvOs6QcCvLIdR_17RFJsOsYR2_U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25781386/Screenshot_2024_12_09_at_11.29.44_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/u/1749127163?luicode=10000011&amp;amp;lfid=1005051749127163" target="_blank"&gt;Weibo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="JRyb2a"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Seven things I learned about the Sony car while playing Gran Turismo inside one","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/24/24185255/sony-afeela-gran-turismo-privacy-wheel"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UyRxNo"&gt;Jun said he expects an official launch for the YU7 in “June or July” next year. “We hope that the YU7 test car can remove its heavy camouflage as soon as possible, which will help us conduct more comprehensive, detailed, long-term and large-scale testing to ensure product quality and make better products,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3GI2I1"&gt;Xiaomi beat Sony, Apple, and others in making the jump from electronics to cars. While Apple bailed on its own car project with nothing to show for it, Sony is gearing up to launch the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/24/24185255/sony-afeela-gran-turismo-privacy-wheel"&gt;Afeela EV&lt;/a&gt; it's making in collaboration with Honda. Indeed, Xiaomi also isn’t going alone, working alongside China’s CATL on batteries and a division of BAIC to build its cars. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s AI boss and Sam Altman disagree on what it takes to get to AGI </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HsLUH0"&gt;Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman disagrees with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s recent &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/article/openai-sam-altman-ama-reddit"&gt;claim in a Reddit AMA&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24201441/ai-terminology-explained-humans#:~:text=Artificial%20general%20intelligence%20(AGI)%3A"&gt;artificial general intelligence, or AGI&lt;/a&gt;, is possible on today’s hardware. While AGI is “plausible,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Nilay Patel in the latest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24314821/microsoft-ai-ceo-mustafa-suleyman-google-deepmind-openai-inflection-agi-decoder-podcast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt; episode&lt;/a&gt; that it could take as long as 10 years to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QZRF0S"&gt;With current hardware defined by Nilay as “within one or two generations of what we have now, I would say,” Suleyman replied, explaining why he thinks that’s unlikely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="oG4tVB"&gt;I don’t think it can be done on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/18/24105157/nvidia-blackwell-gpu-b200-ai"&gt;[Nvidia] GB200s&lt;/a&gt;. I do think it is going to be plausible at some point in the next two to five generations. I don’t want to say I think it’s a high probability that it’s two years away, but I think within the next five to seven years since each generation takes 18 to 24 months now. So, five generations could be up to 10 years away depending on how things go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="0FQJWE"&gt;“The uncertainty around this is so high,” Suleyman said, “that any categorical declarations just feel sort of ungrounded to me and over the top.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="s1zp2L"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://player.megaphone.fm/VMP3665150620" style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 200px;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="unSFWj"&gt;He’s also drawing a line between AGI and the “singularity”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="zgV0yt"&gt;It depends on your definition of AGI, right? AGI isn’t the singularity. The singularity is an exponentially recursive self-improving system that very rapidly accelerates far beyond anything that might look like human intelligence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s642A5"&gt;To me, AGI is a general-purpose learning system that can perform well across all human-level training environments. So, knowledge work, by the way, that includes physical labor. A lot of my skepticism has to do with the progress and the complexity of getting things done in robotics. But yes, I can well imagine that we have a system that can learn — without a great deal of handcrafted prior prompting — to perform well in a very wide range of environments. I think that is not necessarily going to be AGI, nor does that lead to the singularity, but it means that most human knowledge work in the next five to 10 years could likely be performed by one of the AI systems that we develop. And I think the reason why I shy away from the language around singularity or artificial superintelligence is because I think they’re very different things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sz6L0Y"&gt;The challenge with AGI is that it’s become so dramatized that we sort of end up not focusing on the specific capabilities of what the system can do. And that’s what I care about with respect to building AI companions, getting them to be useful to you as a human, work for you as a human, be on your side, in your corner, and on your team. That’s my motivation and that’s what I have control and influence over to try and create systems that are accountable and useful to humans rather than pursuing the theoretical super intelligence quest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="vYW2sb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Sam Altman lowers the bar for AGI","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24313130/sam-altman-openai-agi-lower-the-bar"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QagMSO"&gt;Last week, during &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; DealBook Summit, Altman &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24313130/sam-altman-openai-agi-lower-the-bar"&gt;set out a lower set of goalposts&lt;/a&gt; for AGI than the superintelligence-style phenomenon he’s &lt;a href="https://ia.samaltman.com/"&gt;described in the past&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rllAsp"&gt;Now, Altman says AGI will arrive “sooner than most people in the world think and it will matter much less.” And when it comes to superintelligence, “a lot of the safety concerns that we and others expressed actually don’t come at the AGI moment. AGI can get built, the world mostly goes on in mostly the same way, things grow faster, but then there is a long continuation from what we call AGI to what we call superintelligence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="snat8V"&gt;This is a relationship that appears strained only one year after Microsoft helped reseat Altman as OpenAI’s CEO. After confirming that Microsoft is working on its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24201441/ai-terminology-explained-humans#:~:text=images%2C%20and%20video.-,Frontier%20models%3A,-In%20addition%20to"&gt;frontier AI model&lt;/a&gt; capable of competing at the “GPT-4, GPT-4o scale,” Suleyman also commented on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/17/24273255/openai-and-microsoft-should-ask-chatgpt-for-ways-to-fix-a-relationship"&gt;tension&lt;/a&gt; between Microsoft and OpenAI:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="VdygYk"&gt;Every partnership has tension. It’s healthy and natural. I mean, they’re a completely different business to us. They operate independently and partnerships evolve over time... partnerships evolve and they have to adapt to what works at the time, so we’ll see how that changes over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="mWmvW4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lego Fortnite is getting a big expansion with a GTA-style roleplaying city</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Promotional art for Lego Brick Life, a social game inside of Fortnite." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AhzddTurtAkvVAGkOlJ4uy-nR50=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73775930/LEGO_Fortnite_Brick_Life_KeyArt.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JF62ri"&gt;Lego is building something new in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. A year after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23990660/lego-fortnite-release-epic"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lego Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; launched a new era inside of the game&lt;/a&gt; — one based on the idea that &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is a collection of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/9/23992574/fortnite-festival-harmonix-guitar-hero-rock-band"&gt;many game experiences&lt;/a&gt;, rather than just a battle royale — Lego is expanding its presence with a new title that sounds reminiscent of &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/em&gt; roleplaying as well as a rebrand of its core survival game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PUxdvD"&gt;First up is a game called &lt;em&gt;Brick Life&lt;/em&gt;, which is billed as “an all-new social roleplay experience.” Players explore a Lego-ified city location with 31 other people and can take on specific jobs like courier, security guard, or sushi chef. Players can design their own homes and explore locations like a magical school and rooftop club, and there are missions to take on as well. From the sounds of it, &lt;em&gt;Brick Life&lt;/em&gt; is a more family-friendly take on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/11/23828431/rockstar-cfx-re-mod-tools-roleplay-server"&gt;the enduring popularity of roleplaying servers in &lt;em&gt;GTA V&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and Epic isn’t being all that subtle about the connection:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mQW4WB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" align="center"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Ah bricks here we go again... &lt;a href="https://t.co/1HiNMIbUKX"&gt;pic.twitter.com/1HiNMIbUKX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— LEGO Fortnite (@LEGOFortnite) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LEGOFortnite/status/1865803561210204202?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 8, 2024&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rGTSp2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brick Life&lt;/em&gt; is launching inside of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on December 12th, though it won’t be available for players in South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h1e7E5"&gt;As part of the announcement, &lt;em&gt;Lego Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; — the &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;-style survival experience that launched last December — is being renamed &lt;em&gt;Lego Fortnite Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;. From now on, “Lego Fortnite” will be the name of the hub inside of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; that houses all of the Lego experiences. Epic and Lego have been steadily expanding their partnership over the last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/27/24084644/fortnite-new-lego-games-raft-survival-obby-fun"&gt;launching new games&lt;/a&gt; and also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/20/24106477/lego-fortnite-user-created-games-epic"&gt;letting &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; players build their own Lego games&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QaXblH"&gt;The ongoing collaboration between Lego and &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; could provide a hint at what to expect from the upcoming “persistent universe” that Epic and Disney are making together, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/7/24065281/disney-epic-games-investment-fortnite-metaverse"&gt;following a $1.5 billion investment from Disney in February&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24261555/epic-disney-fortnite-unreal-fest"&gt;we’ve heard very little specifics&lt;/a&gt; about what the virtual world might look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yLSF7g"&gt;Meanwhile, Epic has also announced that &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is getting support for a revamped version of text chat, which will be available as an option across all of its experiences starting on December 10th. There will be three kinds of text chat available: party channel for talking with your squad; game channel for a public conversation with people on the same island; and DMs with people on your friends list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o00PVY"&gt;Epic says there will be two kinds of chat filters — one that removes personal information, and another that filters out “various kinds of mature language and toxicity” — which will be always on for players under the age of 13 in all forms of text chat. They will also be always on for all players in the channel chats. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/16/23962354/epic-games-fortnite-report-voice-conversations"&gt;The feature will also include a reporting system similar to the voice reporting tool Epic launched last year&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s an example of what text chats look like in the game:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of Fortnite featuring an in-game text chat." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3ubHynyP_fizIJkpa20ygm1uT1M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25781166/Fortnite_Text_Chat.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Epic Games&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VEGMdP"&gt;All of these announcements come at a particularly busy time for &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. The battle royale game is currently in the midst of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/26/24306403/fortnite-minus-one"&gt;a brand-new chapter&lt;/a&gt; that kicked off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/4/24288014/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-snoop-dogg-times-square-music"&gt;following an ambitious music-themed season&lt;/a&gt;, and Epic also recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24294616/fortnite-og-permanent-december-release-date"&gt;brought back the nostalgia-filled &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; OG as a permanent mode&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/7/24315134/fortnite-ballistic-counter-strike-first-person-shooter-fps"&gt;Epic just announced “Ballistic,”&lt;/a&gt; a multiplayer first-person shooter mode that launches inside of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on December 11th.&lt;/p&gt;

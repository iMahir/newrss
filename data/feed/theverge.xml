    <title>Epic’s dream is starting to come true — its store will be preinstalled on ‘millions’ of Android phones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Illustration of the Epic Games logo and Google logo inside of a Google Play logo." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_aT1nyeM1x3dbvpSeD7T_om1u80=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73782043/236883_Epic_Vs_Google_B_CVirginia.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3wdoKW"&gt;Telefónica, one of the largest carriers in the world serving the UK, Spain, Germany, and Latin America with the O2 and Movistar networks, will begin preinstalling the Epic Games Store on every new compatible Android phone it sells — including Samsung phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ojs9Az"&gt;It’s part of a “long term partnership” to bring the store and smash hit &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; to “millions” of the carrier’s devices, according to Telefónica and Epic. It’ll be the first time the Epic Games Store is preinstalled on consumer phones, and it could be the next big step in realizing Epic’s dreams of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/2024/10/7/24243316/epic-google-permanent-injunction-ruling-third-party-stores"&gt;challenging Google’s app store monopoly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/20/23970123/tim-sweeney-just-laughed-and-agreed-hed-love-to-make-billions-of-dollars-by-not-paying-google-anythi"&gt;increasing its cut of revenue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="9lsVDp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Fortnite is back on the iPhone — with a whole app store in tow","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/16/24221361/fortnite-iphone-epic-games-app-store"},{"title":"Epic v. Google: everything we learned in Fortnite court","url":"https://www.theverge.com/23945184/epic-v-google-fortnite-play-store-antitrust-trial-updates"},{"title":"Epic is suing Google — again — and now Samsung, too","url":"https://www.theverge.com/policy/2024/9/30/24256395/epic-sues-google-samsung-antitrust-auto-blocker"},{"title":"Epic has a plan for the rest of the decade","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/5/24262376/epic-unreal-engine-6-fortnite-metaverse-plans"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="87KrqV"&gt;Last December, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23994174/epic-google-trial-jury-verdict-monopoly-google-play"&gt;a federal jury unanimously sided with Epic Games&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Google&lt;/em&gt;, finding that Google had turned its Android app store and Google Play Billing service into an illegal monopoly. Epic originally sued in 2020, alleging that Google had “blocked” or “bribed” phonemakers and cellular carriers to keep games like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;and alternative app stores from being preinstalled on phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yTSRSu"&gt;But now, roughly a month after Judge James Donato barred Google from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/18/24271996/google-epic-lawsuit-play-third-party-app-store-changes-delayed-administrative-stay-granted#:~:text=Starting%20November%201st%2C%202024%2C%20and%20continuing%20until%20November%201st%2C%202027%2C"&gt;any further potential blocks or bribes&lt;/a&gt;, one of the world’s largest carriers will begin those preinstalls, adding an entire rival game store (one that may also carry non-game apps in the future) to Google’s own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CGtfq1"&gt;Technically, Epic only launched its Epic Games Store on mobile &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/16/24221361/fortnite-iphone-epic-games-app-store"&gt;this past August&lt;/a&gt;. Previously, it wanted nearly every phonemaker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs#:~:text=95.%20Epic%20approached%20nearly%20every%20Android%20phone%20manufacturer%20to%20preinstall%20Fortnite%20%E2%80%94%20and%20it%20gave%20Samsung%2012%20percent%20of%20its%20revenue%20there"&gt;and carrier&lt;/a&gt; to preinstall one of a couple different types of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; installer apps to bring the game to their phones. It offered a variety of deals to tempt them, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/30/23983345/epic-approached-most-every-oem-about-preinstalling-fortnite"&gt;and Samsung, LG, OnePlus and Huawei all initially agreed to do so&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Un7rUK"&gt;But OnePlus only ever managed to do so in India, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/13/23959264/oneplus-needed-permission-from-google-to-preinstall-fortnite-on-its-phones"&gt;allegedly because&lt;/a&gt; it needed permission that Google wouldn’t grant. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/13/23959430/google-suggests-oneplus-made-its-own-strategic-choice-not-to-preinstall-the-fortnite-launcher"&gt;Google disputes that reasoning&lt;/a&gt;.) LG apparently backed out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368395/fortnite-epic-games-oneplus-deal-google-play-store-lawsuit-lg"&gt;because of a Google contract&lt;/a&gt; as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fxoYbX"&gt;Telefónica wasn’t one of the carriers that Google “bribed,” Epic spokesperson Natalie Muñoz confirms to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, so it’s not like Judge Donato’s order is making this newly possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="skLr26"&gt;In fact, Telefónica has partnered with Epic in the past. In 2020, it began letting Movistar customers in Spain tack their &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; purchases onto their phone bill. That year, court documents revealed Telefónica &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs#:~:text=95.%20Epic%20approached%20nearly%20every%20Android%20phone%20manufacturer%20to%20preinstall%20Fortnite%20%E2%80%94%20and%20it%20gave%20Samsung%2012%20percent%20of%20its%20revenue%20there"&gt;could expect to earn five percent of the proceeds&lt;/a&gt; from those &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; players as a result. Verizon and Hutchison (Three, Wind Tre) were offered similar deals, but we don’t know if they’ll now follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8rPux2"&gt;I wonder what Samsung thinks about Telefónica preinstalling the Epic Game Store on its phones — this September, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/2024/9/30/24256395/epic-sues-google-samsung-antitrust-auto-blocker"&gt;Epic sued Samsung as well&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best deals on Apple Watches right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Woman holding a purse while modeling the Stripes watchface on the Apple Watch SE (2022)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vUtHEiuDx24RW8LhsX7Z25vWPX0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976955/226292_Apple_Watch_SE_PHO_akrales_0047.55.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The latest Apple Watch SE is an entry-level smartwatch if there ever was one.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5yaz1u"&gt;In September, Apple launched its latest smartwatch, introducing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24246464/apple-watch-series-10-review-smartwatch-wearables"&gt;Apple Watch Series 10&lt;/a&gt; alongside a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/19/24248380/apple-watch-ultra-2-black-smartwatch-wearables"&gt;black rendition&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23878981/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-review-double-tap-precision-finding-siri"&gt;Apple Watch Ultra 2&lt;/a&gt;. Each wearable has its own pros and cons, as does the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23369207/apple-watch-se-2022-review-smartwatch"&gt;second-gen Apple Watch SE&lt;/a&gt;, but the recent introduction of the new wearables also means there are now more Apple Watch models on the market than ever before — and a lot more deals to be had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="CWUc7k"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:11906226"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sHcaqK"&gt;But with all of those options, which one should you pick? Generally speaking, you want to buy the newest watch you can afford so that it continues to receive software updates from Apple. The latest update, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/25/24253366/watch-os-11-apple-watch-smartwatch"&gt;watchOS 11&lt;/a&gt;, launched in September on the Apple Watch Series 6 and newer, ultimately leaving those still using an older Series 4 or Series 5 behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C0aQBE"&gt;Picking up a watch from the latest (or a recent) generation ensures you’re getting a smartwatch with an updated design, a robust number of features, and plenty of sensors. Now, let’s get to the deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="0Qe5br"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to choose which Apple Watch to buy","url":"https://www.theverge.com/23037217/best-apple-watch-series-se-ultra"},{"title":"The best AirPods deals available right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"},{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hZHCRf"&gt;The best Apple Watch Series 10 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="kuzcBW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:12429524"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="rOw2iI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:12462708"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KCUrjH"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 10 represents the latest wearable in Apple’s flagship Series lineup. It features the new S10 SiP chip, faster charging, and a wide-angle OLED display that’s brighter, larger, and easier to read than that of previous models. It weighs half as much as the Ultra, too, and is about 30 percent thinner despite its new 42mm and 46mm sizing. Other upgrades include an added depth and water temperature sensor, as well as a new FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection feature, the latter of which is also available on the last-gen Series 9 and Ultra 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="rPKDmW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Watch sleep apnea detection gets FDA clearance","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/16/24246150/apple-watch-sleep-apnea-detection-fda-approval"},{"title":"The Apple Watch is now a better TV remote","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/19/24249074/apple-watch-watchos-11-tv-remote"},{"title":"Here’s how the new Apple Watch Series 10 stacks up to other models","url":"https://www.theverge.com/24240412/apple-watch-series-10-vs-ultra-2-se-comparison-specs-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PS4qua"&gt;While the improvements are certainly welcome, the Series 10 isn’t a vast departure from the prior model, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23878981/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-review-double-tap-precision-finding-siri"&gt;Series 9&lt;/a&gt;. That being said, you can already pick up Apple’s latest wearable at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGHV8NLZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; in the 42mm sizing with GPS starting at $329.99 (about $69 off) thanks to an on-page coupon. The GPS-equipped model is also on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGJ4QLYH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; in the 46mm variant for $359.99 (about $69 off), while the LTE models can be had at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGJGX496/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; starting at $429.99 (about $69 off). Both of the latter discounts also require you to clip the on-page coupon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="Y5l6zo"&gt;The best Apple Watch Series 9 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="lbRB1D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:12073005"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="JK0Ak4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:12152926"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ElCzgR"&gt;In 2023, Apple introduced the Apple Watch Series 9 alongside the second-gen Ultra. It uses Apple’s last-gen S9 SiP chip and a second-gen ultra wideband chip, which allow for onboard Siri processing and precision finding with select iPhone models. It also features a brighter, 2,000-nit display and support for Apple’s nifty “double tap” feature — two minor additions that are also present on the Series 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="eSbn28"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to customize double tap on the Apple Watch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/23930197/double-tap-apple-watch-how-to-use"},{"title":"The best MagSafe and Qi2 chargers for your iPhone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/23505846/best-magsafe-magnetic-chargers-apple-iphone"},{"title":"The Apple Watch made smartwatches the wearable of choice","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/8/24237890/apple-watch-10-years-smartwatch-wearables"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eN7K4x"&gt;The Series 9 has been out for more than a year, but certain configurations have become increasingly difficult to find with the arrival of Apple’s latest watch. Luckily, the GPS-equipped Series 9 is still on sale at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-series-9-2024%2F-%2FA-93149277%2F&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; in the 41mm sizing starting at $299.99 ($100 off), or in the 45mm configuration at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-9-GPS-41mm-Midnight-Aluminum-Case-Sport-Band-S-M-Fitness-Tracker-ECG-Apps-Always-On-Retina-Display-Water-Resistant%2F5405516867&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-series-9-2024%2F-%2FA-93149277%2F&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; starting at $329 ($100 off). There are also a handful of deals to be had on the LTE models with cellular connectivity, though none of them undercut the current price of the LTE-equipped Series 10 model by much, hence their exclusion here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="1D7GZC"&gt;

&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;The Apple Watch SE &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/7/23328608/apple-watch-se-new-second-gen-price-specs-features-release-date"&gt;received a refresh in late 2022&lt;/a&gt;. It has the same chipset as the Series 8, which is great, but with fewer sensors, no always-on display, and a slightly outdated design compared to the Series 8, Series 9, and Series 10. Those omissions might take this out of the running for some people, but it still may be exactly what you’re after. Best of all, it starts at $249 for the 40mm Wi-Fi / GPS model, which is $30 less than the previous generation’s baseline cost. Opting for cellular connectivity bumps the starting price up to $299 for the 40mm size (44mm adds $20 to each configuration).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="2c4FDi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to use wearable tech if you’ve got tattoos","url":"https://www.theverge.com/23567992/wearable-tech-tattoos-fitness-tracking-how-to"},{"title":"Apple Intelligence is here, but it still has a lot to learn","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/28/24279804/apple-intelligence-ios-18-1-siri-ai"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XvDBRz"&gt;At the moment, the best deals on the latest Apple Watch SE can be found at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Smartwatch-Starlight-Aluminium-Detection/dp/B0DGHPY11S/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-2nd-Gen-GPS-40mm-Midnight-Aluminum-Case-with-Midnight-Sport-Band-S-M-Fitness-Sleep-Tracker-Crash-Detection-Heart-Rate-Monitor%2F5054105595&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, where you can pick the 40mm model with GPS in select styles starting at $189 ($60 off). The 44mm configuration, meanwhile, is available in select styles at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGJ1W9MF/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-2nd-Gen-GPS-44mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-M-L%2F5053502760%2F&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; starting at $219 ($60 off).

&lt;div id="vl872D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:12039671" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="58AJpB"&gt;The latest Apple Watch Ultra launched at $799 in September of last year with GPS and LTE support, much like the original model. The ultra-capable smartwatch has the most features, sensors, and ruggedness of any Apple Watch model available thus far, along with a display that’s 50 percent brighter than the first Ultra. The 49mm smartwatch also packs Apple’s S9 SiP and second-gen ultra wideband chips, just like the Apple Watch Series 9, while maintaining long-lasting battery life, precise GPS tracking, and a bevy of diving-friendly sensors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="3ANzYj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to use the Apple Watch Ultra’s Action button","url":"https://www.theverge.com/23365635/apple-watch-ultra-action-button-how-to"},{"title":"FDA qualifies Apple Watch’s AFib history for use in clinical studies","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/2/24147178/fda-apple-watch-mddt-qualification-afib-history"},{"title":"The next Apple Watch Ultra could have satellite texting","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/10/24318154/apple-watch-ultra-satellite-texting-messaging-blood-pressure-monitoring"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pluEiH"&gt;In recent months, we saw the Apple Watch Ultra 2 dip to as low as $642 ($157 off) in select configurations. Right now, however, it’s only on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSVL1GS9/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://howl.link/d29bs492vs57y"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; with a Trail Loop starting at $719.99 (about $79 off) or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSVG1668/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; with an Alpine Loop starting at $759.99 (about $39 off). You can also pick it up with an Ocean Band at either &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSVB9C5G/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://howl.link/14s4vjiis1isj"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, though neither retailer is currently discounting the burlier configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="MpVWgd"&gt;A note on the more premium models&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="7aHrsm"&gt;While all of the Apple Watch models and colorways covered here are encased in aluminum (except the Ultra 2, which has a titanium build), Apple does make a more premium range built out of stainless steel and titanium. These offerings are functionally and aesthetically similar to their aluminum counterparts, with slightly refined colors and finishings — polished for the stainless steel and brushed for the titanium. However, they start at much steeper prices of $699 and above. They, too, can often be found on sale, but they’re never discounted as low as the standard base models, so we don’t include them here.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Steam is adding a new default option for game updates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of the Steam logo." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FgRQ1mP0A5jZfx3eoisCjs7YlLs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73781656/STK138_Stream_Kradtke_01.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bCyPDn"&gt;Valve is &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/4696782040345941642"&gt;testing an option&lt;/a&gt; in the new Steam client beta that will force games by default to only download updates when you launch them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iarvvb"&gt;Currently, Steam by default decides what game updates to download based on a few different things. As explained by Valve:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="5aalMe"&gt;For games you recently played, Steam will download game updates shortly after they are released. For games that you haven’t played in a while, Steam might wait a few days to bundle multiple updates together or choose to download the update while you are asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="dpJeU4"&gt;This new default option to wait to download an update gives players more control; as Valve points out, it means that users can hold an updating a massive game until they actually want to play it, which could be a relief for people with bandwidth caps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MJGSlw"&gt;You’ll find the new option in the beta Steam client settings under the Downloads section. “You can set the default to: let Steam decide when to update the game (based on factors like when you last played the game, bandwidth availability, etc.) or wait to update until the game is launched,” Valve says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RzD1fP"&gt;You can still set per-game download settings in a game’s Properties that override the global setting, but those options have “cleaned up descriptions,” according to Valve. And with the beta, you can also manage the per-game overrides in the overall Steam client Downloads settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot showing Steam’s Update settings." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Phv0n0z6g8Pd-gn3k6R9QhKPgHY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25786275/a14b86155903326a56c8a1f50e6204dbd7abfb4b.png"&gt;

    <title>Here are the best iPad deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A finger touching the iPad Air’s screen." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QmRrw4gj4EXVvg5j-uBVU6oIAnw=/128x0:2375x1498/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66899976/ipad_air_larger.64.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deals on Apple’s latest slates are finally worth springing for.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wlNlq4"&gt;While the best iPad deals usually land during major sale events like Black Friday and Amazon Prime Day, many great iPad deals are attainable outside those times. The day-to-day discounts may come and go like changing winds, but there’s often something to be saved, particularly on the more affordable iPads. The most recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24146276/apple-ipad-pro-oled-features-specs-let-loose-event"&gt;iPad Pro and iPad Air&lt;/a&gt; are also starting to see substantial price reductions, and now that Apple has a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24275956/apple-ipad-mini-2024-review"&gt;new iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt;, we’re seeing regular discounts on the last-gen Mini as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="8iS4ez"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:11906226"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WBzk5S"&gt;It’s difficult to know where exactly you can find the most notable iPad deals unless you’re scouring the major retailers on a daily basis. But that’s often what our deal hunters at &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;are doing each and every day, so let us help you out. Below, we’ve listed the best deals you can get on each iPad model that is currently available, from the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G9FPHY6?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;cheapo ninth-gen iPad&lt;/a&gt; of 2021 to the latest models equipped with Apple’s powerful M2 and M4 chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="5Isa1o"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iOS 18.2 is rolling out now, adding ChatGPT integration and more Apple Intelligence tools","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24317119/ios-18-2-apple-intelligence-chatgpt-genmoji"},{"title":"In iPadOS 18, the whole iPad is a calculator app","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/16/24194423/math-notes-ipad-ios-18-calculator-app"},{"title":"Apple gets ready for AI: all the news on iOS 18, macOS Sequoia, and more ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/24246632/apple-intelligence-ios-18-ipad-os-18-macos-sequoia-iphone-16"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hb2n3u"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23639378/best-ipad-apple-buy-model-price#:~:text=Seifert%20/%20The%20Verge-,The%20best%20budget%20iPad%3A%20ninth%2Dgen%20iPad,-%E2%86%B4"&gt;iPad (2021)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="fMZ13y"&gt;Announced alongside the iPhone 13 way back in 2021, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23639378/best-ipad-apple-buy-model-price#:~:text=Seifert%20/%20The%20Verge-,The%20best%20budget%20iPad%3A%20ninth%2Dgen%20iPad,-%E2%86%B4"&gt;ninth-gen iPad&lt;/a&gt; is Apple’s aging entry-level tablet, one that’s still great at carrying out everyday tasks despite having been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24151124/apple-ipad-headphone-jack"&gt;discontinued&lt;/a&gt;. The ninth-gen model originally started at $329 with Wi-Fi and 64GB of storage, which arguably makes the newer 10th-gen model the better deal if you don’t need a home button or a headphone jack, as it now starts at $349 and is often on sale for even less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rLWRaU"&gt;The last-gen iPad has been receiving a steep discount for quite a while, but it’s becoming increasingly difficult to find in most configurations. That being said, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F2021-Apple-10-2-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi-64GB-Space-Gray-9th-Generation%2F674982024&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart is still selling&lt;/a&gt; the 64GB base model with Wi-Fi for $249 ($80 off), which is about $50 shy of its all-time low. As for the step-up 256GB variant, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G91TLNJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; has it in silver for $359 ($120 off), which is $10 more than its lowest price to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Zyh0l4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A last-gen model is still worth considering&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WMpIom"&gt;The last-gen iPad uses an A13 Bionic processor and a 12MP wide-angle camera with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams"&gt;Center Stage&lt;/a&gt;, a feature designed to keep you framed up and centered while on video calls. The tablet also carries over a number of features from its predecessor, such as the 10.2-inch display, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor built into the home button, and a smart connector for connecting a smart keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eOtg7g"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10752834"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CM2y8j"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23418039/apple-ipad-review-10th-gen-2022-10-9-tablet-ipados"&gt;iPad (2022)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="gWdr2t"&gt;Although the newer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23418039/apple-ipad-review-10th-gen-2022-10-9-tablet-ipados"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10th-gen iPad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; came out in late 2022, it’s still an excellent tablet — one we consider to be the best value for most people (once &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24151124/apple-ipad-headphone-jack#:~:text=The%2010th%2Dgen%20iPad%20is%20now%20the%20sole%20entry%2Dlevel%20iPad%20in%20Apple%E2%80%99s%20official%20lineup%20and%2C%20as%20such%2C%20has%20received%20a%20%24100%20price%20cut."&gt;Apple dropped its price&lt;/a&gt;). The latest iPad modernizes the design with a switch to USB-C, uniform bezels with no home button, a side power button with a fingerprint sensor, and a larger display, but it eliminates the 3.5mm headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A8cnFi"&gt;In the past, you could often buy Apple’s latest entry-level iPad for $349 ($100 off its initial launch price) — which is now the MSRP. Right now, however, the base model with 64GB of storage is on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BJLCWFNM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://howl.link/j3jr0cyltdywv"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F2022-Apple-10-9-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi-64GB-Blue-10th-Generation%2F1485722187%2F&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; for $279 ($70 off), which is about $30 more than its lowest price to date. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BJLDDCGS/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://howl.link/9b749tt4g33iz"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; are also selling the 256GB model starting at $429 ($70 off), which nearly matches its all-time low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="elDNe4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:11616907"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="njqbEo"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review"&gt;iPad Mini (2021)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/15/24268079/apple-ipad-mini-2024-specs-price"&gt;iPad Mini (2024)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jTw4HZ"&gt;The new iPad Mini is similar to the outgoing 2021 model but comes with faster Wi-Fi and USB-C speeds, support for the Apple Pencil Pro, and a newer processor that supports Apple Intelligence. That said, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sixth-gen iPad Mini&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; could still be worth a look if prices continue to drop. It has an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display, an A15 Bionic processor, a USB-C port, and options for 5G. It lacks the 3.5mm jack and dedicated home button found on the prior model, but so do all of the tablets in Apple’s current lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="rxkup7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The new iPad Mini has 8GB of RAM","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/20/24274888/the-new-ipad-mini-has-8gb-of-ram"},{"title":"Apple Intelligence is here, but it still has a lot to learn ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/28/24279804/apple-intelligence-ios-18-1-siri-ai"},{"title":"The iPad mini might get an OLED upgrade in 2026","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/24/24164031/ipad-mini-might-get-an-oled-upgrade-in-2026"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sBkkEE"&gt;Despite its age, the 2021 iPad Mini still technically starts at $499 with 64GB of storage (the seventh-gen model starts at the same price with 128GB of storage). Electing for 256GB of storage brings the price up to $649, while the 5G cellular models are $649 for 64GB and $799 for 256GB. These are some big numbers for a small iPad, and the larger iPad Air might be worth considering if you prefer your dollar to go further with more screen real estate. But if you want an Apple tablet in the smallest possible form factor, this is where the action is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NMDW5P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10743705"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zw4xQv"&gt;Although the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24275956/apple-ipad-mini-2024-review"&gt;seventh-gen iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; is now widely available, it’s not worth the upgrade unless you want to leverage Apple Intelligence or the newer Apple Pencil Pro. Thankfully, you can still pick up the 64GB iPad Mini from 2021 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F2021-Apple-iPad-Mini-Wi-Fi-64GB-Purple-6th-Generation%2F168720858&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; for $389 ($110 off), which misses its all-time low by $40. The 256GB sixth-gen Mini is also on sale at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F2021-Apple-iPad-Mini-Wi-Fi-64GB-Space-Gray-6th-Generation%2F554998889&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; in select colors for $549 ($100 off), which is $50 more than its lowest price to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9y8XzO"&gt;If you do want the newest Mini, you can get the 128GB base configuration with Wi-Fi at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK3YLRM8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://howl.link/w855xeib37snl"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for a record low of $449 ($50 off). You can also get the Wi-Fi model with 256GB of storage for $549 ($50 off) at both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK3XZ1CH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://howl.link/lpxjt9eiu8gxj"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, though Amazon currently does not provide a shipping estimate for the tablet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PnStbd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:12453163"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UyVwNP"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24155407/apple-ipad-air-review-2024"&gt;best iPad Air (2024)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="HkPt3t"&gt;Apple just recently launched the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24155407/apple-ipad-air-review-2024"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2024 iPad Air&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which features several small upgrades. The newer model doesn’t feature any groundbreaking changes compared to the 2022 release, but notably, there is now a 13-inch configuration in addition to a base 11-inch model. Apple also added Wi-Fi 6E radios and upgraded the chipset to M2, which enables the hover feature when using Apple’s latest styluses. You can use the newer iPad Air with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24146454/apple-pencil-pro-ipad-stylus-price-availability-features"&gt;Apple Pencil Pro&lt;/a&gt; and both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/20/21227345/magic-keyboard-ipad-pro-tablet-laptop-review-price-specs-features"&gt;previous-gen Magic Keyboards&lt;/a&gt;, too. The 11-inch iPad Air starts at $599, while the comparable 13-inch model starts at $799.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="r8o4qn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iPads finally get battery health info and adaptive charging, but only the new ones","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/14/24156362/apple-ipad-pro-air-battery-charge-health-limit-cycle-count"},{"title":"Apple’s ‘HomePod with a screen’ may come later in 2025 ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24312969/apple-smart-home-display-homepod-screen-third-quarter-2025"},{"title":"The iPad should fold in half","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/15/24177306/apple-foldable-phone-ipados-18"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WRB6wk"&gt;Deals for the 2024 iPad Air started to appear before the latest model even hit store shelves. Right now, you can pick up the 11-inch base model with 128GB of storage and Wi-Fi at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Air-11-inch-Intelligence/dp/B0D3J617D7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://howl.link/pff6g1q94pvly"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; starting at $499 ($100 off), which is its best price to date. The 13-inch iPad Air with 128GB of storage, meanwhile, is on sale at &lt;a href="https://howl.link/0tqbeyv3x48u9"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for an all-time low of $699 ($100 off).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="iuddo9"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24155440/apple-ipad-pro-2024-review"&gt;iPad Pro (2024)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="103JRv"&gt;Compared to the latest iPad Air, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24155440/apple-ipad-pro-2024-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2024 iPad Pro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a far more impressive upgrade. The 11- and 13-inch models start at $999 and $1,299, respectively, and they are the first Apple devices to feature the company’s latest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24148451/apple-m4-chip-ai-ipad-macbook"&gt;M4 chip&lt;/a&gt;, which brings moderate performance gains and dedicated hardware for on-device Apple Intelligence processing. The new Pro models can claim other firsts, too, such as being the first iPad models with OLED displays and the lightest Pros yet, which is true for both sizes. They also feature repositioned front-facing cameras that sit along the horizontal edge, which prevent you from looking as though you’re staring off into space on a video call.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sonos plans return-to-office push for its product teams</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vector illustration of the Sonos logo." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iYOOL-ZSmMec9HgCJOKP3Pq-pnE=/0x1:4250x2834/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73781315/_STK084_SONOS_A.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Cath Virginia / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RDCudC"&gt;Sonos will soon encourage employees on its various product teams who live near its US office locations to come in for at least two days per week, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has learned. That’s a notable break from the company’s history, throughout which Sonos has enthusiastically supported fully remote and hybrid work. Job listings at Sonos routinely state that “it’s about impact, not location.” &lt;a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Benefits/Sonos-Work-From-Home-US-BNFT152_E259049_N1.htm"&gt;Glassdoor reviews&lt;/a&gt; have long backed this up, with employees reporting no pressure to come into the office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TjQ648"&gt;But that lax stance is set to change slightly as Sonos continues its effort to right the ship following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24258431/sonos-app-controversy-patrick-spence-plan"&gt;this year’s app mishap&lt;/a&gt; and stay on track with upcoming products. It’s adopting a stricter policy that will call for product employees within proximity of Santa Barbara, Boston, Seattle, and San Francisco to regularly be present at those offices. The Santa Barbara location is where Sonos is headquartered. The company also currently operates international offices in Paris and the Netherlands&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H4MZvD"&gt;“Flexibility has been a core tenet of how Sonos has operated since our founding. Flexibility is not going away, but like many companies, we are evaluating the impact that in-person collaboration has on the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android is making it easier to find unknown trackers to prevent stalking</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Android logo on a green and blue background" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s2-ZLm_fKHlTm1-T-iul3RobVy0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73781216/acastro_STK112_android_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OaiXnc"&gt;Google is rolling out two new updates to its unknown tracker alerts feature that should make it easier for Android device owners to detect unfamiliar trackers, the &lt;a href="https://blog.google/feed/android-unknown-tracker-alerts/"&gt;company announced&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday. Introduced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/27/23810052/google-find-my-device-delay-apple-unknown-tracker-alerts-stalking"&gt;in July 2023&lt;/a&gt;, the safety feature automatically sends notifications if an unwanted Bluetooth tracker is traveling with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UkZdmF"&gt;The first update lets Android phone owners temporarily stop sending location updates to the Find My Device network if an unknown compatible tracker is detected. Google will pause these updates for up to 24 hours, so your location will no longer be visible to whoever could be monitoring your location via the tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GTUiQp"&gt;Second, anybody who receives an unknown tracker alert will be able to locate the unwanted Find My Device-compatible tracker using the “Find Nearby” feature. Once you’ve found it, Google will also offer instructions for how to physically disable the tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FCqOmr"&gt;Over the years, Bluetooth trackers have been increasingly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/26/22903005/apple-airtags-personal-safety-hub"&gt;misused&lt;/a&gt;. Domestic abusers and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/5/24172169/russian-smuggling-network-airtag-stalking"&gt;stalkers&lt;/a&gt; have, for example, used it to keep tabs on victims, with &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/apple-airtag-stalking-has-led-to-murder-amended-class-action-lawsuit-says"&gt;one class action lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; claiming AirTag stalking had contributed to “multiple murders.”  In response, Apple and Google have made various efforts to combat stalking, including an announcement earlier this year indicating &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/05/apple-and-google-deliver-support-for-unwanted-tracking-alerts-in-ios-and-android/"&gt;support&lt;/a&gt; for a new industry specification, Detecting Unwanted Location Trackers, that works on both iOS and Android. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to responsibly get rid of the stuff you’ve decluttered</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Four photos showing different types of stuff: phones on a table, a “jigsaw puzzle” of book covers, some toys, hangers full of clothing." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4mqKImZk3EO_Xs_tqOs8Tvi_-nA=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69635339/jbareham_190130_grid_four_up_01_2.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="91CbkL"&gt;While we’re always being told how to simplify our cramped living spaces and get rid of all the stuff we’re no longer using or wearing, it’s often hard to figure out just how to do it responsibly without adding to the world’s excess trash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rEhTDO"&gt;Because just dumping them isn’t an option, reusing and recycling old and unneeded stuff has become an important aspect of the push to preserve the world’s environment. Many states and urban areas have mandated the recycling of tech, metals, paper goods, or other substances, but even if you live in an area where the law doesn’t require it, you probably still want to do the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ucSlT"&gt;The problem is finding how and where you can get rid of your stuff with the greatest advantage to you and the least amount of damage to the environment. This may have been more difficult than usual over the past few years because many resources for recycling were suspended during the covid-19 pandemic, and some were slow to come back — or never did. However, there are still a number of online services that can help you figure out how to responsibly get rid of things — and possibly make some money in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bRMRG6"&gt;Here are some resources to check out, depending on...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NYT tech workers win tentative union contract after election week strike</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Participants seen holding signs at the picket line outside..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vocqayr9gw8lIu0N0n2OqLMtyH8=/0x0:3095x2063/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73781175/2182725600.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Erik McGregor/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A1E8M6"&gt;The NewsGuild of New York &lt;a href="https://www.nyguild.org/front-page-details/ny-newsguild-ny-times-reach-tentative-deal-on-historic-first-tech-contract"&gt;announced Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; that it has reached a tentative deal with &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; on behalf of the Times Tech Guild. The tentative three-year contract would be the first for the guild, which was initially formed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381774/tech-workers-union-nyt-new-york-times-newsguild-guild"&gt;in 2021&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vLf7P9"&gt;The tentative deal follows a strike that kicked off the day before the US presidential election &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/4/24287600/new-york-times-tech-guild-strike-before-presidential-election"&gt;in November&lt;/a&gt; and lasted for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/11/24294023/new-york-times-tech-workers-strike-end"&gt;just over a week&lt;/a&gt;. During the strike, the guild asked people not to play &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; games like &lt;em&gt;Wordle&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Connections&lt;/em&gt; and made a page dedicated to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289937/nyt-tech-workers-strike-games-wordle"&gt;strike-themed versions of games to play instead&lt;/a&gt;. In its press release, the NewsGuild says that the site saw “more than a half million page views and more than 320,000 active users.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zpUfph"&gt;The guild will vote to ratify the contract on December 19th. Here are some of the highlights of the contract, from the NewsGuild’s press release:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="h4fyUr"&gt;Enhanced job security with ‘just cause’ protections &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c3rPvi"&gt;Guaranteed wage increases for the first time of up to 8.25% (plus additional base rate discretionary compensation) that prioritize the largest wage increases for the lowest paid members over the life of the contract &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sp8D1a"&gt;Additional compensation for on-call work&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KDYSUN"&gt;Important protections that lock in guardrails on additional variable compensation (including stocks and bonuses)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tBRoyU"&gt;Improved protections for workers on visas&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uIUYMc"&gt;Language guaranteeing flexible hybrid work schedules&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u3xNjQ"&gt;Process and transparency protections related to career growth, performance reviews and other workplace issues&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="eGIrHa"&gt;“We’re pleased to have reached a tentative agreement with the Tech Guild,” &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; spokesperson Danielle Rhoades Ha says in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sprw3J"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, December 11th:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added &lt;/em&gt;NYT&lt;em&gt; statement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

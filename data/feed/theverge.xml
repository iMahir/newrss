    <title>Trump is probably going to kill the crash reporting rule that made Tesla look bad</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Orange County Register Archive" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g1jzACnO6JFI3fTq73vziHbA90s=/207x0:4082x2583/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73784972/1032138698.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aa0qSp"&gt;Donald Trump’s transition team is taking aim at a Biden-era rule requiring automakers and tech companies to report crashes that involve fully or partially autonomous vehicles, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/trump-transition-recommends-scrapping-car-crash-reporting-requirement-opposed-by-2024-12-13/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Scrapping the crash reporting rule would greatly benefit Tesla, which to date, has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/26/24141361/tesla-autopilot-fsd-nhtsa-investigation-report-crash-death"&gt;reported the most number of crashes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T7zID4"&gt;In 2021, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555666/nhtsa-autonomous-vehicle-crash-report-data"&gt;issued a standing general order&lt;/a&gt; (SGO) requiring automakers and tech companies to report crashes involving autonomous vehicles as well as Level 2 driver-assist systems found in millions of vehicles on the road today. Companies are now required to document collisions when an automated driving system was in use within 30 seconds of impact and report those incidents to the government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="JUL1uX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Automakers plead with Trump: don’t kill the EV tax credit","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/21/24302592/trump-ev-tax-credit-auto-alliance-av-framework"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TG3TNo"&gt;The idea was to create more transparency around the deployment of a new technology that purports to improve safety but has also been tied to a number of deadly incidents. Regulators argued that more data was needed to determine whether these new systems were making roads safer or simply making driving more convenient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gt0mlC"&gt;Tesla, in particular, came under scrutiny. The company’s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features, which are considered Level 2 systems that require drivers to pay attention, are both covered under the rule. Since it was implemented, Tesla has reported over 1,500 crashes to the federal government, &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; says. An analysis of the crash data shows Tesla accounted for 40 out of 45 fatal crashes reported to NHTSA through October of this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W1oq8Y"&gt;Tesla’s numbers were much higher than other companies, most likely due to the fact that it sells more vehicles equipped with Level 2 systems than its rivals and collects more data. But it also resulted in a huge headache for the company. NHTSA has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/26/24141403/tesla-autopilot-nhtsa-investigation-recall-software-fix"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/18/24273418/nhtsa-tesla-full-self-driving-investigation-crashes"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24151077/tesla-autopilot-nhtsa-recall-crash-data-request"&gt;investigations&lt;/a&gt; into Tesla’s driver-assist technology, most of which centered on crashes reported under the SGO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1xfrb7"&gt;Several sources close to Tesla told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; that the company “despises” the standing general order and concluded that it would need a change in administration in order to get rid of it. Tesla CEO Elon Musk was one of Trump’s most vocal defenders, spending at least $277 million of his own money to back his campaign. Musk has since been appointed to head the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301975/elon-musk-vivek-ramaswamy-doge-plan"&gt;Department of Government Efficiency&lt;/a&gt; with the goal of cutting government spending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7CY07Q"&gt;Trump is also considering &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24296723/tesla-reportedly-supports-canceling-the-7500-ev-tax-credit"&gt;getting rid of other policies opposed by Tesla&lt;/a&gt;, including generous subsidies for EV companies. Musk believes Tesla is better positioned to weather a subsidy-free environment than other automakers due to its scale and maturity. Musk is also lobbying Trump to ease restrictions on fully autonomous vehicles in advance of Tesla’s plans to produce its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/10/24265530/tesla-robotaxi-elon-musk-features-range-price-release-date"&gt;robotaxi in 2026&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EVgo nabs $1.25 billion loan as Biden races to approve more EV spending</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="EVGO" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YBuUJSnoEqrnuNTKTA4zLZfs0v8=/0x0:5196x3464/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73784921/2183269024.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="USIAsE"&gt;The US Department of Energy &lt;a href="https://www.energy.gov/lpo/articles/doe-announces-125-billion-loan-evgo-expand-nationwide-public-fast-charging"&gt;announced a $1.25 billion loan&lt;/a&gt; to electric vehicle charging company EVgo as the Biden administration races to finalize its spending on EVs before Donald Trump takes office. The money will fund EVgo’s plans to install approximately 7,500 chargers at roughly 1,100 charging stations across the US over the next five years, with a particular focus on fast-charging 350kW stalls that can charge two vehicles simultaneously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FYoQQH"&gt;But more importantly, it shows how President Joe Biden is intent on doling out as much money for EV projects as he can before leaving office. Trump has promised to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289494/trump-election-electric-vehicle-tax-credit-tesla-elon-musk"&gt;reverse or cancel much of the spending by Biden on EVs&lt;/a&gt; once he assumes office. He has said he will kill the $7,500 tax credit for new EV purchases and wipe out the rest of the spending from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) on EV charging infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="y2OKLi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;President Joe Biden is intent on doling out as much money for EV projects as he can before leaving office&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XiuZGd"&gt;With a little more than a month left in office, Biden’s Energy Department has been furiously approving EV-related loans. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24312175/stellantis-samsung-doe-atvm-ev-battery-loan"&gt;Stellantis and Samsung&lt;/a&gt; were given preliminary approval for $7.54 billion for a battery factory in Indiana, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/26/24306402/rivian-doe-atvm-loan-georgia-ev-factory-trump"&gt;Rivian will receive $6.6 billion&lt;/a&gt; for an EV plant in Georgia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4LJuHN"&gt;The loans are also intended to be job creators, the administration says. For example, EVgo said its expansion project will support the creation of 180 external construction jobs and over 550 maintenance and support jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sQOuRc"&gt;EVgo, which is based in Los Angeles, is working with General Motors on the installation of thousands of EV chargers across the country. The companies recently celebrated the activation of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24313038/gm-and-evgo-now-have-over-2000-ev-charging-stalls-and-counting"&gt;their 2,000th charging stall&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GShDVI"&gt;The fragmented and frustrating nature of our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/6/24214581/electric-vehicle-charging-reliability-study-chargehelp"&gt;current EV charging landscape&lt;/a&gt; has been widely — and correctly — cited as one of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23758095/electric-vehicle-charging-news-nacs-ccs-tesla-supercharger-us-infrastructure"&gt;the most significant barriers to EV adoption&lt;/a&gt;. Owners frequently complain about unreliable charging or broken equipment as one of the most frustrating things about driving an EV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xj19DT"&gt;After his election, Biden vowed to build 500,000 chargers by 2030 as a way to spur more EV sales, including $7.5 billion for charging expansion in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill. While the first few years of funding were rather sluggish, recent updates have shown that things are finally picking up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qPmLCq"&gt;In its release, the DOE said, “there are currently more than 204,000 publicly available charging ports, with nearly 38,000 new public chargers already having been added this year and nearly 1,000 new public chargers being added every week thanks to a combination of direct federal funding, federal tax incentives, state and local funding, and private investment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lBIwnF"&gt;That includes both Level 2 chargers and DC fast chargers. That’s roughly double the number of ports in operation at the outset of 2021 when Biden first took office.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Anker’s new 5K MagSafe battery is slimmer and faster</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Anker’s MagGo Power Bank in blue attached to an iPhone and white on its own." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b2l68l4PGgfB43vRAFTQn0wxUUo=/0x0:2712x1808/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73784871/anker_maggo1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anker’s slim MagSafe power bank now supports Qi2 wireless charging speeds.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Anker&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mrJny5"&gt;Anker has released its &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HRWY2LL/A/anker-maggo-power-bank-5k-slim-white"&gt;thinnest MagSafe-compatible power bank&lt;/a&gt;, measuring about a third of an inch thick. It’s only got a 5,000mAh battery inside, so you probably won’t get two full iPhone charges with it, but Anker has updated it with 15W Qi2 wireless charging speeds so your phone can charge faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zVbM0i"&gt;It’s currently available exclusively through Apple’s online and retail stores for $49.95 in either blue or white, making it $10 more expensive than the older &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anker.com%2Fproducts%2Fa1610%3Fref%3Dselect_your_product%26variant%3D42116102979734&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F12%2F13%2F24320423%2Fanker-apple-magsafe-maggo-power-bank-qi2-battery" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MagGo 621 Magnetic Battery&lt;/a&gt; that Anker still sells through its website. For comparison, the older version of the 5K battery is 0.45-inches thick and only supports wireless charging speeds up to 7.5W.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="GRzHrL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best MagSafe and Qi2 chargers for your iPhone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/23505846/best-magsafe-magnetic-chargers-apple-iphone"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XoPAGi"&gt;The bidirectional USB-C port on the bottom of the power bank can charge it or other devices at 20W. However, when both power outputs are in use, wireless charging speeds drop to 5W, while the USB-C port slows to 12W. The battery is compatible with iPhone models &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/2/24119203/apple-iphone-12-qi2-support-ios-update"&gt;going back to the iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;, but it will also work with Android devices that fully support the Qi2 specifications.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Game-like ‘task scams’ stole more than $220 million in six months</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Graphic photo collage of a wallet." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s9d44tL-2FWFGlQRaLlsV6tNTjo=/20x0:2021x1334/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73784792/STK417_MONEY_CVIRGINIA_C.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Cath Virginia / The Verge; Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KbJHUO"&gt;The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/12/new-ftc-data-show-skyrocketing-consumer-reports-about-game-online-job-scams"&gt;warning Americans about “game-like online job scams”&lt;/a&gt; that get people to perform tasks with the promise of a continuous income stream — only to be duped into giving money to the scammer. The FTC says in the first six months of this year, these “task scams” have raked in over $220 million from victims, often in the form of cryptocurrency. It’s accounted for about 40 percent of all scam reports in 2024. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J5Lh8s"&gt;There were 20,000 reports of task scams in the first half of 2024, a sharp increase from only 5,000 from 2020-2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="zigEhW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The cruel temptation of the job offer scam","url":"https://www.theverge.com/23376976/job-offer-scam-linkedin-bad-check-security-suspicion"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZFIWc4"&gt;These scams often start with a WhatsApp or text message to a victim asking them to do tasks about “app optimization” or “product boosting.” Sometimes, the scammers initially pay small amounts of money to seem trustworthy. Afterward, they convince victims to pay into some tasks with the promise of a larger payout, and then the scammers run away with the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Task scam reports bar graphs, by year: 0 in 2020, less than 500 in 2021, 1,000 in 2022, 5,000 in 2023, 20,000 in 2024 through June." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dvy-Uh5gt8QeXWHzvCLjA8Lfflg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25788524/Screenshot_2024_12_13_at_11.33.35_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: FTC&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PE31lX"&gt;These are the three tips the FTC listed to avoid getting scammed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="dKWjkZ"&gt;Ignore generic and unexpected texts or WhatsApp messages about jobs. Real employers will never contact you that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PoV0Ow"&gt;Never pay anyone to get paid. Someone telling you to pay money to get the money you have supposedly earned is a sure sign of a scam. No legit business would ever do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z60KPZ"&gt;Don’t trust anyone who says they’ll pay you to rate or “like” things online. That’s illegal and no honest company will do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Lenovo might soon announce a SteamOS handheld</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Lenovo Legion Go S" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZrBKT9JJFUJimOINTaCTb8lZA_o=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73784760/lenovolegiongos.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Evan Blass (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1867499994090963132" target="_blank"&gt;X&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HNIOy6"&gt;Valve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219469/valve-steamos-asus-rog-ally-steady-progress-dual-boot"&gt;revealed earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; that it will support the ROG Ally handheld with its Steam Deck operating system, and now it looks like Lenovo will soon have its own SteamOS handheld, too. &lt;a href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1867499994090963132"&gt;Evan Blass has posted&lt;/a&gt; images of an unannounced Lenovo Legion Go S on X today, revealing black and white variants of a handheld gaming PC. The interesting part? The black one has a Steam button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t5Ek7K"&gt;While the low resolution images don’t immediately scream SteamOS, if you look closely you’ll notice a Steam logo is visible on a button to the left of the display. Interestingly, the white model doesn’t have the same Steam button — which could indicate Lenovo is preparing Windows- and SteamOS-powered models of its Legion Go S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nSVS1mSajyzATb-P0FtfFuMEuRo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25788502/lenovolegiongos2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Evan Blass (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1867499994090963132" target="_blank"&gt;X&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can clearly see a Steam logo on the button to the left of the display.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9BoMdr"&gt;PC makers like Lenovo, Asus, and MSI have all opted for Windows-based handhelds so far, but as consumer patience with Windows on tiny screens wears thin and Microsoft’s progress in improving the experience is slow, it seems like OEMs are looking for a better alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jnh8ly"&gt;Lenovo’s potential entry into a SteamOS handheld comes just days after Valve quietly updated a document with new branding guidelines that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24315098/valve-steam-machines-steamos-steam-deck-vr"&gt;include “Powered by SteamOS” hardware&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the surest sign yet that Valve is working with more third-party hardware manufacturers, beyond Asus, to certify devices with SteamOS. With CES 2025 just a few weeks away, we could be about to witness a lot more SteamOS-powered hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UN28eQ"&gt;Valve has been here before, though. At CES in 2013, it tried to tempt PC manufacturers to sign up to its Steam Machines initiative, but it didn’t get far enough with developers to convince them to port games to Linux to make these machines successful. There’s reason to believe this time things will be very different, thanks to Proton. The Steam Deck uses the Proton software compatibility layer and has already proved that many Windows games can even run better on Linux as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8RlMQM"&gt;As my colleague Sean Hollister &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24315098/valve-steam-machines-steamos-steam-deck-vr"&gt;wrote earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;: “it’s just as intriguing an idea &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/16/3652756/valve-big-picture-mode-steam-os-linux-game-console"&gt;as it was 12 years ago&lt;/a&gt; when Gabe Newell &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/8/3852144/gabe-newell-interview-steam-box-future-of-gaming"&gt;explained the initial vision to us&lt;/a&gt;, and this time, there’s a far better chance it’ll work.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s NotebookLM AI podcast hosts can now talk to you, too  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of Google’s multicolor “G” logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A7MocGwsGzQ7kBVrAabktih_ChM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73784598/STK093_Google_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration: The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3DBpRp"&gt;Google’s NotebookLM and its podcast-like Audio Overviews have been a surprise hit this year, and today Google company is starting to roll out a big new feature: the ability to actually talk with the AI “hosts” of the overviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WzzqFW"&gt;When the feature is available to you, you can try it out with new Audio Overviews. (It won’t work with old ones.) Here’s how, &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/google-labs/notebooklm-new-features-december-2024/"&gt;according to a blog post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Xo3rtx"&gt;Create a new Audio Overview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KVWkxE"&gt;Tap the new Interactive mode (BETA) button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ipusmC"&gt;While listening, tap “Join.” A host will call on you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IC7isI"&gt;Ask your question. The hosts will respond with a personalized answer based on your sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGbWlq"&gt;After answering, they’ll resume the original Audio Overview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="32XpIu"&gt;The ability to actually talk with NotebookLM seems like a potentially useful way to learn more about what you’ve collected in the app. But Google cautions that it’s an “experimental feature” and that “hosts may also pause awkwardly before responding or occasionally introduce inaccuracies,” so it may not be a totally polished experience to start. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rcczNm"&gt;In addition to the interactive Audio Overviews, Google is introducing a new interface for NotebookLM that organizes things into three areas: a “sources” panel for your information, a “chat” panel to talk with an AI chatbot about the sources, and a “studio” panel that lets you make things like Audio Overviews and Study Guides. I think it looks nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A GIF showing NotebookLM’s new interface." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9eoQUazpa-jo9hJCpMqHJcTZNg8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25787564/NotebookLM.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TirK79"&gt;Google is announcing a NotebookLM subscription, too: NotebookLM Plus. The subscription will give you “five times more Audio Overviews, notebooks, and sources per notebook,” let you “customize the style and tone of your notebook responses,” let you make shared team notebooks, and will offer “additional privacy and security,” Google says. The subscription is available today for businesses, schools and universities, and organizations and enterprise customers. It will be added to Google One AI Premium in “early 2025.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6e0n6F"&gt;Google is also launching “Agentspace,” a platform for custom AI agents for enterprises. “Agentspace can provide conversational assistance, answer complex questions, make proactive suggestions and take actions based on your company’s unique information,” Google says. It also has connectors for apps like Microsoft SharePoint, Jira, and ServiceNow.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Waymo’s robotaxis pass the first responder test</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Waymo’s robotaxis in San Francisco" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fowi5ZZ4rz3bd2sNpKWOXbOZji4=/204x0:3512x2205/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73784480/1497020128.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YImrW1"&gt;Waymo’s driverless vehicles can detect emergency vehicles, know how to respond to hand signals for traffic cops, and can be disabled manually when something goes wrong, according to an independent review of the company’s first responder protocols. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IVDbwW"&gt;As such, the Alphabet company’s first responder protocols passed an independent review conducted by Tüv Süd, a German tech inspection company. The firm’s assessment found that Waymo’s First Responder Program “meets industry standards” for responding to emergency situations, which is in line with the &lt;a href="https://www.sae.org/standards/content/avsc-i-01-2024/"&gt;best practices&lt;/a&gt; set out in the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5TkwBx"&gt;Waymo — and indeed the entire autonomous vehicle industry — has been under intense scrutiny, especially around how its driverless cars behave around police, fire, and other emergency responders. But Waymo is staking out the position that it goes beyond what’s required to prove that its vehicles are trustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5kqgQD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The firm’s assessment found that Waymo’s First Responder Program “meets industry standards”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IEBPrX"&gt;Case in point: having its first responder protocols scrutinized by an independent group like Tüv Süd. The company has also publicly released its own guide for first responders who are responding to incidents involving autonomous vehicles. &lt;a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/waymo-uploads/files/documents/first-responders/Emergency%20response%20guide%20and%20law%20enforcement%20interaction%20protocol%20.pdf"&gt;The 32-page document&lt;/a&gt; includes a toll free number for getting in touch with remote operators, a visual guide for disabling the vehicle’s autonomous mode, and instructions for how to disconnect the high-voltage battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3QKYka"&gt;Waymo also hosts training sessions for police and fire officials in the cities in which it operates. The company says it has trained 15,000 first responders from over 75 agencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z8UTfQ"&gt;Waymo isn’t the only company to seek Tüv Süd’s stamp of approval. The German firm also &lt;a href="https://ir.aurora.tech/news-events/press-releases/detail/100/first-of-its-kind-independent-audit-recognizes-auroras"&gt;audited Aurora’s safety guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for its self-driving trucks, as well as protocols for &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241008155613/en/Gatik-Paves-the-Way-for-Safe-Driverless-Operations-%E2%80%98Freight-Only%E2%80%99-at-Scale-with-Industry-First-Third-Party-Safety-Assessment-Framework"&gt;autonomous freight company Gatik&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="9Gz22t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The end of Cruise is the beginning of a risky new phase for autonomous vehicles","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24318651/cruise-robotaxi-gm-funding-autonomous-vehicles-risk"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4FL3Bv"&gt;Given some of the history, it’s understandable why Waymo feels it needs to go to such lengths to assure first responders that it's a good actor. In San Francisco last year, city &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/10/23789905/waymo-cruise-sf-cpuc-vote-orange-cone"&gt;officials pleaded with regulators&lt;/a&gt; to reconsider a measure to allow robotaxis to operate 24/7, citing a spate of incidents in which autonomous vehicles have stopped traffic, blocked buses, or obstructed emergency vehicles. And despite Waymo’s efforts to promote itself as a safe operator, these incidents keep happening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LChlfD"&gt;Last July, Phoenix police pulled over a driverless Waymo vehicle that was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/6/24193094/phoenix-waymo-car-pulled-over-traffic-stop-oncoming-lane-police"&gt;driving in the oncoming lane of traffic&lt;/a&gt;. (The company blamed “inconsistent” construction signs.) And in October, a Waymo car ignored police in Austin trying to direct traffic outside a football game. Meanwhile, another Waymo partially blocked an intersection nearby and prevented an escorted bus from passing through, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/local/austin/2024/12/12/cruise-autonomous-vehicle-reports-austin"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. (The company said these were minor occurrences and that its vehicles provide thousands of rides each week in Austin without incident.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MDaBwf"&gt;As Waymo continues to slowly march ahead, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24313346/waymo-miami-robotaxi-moove-2026"&gt;launching in new cities&lt;/a&gt; and taking on new partners, the company is mindful that one bad incident is all it takes for everything to collapse. It happened &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22158745/uber-selling-autonomous-vehicle-business-aurora-innovation"&gt;to Uber&lt;/a&gt; and, more recently, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24318651/cruise-robotaxi-gm-funding-autonomous-vehicles-risk"&gt;to Cruise&lt;/a&gt;. That’s why it needs to take all precautions it can to prove that its vehicles are as safe, if not safer, than human drivers. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA thinks it’s figured out why the Mars helicopter crashed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="NASA’s Ingenuity helicopter on the surface of Mars." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XlLZB9qFMv8yzZ_QhxwDFEVKNyc=/52x0:949x598/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73784452/mars_helicopter.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A color image taken by Perseverance’s Mastcam-Z instrument of NASA’s Ingenuity Mars helicopter in April 2023.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: NASA/JPL-Caltech/ASU/MSSS&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MXZo2P"&gt;Ahead of a full technical report that’s expected to be released in the next few weeks, engineers from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and AeroVironment have &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/missions/mars-2020-perseverance/ingenuity-helicopter/nasa-performs-first-aircraft-accident-investigation-on-another-world/"&gt;revealed what’s believed to be the cause of the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter’s crash&lt;/a&gt; on January 18th, 2024. The craft’s vision navigation system, which was designed to track textured features on the surface of Mars, was confused by a featureless stretch of rippled sandy terrain, resulting in incorrect velocity estimates that led to a hard landing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="77IQof"&gt;Relying on remote data, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/29/23044697/mars-nasa-ingenuity-helicopter-perseverance-space"&gt;including photographs taken after the flight&lt;/a&gt;, the investigators believe that “navigation errors created high horizontal velocities at touchdown,” which most likely resulted in Ingenuity experiencing a “hard impact on the sand ripple’s slope,” causing it to pitch and roll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An illustration that details what NASA believes happened to Ingenuity after its final flight." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0kNRsg8cYpuQMkUWMuZM6sQyN6k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25788347/nasa_landing.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Illustration: NASA/JPL-Caltech&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A graphic shared by NASA depicts what’s thought to be the most likely scenario for Ingenuity Mars Helicopter’s final flight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DMIQ9x"&gt;NASA’s engineers originally assumed that Ingenuity’s spinning rotor blades were damaged after making contact with the surface of Mars during the crash. They now believe they snapped off because “the rapid attitude change resulted in loads on the fast-rotating rotor blades beyond their design limits.” A part of one of the rotor blades was located about 49 feet away from the craft’s final resting place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="F0QfGd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"NASA’s Mars helicopter had a midair brain fart","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/28/22457316/nasa-ingenuity-mars-helicopter-navigation-glitch-sixth-flight"},{"title":"NASA’s Mars Helicopter has made its final flight.","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24051192/nasas-mars-helicopter-has-made-its-final-flight"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2Gxx0Q"&gt;Communications were lost during the crash as a result of excessive vibration in the damaged and unbalanced rotor system that resulted in an excessive power demand. However, despite being permanently grounded, communications were reestablished the next day, and Ingenuity “still beams weather and avionics test data to the Perseverance rover about once a week,” which NASA says “is already proving useful to engineers working on future designs of aircraft and other vehicles for the Red Planet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xpYjqx"&gt;Initially designed to perform only up to five experimental flights over the course of a month on Mars, Ingenuity &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391496/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter-mars-flight-success"&gt;operated for almost three years&lt;/a&gt; and accumulated over two hours of flight time across 72 flights.&lt;/p&gt;

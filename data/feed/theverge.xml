    <title>NZXT’s Flex PC rentals are still ‘misleading’ and ‘predatory,’ claims Gamers Nexus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An image showing an NZXT PC case" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x-EISy8I6PCZZv61JkS2utBEiPs=/0x50:1200x850/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73773207/nzxt_pc_case.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: NZXT&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="w9oTsY"&gt;Gamers Nexus has released a video deconstructing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24313974/nzxt-flex-pc-rental-response"&gt;NZXT’s defense&lt;/a&gt; of its Flex gaming PC purchase and rental program. In it, host Steve Burke says the company is still misleading customers, despite adjustments made in response to his previous video in which he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/1/24310181/nzxt-pc-rental-program-gamers-nexus-investigation"&gt;called the program&lt;/a&gt; “a scam.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VsPU2F"&gt;NZXT &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnzxt.com%2Fnews%2Fnzxt-update-addressing-your-concerns-about-the-flex-subscription-program&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F12%2F7%2F24315781%2Fgamers-nexus-video-reply-nzxt-defense-misleading-customers-flex-pc-rentals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;said in its response&lt;/a&gt; this week that it would clarify details about its Flex program, which Gamers Nexus had criticized for having specs that would change sometimes “day-to-day.” The company has appeared to update specs and performance numbers for its purchase builds. But Gamers Nexus reports it still spotted issues like inconsistent FPS numbers and a FAQ that implied NZXT’s for-sale Player: Three Prime build uses an RTX 4090 graphics card, despite its specs saying otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="764kvl"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DAANNGvMANM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6RNE67"&gt;The FAQ entry Burke mentions seems to be gone now, but as of this writing, there’s still an entry titled “What GPU is right for me?” that lists the RTX 4090 and its benefits. Such inconsistencies are a problem for potential customers, Burke says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="uvebuj"&gt;The fact that NZXT misrepresented its product, even after its statement, as having a 4090 when it still had a 4080 Super ... seemingly indicates that even NZXT can’t keep up with its own specs changes. If NZXT can’t keep up with it ... how are they expecting the customer to keep up with it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="RbGxxd"&gt;Gamers Nexus offers other criticisms of the company’s rental program, from “improper packaging” damage fees with upper bounds that exceed the cost of equivalent non-rental versions of the PCs to the creator-based ad videos that continue to exist, despite the company saying it had “pulled all influencer-led Flex advertising.” NZXT did not immediately respond to our request for comment on the new video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CtBFUW"&gt;Gamers Nexus said Thursday that it’s working on a deeper investigation, and its video today ends with Burke saying he’s received “a number of very concerning tips” from former employees and customers. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Michelle Yeoh’s spy team assembles in Star Trek: Section 31’s official trailer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A screenshot showing Philippa Georgiou in closeup." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SB1msStOisNHOcGj3KkGKwwzP6E=/0x0:1827x1218/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73772987/Screenshot_2024_12_07_at_3.06.55_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Michelle Yeoh as Emperor Philippa Georgiou.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0PFSJh"&gt;There’s a lot of &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Discovery&lt;/em&gt; in the official trailer for the &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Section 31 &lt;/em&gt;movie that Paramount Plus just released — big drama, explosions, and some looming threat that’s “unlike anything that Starfleet’s ever seen.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Q833c"&gt;The trailer shows off a little more of the film, with moody corridors, some sort of electrified space ball, and brief looks at the spaceships that the show will feature. It also devotes more time to characters besides Michelle Yeoh’s Emperor Philippa Georgiou — namely Omari Hardwick’s Alok Sahar and Kacey Rohl’s future Enterprise C captain, Rachel Garrett. It’s still a mystery what trouble Emperor Philippa is leading her team into, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m7LN6b"&gt;Philippa will &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.startrek.com%2Fnews%2Fmeet-the-star-trek-section-31-crew&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F12%2F7%2F24315722%2Fstar-trek-section-31-official-movie-trailer-michelle-yeoh-paramount-plus-streaming" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;work with a team&lt;/a&gt; that also includes a pointy-eared alien named Fuzz (Sven Ruygrok), an empath named Melle (Humberly Gonzalez), the exoskeleton-wearing Zeph (Rob Kazinsky), and a Chameloid shapeshifter named Quasi (Sam Richardson). &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Section 31&lt;/em&gt; starts streaming January 24th on Paramount Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vkz1fi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>X gives Grok a new photorealistic AI image generator</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vector collage of the X logo." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EGTg0RKJEOojFVxKWNnx5veiMOg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73772887/STK160_X_TWITTER__C.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R2gGRd"&gt;X has given Grok a new AI image generator model called “Aurora” that seems to create far more photorealistic imagery than Grok’s other image generator, with similarly few apparent restrictions on what it will produce, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/07/elon-musks-x-gains-a-new-image-generator-aurora/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24314860/x-grok-ai-chatbot-available-all-users"&gt;Like Grok&lt;/a&gt;, anyone can use Aurora. It lives in a new “Grok 2 + Aurora beta” option in the Grok model selector, though you’ll only get a few queries before you hit the X Premium subscription paywall and have to wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F3Rojc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; found that the model, which X employee Chris Park &lt;a href="https://x.com/chrisparkX/status/1865406193776074965"&gt;posted is available&lt;/a&gt; this morning, was willing to create copyrighted characters and public figures, including Mickey Mouse and “a bloodied Donald Trump,” but that it “stopped short of nudes.” Its lack of restrictions isn’t surprising, given &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/14/24220173/xai-grok-image-generator-misinformation-offensive-imges"&gt;our experience&lt;/a&gt; with Grok’s other model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nmm1aJ"&gt;In another example highlighted by &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;, an X user showed off AI-generated images of Ray Romano and Adam Sandler in the X post below — both realistic, but with some very obvious weirdness when it comes to human anatomy and continuity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MrGk2N"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" align="center"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Behold my images using the new Grok &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/grok?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@grok&lt;/a&gt; image generator Aurora:  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Ray Romano and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AdamSandler?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AdamSandler&lt;/a&gt; on a sitcom set &lt;a href="https://t.co/2V491RdjMF"&gt;pic.twitter.com/2V491RdjMF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Matt (@EnsoMatt) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EnsoMatt/status/1865413187740303628?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 7, 2024&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>X helps update Kids Online Safety Act in final push for passage in the Republican-led House</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Graphic photo illustration of Elon Musk and Linda Yaccarino in the negative space around the X logo." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R0Kn885rCeucsVKEC3nkpkOurHg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73772834/236900_Twitter_All_Hands_CVirginia.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo illustration by Cath Virginia / The Verge | Photos by Jerod Harris, Chesnot, Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aVe24N"&gt;With just weeks left to pass legislation before Congress adjourns, X CEO Linda Yaccarino announced she worked with the authors of the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) to &lt;a href="https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/services/files/ED1BAF20-1CE6-40FA-A4B1-3E98F034DD4F"&gt;update the bill&lt;/a&gt; in what seems like a play to win over the Republican House leaders standing in the way of it becoming law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X4UnM5"&gt;The striking announcement is the latest example of how Elon Musk and his companies are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301975/elon-musk-vivek-ramaswamy-doge-plan"&gt;taking on significant roles in influencing government output&lt;/a&gt;. While it’s not unusual for outside stakeholders, including companies, to weigh in on pending legislation, the fact that the bill’s sponsors, Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), announced X’s input indicates they view it as helpful to the bill’s chances of passing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="T6EJ7A"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Congress moves forward on the Kids Online Safety Act","url":"https://www.theverge.com/24205393/kids-online-safety-act-minors-age-verification-kosa"},{"title":"The teens lobbying against the Kids Online Safety Act","url":"https://www.theverge.com/24210795/kosa-kids-online-safety-act-senate-teens-student-lobby"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="b04L8F"&gt;“Led by X, the new changes made to the Kids Online Safety Act strengthen the bill while safeguarding free speech online and ensuring it is not used to stifle expression,” Blumenthal and Blackburn said in a joint statement. “These changes should eliminate once and for all the false narrative that this bill would be weaponized by unelected bureaucrats to censor Americans. We thank Elon and Linda for their bold leadership and commitment to protecting children online and for helping us get this bill across the finish line this Congress.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aw0NzL"&gt;KOSA aims to make the internet safer for kids by imposing a duty of care on tech platforms to prevent and mitigate certain harms when they implement certain design features, including photo filters and infinite scroll. The bill &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/30/24205718/senate-passes-kids-online-safety-act-kosa-content-moderation"&gt;passed overwhelmingly in the Senate&lt;/a&gt; over the summer but has stalled in the House, with the bill’s &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/03/analyzing-kosas-constitutional-problems-depth#:~:text=A%20line%20of%20U.S.%20Supreme,to%20protecting%20children%20online%2C%20however."&gt;critics fearing&lt;/a&gt; it could be weaponized against disliked speech or lead to a more restricted internet due to platforms’ fears of legal risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n0gVPg"&gt;The changes include a clarification that the bill can’t be used to enforce the platforms’ duty of care “based upon the viewpoint of users expressed by or through any speech, expression, or information protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.” It also narrows the duty of care with respect to anxiety and depressive disorders to make it enforceable only when those conditions are “objectively verifiable” and linked to “compulsive usage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DmnjQz"&gt;Yaccarino previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/31/24057514/the-dominoes-are-falling-snap-x-and-microsoft-all-support-kosa"&gt;endorsed the bill on behalf of X earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, while CEOs of companies like Meta and Google have not gone so far, and KOSA supporters &lt;a href="https://issueone.org/articles/as-kosa-prepares-for-senate-floor-big-tech-lobbying-operations-hold-steadfast/"&gt;point to tech lobbying &lt;/a&gt;as a key obstacle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yHNg2r"&gt;But Republican leadership in the House has also become a hurdle for the bill’s passage. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) &lt;a href="https://punchbowl.news/article/policy/johnson-calls-details-of-child-safety-bill-problematic/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Punchbowl News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in October, “I love the principle, but the details of that are very problematic.” He worried about “unintended consequences.” House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA) is viewed as &lt;a href="https://punchbowl.news/article/tech/kosa-proponents-take-advocacy-direct-to-mike-johnson-home-turf/"&gt;potentially even harder to win over&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Punchbowl&lt;/em&gt; reports, and is concerned about the scope of the duty of care in the bill.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Severance’s season 2 trailer teases answers and raises strange new questions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A still photo of Adam Scott in the Apple TV Plus series Severance." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/92ny_7x8JuFeFFX-cNKbzk1ol2I=/725x0:3115x1593/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73772774/Severance_Photo_020104.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Amj0Gf"&gt;We already knew that the tensions and scares were going to ramp up in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/23/24277021/severance-season-2-trailer-apple-tv-plus"&gt;season 2 of &lt;em&gt;Severance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and the latest trailer provides a deeper glimpse into what to expect — along with teasing answers to some important (and weird) questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eGOeUy"&gt;The show follows a megacorporation called Lumon Industries, which utilizes a new procedure called severance that allows workers to spatially split their brains, creating two selves: one who works for Lumon, and another who lives life on the outside. The new clip shows the return of four Lumon employees —  Mark (Adam Scott), Dylan (Zach Cherry), Helly (Britt Lower), and Irving (John Turturro) — who are back in the office after managing to bridge those two different worlds. However, it’s unclear if they’re actually in trouble for their actions; instead, they’ve turned into celebrities of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="YFj9uo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Severance’s first season is a wonderfully tense workplace horror story","url":"https://www.theverge.com/23015650/severance-season-1-review-apple-tv-plus"},{"title":"The weird computers and claustrophobic hallways of Severance","url":"https://www.theverge.com/23013413/severance-apple-tv-plus-production-design-computers"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IID8ic"&gt;That doesn’t mean that the vibes are any less unsettling, though, with the always-intense supervisor Milchick (Tramell Tillman) saying things like, “I’m tightening the leash.” More than anything, the new trailer promises answers to some of &lt;em&gt;Severance&lt;/em&gt;’s strangest questions. There’s the mystery of what actually goes down in Lumon’s basement, which we’re told “will be remembered as one of the greatest moments on this planet” as well as just what the hell is going on with all of the goats. The trailer also introduces an unexpected new question: how could a child be an office manager?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FCQ6Uv"&gt;Clearly, there’s a lot going on in season 2, and it’s not too far off now. The new season of &lt;em&gt;Severance&lt;/em&gt; starts streaming on January 17th. In the meantime, here are some excellent new posters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>Google sues to stop the US from monitoring it like a bank</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Image of two smartphones with hands emergine from them, one holding cash and another holding a credit card." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/haeUAEtMIzi-gINiJyHBBBWWL3c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73772717/STK417_Mobile_Banking_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Hugo Herrera / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f3RIlK"&gt;The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) &lt;a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-orders-federal-supervision-of-google-following-contested-designation/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; on Friday it had placed Google Payment Corp. under federal supervision, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-regulator-places-google-payment-corp-under-supervision-2024-12-06/"&gt;reports &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Google reportedly filed a lawsuit to block the &lt;a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_Publication-Redacted-Decision-and-Order-Designating-Google-Payment-for-Su_6EZQyMz.pdf"&gt;CFPB’s order&lt;/a&gt;, which could result in routine inspections and monitoring like those imposed on banks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vkkF8g"&gt;The agency found that Google’s error resolution and fraud prevention processes pose risks to consumers, citing consumer complaints about Google Pay Balance and Google’s peer-to-peer payments. Those complaints, which Google’s lawsuit claims are “unsubstantiated,” &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/12/06/google-cfpb-supervision-lawsuit/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;include that the company didn’t seem to fully investigate fraudulent charges and didn’t “adequately explain” the results of those investigations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="03sgqb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"CFPB is reportedly trying to put Google under bank-like supervision ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24296500/cfpb-google-federal-supervision"},{"title":"Apple Pay, Cash App, and other digital wallets will be regulated more like banks now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/21/24302322/apple-pay-cash-app-paypal-regulated-banks-cfpb"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7Qe30w"&gt;The CFPB says its finding that Google should be supervised doesn’t mean the company is “guilty of wrongdoing.” It also notes in its order that Google Pay and the P2P platform were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/23/24080605/google-wallet-pay-mobile-payments-credit-cards-keys"&gt;discontinued earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PQ2uzz"&gt;Google spokesperson José Castañeda provided a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="FT7Uv6"&gt;This is a clear case of government overreach involving Google Pay peer-to-peer payments, which never raised risks and is&lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/google-pay/payment-apps-update/"&gt; no longer provided&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S., and we are challenging it in court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="kprqnU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 7th: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statement from Google spokesperson José Castañeda.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite’s new mode is an FPS that’s a lot like Counter-Strike</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Promotional art for Fortnite’s Ballistic mode." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tXyGFdyH6hUTl9IELITQamm6Sa0=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73772352/Fortnite_Ballistic_Key_Art_EN.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4HWbHH"&gt;Epic Games is about to let &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; creators publish experiences with first-person modes, and to help show what’s possible, Epic itself is introducing a tactical FPS shooter that seems like it will play a lot like &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;Valorant.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dgv3Bk"&gt;The new mode, called “Ballistic,” is “an adrenaline-filled, round-based 5v5 competitive game mode where strategy, tactical teamwork, and individual prowess are essential for victory,” &lt;a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-goes-first-person-with-ballistic-a-tactical-5v5-shooter-launching-in-early-access-dec-11"&gt;according to an Epic blog post&lt;/a&gt;. Players will be split into two teams, with one that has to plant the bomb — sorry, I mean the “Rift Point Device” — and another that has to defend against that. Between rounds, you’ll be able to buy gear for the next one. Teams will switch sides after six rounds, and the first to win seven rounds will be crowned the victor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZcHAba"&gt;This isn’t the first time Epic has cribbed a game idea for &lt;em&gt;Fortnite: &lt;/em&gt;its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23993046/fortnite-is-going-full-speed-ahead"&gt;racing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/9/23992574/fortnite-festival-harmonix-guitar-hero-rock-band"&gt;festival&lt;/a&gt; modes both borrow a lot from Psyonix’s &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt; and Harmonix’s &lt;em&gt;Rock Band&lt;/em&gt; (Epic owns both studios), the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23990660/lego-fortnite-release-epic"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lego&lt;/em&gt; survival mode&lt;/a&gt; has a lot of similarities to &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;, and Epic even admitted that the (now-gone) Impostors mode &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722606/epic-games-fortnite-imposters-mode-copy-among-us-credit"&gt;was inspired by &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Heck, the game’s main battle royale mode was actually a spinoff that followed the success of &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m5l2s1"&gt;But now that Epic is trying to make &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; into something more akin to &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; (another inspiration!), where players are encouraged to sample lots of experiences instead of just one, modes like Ballistic and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/21/24183255/its-going-to-be-a-busy-weekend-in-fortnite"&gt;Reload&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;let Epic experiment with different ideas without changing the core battle royale experience. And since your purchased &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; outfits and gear generally work across all of the modes, there’s a financial incentive for Epic to add more experiences, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EdytnF"&gt;Ballistic launches in early access on December 11th. &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; creators will be able to publish their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24258447/fortnite-creators-first-person-shooters-fps-unreal-editor"&gt;own experiences&lt;/a&gt; with first-person modes &lt;a href="https://x.com/FNCreate/status/1864747437384176063"&gt;that same day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tMcSRW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ballistic&lt;/em&gt; is arriving during an already busy time for &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. The game’s Japanese-themed season kicked off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/30/24309607/new-chapter-new-island"&gt;at the beginning of the week&lt;/a&gt;, and on Friday, Epic launched the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24294616/fortnite-og-permanent-december-release-date"&gt;permanent version of its throwback OG mode&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to stop the AI you’re using from training with your data</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vector illustration showing various aspects of using AI." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WxEaZ8QJc3jtazL-WVJS9_NYj_U=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73772320/HT054_AI_general_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uG3ww8"&gt;There’s plenty to consider when it comes to deciding whether you want to engage with the many generative AI bots now available inside our apps. These include the ethics of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23961021/ai-art-copyright-training-ownership-fair-use"&gt;copyright use&lt;/a&gt;, soaring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24211177/ai-climate-crisis-energy-use-microsoft-openai-chatgpt-google-gemini-decoder-podcast"&gt;energy demands&lt;/a&gt;, and the diminishing of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/26/24306575/anthropic-claude-ai-custom-style-presets"&gt;human creativity&lt;/a&gt;, to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FWroI7"&gt;Something else to bear in mind when engaging with these tools is they’re often going to use your flesh-and-blood human inputs to further train their underlying models. While some AI companies &lt;a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5722486-how-your-data-is-used-to-improve-model-performance"&gt;make efforts&lt;/a&gt; to anonymize this data, it’s something you may not feel comfortable with. The good news is, in most cases, you can find a setting to turn the training off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VElfOO"&gt;Disabling AI training isn’t quite the same as wiping your AI chatbot history, though they are linked. Your chats can still be used for training purposes before they’re wiped, and you may well want to keep your chat history in place — but at the same time stop AI companies from using your data for model refinement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m4Yolq"&gt;Here are instructions on how to turn off AI training on several AI or AI-supporting apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MPdFeu"&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/h2&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On ChatGPT, you can refuse to “improve the model for everyone.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

    <title>Google’s AI weather prediction model is pretty darn good</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Two people standing in a street shield themselves from rain and snow with clear umbrellas." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Li_k1ogCzTNOVPLnXwTQbMf5sEM=/1x0:4243x2828/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73772239/1175363196.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;People shelter under umbrellas from the wind and rain as they cross a road near Shinjuku train station on October 12, 2019 in Tokyo, Japan ahead of Typhoon Hagibis’ expected landfal later in the evening. | Photo by Carl Court/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RoT5CZ"&gt;GenCast, a new AI model from Google DeepMind, is accurate enough to compete with traditional weather forecasting. It managed to outperform a leading forecast model when tested on data from 2019, according to recently published research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w58Hg1"&gt;AI isn’t going to replace traditional forecasting anytime soon, but it could add to the arsenal of tools used to predict the weather and warn the public about severe storms. GenCast is one of several AI weather forecasting &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/12/04/1107892/google-deepminds-new-ai-model-is-the-best-yet-at-weather-forecasting/"&gt;models being developed&lt;/a&gt; that might lead to more accurate forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="6kkO30"&gt;&lt;q&gt;GenCast is one of several AI weather forecasting models that might lead to more accurate forecasts&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eNukf7"&gt;“Weather basically touches every aspect of our lives ... it’s also one of the big scientific challenges, predicting the weather,” says Ilan Price, a senior research scientist at DeepMind. “Google DeepMind has a mission to advance AI for the benefit of humanity. And I think this is one important way, one important contribution on that front.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xf2YrS"&gt;Price and his colleagues tested GenCast against the ENS system, one of the world’s top-tier models for forecasting that’s run by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (&lt;a href="https://www.ecmwf.int/"&gt;ECMWF&lt;/a&gt;). GenCast outperformed ENS 97.2...&lt;/p&gt;

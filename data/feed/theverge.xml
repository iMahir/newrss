    <title>Okami is getting a sequel</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The logo for an Okami sequel." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SH2zYbLZoGas6zTpRx873F6V9iA=/254x0:1871x1078/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73783875/Screenshot_2024_12_12_at_10.51.05_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Capcom&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kqhiwT"&gt;Capcom had quite the surprise in store at The Game Awards. The developer announced a sequel to &lt;em&gt;Okami&lt;/em&gt;, a beautiful and beloved action-adventure game that originally launched back in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DrPo9K"&gt;The sequel — which doesn’t currently have a name — was revealed in dramatic fashion with a musical performance. Original director &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/12/23914228/hideki-kamiya-bayonetta-platinum-games-retiring-youtube"&gt;Hideki Kamiya&lt;/a&gt; is returning for the game, which will be developed by his new studio Clovers. It’s still very early though; during the reveal TGA host Geoff Keighley said that “production is about to begin.” Capcom, meanwhile, says only that “a new adventure in the same vein as &lt;em&gt;Okami&lt;/em&gt; has been set in motion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qXmO2l"&gt;Not only has it been quite some time since &lt;em&gt;Okami&lt;/em&gt; debuted, its announcement also comes at a time when Capcom seems intent on doubling down on its biggest franchises. Right now that means a lot of &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt;. Up next is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24167998/monster-hunter-wilds-date-trailer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Wilds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is launching next year, as well as the mobile spinoff &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24294524/monster-hunter-outlanders-mobile-game"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Outlanders&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zJRngv"&gt;However, Okami isn’t the only Capcom franchise being revived: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24320142/onimusha-is-back-and-very-bloody"&gt;the company also revealed a new entry in the action franchise &lt;em&gt;Onimusha&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is launching in 2026. Here’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOiJGLZDnFw"&gt;the very bloody debut trailer &lt;/a&gt;for that.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Borderlands 4’s first trailer is all out war</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The logo for the video game Borderlands 4." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GqECg5hypLONkJHX9vLwKDLEghI=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73783787/borderlands4.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Gearbox Software&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2REkJR"&gt;We already knew it was in the works, and now we have an idea of how it will look and play. At the Game Awards, Gearbox Software revealed the first proper trailer for &lt;em&gt;Borderlands 4&lt;/em&gt;, which is due out in 2025. The trailer starts with a cinematic depicting a large-scale conflict of some sort, before getting into the actual gameplay — which is as colorful and violent as you’d expect from the franchise. The game is playable solo or co-op with up to three other players, and Gearbox says that there are “billions” of weapons to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpNn3m"&gt;Here’s the basic set-up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="1SeAw7"&gt;Break free from the oppressive Timekeeper, a ruthless dictator who dominates the masses from on high. Now a world-altering catastrophe threatens his perfect Order, unleashing mayhem across the planet. Ignite a resistance and blast your way through mechanical monstrosities, bloodthirsty bandits, and vicious beasts. Amass an arsenal of death-dealing firepower to wreak havoc as you tear your way across Kairos. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="yAOHiB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Borderlands 4&lt;/em&gt; was first announced this summer, and will be the first new entry in the looter shooter series since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/14/20803683/borderlands-3-preview-gearbox-interview-social-media-streamers-vlogging"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Borderlands 3&lt;/em&gt; in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. It also follows the franchise’s debut on the big screen, as the &lt;em&gt;Borderlands&lt;/em&gt; movie hit theaters in August to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/30/24232389/borderlands-movie-review-interview-video-on-demand"&gt;less than critical acclaim&lt;/a&gt;. The game is also in development during an interesting time for Gearbox; in March &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/28/24114402/embracer-selling-gearbox-borderlands-developer-take-two"&gt;the studio was sold to Take-Two&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/23/24163110/embracer-laid-off-more-employees-than-riot-games-entire-workforce"&gt;beleaguered publisher Embracer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zvdqcJ"&gt;While &lt;em&gt;Borderlands 4&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t have a specific release date yet, it’s coming to PS5, Xbox, and PC next year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Split Fiction is the next co-op game from Hazelight Studios</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A screenshot from the video game Split Fiction." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Era7CPtpmaE3crTVnWvRj40GT7k=/238x0:1561x882/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73783771/Screenshot_2024_12_12_at_8.43.20_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: EA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vQFJFx"&gt;Josef Fares is back and so &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22826987/josef-fares-hazelight-studios-it-takes-two-game-of-the-year"&gt;is his penchant for cursing&lt;/a&gt;. The director of Hazelight Studios has returned to The Game Awards to debut his next game: &lt;em&gt;Split Fiction&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kx4c8G"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Split Fiction&lt;/em&gt; is a game that feels very much in Hazelight’s wheelhouse. Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22352157/it-takes-two-interview-developer-josef-fares-hazelight-studio-co-op"&gt;&lt;em&gt;It Takes Two&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/22/17151056/a-way-out-coop-multiplayer-review-ps4-xbox-one"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Way Out&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; before it, &lt;em&gt;Split Fiction&lt;/em&gt; is a two-person split-screen co-op game. In it, two game developers have been trapped in a world they created and must play together to escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1hvYQ6"&gt;It’s been a quiet but massively successful handful of years for Hazelight Studios. In 2021, it took home Game of the Year for &lt;em&gt;It Takes Two &lt;/em&gt;in which two players must work together to overcome the myriad dangers of their home (and their failing marriage) &lt;em&gt;Honey, I Shrunk The Kids&lt;/em&gt;-style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Wb0xa"&gt;Earlier this year, the studio announced that &lt;a href="https://x.com/HazelightGames/status/1846588233573937193"&gt;&lt;em&gt;It Takes Two&lt;/em&gt; sold 20 million copies&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/analysis/489856/it-takes-two-sales-20-million"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polygon &lt;/em&gt;did a deep dive into the game’s sales numbers&lt;/a&gt;, determining that it sold at an astonishingly consistent and enviable clip of half a million copies per month since its release in March 2021. A truly remarkable feat given the game had very little marketing outside its initial release window &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;at a time when most consumers’ multiplayer tastes were wrapped up in “forever games” like &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Fortnite. &lt;/em&gt;With bona fides like that, it’s safe to say folks will be looking at &lt;em&gt;Split Fiction, &lt;/em&gt;launching March 6th on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, with great interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LhDioH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FromSoftware debuts a new Elden Ring game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The logo for Elden Ring Nightreign." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ki-mLb0HjJoCXuho6h93Y8RlngY=/246x0:1752x1004/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73783768/Screenshot_2024_12_12_at_8.28.44_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Bandai Namco&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ehi7n6"&gt;FromSoftware, the studio that &lt;a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/elden-ring-director-hidetaka-miyazaki-says-fromsoftware-isnt-really-considering-elden-ring-2-right-now-but-hes-still-not-ruling-out-more-of-the-lands-between-in-the-future/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;just this month&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said it was “not really considering developments such as an &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring 2,&lt;/em&gt;” has revealed a game that looks a lot like it could be &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring 2&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qDG6dP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elden Ring Nightreign&lt;/em&gt; is the next entry in the &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt; series. The trailer, debuting during this year’s The Game Awards, didn’t share much narrative details, but from &lt;a href="https://www.bandainamcoent.com/news/elden-ring-nightreign-announcement"&gt;the game’s official announcement&lt;/a&gt;, it doesn’t seem like game director Hidetaka Miyzaki told a fib. &lt;em&gt;Nightreign&lt;/em&gt; goes in a completely different gameplay direction from the base game and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180536/shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-elden-ring-dlc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shadows of the Erdtree&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; DLC. Described as an action survival game, &lt;em&gt;Nightreign&lt;/em&gt; is a standalone co-op multiplayer game lets up to three players work together to survive a single day in a parallel universe to the Lands Between. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1dWS0x"&gt;Players, called Nightfarers, will have up to eight different characters to choose from each with unique abilities and ultimate attacks. Each day, they have to fight through a battery of monsters to ultimately face off against a tough boss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2xXjIx"&gt;While we don’t yet know when this takes place in Lands Between chronology, the trailer did show off a ton of gameplay. It appears to be similar to &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt; but with a greater emphasis on aggressive, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/21/24079145/while-you-were-studying-the-erdtree-i-studied-the-blade"&gt;flippy-dippy martial arts moves&lt;/a&gt; rather than the slower, more thoughtful combat in &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Erdtree&lt;/em&gt;. The announcement also mentioned a constantly changing map that shrinks with each day along with abilities and gear players can use to customize their characters upon death. Taken all together, it sounds like FromSoftware put a little &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt; chocolate in the &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring &lt;/em&gt;peanut butter with a dash of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; co-op and &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; hero classes for flavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tnYsl1"&gt;FromSoftware has, so far, only confirmed Xbox, PlayStation, and PC platforms and, surprisingly, a release date. &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring Nightreign&lt;/em&gt; will launch sometime next year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s your very first look at The Witcher 4</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A screenshot from the video game The Witcher 4." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R9RLS0JLgIiPOd0DFYb6xvjKecQ=/241x0:1876x1090/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73783757/Screenshot_2024_12_12_at_8.18.04_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="COWD09"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24319637/the-game-awards-2024-trailers-annoucements"&gt;2024 edition of The Game Awards&lt;/a&gt; started with a bang — the very first look at the next &lt;em&gt;Witcher&lt;/em&gt; game. It’s called &lt;em&gt;The Witcher 4&lt;/em&gt; and was revealed via a lengthy cinematic trailer that starred Ciri in place of Geralt, who led the original trilogy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M0QV1C"&gt;There aren’t many details yet, but CD Projekt Red says that in the new game, “Ciri takes center stage as the protagonist, embarking on her own journey to become a professional monster slayer.” It will be a single-player, open-world RPG. The studio says that “the cinematic trailer is pre-rendered in a custom build of Unreal Engine 5 on an unannounced NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPU.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p7kvcz"&gt;It doesn’t sound like the trailer will necessarily be representative of the final game, however. Here’s how CD Projekt Red explains it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="PUgbk5"&gt;In the nearly six-minute trailer, viewers were introduced to Ciri, the adopted daughter of Geralt of Rivia, as she takes on a witcher contract in a remote village that has been terrorized for generations by a fearsome monster demanding human sacrifices. Framed as a short, self-contained &lt;em&gt;Witcher&lt;/em&gt; story, the trailer showcases Ciri’s new abilities and tools, including a chain and advanced magic powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="67qsq6"&gt;At the heart of the trailer is Ciri’s perspective as an outsider to the village. As the villagers say goodbye to one of their own — a young girl they are preparing for a traditional ritual sacrifice — Ciri chooses to intervene. Aiming to slay the beast and save the girl at the same time, Ciri finds herself at odds with the prejudices and superstitions of the people she tries to protect, leading her to confront a painful witcher lesson: that monsters come in all forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="HLD4h6"&gt;We’ve known for some time that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/4/23387206/cyberpunk-witcher-new-games-cd-projekt-red-cdpr-franchise-hadar-multiplayer"&gt;CD Projekt Red was working on a follow up&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/12/23505545/the-witcher-3-next-gen-update-ps5-xbox-pc-hands-on"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is meant to kick off a new saga for the fantasy franchise. In November &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/26/24306590/the-witcher-keeps-on-witching"&gt;the studio revealed&lt;/a&gt; that the game, previously codenamed “Polaris,” was in the “full-scale production phase” of development.” It’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/26/23424463/witcher-remake-cd-projekt-red-unreal-engine-5"&gt;being built using Unreal Engine 5&lt;/a&gt;, which the studio shifted to following the troubled launch of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4MGS9q"&gt;No word yet on platforms or release timing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk is mad at the SEC again</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Photo collage of Elon Musk." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8yMxC9Xy-Sq2xu9lMzwvRxVr8Y8=/20x0:2021x1334/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73783736/STK022_ELON_MUSK_CVIRGINIA_B.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration: Cath Virginia / The Verge; Photo: Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0FpFJc"&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission is preparing “numerous counts” against Elon Musk, according to a letter from his lawyer that &lt;a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1867357433493872874"&gt;Musk posted to X&lt;/a&gt;.  It has also “reopened an investigation into Neuralink.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xsfEIg"&gt;The letter is short on specifics — such as what the charges may be, and how many Musk companies are affected. Instead, Musk’s lawyer, Alex Spiro, complains that “the Commission Staff issued a settlement demand that required Mr. Musk agree within 48 hours to either accept a monetary payment or face charges on numerous accounts.” Even this is somewhat unclear; presumably, Spiro means that Musk would &lt;em&gt;pay&lt;/em&gt; a penalty rather than accept money from the SEC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="v8JDGo"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" align="center"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Oh Gary, how could you do this to me?   &lt;a href="https://t.co/OoooQI77ZS"&gt;pic.twitter.com/OoooQI77ZS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1867357433493872874?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 12, 2024&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WAK4Bw"&gt;Musk has a long and storied history with the SEC, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/14/18139544/elon-musk-60-minutes-tesla-sec-investigation-fine"&gt;he has said he does not respect.&lt;/a&gt; In 2018, Musk &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/7/17661178/tesla-elon-musk-private-420-share-considering"&gt;briefly pretended he’d take Tesla private&lt;/a&gt; before admitting two weeks later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/24/17780714/elon-musk-tesla-staying-public"&gt;Tesla would stay public&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/27/17911428/sec-lawsuit-elon-musk-tesla-funding-tweet"&gt;SEC then sued him over a tweet&lt;/a&gt; saying he had “funding secured” to take Tesla private. Musk reached a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/29/17918252/elon-musk-tesla-sec-securities-fraud-lawsuit-settlement-fine-penalty"&gt;settlement with the agency, &lt;/a&gt;paying $20 million, stepping down as chair of Tesla’s board and agreeing to a “Twitter sitter,” or a lawyer who’d supervise his tweets. Musk then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/18/18271914/sec-elon-musk-contempt-twitter-court-fraud"&gt;reneged on the Twitter sitter thing&lt;/a&gt;. That particular kerfuffle went all the way to the Supreme Court, which declined to hear the case; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/29/24144317/elon-musk-supreme-court-twitter-sitter-sec-tesla"&gt;Musk was stuck with his Twitter sitter.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="33713N"&gt;The letter characterizes this history as “more than six years of harassment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hjzm40"&gt;More recently, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-sec-intends-seek-sanctions-against-elon-musk-twitter-probe-2024-09-20/"&gt;the SEC sought to sanction Musk&lt;/a&gt; for no-showing on them in a separate investigation over his Twitter takeover. A judge declined to sanction him because he reimbursed the SEC for the &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-23/musk-ducks-sanction-for-choosing-rocket-launch-over-sec-meeting?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;airfare of the lawyers he stood up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0T5Lrf"&gt;It is unclear from Spiro’s letter whether the charges the SEC is pursuing have to do with the Twitter matter or something else. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24151881/tesla-justice-investigation-securities-wire-fraud-self-driving"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; previously reported&lt;/a&gt; that the Department of Justice was probing whether Tesla’s self-driving claims were actually securities fraud. In 2023, &lt;em&gt;Reuter&lt;/em&gt;s reported that &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-lawmakers-ask-sec-scrutinize-musk-comments-neuralink-2023-11-22/"&gt;lawmakers had asked the SEC&lt;/a&gt; to probe Neuralink over Musk’s comments about the safety of the company’s brain device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VYk8UI"&gt;Musk also asked his AI, Grok, to draw a picture of SEC chair Gary Gensler. The &lt;a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1867357990140944434"&gt;image depicted a snail&lt;/a&gt; in a business suit, seemingly a reference to Gary the Snail from &lt;em&gt;Spongebob Squarepants&lt;/em&gt;, a television show for children.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia will host its first full LAN party in over a decade, and you’re invited</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Gamevasion” trade fair in Hanover" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nYQnqL6D0985FdgRU32qVigIDG4=/0x0:3804x2536/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73783715/2187892738.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not a photo of an Nvidia LAN, since I can’t find my old photos of them!&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Julian Stratenschulte/picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HK0pDn"&gt;It’s been 13 years since Nvidia hosted &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NVIDIA/search?query=geforce%20lan%206"&gt;its last LAN party&lt;/a&gt;, inviting hundreds of people to physically haul their gaming PCs onto a decommissioned aircraft carrier and jack them in for networked gaming bliss. Now, the GeForce LAN is finally coming back — and you’re theoretically invited, should you manage to reserve one of the 400 available spaces &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fgeforce-lan-50%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F12%2F12%2F24320009%2Fnvidia-lan-party-comeback-2025" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt; on December 16th at 6AM PT / 9AM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dflv9k"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fgeforce-lan-50%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F12%2F12%2F24320009%2Fnvidia-lan-party-comeback-2025" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The GeForce LAN 50&lt;/a&gt; will run January 4th through January 6th, 2025 in Las Vegas, Nevada, with satellite events in Berlin, Taipei, and Beijing, and it promises to be a “online &amp;amp; in-person 50 hour gaming marathon” with contests, tournaments, raffles, and swag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IAbJNY"&gt;It’ll kick off 4:30PM PT on January 4th, and you’ll need to provide a fully refundable $125 deposit to sign up. Nvidia tells me those 400 slots are for everyday gamers, and do not count the influencers who may also show up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="CgXGjk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"This house is made for LAN gaming parties","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/18/24299455/house-lan-gaming-parties-software-engineer-kenton-varda"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vtcjqp"&gt;If you can’t or don’t want to make it, Nvidia says it’ll offer one small set of rewards online — if you stream &lt;em&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Elder Scrolls Online&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fallout 76&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Finals&lt;/em&gt;, or&lt;em&gt; WoW&lt;/em&gt; from its GeForce Now cloud gaming service “continuously for 50 minutes,” there’ll be some kind of in-game reward. Nvidia will also be offering prizes in a marketing celebration &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fgeforce-greats%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F12%2F12%2F24320009%2Fnvidia-lan-party-comeback-2025" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s calling “GeForce Greats”.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jSQkUJ"&gt;The LAN party is happening right before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/7/24264418/nvidia-ces-2025-keynote-rtx-5090-rumors"&gt;Nvidia’s CES 2025 keynote in Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt;, where we’re expecting the company to announce the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24266052/nvidia-rtx-5070-ces-rumor-specs"&gt;RTX 5090, RTX 5080, and possibly the RTX 5070&lt;/a&gt; as well, and the fact that this is the “GeForce LAN 50” is probably a tease for those 50-series cards — the last LAN that Nvidia hosted was the “GeForce LAN 6,” not “GeForce LAN 49” or anything like that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WlEQCg"&gt;Starting in 2004, the GPU company began to host major LAN parties almost every year until it stopped in 2011. Here’s one of my minor claims to nerd fame: I helped set &lt;a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/69990/lan-party-at-nvision-08-sets-world-record"&gt;a Guinness World Record for the largest, longest LAN party&lt;/a&gt; at one in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WbkPkq_VTF32dOaMYlj0UQ36dZE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25787830/guinness_world_record_sean_hollister_nvision_08_gareth.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sean Hollister&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Record scratch, freeze frame, yep that’s me (on the left)...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AoiC44"&gt;That Nvidia LAN wasn’t held on an aircraft carrier, but rather the San Jose Convention Center, as part an event that Nvidia called “NVISION 08.” The company never held another NVISION, but it rebooted its event the very next year, at the very same location, as the GPU Technology Conference (GTC). &lt;a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/19/~/getting-nvidia-to-sponsor-a-lan-party%2Fevent"&gt;There was a time&lt;/a&gt; Nvidia would sponsor third-party LANs as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PoP1FF"&gt;Apparently Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has a soft spot for LANs, making &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/18e879x/mr_jensen_huang_came_to_a_nvidia_lan_party_in/"&gt;a surprise visit to a small one&lt;/a&gt; in Vietnam last year. While gamers have largely moved online for multiplayer games, the LAN party subculture has been getting a bit of nostalgic attention as of late — there’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LAN-Party-Inside-Multiplayer-Revolution/dp/0500026955?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;even a coffee table book now&lt;/a&gt; documenting the era.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Game Awards 2024: all of the biggest trailers and announcements </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Graphic of The Game Awards trophy, a winged woman stretching her wings behind her head against a black and gold background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i7azJIhdO47GmZ7OmfApWf7Iyr0=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73783618/gamawards.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: The Game Awards&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Geoff Keighley’s enormous and expensive video game commercial show celebrates its tenth anniversary this year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="Tw0mGo"&gt;It’s that time of the year. The Game Awards 2024 starts December 12th at 7:30 PM ET / 4:30 PM PT on Twitch and YouTube. This year marks the awards’ tenth anniversary so expect some big surprises to celebrate the occasion. We already know &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224587/borderlands-4-2025-gearbox-studios"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Borderlands 4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will make an appearance &lt;a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1866536140876009476"&gt;as well as the next game from Hazelight Studios&lt;/a&gt;, the developers behind Game of the Year 2021&lt;em&gt; It Takes Two&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GEKHxR"&gt;Keighley’s BFF Hideo Kojima will probably show up to show off more of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/8/23498369/death-stranding-2-kojima-game-awards-ps5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Death Stranding 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or maybe even his &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23993035/hideo-kojima-od-xbox"&gt;new game / movie hybrid project &lt;em&gt;OD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And with 2025 mere weeks away, the &lt;em&gt;GTA VI &lt;/em&gt;hype season will officially start, likely with a new, potentially record busting trailer. Here are all the news, trailers, and surprises for this years Game Awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jHP8Le"&gt;As for me, the only thing I’m excited about for TGAs 2024 is the possibility of Flute Guy and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24268103/metaphor-refantazio-review-atlus-xbox-persona"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metaphor: ReFantanzio&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Monk Guy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/18/24299700/flute-guy-japanese-monk-chant-guy-musical-nirvana"&gt;sharing the same stage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="H5TP4a"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LfnUQ-qKsdQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

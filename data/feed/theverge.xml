  &lt;p id="u9iLkd"&gt;Amazon is continuing many of its best headphone and earbud discounts on the second day of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/24262468/amazon-prime-day-best-deals-sales-tech-gadgets-october-2024"&gt;October Prime Day&lt;/a&gt; sale. If you want to get a jump on your holiday shopping — or just treat yourself to a new upgrade — this is a great opportunity to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5iYlsn"&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro, which are about to receive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24241960/apple-airpods-pro-2-otc-hearing-aid-health-industry"&gt;significant hearing health features&lt;/a&gt;, can be had at a great price, but there are also excellent options from Sony, Bose, Samsung (like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24265270/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review"&gt;Buds 3 Pro I just reviewed&lt;/a&gt;), Sennheiser, and other mainstays in this category.

    <title>Here are my picks for the best Prime Day deals on robot vacuums and mops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YJYIFmFY94lZ6NqzU3xJGHZvTLk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73642465/226425_Roomba_Combo_Review_JTuohy_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The excellent Roomba j7 is down to $400 this Prime Day.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="42Rpum"&gt;Robot vacuums are some of the most useful smart home gadgets you can buy. Small, circular home helpers that clean areas you can’t reach and work hard so you don’t have to, these little suckers are life-changing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HKvIYa"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s resident robot vacuum expert, I’ve tested dozens of different models over the last five years and have always highly recommended only buying robot vacuums when they’re on sale. This is because: (a) they’re expensive, and (b) they're almost &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; on sale — if not today, then likely tomorrow. And today, the last day of the October Prime Day event, is a very good day to pick one up. There are some excellent deals to be had — over 50 percent off in some cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AZDwKk"&gt;Here are my picks based on price and prowess:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

    <title>Wimbledon is Wimble-done with line judges</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Spain’s Rafael Nadal reacts as the scoreboard shows the result of a hawk-eye challenge during a point against Russia’s Karen Khachanov during their men’s singles third round match on the fifth day of the 2017 Wimbledon Championships at The All England Lawn Tennis Club in Wimbledon, southwest London, on July 7, 2017" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vb9ojEx4tcOZELzM5t-PX7-8ByA=/30x0:3018x1992/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73642428/810307074.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CEu6YH"&gt;The Wimbledon Championships, the most prestigious of professional tennis events, declared it would no longer use human line judges at next year’s tournament. In 2025, the London event will use an electronic line-calling system (ELC) instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mzw297"&gt;First reported in &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/sport/tennis/article/wimbledon-ditches-line-judges-after-147-years-cn87skddm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Times&lt;/em&gt; of London&lt;/a&gt;, the announcement marks a radical change to a 147-year-old tradition, albeit one that’s on trend with the sport’s broad shift toward technology-assisted officiating. In 2023, &lt;a href="https://www.atptour.com/en/news/electronic-line-calling-release-april-2023"&gt;the Association of Tennis Professionals announced&lt;/a&gt; all of its events would move toward automating line calls, and two of the four Slams have already incorporated it. With Wimbledon going with ELC, the last holdout is the French Open.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo’s original alarm clock prototypes were a lot less playful</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mo903q"&gt;Nintendo just announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24265984/nintendo-alarmo-alarm-clock-date-price"&gt;its new Alarmo clock&lt;/a&gt; with a motion sensor, and even though we’re still soaking in the $100 device, the company also shared a look at some interesting early prototypes that reveal how the project changed during its development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fhAiSM"&gt;While the Alarmo is round and an eye-catching red, one “early” prototype Nintendo showed in an “Ask the Developer” interview had a more boxy shape and came in gray. This prototype did have an interesting feature in its dot matrix LED display (similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/24/24205675/amazon-discontinue-echo-dot-with-clock"&gt;now-discontinued Echo Dot with Clock&lt;/a&gt;), but Nintendo ultimately went in a different direction because “we felt that this display system wouldn’t be able to communicate the instructions sufficiently,” says Nintendo’s Yosuke Tamori, who...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best October Prime Day deals you can still get for under $100</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A photo of Amazon’s Fire TV Cube on a TV stand." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YfCJNseL5OtbNmJvj_aYRqXzKzU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73639450/DSCF0211.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The latest Fire TV Cube remains Amazon’s best streaming device — and it’s still available for $99.99 ($40 off).&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qMCxQH"&gt;If you’re looking to maximize your budget and score a bigger haul for your money during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24255302/amazon-prime-day-deals-tips-news-guide-2024-october"&gt;October’s Amazon Prime Day sale&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll be happy to know that there are many great deals you can find on tech and other gear for well under $100. Some of the inexpensive gadgets we like under that threshold are discounted even further, while others normally in the triple digits have snuck into double-digit territory, some for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="RyM2kb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Our favorite deals under $50 from Amazon’s October Prime Day sale","url":"https://www.theverge.com/24262440/amazon-prime-day-best-cheap-tech-deals-under-50-october-2024"},{"title":"The best Prime Day deals you can get on some of our favorite gadgets","url":"https://www.theverge.com/24265074/amazon-prime-day-best-deals-sale-tech-staff-picks-favorites-october-2024"},{"title":"The best deals you can grab on day two of Amazon’s October Prime Day sale","url":"https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/24262468/amazon-prime-day-best-deals-sales-tech-gadgets-october-2024"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cjgROg"&gt;Right now, for example, you can find great prices on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-fire-tv-cube-4k-streaming-device/dp/B09BZZ3MM7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon’s newest Fire TV Cube&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08D9N7RJ4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Philips Hue RGB smart bulbs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFXQMZJT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker’s MagGo 3-in-1 charging stand&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>You can add wireless controller support to the NES through its unused expansion port</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An early version of the NES Hub in front of a European version of the NES console." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o38QBd0bG_k8wrtGezSdAce_8AM=/0x0:1930x1287/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73642279/nes3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The NES Hub is compatible with NES consoles featuring the same design as the North American model.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: X&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iCcsOZ"&gt;RetroTime has found a good use for the expansion port Nintendo included on the underside of the NES but never utilized. Its NES Hub connects to that port and adds Bluetooth connectivity, allowing up to four wireless controllers to be connected to the almost 40-year-old console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yVHQHH"&gt;The NES Hub is currently &lt;a href="https://8bitmods.com/retrotime-nes-hub-bluetooth-for-nes/"&gt;available for preorder through 8BitMods&lt;/a&gt; for $57.28 and is expected to ship as early as December 2024. Installation doesn’t require any soldering, hardware modifications, or for the NES to even be opened. The NES Hub simply snaps into the expansion port and is designed to perfectly sit hidden inside the cutouts under the console. The most complicated part of the installation is connecting a small Bluetooth antenna and sticking it to the...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="6SIrOL"&gt;It’s now the second day of Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24255302/amazon-prime-day-deals-tips-news-guide-2024-october"&gt;October Prime Day event&lt;/a&gt;, and since the company is still pushing a lot of interesting deals, we looked through some of our recent “favorites” articles to find discounts on a lot of the devices we like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SeruAu"&gt;What are the “favorites” articles? Well, every month or so, we like to ask our staff &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22344288/favorite-gadgets-tech-lgear-aptops-headphones-kitchen-recommendations"&gt;about their favorite stuff&lt;/a&gt; — whether it’s board games, smart tech, or kitchen gadgets. And the results are usually quirky, personal, and a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Cl5ECB"&gt;So, we thought we’d list a few in case you have read about them in the past and thought, well, that sort of sounds good, but it’s a bit pricey. (Or — that’s pretty cheap, but maybe I’ll wait until the price goes down even more...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2O3Ixo"&gt;What follows are some of our staff’s...&lt;/p&gt;

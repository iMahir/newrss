    <title>Now you can visit Roku City in 1080p</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A marketing image of Roku City." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rt8JDH4STFcafuEfO2r6vjdULK8=/73x0:864x527/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73781008/image001.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sBXNir"&gt;Roku City, the purple-tinted cityscape screensaver that debuted in 2018, might look a little sharper and more detailed the next time you see it scrolling by. This week, Roku is increasing the screensaver’s resolution to 1080p; it was still stuck at 720p until now — despite running on millions of 4K Roku TVs and 4K-capable streaming players. That’s blasphemous, if you ask me, so it’s nice to see some progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WwuVIw"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/02/style/roku-city-screensaver.html"&gt;surprisingly popular&lt;/a&gt;, fictional skyline is also being updated with an “expanded color palette” and more activity and Easter eggs that you’ll spot if looking closely. Apparently there’s a train station in there somewhere, so the denizens of Roku City have gained a mass transit system. Billboards “will now feature a new star button that allows viewers to learn about things like original Roku content, Roku Zones, and more.” (If I had to guess, the “more” at the end there is probably referring to ads and sponsored content.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bvtz13"&gt;It took six years for us to reach full HD. So if this cadence stays on track, maybe we’ll all be experiencing Roku City in native 4K by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The tundra keeps burning and it’s transforming the Arctic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="fire stock illustrations" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2YHMqUg-dputeuQl31EZ0gO3fJE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73781006/acastro_171017_1777_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OsliLL"&gt;For millennia, the Arctic tundra has helped stabilize global temperatures by storing carbon in the frozen ground. Wildfires have changed that, according to the latest &lt;a href="https://arctic.noaa.gov/report-card/report-card-2024/"&gt;Arctic Report Card&lt;/a&gt; released yesterday at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AkUrs5"&gt;Fires, intensified by climate change, release carbon trapped in soil and plants. More frequent infernos have now transformed the tundra into a net source of carbon dioxide emissions. It’s a dramatic shift for the Arctic, and one that will make the planet even hotter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nbqsq4"&gt;“Climate change is not bringing about a new normal. Instead, climate change is bringing ongoing and rapid change,” Twila Moon, lead editor of the Arctic Report Card and deputy lead scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MOI9JE5ZPI"&gt;said at the conference&lt;/a&gt; yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="UO57iZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Climate change is not bringing about a new normal.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wpVpZ0"&gt;The Arctic’s permafrost, which stays frozen year-round, has kept planet-heating carbon sequestered for thousands of years. Northern permafrost has been estimated to hold about &lt;a href="https://arctic.noaa.gov/report-card/report-card-2019/permafrost-and-the-global-carbon-cycle/"&gt;twice as much carbon&lt;/a&gt; as there is in the atmosphere. Tundra describes the Arctic’s tree-less plains, where shrubs, grasses, and mosses grow and &lt;a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/CarbonCycle"&gt;take in carbon dioxide through...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Krispy Kreme got cyberattacked</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="donuts on conveyer belt getting iced" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HoThyk9zbUOadElsSO1MWPIcQ7s=/0x65:1907x1336/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73780938/glazer_tall2_Ashna.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Krispy Kreme&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BKDb7z"&gt;Krispy Kreme is currently dealing with a cybersecurity breach that has brought down parts of its online donut ordering service in the US. The company has been working to resolve the issue for over a week now after detecting unauthorized access to its systems on November 29th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W4u3KO"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1857154/000185715424000123/dnut-20241211.htm"&gt;filing&lt;/a&gt; issued to the SEC on Wednesday, Krispy Kreme says it was “notified regarding unauthorized activity on a portion of its information technology systems” and pulled in “leading cybersecurity experts” for remediation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nLiJ5a"&gt;The event took down Krispy Kreme’s consumer online ordering operations but it has not affected its commercial distribution business. However, the company says there’s “a material impact” on its business operations and that there will be significant financial implications stemming from the incident due to cybersecurity experts’ and advisers’ fees. Otherwise, Krispy Kreme says it has cybersecurity insurance and it does not expect “long-term material impact on its results of operations and financial condition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="22oCvH"&gt;Krispy Kreme did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the cause of the cybersecurity incident. As speculated in a report by &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/krispy-kreme-cyberattack-impacts-online-orders-and-operations/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the timeline may suggest the company is negotiating with possible threat actors so as not to leak internal data.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Vision Pro’s ultrawide Mac display is very close to being a killer app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Screenshot of the ultrawide virtual display in one of the Vision Pro’s immersive environments." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x7ryAV1QTDdWWFJqeDV9gBGlOT0=/92x0:1357x843/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73780924/IMG_0314.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;My &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.mattvince.com/product/zelda-windwaker-dynamic-wallpaper-mac-osx/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;favorite dynamic wallpaper&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; floating in the desert.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: Mac Virtual Display&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TqsJ9J"&gt;Since its release, I’ve mostly used Apple’s Vision Pro like a movie theater. The VR headset is an amazing way to watch &lt;em&gt;Dune &lt;/em&gt;— but beyond that, it hasn’t really &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24054862/apple-vision-pro-review-vr-ar-headset-features-price"&gt;lived up to its potential&lt;/a&gt; as a general-purpose computing device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="43k320"&gt;Today, that’s finally starting to change. With the u&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24317119/ios-18-2-apple-intelligence-chatgpt-genmoji"&gt;pdate to visionOS 2.2&lt;/a&gt;, Apple is seriously upgrading the headset’s ability to work with a Mac. It’s probably the closest thing the Vision Pro has to a killer app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ZsRCM"&gt;The Vision Pro has been able to mirror the screen of a Mac since day one, but I found the original Mac Virtual Display feature limiting. Text was sharp at low resolutions, but the screen was cramped. I could get more space at higher resolutions, but the text was too small and blurry to read. Yes, I can blow it up to the size of a bus to make things readable, except then, I’m craning my head around way too much to see everything. My normal three-monitor setup lets me see the most important stuff with slight movements, but that just hasn’t been possible before now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot showing Standard, Wide, and Ultrawide options for the Mac Virtual Display." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RNTYLO-h2Eur3BmNPgdGO74rB0k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25772222/IMG_0311.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Mac Virtual Display options&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vision Pro now has three Mac Virtual Display options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OcaIPH"&gt;In visionOS 2.2, the standard Mac display is now curved, and it seems sharper. It’s not Retina-sharp at the highest resolutions, but I no longer have to make it gigantic to get legible text. The default virtual display becomes one of three options — Standard, Wide, and Ultrawide — once your Mac is updated to macOS 15.2, which lets it take over foveated rendering from the Vision Pro. Those two extra modes instantly made the virtual display viable for me, giving me the space I’m accustomed to in my three-monitor life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BeuB70"&gt;You can crank the resolution in Ultrawide all the way up to 10240 x 2880 if you’d like, but the sweet spot for me has been the Wide display’s maximum 6720 x 2880 resolution, which lets me see everything I need to without constantly rotating my Vision Pro-laden head. It ends up feeling more like a real monitor and not some fantasy display that evokes Weird Al Yankovic’s song “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbDostWXpcU"&gt;Frank’s 2000” TV&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Animated GIF panning from the left side of the Ultrawide display to the right of it." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JJcd7YnRIgPAptf9__dk5nTUoZc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25772218/Ultrawide_display.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Mac Virtual Display in Ultrawide&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;So much room for activities!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="L2St5c"&gt;This has made it much easier for me to relocate to another room in my house, or even outside if I wanted. I wouldn’t take it to a coffee shop for a number of reasons (do I leave it behind when I go to the restroom or wear the Vision Pro in there like a maniac?), but I’d absolutely bring it on a work trip. Apple has also made it so that the audio is sent through the headset instead of your computer’s speakers, as it did before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QaKlYe"&gt;The widescreen options came in handy recently, when I strained my back in a way that made it painful to sit upright. I hate doing work on a laptop, but reclining in bed with the Vision Pro on was suddenly a real option for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E2zRXg"&gt;There are quirks, though. Switching between the display modes can be sluggish, and your Mac doesn’t always remember what resolution you set, so if you switch from Wide to Ultrawide and back, you might find all your windows piled on top of each other. And the Keyboard Awareness feature, which shows your keyboard even if you have one of Apple’s immersive environments fully turned on, works great with my Magic Keyboard but doesn’t reliably show the mechanical one I prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="4YVKrW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Comfort isn’t just a Vision Pro problem — it’s a wearable one","url":"https://www.theverge.com/24078522/apple-vision-pro-wearables-comfort"},{"title":"With visionOS 2, Apple’s Vision Pro comes into focus","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/18/24246461/apple-visionos-2-vision-pro-impressions-features-virtual-reality"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7HQIro"&gt;Still, those are minor issues. The expanded virtual display is a critical upgrade, and if it’s not in killer app territory, it’s at least right next door to it. It still doesn’t help the Vision Pro with its biggest issues, like that our bodies are all different and not everyone will find it comfortable to use for long stretches of time. And it doesn’t make Apple’s headset any less expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MqZgRX"&gt;But it does help that my Vision Pro is now more than a personal movie theater. Now, it’s a gigantic, high-res curved display with perfect viewing angles, too. That makes the price feel a little closer to right.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook, Instagram, and Threads are down</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xCthAv"&gt;A bunch of Meta apps are down right now. For many staffers at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, apps like Facebook and Instagram haven’t been loading or, when they do, show older posts. Threads seems to be recovering, though it sometimes is loading slowly for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="id__q95r8croxy9"&gt;“We’re aware that a technical issue is impacting some users’ ability to access our apps,” &lt;a href="https://x.com/Meta/status/1866918000374280593"&gt;Meta says on X&lt;/a&gt;. “We’re working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible and apologize for any inconvenience.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J01Ud0"&gt;Downdetector is showing big and sudden spikes for Facebook, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram, indicating &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of people have been affected by the outages. The &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/instagram/"&gt;Instagram Downdetector&lt;/a&gt; page, for example, shows a peak of more than 70,000 reports of issues with the platform. The Facebook peak &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/facebook/"&gt;exceeded 100,000&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GXSF8L"&gt;This big outage follows another large Meta outage &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/5/24091207/meta-outage-facebook-instagram-threads-down-signed-out"&gt;from March&lt;/a&gt; that took down Facebook, Instagram, and Threads. Meta also saw a major outage affecting Instagram and Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/28/23428969/instagram-facebook-not-loading-refresh-outage"&gt;in October 2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Homey adds new energy management features and a dongle</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wkkRi-tE4I1gbEtVAHaSBuMBI-o=/0x160:3840x2720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73780832/Homey_Bridge___Homey_Pro___Mobile_App___Web_App.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Homey smart home platform, which works with the Homey Pro or Homey Bridge hubs, has launched a Home Energy Dongle and energy management tab for its app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ntRUff"&gt;Smart home company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24087882/smart-home-hub-apple-google-alexa#:~:text=other%20platforms%2C%20too).-,Homey%20Pro,-The%20Homey%20Pro"&gt;Homey&lt;/a&gt; has added a new &lt;a href="https://homey.app/en-us/news/introducing-the-homey-energy-dongle/?draft"&gt;energy management tab&lt;/a&gt; to its app to track and monitor energy use from compatible smart devices such as plugs, appliances, thermostats, and EV chargers. This week, the company also announced the &lt;a href="https://homey.app/en-us/news/introducing-the-homey-energy-dongle"&gt;Homey Energy Dongle&lt;/a&gt; for Europe, which can connect directly to a smart meter to monitor a home’s energy consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="foZCHS"&gt;Together, the software and hardware are a big step toward a full &lt;a href="https://www.gridx.ai/knowledge/home-energy-management-system-hems"&gt;home energy management system&lt;/a&gt;. Homey says it plans to bring support for &lt;a href="https://homey.app/en-us/news/introducing-the-homey-energy-dongle/?draft#:~:text=Once%20dynamic%20tariffs,at%20their%20lowest."&gt;automatic dynamic energy pricing&lt;/a&gt; next year, so users could set up automations to do things like charge their EV when electricity prices are low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EZBCpe"&gt;The new energy management tab is available in public beta to all &lt;a href="https://homey.app/en-us/homey-pro/"&gt;Homey Pro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://homey.app/en-us/homey/"&gt;Homey Cloud&lt;/a&gt; customers, and the &lt;a href="https://homey.app/homey-energy-dongle/"&gt;dongle can be preordered&lt;/a&gt; for €39 if you’re in the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Lithuania, Austria, Switzerland, and Hungary, with shipping expected in March 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Homey&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Homey Energy Dongle works with European smart meters and uses the P1 standard to monitor electricity and gas usage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6XKzgK"&gt;Homey is a smart home platform centered around a smart home hub, either the powerful, locally based &lt;a href="https://homey.app/en-us/homey-pro/"&gt;Homey Pro ($399)&lt;/a&gt; or the lighter &lt;a href="https://homey.app/en-us/homey-bridge/"&gt;Homey Bridge ($69)&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on which hub you have, Homey can connect to and control a &lt;a href="https://homey.app/en-us/apps/homey-pro/"&gt;wide range of smart home devices&lt;/a&gt; thanks to radios for Zigbee, Z-Wave, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Thread, IR, and more; there’s also the option of cloud-based connections and compatibility with other bridges, such as Philips Hue. Homey also supports the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23568091/matter-compatible-devices-accessories-apple-amazon-google-samsung"&gt;Matter smart home standard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9EvJOt"&gt;“The Energy Management functionality works with all devices connected to a Homey setup, no matter if they use a proprietary local/cloud API, Zigbee, Z-Wave or Matter to connect to Homey,” explained Homey commercial director Stefan Witkamp in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. A full list of &lt;a href="https://homey.app/en-us/apps/browse/#filter?category=energy&amp;amp;platform=local"&gt;currently compatible devices&lt;/a&gt; is on Homey’s website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n7GpraN_sviMba6gR8YhZnkHF0M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25785054/Mobile_App___Energy__Dark_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Homey&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new energy management tab in Homey can track energy usage across connected devices in your home. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5zZrgA"&gt;The energy tab uses charts to show a home’s live electricity, gas, and water usage (with compatible hardware) and can provide historical data. Homey says it “can also track solar generation, monitor EV charging, and show energy supply to, or consumption from, the grid.” It’s compatible with smart batteries and can show a list of your top energy consumers, helpful for figuring out where to cut down on usage. You can enter your energy price to get cost estimates, and Homey says it plans to add support for dynamic pricing next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IWDwi2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/3/24191422/lg-homey-athom-acquisition-samsung-smartthings"&gt;LG acquired Homey&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year and has said it plans to incorporate Homey’s connectivity and software &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/16/24243056/lg-thinq-smart-home-platform-thinq-on-hub"&gt;into its ThinQ platform&lt;/a&gt;. However, Homey will continue to operate independently. While LG plans to integrate its appliances with Homey, official support is still on the roadmap, says Witkamp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xrR0OR"&gt;Energy management is set to play a key part in the smart home as a compelling reason to connect all your devices. Allowing a system to automate energy use in your home could save you energy and money. Several smart home companies already offer some functionality here. Samsung’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fhome-appliances%2Fsmartthings%2Fenergy%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F12%2F11%2F24318680%2Fhomey-lg-smart-home-energy-management-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SmartThings Energy&lt;/a&gt; platform, which works with its appliances and several partner devices, was the first platform to be recognized by the Environmental Protection Agency as an &lt;a href="https://www.energystar.gov/products/recent_program_updates/samsungs-smart-home-energy-service-earns-energy-star"&gt;Energy STAR Smart Home Energy Management System&lt;/a&gt;. Others, such as Home Assistant, offer some energy management features, and Apple introduced an electricity usage page to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/10/24172054/apple-home-homekit-robot-vacuum-support-smart-locks-wwdc24#:~:text=A%20new%20electricity%20usage%20page%20in%20the%20Home%20app%E2%80%99s%20Energy%20section%20will%20show%20your%20electricity%20usage%20through%20a%20connection%20to%20your%20utility.%20It%20will%20launch%20with%20a%20partnership%20with%20PG%26E%20in%20California%20but%20hopefully%20expand%20to%20more%20utilities%20in%20the%20future."&gt;its Home app this year&lt;/a&gt; (although it’s limited to PG&amp;amp;E customers). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uMBjBp"&gt;The new Matter smart home standard just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/7/24289972/matter-smart-home-standard-1-4-spec-new-features-device-types"&gt;added energy management&lt;/a&gt; to its spec along with support for several key devices in the space — electrical vehicle supply equipment, solar panel inverters, home batteries, and more. All of this shows significant momentum in home energy management, and Homey’s latest move is another option for people looking to use smart home tech to maximize the efficiency of their energy use and minimize their costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uT4Fud"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft starts testing iPhone file sharing for Windows PCs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Illustration of Microsoft’s Windows logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4X1Fi6270URCT93DSB-O1-BX-W0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73780827/acastro_STK109_microsoft_02.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n7KlcW"&gt;Microsoft has started testing some improvements to its Phone Link app for iPhone users. Windows Insiders &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/12/11/sharing-files-between-your-iphone-and-windows-pc-rolling-out-to-windows-insiders/"&gt;can now try out&lt;/a&gt; a new way to share a file from an iPhone to a PC and vice versa, making the experience a little more like file sharing with an Android device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o1O1kK"&gt;Windows Insiders can download the latest Phone Link app update, version 1.24112.89.0 or higher, and it will include a new setup dialog to enable sharing files between iPhones and PCs. The sharing works by using the share sheet on iOS to send files to the “Link to Windows” app, which then lets you select a Windows device to share the file with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DRVGJk"&gt;On a Windows PC you can also share local files by right clicking on a file and selecting share and then “my phone” to get a file from your PC to your iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N91ZmZCRtkBXb8v6iFic9cChDp0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25785677/phone_link_ios_setup.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new file sharing dialog for iPhone users.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7TWGot"&gt;Microsoft has been gradually improving its Phone Link app for both iOS and Android in recent years, but the iOS version is still very limited thanks to Apple’s OS restrictions. Last year Microsoft did manage to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/24/23654672/microsoft-phone-link-hands-on-imessage-ios"&gt;update Phone Link&lt;/a&gt; with the ability to send and receive messages via iMessage. Even this integration is limited though, only supporting sending and receiving messages to single contacts and not groups (via iMessage).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="naTaW6"&gt;You still can’t use the Phone Link app to mirror phone apps onto your PC like you can with Android, and you have to have the app open for messages to be sent over iMessage as Microsoft is using a Bluetooth and system notifications workaround to read send messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ys9aP7"&gt;The latest file sharing update is live now for Windows Insiders and should start rolling out to all Phone Link users in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox tests streaming your Xbox games to your Xbox</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vector collage of the Xbox logo." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tciD1LrGlvCbeHk4TumOKz9z6Oo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73780825/STK048_XBOX2__A.5.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dtLomd"&gt;Microsoft is going to let Xbox Insiders who also subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate test the ability to stream some Xbox games they already own to their Xbox &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/12/11/xbox-insiders-with-game-pass-ultimate-stream-your-own-game-on-xbox-consoles/"&gt;starting today&lt;/a&gt;. The feature could be useful if you want to jump into a game without having to install the whole thing; given how big game file sizes can be nowadays, streaming a game via the cloud might be a faster way to play or save you from hitting a data cap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XMGHfs"&gt;Microsoft has published a list of games that support the feature &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fplay%2Fgallery%2Fbuy-and-stream&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F12%2F11%2F24318876%2Fxbox-tests-streaming-games-console" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on its website&lt;/a&gt;. There are some great games on the list, including &lt;em&gt;Animal Well&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Balatro&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Baldur’s Gate 3&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Price of Persia: The Lost Crown&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tSZbUv"&gt;You’ll be able to stream games on Xbox Series X / S and Xbox One consoles, Microsoft says, and the feature is set to come out of testing next year. The company started letting Xbox players stream select games they own on TVs and browsers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24300547/xbox-cloud-gaming-game-library-streaming"&gt;last month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia must face lawsuit alleging it downplayed crypto’s impact on its success</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vector collage of the Ndivia logo." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/InG0tLEXBKKQruT0YdkEttVI1kQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73780803/STK083_NVIDIA_A.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Cath Virginia / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CXHTYE"&gt;Nvidia must face an investor lawsuit claiming it misled shareholders about the impact of the cryptocurrency market on its sales after the Supreme Court dismissed the company’s appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bgb7oI"&gt;The court said it had “improvidently granted” Nvidia’s petition, meaning it decided it shouldn’t have taken it up in the first place. That means the case will have to continue on in the lower courts. During oral arguments last month, some justices seemed skeptical about whether it was appropriate for them to weigh in on the case, wondering if it was more of a dispute over facts than a legal question, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-supreme-court-hear-nvidia-bid-avoid-securities-fraud-suit-2024-11-13/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uYEWXr"&gt;The case stems from a pair of &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/8490233/1/in-re-nvidia-corporation-securities-litigation/"&gt;2018 investor lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; claiming Nvidia recklessly misled investors about how closely tied its revenue growth was to cryptocurrency performance. Investors alleged that Nvidia and its top executives made materially false claims downplaying the impact of the volatile cryptocurrency market on its revenue growth, and exaggerating its ability to adapt its changes. An appeals court &lt;a href="https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2023/08/25/21-15604.pdf"&gt;had allowed&lt;/a&gt; at least a portion of the consolidated case to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W9HqDb"&gt;In a separate case in 2022, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/6/23059930/nvidia-sec-charges-fine-settlement-gaming-gpu-crypto-mining"&gt;Nvidia settled charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt; for $5.5 million over claims it obscured how its success was linked to the volatile cryptocurrency market. The company did not admit to any wrongdoing in the settlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iqeViT"&gt;Nvidia is facing increased legal scrutiny alongside its business success. The company is reportedly facing antitrust investigations from both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24317016/nvidia-mellanox-antitrust-china-ai-chips"&gt;Chinese authorities&lt;/a&gt; and the US &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/3/24235233/nvidia-doj-ai-antitrust-investigation"&gt;Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ju5EWS"&gt;“We would have preferred a decision on the merits affirming the trial court’s dismissal of the case, but we are fully prepared to continue our defense,” Nvidia spokesperson John Rizzo says in a statement. “Consistent and predictable standards in securities litigation are essential to protecting shareholders and ensuring a strong economy, and we remain committed to supporting them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JdPtos"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

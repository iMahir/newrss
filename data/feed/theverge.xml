    <title>Researchers put bird legs on a drone so it can take off by jumping</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="EPFL’s RAVEN drone shown posed in flight with its bird-inspired legs dangling." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-7-Fz_AGk3YeZ9kyziPi2AKpMYY=/0x0:2500x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73770675/EPFL_raven_drone1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;EPFL’s RAVEN drone trades traditional landing gear for a pair of legs that function similar to a bird’s.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Alain Herzog&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VMc99V"&gt;Researchers from the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland and UC Irvine have developed a drone capable of landing and taking off in areas that would otherwise leave a fixed-wing aircraft stranded. Their &lt;a href="https://actu.epfl.ch/news/bird-inspired-drone-can-jump-for-take-off-2/"&gt;Robotic Avian-inspired Vehicle for multiple ENvironments&lt;/a&gt; (RAVEN) trades traditional landing gear for a pair of bird-inspired articulated legs that allow the drone to walk around, hop over obstacles, and even &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/bird-drone"&gt;leap into the air to take flight&lt;/a&gt; without the need for a runway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kzfvd5"&gt;Quadcopter drones may offer more flexibility when it comes to where they can take off and land, but most rely on four motors which are less energy-efficient than fixed-wing drones that use a single motor paired with gliding for flight. To expand the capabilities of fixed-wing drones, the researchers took inspiration from birds like crows and ravens which can easily maneuver on the ground using a scrawny pair of legs, as detailed in a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08228-9"&gt;paper published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A close-up look at the EPFL’s RAVEN drone’s legs and feet." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rZrRsjWduS-81mAzzF1C2dA_IdE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25776421/EPFL_raven_drone2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Alain Herzog&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;RAVEN’s legs and feet use a simplified design but still offer enough articulation for the drone to maneuver on the ground.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="M1fw6p"&gt;Recreating the strength and capabilities of a bird’s legs mechanically without adding significant weight to a drone and reducing its operating range required a mix of “mathematical models, computer simulations, and experimental iterations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="khbZQP"&gt;The final design for the legs uses a combination of springs and motors to mimic “powerful avian tendons and muscles” while its simplified feet use “two articulated structures” plus toes with a passive elastic joint. The toes not only prevent RAVEN from constantly face planting, they’re also critical for walking and positioning the drone at the right angle of attack for an effective takeoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TiPIAN"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-8DJ1a3sLIc?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mGaJ2M"&gt;Fixed-wing drones that take advantage of legs for short takeoffs and landings aren’t an entirely new idea. In 2019, a South African startup called Passerine &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/delivery-drones-use-birdinspired-legs-to-jump-into-the-air"&gt;demonstrated a drone called Sparrow&lt;/a&gt; that used a pair of spring-loaded legs to leap into the air and take flight from a standstill. What sets RAVEN apart is the complexity of its legs that allow the drone to walk across rough terrain, jump over gaps, and hop onto obstacles as high as 10 inches — in addition to being able to leap into flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X1FYag"&gt;RAVEN’s operations aren’t limited to airports or areas with smooth surfaces, which traditional wheeled landing gear requires. It also doesn’t require human intervention to get airborne again. It’s capable of landing and exploring areas that may be dangerous or restricted to humans, and then repositioning itself to an area that’s safe for takeoff. And it does it all using less power than a quadcopter drone would, giving it a larger operational range.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon just completed its first delivery by drone in Italy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="drone in sky with amazon building in background" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NhDDgNCVjjRhFjQSvwX19qdzEuY=/102x0:1218x744/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73770625/90_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CZGZJ3"&gt;Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.it/notizie/company-news/amazon-completa-con-successo-il-primo-volo-di-prova-per-le-consegne-con-i-droni-a-san-salvo-in-abruzzo"&gt;completed&lt;/a&gt; its first drone flight test in Italy on Wednesday. The test used its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/10/23451851/amazon-mk30-drone-prime-air-delivery"&gt;MK30 drone&lt;/a&gt;, which can carry up to five pounds (or 2.27 kilograms) of packages through light rain and, in the US, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24288735/amazon-arizona-tolleson-phoenix-drone-prime-air-launch"&gt;is licensed&lt;/a&gt; to operate Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z4LriP"&gt;Italian regulators ENAC and ENAV, which are like the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), authorized Amazon to carry out the test in San Salvo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="38xSE3"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FTHXHvFBmVw?rel=0&amp;amp;start=2" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="52p4Tk"&gt;Last year, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/18/23922910/amazon-prime-air-delivery-drone-italy-united-kingdom"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; its intention to expand to Italy and the UK in 2024. Amazon says it plans to launch its Prime Air delivery service commercially in Italy in 2025, pending regulatory approval. According to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/amazon-successfully-tests-using-delivery-drones-italy-2024-12-05/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Britain has selected six drone testing projects, including Amazon, however, there’s no word on when testing will take place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BTvbZC"&gt;In the US, Amazon’s drone deliveries are up and running in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/28/23529705/amazon-drone-delivery-prime-air-california-texas"&gt;College Station, Texas&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24288735/amazon-arizona-tolleson-phoenix-drone-prime-air-launch"&gt;Phoenix, Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, with plans to operate in more areas next year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s Jentry Chau vs. The Underworld is a fresh remix of Buffy-style monster slaying</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A blonde girl wearing a black and yellow T-shirt, jeans, and a backpack. The girl is standing in a dark high school hallway and holding her hands, which are engulfed in flames, up in defense." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EMcVUfzX6dBNelpjTKzOUTmFXus=/0x0:3430x2287/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73770611/Jentry_PromoImage.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Jentry Chau vs. The Underworld’s first season feels like a classic monster slaying story remixed for a new generation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="XJZuv4"&gt;Though it has been decades since &lt;em&gt;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&lt;/em&gt;’s final episode aired, the show’s lasting cultural impact can still be felt through &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24141747/i-saw-the-tv-glow-review-a24"&gt;the stories being told&lt;/a&gt; by people who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24159054/i-saw-the-tv-glow-jane-schoenbrun-interview"&gt;were impacted by it&lt;/a&gt;. Netflix’s &lt;em&gt;Jentry Chau vs. The Underworld &lt;/em&gt;feels like the kind of show that might not exist if it weren’t for the way an entire generation of kids grew up watching a teenage girl fight monsters from week to week. The new Titmouse-produced animated show’s world of magic, and its focus on a young warrior who just wants to be a regular high schooler, makes it impossible not to see it as a tribute to Sunnydale’s finest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UgTtKV"&gt;But as often as it riffs some of &lt;em&gt;Buffy&lt;/em&gt;’s signature beats — teen angst, supernatural love triangles, a town full of normies who &lt;em&gt;kinda &lt;/em&gt;know something weird is going on around them — &lt;em&gt;Jentry Chau vs. The Underworld &lt;/em&gt;uses them to tell a much more dynamic tale about who gets to be an “all-American girl.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hpGREA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jentry Chau vs. The Underworld &lt;/em&gt;tells the story of how its titular Chinese American teen is yanked out of her boarding school in South Korea and dragged to a small Texas town to fulfill a destiny she doesn’t want any part of. Things are &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; for Jentry in Seoul, where her friends have basically become her family and people that she can trust with some of her dark secrets. They know about Jentry’s uncontrollable ability to start fires and that it is part of why her feisty elderly aunt Gugu (Lori Tan Chinn) sent her to study abroad. But as dangerous as Jentry might be, her friends don’t care because they, like Gugu, love her. And with Jentry’s powers having seemingly gone dormant since she left the US, she assumes her days of literal bridge-burning are all in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="8gZYaJ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EHYcymIQ7xo?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1m8NNC"&gt;All Jentry wants for her 16th birthday is for things to stay as they are and to keep building a new life that feels like it’s really hers. But when she’s attacked by Ed (Bowen Yang), a &lt;em&gt;Twilight&lt;/em&gt;-obsessed shapeshifting vampire tasked with delivering her to his master Mogui (Kenton Chen), Jentry knows that her wish for a blissfully mundane childhood isn’t coming true anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BUiXj7"&gt;While younger viewers might not initially pick up on just how much &lt;em&gt;Jentry Chau &lt;/em&gt;borrows from &lt;em&gt;Buffy&lt;/em&gt;, the ’90s monster-of-the-week show’s influence on showrunner Echo Wu shines through in Jentry’s journey back to Texas to enroll in a school run by a paranoid administrator. Jentry’s being new-ish in town is all it takes for vice principal Wheeler (Sean Allan Krill) to be suspicious of her sudden arrival, and she tries to keep quiet about her extracurricular monster hunting. But because Jentry’s reignited powers lure so many mythological ghouls out of the woodwork, there’s enough day-to-day chaos that it’s kind of easy for her to pretend she’s just another student who can’t believe how her high school seems to be situated on top of a hellmouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KZo7Ld"&gt;The show’s monsters — a cavalcade of demons and spirits plucked from Chinese mythology — are a huge part of what makes &lt;em&gt;Jentry Chau vs. The Underworld &lt;/em&gt;feel like such an inspired spin on the monster-of-the-week genre. Almost every supernatural creature Jentry faces speaks to the series’ focus on exploring her cultural heritage, rather than using its aesthetics as superficial set dressing. Jentry’s powers make her formidable, but it’s because of Gugu’s years of teaching her about Chinese folklore that she’s able to outsmart the ghosts she encounters when she journeys into the underworld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kvStsJ-d7CCdCOzgg0A03RquVt4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25776361/en_US_JCVU_Teaser_Girl_On_Fire_Still005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hif1WY"&gt;One of the series’ funnier episodes follows Jentry and her classmates on a field trip to the Alamo, where a tour guide summons a bunch of dead American soldiers to scold the kids about how “rude” it is for them to want to know more about &lt;a href="https://stateline.org/2021/09/14/forget-the-alamo-depicts-a-racist-heritage-sparking-backlash/"&gt;the monument’s actual history&lt;/a&gt;. It’s one of the instances where &lt;em&gt;Jentry Chau &lt;/em&gt;more explicitly reminds you that, in addition to centering Jentry’s Chinese heritage, it’s telling a story about an American girl who has been encouraged to think about her country’s past and how that shapes some people’s perceptions of her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="co7OFH"&gt;Jentry has far more interesting things to deal with than racism, like her complicated love triangle situation with her childhood friend Michael (A.J. Beckles) and Kit (Woosung Kim), another mysterious transfer student. But it’s clear the show wants you to appreciate that there’s more to telling relatable yet culturally specific stories than simply putting a few characters of color onscreen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i0bAKq"&gt;Even though the &lt;em&gt;Buffy &lt;/em&gt;vibes only grow stronger with each episode — Jentry ends up with a Scooby Gang of her own who all have their own supernatural stuff going on — the show remixes them just enough to make this first season feel like a refreshing addition to the Chosen Girl™ canon. You can see that Wu and the rest of &lt;em&gt;Jentry Chau vs. The Underworld&lt;/em&gt;’s creative team have poured their hearts into this first chapter, and it would be great to see what else they might want to conjure up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="WL1Zvd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jentry Chau vs. The Underworld&lt;/em&gt;’s first season is now streaming on Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok divest-or-ban law upheld by federal court</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Photo illustration of the Capitol building next to the TikTok logo." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QEQzPwIFKbOCKPdjztmzEGprIWI=/20x0:2021x1334/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73770607/STK051_TIKTOKBAN_CVirginia_A.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Cath Virginia / The Verge | Photos from Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EgkSqI"&gt;A bill that could ban TikTok from the US unless its Chinese parent company divests it is constitutional, a panel of judges for the DC Circuit Court of Appeals &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cadc.40861/gov.uscourts.cadc.40861.1208687457.0_5.pdf"&gt;unanimously ruled&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BZCac3"&gt;The decision comes soon before ByteDance’s January 19th deadline to sell the popular video app, or face its expulsion from the US. That deadline now falls one day before President-elect Donald Trump will be inaugurated for the second time — thanks in part to donations from &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-06-24/jeff-yass-how-tiktok-billionaire-became-a-top-influence-in-2024-election"&gt;ByteDance investor Jeff Yass&lt;/a&gt;. Though Trump sought to ban TikTok during his first term, he changed his tune on the campaign trail this year, saying a ban would just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/8/24094587/republicans-ignore-trump-criticism-and-plan-to-vote-next-week-on-a-bill-that-could-ban-tiktok"&gt;help a different target of his ire&lt;/a&gt;: Meta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VdQ14r"&gt;While Trump allies &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/11/12/trump-tiktok-ban-sale/"&gt;reportedly expected him to try to halt the ban&lt;/a&gt;, the options for recourse are somewhat limited. The law allows for a 90 day extension at the president’s discretion, but only if progress is being made toward a spin-out. Trump could direct the Department of Justice not to enforce the bill, but that still leaves app store companies like Google and Apple — tasked with being the gatekeepers to the app — in a precarious spot, should Trump change his mind or a future administration decide to enforce the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="thK3tp"&gt;The court decided that the law could survive even strict scrutiny under the First Amendment, and did not find TikTok’s arguments that it violates equal protections under the Fifth Amendment compelling. “We emphasize from the outset that our conclusion here is fact-bound,” Judge Douglas Ginsburg writes in &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cadc.40861/gov.uscourts.cadc.40861.1208687460.0_3.pdf"&gt;the opinion for the court&lt;/a&gt;. “The multi-year efforts of both political branches to investigate the national security risks posed by the TikTok platform, and to consider potential remedies proposed by TikTok, weigh heavily in favor of the Act. The Government has offered persuasive evidence demonstrating that the Act is narrowly tailored to protect national security.” These risks included both fears that China could use TikTok for data collection and that it could covertly manipulate the recommendation algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HX6zV7"&gt;Despite Trump’s opposition, many Republicans in Congress voted to pass the bill earlier this year. It received overwhelming bipartisan support in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/20/24135163/tiktok-ban-divest-bytedance-house-foreign-aid-package"&gt;both&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/23/24137638/senate-passes-tiktok-ban-bill-divest-bytedance-foreign-aid"&gt;chambers&lt;/a&gt;, before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/24/24139036/biden-signs-tiktok-ban-bill-divest-foreign-aid-package"&gt;President Joe Biden signed it into law&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/15/24102472/house-tiktok-ban-bill-staffers-calls-congress"&gt;Proponents of the law&lt;/a&gt; say that it’s necessary protect the privacy of Americans and protect them from foreign influence campaigns. That’s because Chinese law lets the government compel companies headquartered there to hand over internal information for national security reasons. And while TikTok has repeatedly asserted its independent operations from ByteDance and says US data is not stored in China, many lawmakers still feared Chinese officials could have a say in what information Americans do and don’t see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oxlhk4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/14/24243794/tiktok-ban-bytedance-court-oral-arguments-lawsuit-explainer"&gt;During oral arguments&lt;/a&gt; in September, TikTok and a group of creators also suing to block the law argued that it would stifle Americans’ speech, and unfairly limit the information they’re able to access. The DOJ defended the law as appropriately tailored to address a national security risk. The three-judge panel that heard the case &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/16/24246568/tiktok-v-garland-oral-arguments-dc-circuit"&gt;appeared skeptical of the company’s arguments&lt;/a&gt;, prodding at the practicality of a more restrained approach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BQz9MC"&gt;The ruling could still appealed &lt;em&gt;en banc&lt;/em&gt; to the full panel of judges on the DC Circuit, and ultimately to the Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus teaser hints at ‘world’s first’ 27-inch 4K OLED gaming monitor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A screenshot from an ASUS teaser" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N4i9lIkyN4SsB5Y61ab1Yqx7hiI=/0x0:1350x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73770563/rog_27_inch_gaming_monitor.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Asus via &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://tftcentral.co.uk/news/oled-news-and-rumours-round-up-for-2025" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TFTCentral&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tbW1sH"&gt;It looks like Asus may be gearing up to release one of the first 4K OLED gaming monitors with a 27-inch display, &lt;a href="https://videocardz.com/pixel/asus-teases-pg27ucdm-the-worlds-first-27-inch-4k-oled"&gt;as reported earlier by &lt;em&gt;VideoCardz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In a now-removed teaser posted to Instagram, Asus mentioned a “ROG Swift OLED PG27UCDM” monitor, suggesting this display could be a smaller version of its existing Rog Swift 32-inch OLED 4K monitor, which shares nearly the same product name (PG32UCDM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IJNvHn"&gt;As shown in a &lt;a href="https://tftcentral.co.uk/news/oled-news-and-rumours-round-up-for-2025"&gt;reposted version of the ad shared by &lt;em&gt;TFTCentral&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Asus doesn’t reveal much about the new display other than its name. Currently, most 27-inch OLED gaming monitors sport a 1440p resolution — not 4K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oT7vxX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flatpanelshd.com/focus.php?subaction=showfull&amp;amp;id=1706685316"&gt;Previous rumors suggest&lt;/a&gt; that display manufacturer Samsung Display has already begun work on a 27-inch 4K OLED monitor. Even with a smaller size, a 27-inch 4K OLED monitor from Asus likely won’t come cheap, as its 32-inch &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Swift-Gaming-Monitor-PG32UCDM/dp/B0CV26XVMD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ROG Swift OLED costs $1,299.99&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y3zRcs"&gt;Aside from this monitor, &lt;em&gt;TFTCentral&lt;/em&gt; also mentioned some broader display trends we might see next year, including 45-inch ultrawide OLED displays with better resolution, 500GHz QD-OLED panels, and monitors that use DisplayPort 2.1 connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iCkNQu"&gt;If Asus is planning on releasing a new monitor, it will probably reveal it during CES 2025, which kicks off on January 7th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TGRKCj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Muppet History was a bright spot online — now it’s embroiled in a sexual harassment scandal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Muppet Show’s First European Tour" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kFFxk6KPKM8HaXdBYbc-dEyiT3M=/27x0:4230x2802/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73770557/542621384.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NgYJnI"&gt;For years, a fan-run account called Muppet History has been central to the Muppets fandom. It shared little-known facts, memes, and wholesome messages, amassing half a million followers on Instagram and more than &lt;a href="https://x.com/HistoryMuppet/status/1859646855803801928"&gt;280,000 on X&lt;/a&gt;. Publicly, it was a wholesome and sweet platform, a passion project that took off. It became an unofficial ambassador of Jim Henson’s iconic cast of characters — inside and outside the world of diehard fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uEfjiI"&gt;But on Monday night, a post on &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/muppethistory/"&gt;the account’s Instagram page&lt;/a&gt; had an ominous tone. “Good Evening,” the message started. “We wanted to take a moment to address some concerns that have arisen as of late.” The vague post — on which comments had been disabled — mentioned “overstepped” boundaries, the “harm” caused, and that people were made “uncomfortable.” It did not specify exactly what had happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="57Y8qX"&gt;Since that post, however, a rough sketch has come into focus. Fans claim that Muppet History’s co-runner Joshua Gillespie, who operates the account with his wife, Holly, was sending unwanted sexual messages to other people. Now, it’s gone from a bright spot on the internet to another soured piece of online culture, leaving a small community navigating the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Photos now has its own version of Spotify Wrapped</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZMIL0ZAN0JGDoSw-f26s0beyS-I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73770493/Google_Photos_Recap_2024.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Every company is trying to copy Spotify these days.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vY8tWb"&gt;The Google Photos app is rolling out a throwback experience that highlights some of your most memorable moments from this year. The “2024 Recap” presentation feature announced today combines a collection of photos and insights with graphics and cinematic effects that summarize what users have been doing over the last 12 months — a similar concept to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24312282/spotify-wrapped-2024-ai-podcast-recap-listening-habits"&gt;Spotify Wrapped&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1BV2LJ"&gt;The 2024 Recap insights include information like how many photos you snapped, the longest photo streak length, most photographed colors, who you took the most photos of, and the people you smiled the most with. Google says that “select users in the US” who have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/14/24156552/google-photos-ask-gemini-feature-io"&gt;Gemini enabled in the Photos app&lt;/a&gt; can also opt-in to receive a version of Recap that adds personalized captions highlighting the “two biggest moments from your year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PjkeFaww6wCSywYkH0vFb5Z9y-4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25776235/Google_Photos_Recap_memories_gif.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Gif: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s an example of the Wrapped-like insights that appear in Recap.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sXrfLg"&gt;The Recap will appear in the Google Photos Memories carousel throughout December before relocating to the photo grid in January, and can be shared to messaging and social media apps. There are some caveats though — Recap is only available to Photos users who have the &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/photos/answer/6128838?sjid=10142809278380501709-NC&amp;amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;amp;oco=1"&gt;Face Groups setting enabled&lt;/a&gt;, which uses facial recognition to identify and group similar faces together. This feature has some regional restrictions, so the end-of-year highlights won’t be available globally.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AGI is coming and nobody cares</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Sam Altman (R) speaks onstage during The New York Times Dealbook Summit 2024 at Jazz at Lincoln Center on December 04, 2024 in New York City" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6bvNMAepqJ5LLJxvF-aEolu4IM8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73770326/VRG_VST_1206_Site.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Eugene Gologursky/Getty Images for The New York Times&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2yQ61g"&gt;OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has been saying for years — years! — that artificial general intelligence, or AGI, would be something like a singularity. When we achieve AGI, Altman and others have said, it will fundamentally reshape society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g3IzNS"&gt;At the &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;DealBook Summit this week in New York City, Altman said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24313130/sam-altman-openai-agi-lower-the-bar"&gt;never mind&lt;/a&gt;. AGI is coming really soon, he said, but it’s not going to be a huge deal. Also this week: OpenAI began its “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24312352/openai-sora-o1-reasoning-12-days-shipmas"&gt;12 days of shipmas&lt;/a&gt;” campaign with a new $200 monthly subscription for its latest model. The stakes are lower, the prices are higher. Strange times in the AI race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kAL1qJ"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://player.megaphone.fm/VMP4036726409" style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 200px;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NkEsbg"&gt;On &lt;a href="https://link.chtbl.com/vergecast"&gt;this episode of &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/kylie-robison"&gt;Kylie Robison&lt;/a&gt; joins the show to talk about Altman’s about-face, shipmas, and everything else happening in the AI world this week. Google CEO Sundar Pichai had &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/business/dealbook/google-ai-sundar-pichai.html"&gt;a spicy take on Gemini&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24312260/amazon-nova-foundation-ai-models-anthropic"&gt;some models of its own&lt;/a&gt;, and the models &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24313222/chatgpt-pardon-biden-bush-esquire"&gt;just keep making mistakes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P3Rq73"&gt;But before we get to AI, Nilay and David spend some time talking about the world of subscriptions. Starting with ours! We launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24306571/verge-subscription-launch-fewer-ads-unlimited-access-full-text-rss"&gt;a subscription for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this week, and we’re grateful to everyone who has signed up to support us and be part of our community. Thanks also to everyone who has offered feedback, found bugs, and asked for ad-free podcasts. We’re still new at this whole subscription thing, but we’re learning fast. (And if you have questions, you have a &lt;em&gt;little &lt;/em&gt;more time to get them in for next week’s episode! Email vergecast@theverge.com or call 866-VERGE11 to get them in.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IkA0w1"&gt;That takes us into a conversation about the ongoing cable-ification of the streaming world, which this week included Disney &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24312617/espn-disney-plus-now-available-bundle-free-preview"&gt;bundling ESPN into Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; and Max launching &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24312385/max-always-on-live-hbo-channels"&gt;always-on channels for HBO content&lt;/a&gt;. You know, like cable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eLl4Aa"&gt;After all that it’s AI time. And finally, in the lightning round, we talk about bitcoin, AI browsers, the fediverse, Intel, Spotify Wrapped, and much more. It may be December, but there’s still an awful lot going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5OowCR"&gt;

    <title>Microsoft ends Surface Studio 2 Plus production with no successor in sight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i48Jm6qLo9o8Sx_nrqeYYqdSC5s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73770280/jbareham_161114_1269_0316_2400px_05.0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The original Surface Studio.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rk1OE5"&gt;Microsoft is ending production of its Surface Studio 2 Plus all-in-one PC two years after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/12/23400291/microsoft-surface-studio-2-plus-release-date-price-specs"&gt;introducing the latest model&lt;/a&gt;. Surface Studio 2 Plus stock started running out in recent weeks, and now Microsoft has &lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/surface/the-surface-studio-is-dead-microsoft-ends-production-on-surface-studio-2-as-stock-dwindles"&gt;confirmed to &lt;em&gt;Windows Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it’s no longer manufacturing the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R68DU7"&gt;“Customers can continue to purchase Surface Studio 2 Plus through retailers and partners with stock” says Microsoft in a statement. “For areas reaching out of stock, Surface Studio 2 Plus will no longer be available for new purchases.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="13hovL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/17/13663112/microsoft-surface-studio-review"&gt;The Surface Studio&lt;/a&gt; started off life as a surprise addition to Microsoft’s Surface lineup, with a touchscreen and unique hinge that allowed the 28-inch display to transform into a giant tablet for drawing purposes. It targeted creatives, one of Apple’s strongholds, at a time when Microsoft had just shipped Windows 10 and was looking to make desktop PCs exciting again.  &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The original Surface Studio display folding down.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uvySCC"&gt;It now looks like the end of the road for Microsoft’s innovative Surface Studio, once considered the ultimate all-in-one Windows device. While the Surface Studio was always an expensive and niche device, there was nothing else quite like it on the market. Microsoft has been gradually exiting various areas of its Surface business, with no successors planned for the Surface Duo or Surface Earbuds either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b7Dc6m"&gt;This year Microsoft has largely focused on its Copilot Plus range of devices, including a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24191243/microsoft-surface-pro-11-oled-review"&gt;Surface Pro 11&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185462/microsoft-surface-laptop-7th-edition-review"&gt;Surface Laptop 7&lt;/a&gt;. The company also launched business-focused versions of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/21/24107513/microsoft-ai-pc-surface-pro-10-laptop-6-specs-release-date-price"&gt;Surface Pro 10 and Surface Laptop 6&lt;/a&gt;  earlier this year with Intel chips inside. It looks like Lunar Lake variants of the Surface Laptop 7 and Surface Pro 11 will arrive in 2025, after a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24271612/microsoft-surface-laptop-prototype-leak-intel-lunar-lake"&gt;prototype Surface Laptop appeared&lt;/a&gt; on a Chinese second-hand marketplace in October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aC9tlJ"&gt;As someone who has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13493170/microsoft-surface-studio-monitor-gaming-potential"&gt;pleaded for a Surface Studio monitor&lt;/a&gt;, I’m still holding out hope that Microsoft might one day release a standalone folding and transforming screen so we can turn any laptop or PC into a Surface Studio.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber’s first international robotaxi service is live in the UAE </title>

      &lt;img alt="Uber and WeRide robotaxi in the UAE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xDCbPdhWrztrv-bldNNLz1d957w=/382x0:5745x3575/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73770113/Image__1.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="G9ngxO"&gt;Uber launched a robotaxi service with its partner WeRide in Abu Dhabi, its first international effort to make a wide number of autonomous vehicles from different operators available on its platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Z90fc"&gt;Customers who use Uber to book a ride will be presented with the option to hail an autonomous vehicle from WeRide. Fares will be upfront and equal to UberX and Uber Comfort prices. The vehicles will include safety drivers, so it won’t be a fully autonomous service at launch. But Uber and WeRide said they aim to offer driverless vehicles to passengers in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Nv1Vtw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The vehicles will include safety drivers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VDKqI4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://investor.uber.com/news-events/news/press-release-details/2024/WeRide-and-Uber-Partner-to-Bring-Autonomous-Vehicles-to-the-Uber-Platform-Beginning-in-the-United-Arab-Emirates/default.aspx"&gt;Uber first announced its partnership with WeRide&lt;/a&gt;, a startup based in Guangzhou, China, last September. WeRide holds driverless operation permits in the United Arab Emirates, Singapore, China, and the US — though Uber has said it isn’t currently considering extending the partnership beyond the UAE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F3xBu2"&gt;WeRide’s autonomous vehicles in Abu Dhabi have been available to customers through the TXAI app. The company was first granted a permit to test and operate AVs on public roads in the country in July 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8GnV9D"&gt;WeRide was planning on listing its shares in the US at a valuation of $5 billion, but its initial public offering &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2024%2F08%2F22%2Fchinas-self-driving-startup-weride-delays-us-ipo-as-deadline-looms.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F12%2F6%2F24313138%2Fuber-weride-robotaxi-uae-abu-dhabi" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;has been delayed&lt;/a&gt;, with the company citing a need to complete all the documentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KnZpMn"&gt;The company also develops self-driving technology that powers shuttle buses and freight equipment. It first launched in Silicon Valley in 2017 and subsequently was incorporated in the Cayman Islands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="seimBG"&gt;Since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22158745/uber-selling-autonomous-vehicle-business-aurora-innovation"&gt;ending its own efforts&lt;/a&gt; to develop self-driving cars in 2020, Uber has sought to become a clearinghouse for any company operating autonomous vehicles in the world. In addition to WeRide, Uber has deals with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/22/24226331/uber-cruise-autonomous-rides"&gt;Cruise&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/13/24243397/waymo-uber-austin-atlanta-robotaxi-partnership"&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/7/23496383/uber-motional-av-robotaxi-las-vegas-ridehail"&gt;Motional&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/3/24260712/uber-avride-robotaxi-sidewalk-robot-delivery-yandex"&gt;Avride&lt;/a&gt; for self-driving cars and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23930378/serve-delivery-robot-la-day-in-life-tiktok"&gt;Serve&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/15/23509283/uber-eats-sidewalk-robots-delivery-miami-cartken"&gt;Cartken&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/8/23339830/uber-eats-nuro-robot-delivery-ten-year-deal-california-texas"&gt;Nuro&lt;/a&gt; for delivery robots.&lt;/p&gt;

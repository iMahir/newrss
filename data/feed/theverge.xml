  &lt;p&gt;AI investment is massive even though AI profits are not. How are investors justifying this pricey gamble on the future?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Waymo’s next robotaxi city will be Miami </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Photo illustration of an autonomous vehicle." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/87rG8g2Ds5y3Xj41Q8tbZwkunxM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73768273/STK418_Autonomous_Vehicles_Cvirginia_A.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Cath Virginia / The Verge | Photo from Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wnZdOg"&gt;Waymo is making the moves on Magic City. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iCmjze"&gt;Alphabet’s robotaxi service said it would launch in Miami in 2026. The company has been testing its autonomous vehicles in the Florida city on-and-off &lt;a href="https://waymo.com/blog/2019/08/rain-testing-in-sunshine-state/"&gt;since 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and more recently has begun to &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/waymos-self-driving-cars-on-miami-streets-as-company-tests-its-technology/"&gt;lay the groundwork in earnest&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Eoi2Q"&gt;Waymo plans to start “reacquainting” its autonomous Jaguar I-Pace vehicles to Miami’s streets in 2025. And in 2026, it expects to start making its vehicles available to riders through its Waymo One ridehail app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="KA5P68"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Waymo plans to start “reacquainting” its autonomous Jaguar I-Pace vehicles to Miami’s streets in 2025&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0sRasM"&gt;The vehicles will be maintained by a company called &lt;a href="https://www.moove.io/"&gt;Moove&lt;/a&gt;, which provides fleet services, as well as a range of financial products for mobility companies. The African company (it has several offices in Nigeria) is backed by Uber and was recently &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/19/uber-leads-100m-investment-in-african-mobility-fintech-moove-as-valuation-hits-750m/"&gt;valued at $750 million&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CVW6oY"&gt;Moove will start out by taking over Waymo’s fleet management operations in Phoenix. That includes cleaning the vehicles, charging them, and making sure that the sensors are calibrated and unobstructed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3UDMF4"&gt;Waymo’s robotaxi business is slowly growing. It currently operates fleets of driverless cars in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin, and Phoenix. It also plans to launch a robotaxi service in Atlanta in an exclusive partnership with Uber. Waymo said recently it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24283127/waymo-now-does-150000-paid-trips-per-week"&gt;crossed the threshold of providing 150,000 paid trips per week&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KlVMti"&gt;Miami once played host to Ford-backed ArgoAI’s autonomous vehicle testing, but the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/26/23423998/argo-ai-shut-down-ford-vw-av-self-driving"&gt;company shut down&lt;/a&gt; when Ford pulled its funding. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Secret Level is a hollow anthology of video game cutscenes  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A still image from the animated series Secret Level." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L6PaCaA2V6AZNbVvAKGlA_zI0R8=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73768251/PCM_FINAL_11496_CC.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pac-Man.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9g3OSN"&gt;Ever since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224612/thats-a-lot-of-video-games"&gt;it was announced&lt;/a&gt;, there has been some confusion over just what &lt;em&gt;Secret Level&lt;/em&gt; actually is. The video game-themed anthology streaming on Prime Video — helmed by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23132482/love-death-and-robots-volume-3-review-netflix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Love, Death &amp;amp; Robots&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; creator Tim Miller — is a collection of animated shorts, each based on a different gaming property. So there’s a &lt;em&gt;Mega Man&lt;/em&gt; episode that explores the character’s origin and a &lt;em&gt;Spelunky&lt;/em&gt; episode that attempts to create a metanarrative around the concept of a roguelike. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZeUIxy"&gt;It’s an interesting idea let down by a lack of interesting ideas. The 15 shorts are almost universally dull and manage to neither make their source material seem compelling nor provide new insights for existing fans. The real confusion is who this is actually for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYcKO8"&gt;The main problem is how homogenous &lt;em&gt;Secret Level&lt;/em&gt; is. Working directly with game publishers, the show pulls from an oddball but also impressively global list, with titles like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/18/16469736/tencent-arena-of-valor-honor-of-kings-north-america-launch"&gt;Chinese megahit &lt;em&gt;Honor of Kings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Korean shooter &lt;em&gt;Crossfire&lt;/em&gt;. But despite featuring a large variety of video games, its episodes all feel very samey. It’s kind of the opposite of &lt;em&gt;Love, Death &amp;amp; Robots&lt;/em&gt;, which featured a number of different styles and tones as it explored horror and sci-fi. That’s how we...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This new smart thermostat from Meross works with Matter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iVZpw5F7Ac3CEzzdMBPq30OktE4=/0x69:1146x833/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73768238/Meross_smart_thermostat.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Meross Matter Smart Thermostat is the company’s first thermostat compatible with North American heating and cooling systems.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Meross&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LlRPP8"&gt;Smart home company Meross announced its first Matter-certified smart thermostat and its first to work with North American whole-home heating and cooling systems. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.meross.com%2Fproducts%2Fmatter-smart-thermostat-mts300ma%3F_pos%3D1%26_sid%3D09e6f6a97%26_ss%3Dr&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F12%2F5%2F24313941%2Fmeross-matter-smart-thermostat-release-date-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Meross Matter Smart Thermostat&lt;/a&gt; costs $99.99, works over Wi-Fi, and features a white glass panel with a touch screen, smart scheduling, and can track system usage through the Meross app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jWbbrd"&gt;The thermostat requires a C-Wire, and &lt;a href="https://www.meross.com/en-gc/compatibility-check/smart-thermostat-mts300"&gt;Meross says&lt;/a&gt; it’s compatible with 95 percent of heating and cooling systems. It also appears it will work with Meross’ &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.meross.com%2Fproducts%2Ftemperature-and-humidity-sensor-ms130%3F_pos%3D1%26_sid%3D6a3769c74%26_ss%3Dr%26variant%3D45181160390872&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F12%2F5%2F24313941%2Fmeross-matter-smart-thermostat-release-date-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;smart temperature and humidity sensors&lt;/a&gt;, which are Matter-compatible. They cost $30 each, although you’ll need a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.meross.com%2Fproducts%2Ftemperature-and-humidity-sensor-ms130%3F_pos%3D1%26_sid%3D6a3769c74%26_ss%3Dr%26variant%3D45181160259800&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F12%2F5%2F24313941%2Fmeross-matter-smart-thermostat-release-date-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Meross hub&lt;/a&gt; to use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6UTlso"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22832127/matter-smart-home-products-thread-wifi-explainer"&gt;Matter compatibility&lt;/a&gt; means the thermostat can integrate with platforms such as Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Samsung SmartThings locally over your Wi-Fi network without requiring a cloud connection. You should also be able to set up and use the thermostat directly on those platforms without requiring the Meross app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/69TUFkV0G8KU9Cgy_3Xn0cNMgQc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25774888/8_c8052352_8c55_487e_92c8_477a9e2a2dfe.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Meross&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new smart thermostat from Meross can track the heating and cooling usage of your HVAC system.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="f7e3qT"&gt;Surprisingly, despite the popularity of smart thermostats — which take a lot of the pain out of programming your heating and cooling system and can use their smarts to help save you energy  — there are only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23568091/matter-compatible-devices-accessories-apple-amazon-google-samsung"&gt;two Matter-compatible smart thermostats&lt;/a&gt; for US HVAC systems. Those are the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/18/23687751/nest-thermostat-matter-support-apple-home"&gt;Nest Thermostat&lt;/a&gt; ($129.99) and the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/6/24213538/google-nest-learning-thermostat-4th-gen-hands-on-price-release-date"&gt;Nest Learning Thermostat (4th Gen)&lt;/a&gt; ($279.99) — both from Google. Other popular brands in the space, such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23076845/ecobee-smart-thermostat-premium-enhanced-review"&gt;Ecobee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22791333/amazon-smart-thermostat-review-learning-geofencing-hunches"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.resideo.com/us/en/products/air/thermostats/wifi-thermostats/whole-home-comfort-kit-smhomcomfkit/"&gt;Honeywell Home&lt;/a&gt;, have not added Matter support to their thermostats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TIlWrb"&gt;This means that if you're interested in using a Matter device to control your HVAC, Meross’ new thermostat is now your least expensive option. While it doesn’t come with the Nest Thermostat’s smarts that will automatically adjust your schedule, it is the only thermostat with Matter-compatible room sensors. The Nest Learning Thermostat has room sensors, but they're not compatible with Matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jZ4W6e"&gt;One reason for the lack of support for more thermostats in Matter could be the limited controls Matter allows for. Currently, you can only adjust the temperature and change the mode on compatible platforms. However, the most &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/7/24289972/matter-smart-home-standard-1-4-spec-new-features-device-types"&gt;recent spec release for Matter (1.4)&lt;/a&gt; added support for scheduling and preset modes such as home / away and vacation settings. This addition means that once a platform supports 1.4, it will be easier to set up and use a Matter smart thermostat directly in your smart home platform of choice and not need to use the manufacturer’s app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8rbqng"&gt;The Meross Matter Smart Thermostat costs $99.99 and is available now, with a launch price of $69.99 from the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.meross.com%2Fproducts%2Fmatter-smart-thermostat-mts300ma&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F12%2F5%2F24313941%2Fmeross-matter-smart-thermostat-release-date-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Meross store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ikea’s smart lights can now automatically adjust throughout the day</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Ikea Symfonisk speaker lamp in blue sitting on a bed’s side table." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k1kMDRnGL0_8nNTUNK8PfGUMYYg=/0x0:1152x768/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73768216/ikealamp1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ikea has updated its smart home app to bring dynamic lighting to its smart lights.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Ikea&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HMHjds"&gt;Ikea updated its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23420136/ikeas-dirigera-smart-home-review-price-specs"&gt;Home smart mobile app&lt;/a&gt; this week with a new dynamic lighting feature that will automatically adjust the color temperature and brightness of its smart lights throughout the day. It’s similar to the natural light scene that &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/12/20/philips-hue-natural-light/"&gt;Philips Hue introduced in late 2022&lt;/a&gt;, and is designed to provide warmer illumination in the mornings and evenings, with cooler hues in the day time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sSo7bu"&gt;The new feature is mentioned in the version history notes of a recent update to the &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ikea-home-smart/id1633226273"&gt;iOS version of the Ikea Home smart app&lt;/a&gt;, and is described as a way to “keep your home in balance” that’s “great for mind, body, and soul.” The &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ikea.inter.homesmart.system2&amp;amp;hl=us"&gt;Android version of Ikea’s app&lt;/a&gt; was updated on the same day, &lt;a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/IKEA-smart-lights-get-new-dynamic-lighting-effect-in-update.928038.0.html"&gt;according to Notebookcheck&lt;/a&gt;, but there’s no mention of the new adaptive lighting feature there, only bug fixes and minor improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TrFZaU"&gt;Given the feature is specifically tied to Ikea’s Home smart app, it’s only compatible with lighting products that connect to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/3/23384970/ikea-dirigera-smart-home-hub-price-release-date"&gt;Ikea’s Matter-ready Dirigera smart home hub&lt;/a&gt; that launched in the latter half of 2022. That includes products like its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21435860/ikea-speaker-red-blue-symfonisk-discount-tradfri-gateway"&gt;Sonos-compatible Symfonisk speaker lamp&lt;/a&gt;. However, it’s not known if the feature will work with third-party smart lights through Matter, and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has reached out to Ikea to confirm if it’s compatible with the Adaptive Lighting feature in Apple’s Home app.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twos is a handy to-do list app with exactly the right amount of AI</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A screenshot of a shopping list showing paper towels." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AN7MUpwfnvPc_thkVbNIkJ9T2iU=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73768204/TwosPals.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A perfect example of the good and bad of Twos AI: paper towel prices are helpful, eBay listings, less helpful.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Twos&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gNF2ej"&gt;A lot of AI tools promise something like magic. Just write down all the stuff you need to do, or better yet, just let the tool record every second of your life, and presto manifesto, it’ll do… something. Buy plane tickets, maybe, or magically reorder your calendar to maximize your flow state. The idea is huge and enticing, that you could just live your life and your AI assistant will make everything happen on your behalf. But hardly any of it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IU65qg"&gt;The developers of the app &lt;a href="https://www.twosapp.com"&gt;Twos&lt;/a&gt; are taking a much more cautious and, as a result, much more actually useful approach. Twos is an app for taking notes, managing to-dos, and generally making lists of any and every kind — Parker Klein, the app’s creator, just calls it “a place to write things down.” Klein has been working on the app for nearly a decade, first as a tool just for himself and most recently as a true startup. I’ve been using Twos off and on for a couple of years, and there’s a lot to like about the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GDY7qI"&gt;The Twos AI approach, which Klein and cofounder Joe Steilberg call “smart suggestions,” is to use AI to help you simply take the first step in getting something done. If you write down the name of a movie, Twos might offer you a link to a JustWatch search or the IMDb page for that movie. If you write a person’s name and phone number, it can add them to your contacts with one tap. If you’re making a grocery list, it’ll send you to Amazon or Walmart or Instacart to buy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fZow9z"&gt;The logic behind all these suggestions is really simple: Twos looks for &lt;a href="https://twosapp.com/palsUseCases"&gt;certain words and phrases&lt;/a&gt; to determine what you’re trying to do and which integration makes the most sense. (You can pick and choose, too — I never use Uber Eats, for instance, so I turned that off entirely.) All the smart suggestions really do is take the first step. They’re definitely not perfect — when I type “bake blueberry muffins,” it offers me an Allrecipes link, which is helpful and relevant, and a Google Maps search for “blueberry muffins around me,” which is not. But even in the feature’s early days, I’ve found it way more useful than almost every other, vastly more ambitious productivity tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshots of the Twos app, showing AI chat." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7fZcD08s_ExjjMBuRRhXw5fB9u8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25774281/TwosChat.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Twos&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like any to-do list app worth its valuation, Twos now has an AI chatbot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TUEdQP"&gt;Twos also has a built-in chatbot, which you can use to ask questions about your notes. If you use your note-taking app like a journal, this can be really cool — “what was the name of that Thai food place we went to a few weeks ago?” is a surprisingly common question in my life. Lots of apps &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/14/23952292/notion-qa-ai-search"&gt;have something like this,&lt;/a&gt; and they all suffer from the same problem: if you don’t put &lt;em&gt;everything &lt;/em&gt;in the app, the search isn’t that useful. But whether it’s Notion or Dropbox or Twos, the AI integrations reward the heaviest users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DCx41q"&gt;AI turns Twos into not just my to-do list but the jumping-off point for all my tasks. Since the app works across platforms — it’s fundamentally a web app, but there are versions for Android and iOS, Windows and Mac, and more — it’s easy to just dump information into. Then, when it’s time to leave for the restaurant I wrote down and promptly forgot the name of, I open Twos, tap the sparkles that appear next to any item with a smart suggestion, and it opens Google Maps and directs me there. You can store and organize things inside of Twos, but I find myself using it transiently, just for the small things in day-to-day life. I need to make bread: click the sparkles, bread recipes appear. Remember to buy those Sesame Street bath toys for the kid: click the sparkles, Amazon search done. Ollie’s birthday is December 7th: click the sparkles, in my contacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1o8Kw"&gt;For now, the Twos smart suggestions are only available in beta testing, and there’s a waitlist for new users. (Though Klein did tell me that if you &lt;a href="https://www.twosapp.com/pals"&gt;sign up and use the code&lt;/a&gt; “Verge,” you’ll be able to skip the line.) Klein and Steilberg are working on more integrations and more ways to do even more with just a few words of your writing. They’re obviously enticed by how far this might go. Why not automatically buy the toys or start the grocery delivery and take a cut for themselves? It’s an age-old idea, that one. &lt;a href="http://any.do"&gt;Any.do tried it years ago&lt;/a&gt;; there was even a frenzy of &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/02/magic-the-startup/"&gt;apps like Magic&lt;/a&gt; that would do it all via text message. Even the Alexa business model used to depend on you being willing to just shout “buy toilet paper” at your speaker and trust it to do the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MwkZGl"&gt;There’s just one problem with the idea: it doesn’t work. There are too many logistical questions, too many ways to screw it up, and too many consequences for getting it wrong that it’s not going to work anytime soon. If ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bGSxph"&gt;In the meantime, the best AI tools work the way Twos does: by just helping you get started. Some apps help you search for information even when you don’t know exactly how to ask for it; others write the first draft of code or an email to get you started. AI as a complete solution to just about anything still feels like fiction. AI as a first step? Pretty useful.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oura’s smart rings can now tell when you’re getting sick</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Close-up of Oura Ring 4" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jUNRpxaoOhrPuLzAFnw7q8R8s4g=/0x0:2700x1800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73768104/247314_Oura_Ring_4_AKrales_0105.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Symptom Radar flags when you have no signs, minor signs, or major signs of respiratory illness.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S38whn"&gt;At the height of the covid-19 pandemic, many wearable companies rushed to see if their devices could &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/can-a-smart-watch-detect-covid-19-1833409102"&gt;detect early signs of the disease&lt;/a&gt;. Now, four years later, Oura is officially launching a feature that can flag when you may be coming down with a respiratory illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L8GkR7"&gt;Technically, Symptom Radar isn’t diagnostic in nature — though its development does have roots in Oura’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fouraring.com%2Fblog%2Fearly-covid-symptoms%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F12%2F5%2F24313465%2Foura-symptom-radar-illness-wearable-smart-ring" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;illness prediction research during the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. It can’t tell you if you’re catching a cold or the flu versus covid-19. Instead, it’s more of an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535204/apple-watch-fitbit-oura-wearables-illness-prediction"&gt;“illness warning light”&lt;/a&gt; that flags when your body is showing early signs that something’s up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5y79QJ"&gt;“What we saw through all of the research and science that we’ve done is that your physiology actually starts changing a day or two before you start feeling symptoms,” Shyamal Patel, Oura’s head of science, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. From there, the idea is to take precautionary measures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Render of Symptom Radar screen" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/892vyCujDO-uQ7NN-Narqkn4F40=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25774000/symptom_radar_app_2__2_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Oura&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Symptom Radar is moving out of beta.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OZwS2Y"&gt;Essentially, Symptom Radar works by evaluating metrics like resting heart rate, heart rate variability, temperature trends, and breathing rate to detect significant changes from your long-term baselines. When users sync their data in the morning, they’ll be notified if no signs, minor signs, or major signs of strain related to respiratory symptoms have been identified. In the case of minor or major signs, the Oura app will encourage users to turn on Rest Mode and take steps to prioritize rest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="753KPh"&gt;Symptom Radar was actually introduced as a beta feature in April through Oura’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/3/24119189/oura-ring-labs-symptom-radar-wearable-smart-ring"&gt;recently launched Labs program&lt;/a&gt; for experimental features. Patel says that’s been a valuable part of developing the feature for prime time. On the one hand, the Oura team was able to develop a new algorithm based on a much bigger data set. Even so, Patel acknowledged that the algorithm isn’t 100 percent accurate and that false positives and negatives were possible; Oura didn’t provide specific accuracy data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="STV1Sl"&gt;Beta users also noted that they actually wanted to be notified when symptoms &lt;em&gt;weren’t&lt;/em&gt; detected. Given that, Patel says the official version of Symptom Radar will now include a historical graph so that people can see how their health is trending over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8VOtiA"&gt;“It will also be interesting to see how [people] recover from [illnesses]. That’s where I see some interesting things that we could kind of evolve towards,” Patel says. He notes that aside from flagging illness, Symptom Radar could be a useful tool in helping people identify what factors help in recovering from illnesses faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="smmpkd"&gt;Symptom Radar will be available to all Oura Ring Gen 3 and Oura Ring 4 users by Monday, December 9th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rivian opens up its charging network to other EVs for the first time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Rivian EV charging station in Joshua Tree National Park" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z5EpUp6rS5fEpRcdROsBFrobN_Y=/0x0:5455x3637/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73768152/Rivian_J_Tree_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Rivian&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3xVktb"&gt;Rivian’s latest EV charging station is the first to be open to other companies’ vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a2BGcx"&gt;The new station located in California’s Joshua Tree National Park will be the companies’ first that’s available to non-Rivian electric vehicles. The station features a new design, including larger displays with a tap-to-pay option, that can accommodate any car brands’ EVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLNhYf"&gt;Currently, the &lt;a href="https://rivian.com/experience/charging"&gt;Rivian Adventure Network&lt;/a&gt;, which comprises 560 chargers at 92 sites across the country, are exclusive to owners of the company’s R1T and R1S vehicles. This was a similar approach to Tesla, which initially built its own Supercharger network so it could offer exclusive charging to its own customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IsvEXe"&gt;But with billions of dollars in federal funding at stake, automakers are now reassessing this exclusivity. One of the requirements for receiving federal funding for EV charging installation is that chargers need to be available to all EVs, not just a single brand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="JZ91uk"&gt;&lt;q&gt; Rivian Adventure Network comprises 560 chargers at 92 sites across the country&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FpZsFW"&gt;Tesla began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/1/23620368/tesla-supercharger-non-tesla-ev-payment-access-app"&gt;opening its network to non-Tesla EVs&lt;/a&gt; in 2023. Soon after, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/11/23453587/tesla-connector-north-american-standard-ccs-combo"&gt;it open-sourced its charging plug&lt;/a&gt;, renaming it the North American Charging Standard (NACS), and began making a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/9/23755184/tesla-ev-charging-standard-nacs-ccs-gm-ford"&gt;series of deals&lt;/a&gt; with the rest of the auto industry (including Rivian) to use it for their EVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mFkvTg"&gt;Rivian’s EV chargers use the standard CCS connector for DC fast charging. But the stations are still exclusive to Rivian vehicles thanks to proprietary software. With today’s announcement, the company is beginning the process of unwinding that exclusivity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BjVowe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:12498553"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R4wRj5"&gt;Rivian has also said that it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/20/23766979/rivian-tesla-ev-charging-standard-nacs-r1t-r1s"&gt;adopt Tesla’s NACS charging standard&lt;/a&gt;. Current Rivian customers can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/18/24104786/rivian-tesla-supercharger-access-adapter-free-r1t-r1s"&gt;buy an adapter&lt;/a&gt; if they want to use the Supercharger network. In 2026, Rivian said it will begin producing vehicles with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/7/24093215/rivian-r2-revealed-ev-suv-price-specs-price"&gt;a native NACS port&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U0Sgvw"&gt;Rivian spokesperson Evan Barbour said that the company’s future EV charging sites will also be open to non-Rivian EVs. Rivian plans to open additional charging sites in Texas, Colorado, Illinois, Montana, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and New York before the end of 2024. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2LJxY"&gt;Meanwhile, current stations will be retrofitted with software updates to accommodate other brands, as well as hardware updates to add NACS charging plugs. In the meantime, the Joshua Tree location and others will be available to Tesla owners with NACS-to-CCS adapters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G497sv"&gt;EV ownership is currently a tangle of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23797527/ev-charging-ccs-nacs-tesla-adapter-guide"&gt;competing standards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/17/23308612/ev-charging-broken-unreliable-survey-jd-power"&gt;subpar software experiences&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24312002/ev-plug-and-charge-universal-protocol-sae-pki-roaming"&gt;dueling payment apps&lt;/a&gt;. And while some customers admit that the EV charging experience is slowly improving, this next phase of adapters and formerly proprietary chargers going universal has really only just begun. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OpenAI strikes content deal with Tom’s Guide owner Future</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration: The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pQRv95"&gt;OpenAI is &lt;a href="https://openai.com/index/openai-and-future-partner-on-specialist-content/"&gt;partnering with Future&lt;/a&gt;, the publisher behind &lt;em&gt;Tom’s Guide&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Marie Claire,&lt;/em&gt; and many other websites and magazines. The deal will give ChatGPT users access to news and lifestyle content from Future’s more than 200 media brands, while also displaying “attribution and links to the full original articles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6pL8sB"&gt;This adds to the string of content licensing agreements OpenAI has made in recent months. In addition to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/29/24167072/openai-content-copyright-vox-media-the-atlantic"&gt;parent company Vox Media&lt;/a&gt;, OpenAI has also struck deals with &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;owner &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/22/24162782/openai-licensing-deal-wall-street-journal-news-corp"&gt;News Corp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt; publisher &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24151171/openai-dotdash-meredith-people-instyle-licensing"&gt;Dotdash Meredith&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Politico &lt;/em&gt;parent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/13/23999861/openai-axel-springer-chatgpt-ai-content-insider-politico"&gt;Axel Springer&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/29/24141869/financial-times-licensing-deal-openai-news"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/11/24196396/the-atlantic-openai-licensing-deal-ai-news-journalism-web-future-decoder-podcasts"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. However, some publishers, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/27/24016212/new-york-times-openai-microsoft-lawsuit-copyright-infringement"&gt;like &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/28/24085973/intercept-raw-story-alternet-openai-lawsuit-copyright"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and a group of &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm27247j6gno"&gt;Canadian outlets including the CBC&lt;/a&gt;, have sued OpenAI over allegations of copyright infringement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jIWqSO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"ChatGPT now has over 300 million weekly users","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24313097/chatgpt-300-million-weekly-users"},{"title":"ChatGPT’s search results for news are ‘unpredictable’ and frequently inaccurate","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24312016/chatgpt-search-results-review-inaccurate-unpredictable"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q2PMa1"&gt;OpenAI says its deal with Future builds on the company’s “existing deployment of OpenAI’s technology,” as it has already launched AI chatbots within &lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Who What Wear&lt;/em&gt;. Future also plans to use OpenAI’s tech for sales, marketing, and editorial purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0tRaJc"&gt;“This partnership enables us to enhance the ChatGPT experience by providing more access to engaging, up to date, and reliable information from a range of specialist sources,” OpenAI chief operating officer Brad Lightcap said in the announcement. “Our goal is to help publishers and content creators both benefit from advanced AI technology and expand their reach.”&lt;/p&gt;

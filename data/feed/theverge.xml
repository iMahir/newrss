    <title>Amazon finally has a color Kindle, and it looks pretty good</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A photo of a Kindle Colorsoft, showing the library." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lx7FWSUpAJZvwGsgXwf__M7g0Ro=/0x224:5354x3793/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73657118/Colorsoft.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lngVPy"&gt;For years, Kindle users have asked Amazon to make a color version of its e-reader. Now, the company is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24271603/kindle-2024-colorsoft-scribe-paperwhite-specs-price-date"&gt;finally delivering&lt;/a&gt;: it’s &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/new-kindle-color-scribe-paperwhite-entry"&gt;launching&lt;/a&gt; the new Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition, a device that has a lot in common &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/24035238"&gt;with the new Paperwhite&lt;/a&gt;, except instead of black and white it’s color all over. The Colorsoft &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CN3XR57P?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costs $279.99 and is available for preorder today&lt;/a&gt;, with shipments starting October 30th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8o6Wk3"&gt;Making the Colorsoft happen, Amazon executives said at a launch event on Tuesday in New York City, required a lot more than just swapping in a new display. “Frankly, the technology just wasn’t ready” before now, says Kevin Keith, who runs Kindle products for Amazon. “And we now think the tech is ready.” (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/4/24158251/kobo-libra-clara-colour-e-reader-review"&gt;Kobo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24234815/the-remarkable-paper-pro-is-as-outrageous-as-it-is-luxurious"&gt;Remarkable&lt;/a&gt;, and others might...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s new Kindle Scribe takes another step toward pen and paper</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A person on a couch reading on a Kindle Scribe." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3Yv6Y5QWaJ19hZq9Gd708JypVlM=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73657089/Active_Canvas.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Scribe is as much a writing device as a reading one. | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cCJgjz"&gt;Ever since Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23484927/amazon-kindle-scribe-e-reader-notetaking-pen-review"&gt;launched the Kindle Scribe in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, the company has been noticing some unusual ways people are using the device. Scribe users read more nonfiction than normal Kindle owners; a full 60 percent of Scribe buyers use the device at work. That’s maybe not shocking, given that the Scribe is the largest Kindle and the one with an included stylus for taking notes. But still: this is maybe the first Kindle ever to not be &lt;em&gt;mostly &lt;/em&gt;a reading device, but rather equal parts book and notebook. With the new Scribe, which the company announced on Wednesday (and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24271603/kindle-2024-colorsoft-scribe-paperwhite-specs-price-date"&gt;leaked on Tuesday night&lt;/a&gt;), Amazon is leaning into the notebook side of things in a big way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FWBTxQ"&gt;The new Scribe, which will cost $399.99 and will ship starting on December 4th, is a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s new seven-inch Kindle Paperwhite is bigger and faster than ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The 2024 Kindle Paperwhite." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ImaZFMaeq6B1VILGPFSPiTibivw=/0x0:2700x1800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73657084/247326_Amazon_Kindle_2024_AKrales_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The new Kindle Paperwhite is probably going to be the best-selling Kindle. | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JDOVhK"&gt;Amazon introduced updated versions of the Kindle and Kindle Paperwhite on Wednesday, only a few hours after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24271603/kindle-2024-colorsoft-scribe-paperwhite-specs-price-date"&gt;inadvertently leaking them&lt;/a&gt; both. The Paperwhite is getting one of its biggest design refreshes ever, with a larger screen that’s completely flush with the bezels of the device, while the entry-level model is getting updated with a pop of color and some speed improvements. We got to try both at Amazon’s launch event in New York City and came away impressed. Neither is a reinvention of the whole Kindle format, but both are nice devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BkjWB7"&gt;Of the two e-readers, the Kindle Paperwhite is receiving more significant changes. The e-reader is now bigger, with a seven-inch screen, while boasting the highest contrast ratio of any Kindle. It’s...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="IR6wwc"&gt;A lot has been said about TV in 2004. That it was the &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/jamiejones/why-2004-was-the-greatest-year-in-television-history"&gt;best year of television&lt;/a&gt; of all time, the peak of the Golden Age of television. Or maybe that it was the year reality &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/24/business/media-business-advertising-fall-tv-season-s-new-offerings-tend-toward-escapist.html"&gt;television became too much&lt;/a&gt;, suddenly showing up on every channel as we flipped the switch. But as famed Hollywood producer and UFO enthusiast Bryce Zabel wrote for the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt; in 2004, it was the &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2004-sep-19-tm-blur38-story.html"&gt;end of television as we knew it&lt;/a&gt;. He chalked it up to the prevalence of TiVo and DVR in American households and predicted an upheaval so severe the whole advertising business would crumble — and he didn’t even know about streaming yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jscazG"&gt;The shift was one that a lot of people felt in real time. For many, it was through the show &lt;em&gt;Lost&lt;/em&gt;, which debuted in 2004 and created a...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="k4sGcx"&gt;By the time &lt;em&gt;MGM v. Grokster&lt;/em&gt; hit the Supreme Court, the file-sharing industry had been roiling with lawsuits for years. The record labels had sued Napster in December 1999, baptizing the oughties with a spree of copyright litigation. But the public’s appetite for piracy didn’t go away, and for every Napster that was sued into oblivion, three more sprung up in its place. Their names are now commemorated only in the court decisions that eventually destroyed them: Aimster, StreamCast, and of course, Grokster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Ay3FX"&gt;The Supreme Court agreed to hear the &lt;em&gt;Grokster&lt;/em&gt; case in December 2004, and &lt;a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2004/04-480"&gt;oral arguments&lt;/a&gt; took place in March of the following year. The copyright wars had finally arrived before the justices. The court heard first from Don Verrilli, the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Nintendo DS introduced touchscreens to a generation of gamers</title>

      &lt;img alt="Photo of two teenagers on an orange carpet playing with Nintendo DS’s." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-zmMfZy0E0gCP-VObDFP535D_cA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73656939/2004_DS_CHORUS_LEDE.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="56mdMV"&gt;Decades before we got married and started a family, my partner and I connected over a little Boxer pup named Charlie. We tossed a ball around, scrubbed him down when he got dirty, and took him for daily walks. It was a bonding experience — mediated entirely through the original Nintendo DS’s touchscreen. The tactile experience turned an otherwise simple game like &lt;em&gt;Nintendogs,&lt;/em&gt; where the goal is to take care of virtual pets, into something that created a deep emotional connection. And years before smartphones were in everyone’s pockets, it helped show a generation of gamers just what’s possible with a touchscreen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F5DOo9"&gt;Now, we mostly take them for granted, but prior to the arrival of the first DS in 2004, the idea of a touchscreen was, for many...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Adobe’s experimental tool can identify an artist’s work online or on a tote bag</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rSqZeG"&gt;One of Adobe’s most notable experiments this year could help combat misinformation and ensure artists are credited for their work, no matter where it appears online &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; offline. Announced during the Sneaks segment at Adobe Max, Project “Know How’ is an in-development tool that can link ownership of an image or video across any online platform, and a multitude of real-world surfaces like posters, tumblers, and textiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xN3flC"&gt;Project Know How builds on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/10/23911381/adobe-ai-generated-content-symbol-watermark"&gt;Adobe’s Content Credentials tech&lt;/a&gt;, which applies a digital tag to track where a piece of content has been posted, who owns it, and if/how it’s been manipulated. Providing an image or video has Content Credentials applied, the tool can help creators establish ownership over their content even if...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="t9rzau"&gt;In February 2004, a 19-year-old, flip-flop-wearing Mark Zuckerberg released an online directory of Harvard students. In those days, the internet still felt small. It was mostly about finding webpages, not people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KrjU3A"&gt;It turned out that the internet was very good for connecting people. More than 1,000 Harvard students signed up for TheFacebook.com in the first 24 hours. The site started spreading quickly by word of mouth around campus. By the end of 2004, dozens of other colleges were on Facebook. The site had 1 million monthly users. Myspace’s user base was about five times larger, though not for long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TuIqMi"&gt;Social media predated Facebook, but nothing had captured the magic of what Zuckerberg and his classmates hacked together. The 2004 version of...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MBC6vz"&gt;Microsoft has pulled its $1 Xbox Game Pass trial, just days before &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Black Ops 6&lt;/em&gt; releases on October 25th. The 14-day Game Pass trial was removed on October 8th, preventing people from signing up for a trial and playing through the &lt;em&gt;Black Ops 6&lt;/em&gt; campaign without paying for a full month of Game Pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVbknk"&gt;Microsoft first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/26/23657627/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-trial-offer-stopped"&gt;stopped its $1 trial&lt;/a&gt; for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass in March last year, before bringing it back and nerfing it down to just 14 days instead of a full month. The Xbox maker then &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-pulls-1-xbox-game-pass-trial-just-days-before-starfield-release-date"&gt;briefly removed&lt;/a&gt; the $1 trial just days before &lt;em&gt;Starfield&lt;/em&gt;’s debut in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aoFmJ8"&gt;It’s not surprising to see the $1 Xbox Game Pass trial quietly removed once again, especially as Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24166053/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-xbox-game-pass"&gt;looks to &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Black Ops 6&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to boost...&lt;/p&gt;

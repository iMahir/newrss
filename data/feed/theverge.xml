    <title>YouTube is getting in on the digital gifting game</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p id="7D0KRF"&gt;YouTube is taking a page out of the TikTok playbook by adding “jewels” you buy to &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/307754858?hl=en"&gt;exchange for gifts for your favorite creators&lt;/a&gt; during livestreams. The feature, announced in September’s Made on YouTube event, is rolling out in the US over the next few weeks for eligible creators in the YouTube Partner Program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AUNnVS"&gt;The feature is reminiscent of TikTok’s livestream gifting, which essentially works the same way, except you buy “coins.” On YouTube, gifts you send to live streamers appear onscreen and add to their earnings called “rubies,” valued at one cent each. YouTube says there’s no fixed revenue share since the cost of jewels can change based on promotions, so the amount of rubies earned can vary. For the next three months, YouTube will...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney’s streaming business is finally finding its footing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An image showing the Disney Plus logo on a blue background" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FLiKe-swToj7uHPnPpC7b7x415w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73722784/STK080_VRG_Illo_N_Barclay_5_disney_.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8opepf"&gt;Disney made money off its streaming business for the second time in a row. &lt;a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/app/uploads/2024/11/q4-fy24-earnings.pdf"&gt;During Q4 2024&lt;/a&gt;, profit from Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN Plus soared to $321 million, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/7/24214898/disney-streaming-business-profitable-earnings-q3-2024"&gt;up from $47 million last quarter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HwqcGG"&gt;During an earnings call on Thursday, Disney CEO Bob Iger said around 60 percent of all new subscribers are choosing Disney Plus’s ad-supported plan. Meanwhile, 37 percent of total subscribers in the US are currently subscribed to the option, which has become a major revenue driver for streaming services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="49tW3S"&gt;“It’s not just about raising pricing,” Iger said. “It’s about moving consumers to the advertiser-supported side of the streaming platform... the pricing that we recently put into place, which is increased pricing, was actually designed to move...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon announces its first Mini LED Fire TV — and this one’s also built for gaming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A marketing photo of Amazon’s Fire TV Omni Mini-LED series TV." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LMFQY7QSt3Y2y07ZLQGiUZzNH2w=/1x0:1792x1194/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73722745/Fire_TV_Omni_Mini_LED_Series_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r66xt2"&gt;Amazon is today introducing its latest Fire TV Omni TV series, and it’s the first to feature Mini LED backlighting for improved contrast, less blooming, and greater brightness than past models. The “Fire TV Omni Mini-LED Series” features up to 1,344 dimming zones (depending on screen size) and delivers up to 1,400 nits of peak brightness. That’s respectable, but falls short of top Mini LED contenders like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/TCL-75QM851G-Accelerator-Streaming-Television/dp/B0CZM95SG6?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;TCL’s QM8&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hisense-65-Inch-Mini-LED-Google-65U8N"&gt;Hisense’s U8N&lt;/a&gt;, which can push all the way to 3,000 nits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNOFUh"&gt;Still, Amazon’s TV is priced quite a bit lower than those models and includes Dolby Vision IQ, HDR10 Plus Adaptive, and Dolby Atmos audio. This also sounds like the first Fire TV Omni that’s truly cut out for gaming. It’s got AMD FreeSync Premium Pro certification,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Words With Friends takes on Wordle with new single-player daily puzzles</title>

The long-running word game is adding four solo modes that can be played daily, and they’ll sound familiar to those who use &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times’&lt;/em&gt; gaming app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mgcAhv"&gt;The new games include a mini crossword puzzle; a word search; &lt;em&gt;Word Wheel&lt;/em&gt;, which is about connecting letters to create words; and a word guessing game called &lt;em&gt;Guess Word&lt;/em&gt;. You can see what they all look like in the gallery below:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple faces a new $3.75 billion antitrust lawsuit over iCloud storage</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2bvYrs"&gt;Apple is facing a £3 billion (about $3.75 billion) lawsuit from a consumer group that alleges the iPhone maker violated UK competition law by “forcing” customers to use its iCloud service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HwqZpE"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.which.co.uk%2Fpolicy-and-insight%2Farticle%2Fwhich-launches-3-billion-action-against-apple-over-competition-law-breaches-acY7c0t4g3Gu&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F11%2F14%2F24296294%2Fapple-uk-consumer-antitrust-lawsuit-icloud-storage" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;its press release&lt;/a&gt;, UK consumer watchdog Which? says that Apple gave its iCloud storage service preferential treatment and encouraged users to use the service to store photos, videos, and other data while making it difficult to use alternative providers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LuIJHc"&gt;“We believe Apple customers are owed nearly £3 billion as a result of the tech giant forcing its iCloud services on customers and cutting off competition from rival services,” Which? said in its announcement. The group alleges that Apple’s monopoly allowed the company to overcharge users for iCloud...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snapchat will let parents request their teen’s real-time location</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Snapchat ghost icon in white, on a rust red and black background" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zk9x-tTZnH8AnXLRRz9b4jCeJGY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73722535/acastro_STK466_02.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hSJfAr"&gt;Once known only for its self-destructing pics, in recent years Snapchat has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/2/24190995/snapchat-snap-map-app-update"&gt;sneakily evolved into a location-oriented social media app&lt;/a&gt;. It’s now leaning further than ever into that identity with a new real-time location sharing feature that allows family members to share their live locations with each other. The feature will roll out alongside other new location and privacy tools in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jNsUjQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Snapchat is getting its biggest redesign in years ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/17/24246999/snapchat-redesign-three-tabs-stories-spotlight"},{"title":"Snapchat is jumping on the AI selfie train with ‘Dreams’ ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/29/23849611/snapchat-releases-ai-selfie-feature-dreams"},{"title":"Now you can launch Snapchat’s camera from your iPhone’s lock screen ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24278353/snapchat-iphone-lock-screen-ios18-widget-availability"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IV2Mjj"&gt;Once you have the update, you’ll see an option in the Family Center that lets parents request their teen’s locations, and vice versa. The hub will also allow parents to view their child’s location-sharing settings alongside existing privacy settings to ensure they’re using the app safely and responsibly. If that’s not enough, Snap is...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Gemini AI now has its own iPhone app</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N4wRYJ"&gt;In the AI chatbot world, ubiquity is everything. Companies have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/13/24155573/chatgpt-app-desktop-mac"&gt;raced&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24284742/claude-ai-macos-windows-desktop-app"&gt;build&lt;/a&gt; desktop and mobile apps for their bots, in order to both give them new capabilities but also to make sure they’re right in front of your face as often as possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VrAFCg"&gt;There’s no better example of that than Google’s &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-gemini/id6477489729"&gt;new Gemini app for iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, which quietly hit the App Store around the world this week. The free app is simple and straightforward: it’s just a chat window and a list of your previous chats. You can query the bot with text, voice, or your camera, and it’ll give you answers. It’s effectively identical to the Gemini section of the Google app, or what you’d get by opening a browser and going to the Gemini website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8QuycY"&gt;The Gemini app does have one newish...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google will let you search for products on Maps to help with holiday shopping</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7i1wUP"&gt;Google has added &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/8-ways-to-use-maps-and-more-for-your-holiday-plans/"&gt;some new travel and shopping&lt;/a&gt; features to Maps that aim to make it easier to find local products and stay on time during busy periods. Starting today, Maps now allows users to search for items like home goods, clothing, and electronics, and find stores nearby that sell them — a useful feature to have for any last-minute holiday shopping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wd4UbD"&gt;The search results in Maps will display individual product listings alongside locations where generic examples of desired items can be found (showing nearby stores that sell “holiday sweaters,” for example). The product listings are presented similarly to products in Google Shopping, only with useful information like store distance and if the item is currently in stock.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PayPal will let you pool money for group gifts and shared expenses</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;PayPal is making it easier to collectively pool together funds on the platform.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Cath Virginia / The Verge; Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="B8vIz3"&gt;PayPal is introducing a new money-pooling feature that aims to make it easier to collect and pay for things as a group. The feature is free and allows PayPal users to create a pool online or via the platform’s app, invite friends and family to contribute, track contributed funds, and transfer that cash to their own PayPal balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0sQPv3"&gt;Provided you trust the pool organizer who will hold the power to spend or withdraw those funds, the pooling feature should provide a simple way to gather cash for things like gifts and group traveling collectively. Pool organizers can share pool joining links via “text, email, WhatsApp, and more” to people regardless of whether they have a PayPal account or not. Contributions can be made using a PayPal balance...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="tfGeiU"&gt;Apple today announced some minor updates to Logic Pro for both the Mac and the iPad, including the ability to search for plug-ins and sources and the addition of more analog-simulating sounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1TbSFZ"&gt;In Logic Pro for Mac 11.1 and Logic Pro for iPad 2.1, you can now reorder channel strips and plug-ins in the mixer and plug-in windows to make it easier to organize the layout of an audio mix.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1QO7a3"&gt;As for the new sounds, Apple added a library of analog synthesizer samples called Modular Melodies, akin to the Modular Rhythms pack already found in Logic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UbIgx9"&gt;A more exciting sonic addition is the new Quantec Room Simulator (QRS) plug-in, which emulates the &lt;a href="https://www.vintagedigital.com.au/effects/quantec/"&gt;vintage digital reverb hardware of the same name&lt;/a&gt;, found in professional recording studios all over...&lt;/p&gt;

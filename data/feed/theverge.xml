    <title>Uber partners with ex-Yandex self-driving group for robotaxis and robot delivery</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BnhQQ2"&gt;Uber expanded its cohort of autonomous vehicle partners today with the addition of Avride, formerly known as Yandex Self-Driving Group. The companies signed a “multiyear” agreement in which Uber customers can take rides and accept takeout deliveries from Avride’s autonomous vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cznlU1"&gt;Starting this week, Uber customers in Austin will see an option to receive Uber Eats deliveries from Avride’s six-wheeled sidewalk robots. That deal will expand to Dallas and Jersey City, New Jersey, later this year. And in 2025, Avride’s autonomous vehicles will be available to some Uber customers for rides in Dallas. The company also operates delivery robots in South Korea. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gemini Live will support more languages for its AI voice chat</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vector illustration of the Google Gemini logo." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oe-UKU9MXD9ntqUQTbY8UUmSe2M=/20x0:2021x1334/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73628967/STK255_Google_Gemini_C.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HmbBnc"&gt;Google initially rolled out Gemini Live, its conversational AI voice chat, in just one language: English. Today, the company is expanding the service to a handful of other languages, starting with French, German, Portuguese, Hindi, and Spanish. And while support for these languages &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; appear to be imminent for a lot of people, the company is still couching promises of other Gemini features with fuzzy “coming weeks” timelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNPXKi"&gt;Google expects that the languages starting to roll out today will be available to all users “in a couple of weeks.” As for other languages, Google says it will have more than 40 languages over “the coming weeks,” which is harder to pin down. Still, Google’s timeline from announcement to full rollout for Gemini...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>John Deere accused of ‘excluding’ right-to-repair language in its manuals </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rnIcrn"&gt;Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is pressuring John Deere to update its manuals to better enable customers to repair their tractors. By omitting information about repair rights and pollution control systems, Warren alleges that John Deere could be in violation of the Clean Air Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PIRt9I"&gt;&lt;q&gt;John Deere has been at the center of an ongoing battle over the right to repair&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kk8NzG"&gt;John Deere has been at the center of an ongoing battle over the right to repair, especially as it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22533735/john-deere-cto-hindman-decoder-interview-right-to-repair-tractors"&gt;incorporates more software into farm equipment&lt;/a&gt;. Warren’s office contends that the company is making it almost impossible for farmers to fix their own equipment or turn to independent repair shops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TOUSCF"&gt;Withholding repair information from its customers in its manuals could also be illegal,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to import email from other accounts into Gmail </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Gmail icon against a background of small illustrations." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MjR3CETmNUdc_OEbr0t7cI2bE6Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73628968/HT011_gmail_00011.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RGEoYr"&gt;If you’re anything like me, you spend a lot of each day jumping between multiple email accounts — and multiple email apps — trying to get to inbox zero. Anything that can be done to reduce the number of places where messages are piling up can save time and reduce confusion. Gmail can import emails from other accounts like iCloud or Outlook so you don’t have to necessarily check multiple inboxes multiple times a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EhFtVp"&gt;Setting up an email import isn’t particularly difficult. I’m going to start with a little bit of explanation first and then go on to detail several ways to gather all your emails in your Gmail account. There is also a way to use your mobile Gmail app to read and answer emails from other accounts; I’ll cover that as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can easily upgrade all of Apple’s AirPods to USB-C using these smart cases</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A pair of gloved hands inserting an Apple AirPods charging case into a USB-C charging case." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_oA_AnupGbbU1IOo7kU3dOgvfmA=/0x0:1610x1073/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73628969/airpodsusbc2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ken Pillonel has created a protective case that also upgrades old AirPods charging cases to USB-C.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eQdkzG"&gt;Those of us still rocking AirPods with Lightning ports finally have a way to upgrade them to USB-C that doesn’t require complicated modifications or the cost of completely replacing the case. Engineer &lt;a href="https://kenp.io/"&gt;Ken Pillonel&lt;/a&gt; has created a &lt;a href="https://shop.kenp.io/"&gt;smart case for older AirPods&lt;/a&gt; models that includes a USB-C charging port on the outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MM8hz1"&gt;The protective cases are made from a durable but flexible 3D-printed plastic and can be installed on an AirPods charging case in about 10 seconds. The USB-C port on the outside passes power along to the AirPods’ Lightning port using some added electronics hidden in the base, but the case is also easily removable should direct access to the Lightning port still be needed.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Silicon Valley gets its first drone delivery service</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just don’t expect it to deliver any meaningful groceries yet.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Matternet&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9mquDc"&gt;Silicon Valley is getting its first drone delivery service to airdrop food and commercial items to local homes, though only the bare essentials (chocolate and Prime-branded drinks) are available right now. California-based &lt;a href="https://www.matternet.com/newsroom/matternet-enters-home-delivery-market-launches-first-ever-drone-delivery-operation-in-silicon-valley"&gt;Matternet is launching a pilot program for its delivery service&lt;/a&gt; in Mountain View and Sunnyvale, California, over two years after receiving Federal Aviation Administration &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/11/23347199/matternet-delivery-drone-model-m2-design-approved-faa"&gt;approval for its Model M2 drone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fptvtp"&gt;The delivery platform uses a variant of the M2 drone — currently the only non-military drone certified by the FAA for deliveries in the US, according to Matternet — which is equipped with a tether drop system to lower packages down to customers’ homes. Matternet says the delivery process is fully automated and that the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic knows its game store social features ‘suck,’ but it wants to fix that</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of the Epic Games logo." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pfl6mrUfJliTnD-gJEHyj8MwBf0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73628800/acastro_STK108__03.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vRZu9M"&gt;Epic’s game store is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/16/24221361/fortnite-iphone-epic-games-app-store"&gt;finally on mobile&lt;/a&gt;. Next up, the company plans to add features that make people want to use it — on both mobile &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FZV7wx"&gt;A key thing Epic Games wants to introduce is what store boss Steve Allison calls a “social framework” — think the types of social and chat features you see on consoles or Steam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JksVii"&gt;“Our social features on PC suck,” Allison says in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Let’s call it what it is.” Social features are the “battery that powers &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;,” Allison says, and Epic wants to “take that battle-tested social framework and move it up from &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; up to the store level.” The idea is that you’ll be able to party up and chat with your Epic Games friends across devices, theoretically meaning that friends on...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The ‘WordPress’ fight is now a lawsuit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vector illustration of the WordPress logo." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6-kXfzcdEuq0ho1UDDUfOW2wXOw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73628745/STK302_WORDPRESS.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;WP Engine said the lawsuit aims to address “abuse of power, extortion, and greed.”&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Cath Virginia / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S1LFTo"&gt;The WP Engine web hosting service is suing WordPress co-founder Matt Mullenweg and Automattic for alleged libel and attempted extortion, following a public spat over the WordPress trademark and open-source project. In the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwpengine.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F10%2FComplaint-WP-Engine-v-Automattic-et-al-with-Exhibit.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F10%2F3%2F24261016%2Fwordpress-wp-engine-lawsuit-automattic-matt-mullenweg" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;federal lawsuit filed on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;, WP Engine accuses both Automattic and its CEO Mullenweg of “abuse of power, extortion, and greed,” and said it seeks to prevent them from inflicting further harm against WP Engine and the WordPress community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Seu332"&gt;WP Engine is a major rival to WordPress.com, with more than 200,000 websites using the service. Mullenweg runs Automattic, which owns WordPress.com, a company that sells a hosted version of the open-source WordPress software — just like WP Engine.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Bank of America outage showed customers blanked-out account balances</title>

  &lt;p id="3My7wh"&gt;First, it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/29/24257477/spotify-outage-down-website-app"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/30/24258362/verizon-mobile-services-down-sos-mode"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/30/24258362/verizon-mobile-services-down-sos-mode"&gt;PlayStation&lt;/a&gt;, and now it’s apparently Bank of America’s turn to have an outage this week. Some customers reported problems accessing their bank accounts on Wednesday, with the balances showing $0 or “—-” instead of what should be there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BMgAVX"&gt;“Some mobile and online banking clients experienced an issue accessing their accounts and balance information earlier today,” writes Bank of America media relations executive Matt Card in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “These technology issues&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;have been fully resolved. We apologize for any inconvenience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TuF9tO"&gt;Reports spiked just before 1PM ET on Downdetector, with posts across X and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BankOfAmerica/comments/1fuldts/boa_app_and_website_down/"&gt;Reddit &lt;/a&gt;from people reporting that their account balances don’t show anything (some mentioned...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now use AirTags to expedite a lost luggage reunion through United’s mobile app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The United Airlines mobile app running on a smartphone being held by someone in the baggage claim area of an airport." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RJCcevO7p0l6BfCg6I-oJSOcy8g=/0x1:3314x2210/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73782399/united_airlines_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s new Share Item Location is already integrated into the latest version of United Airlines’ mobile app.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: United Airlines&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4xwJ8z"&gt;Following the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/11/24293654/apple-ios-18-2-share-airtag-locations"&gt;official release&lt;/a&gt; of Apple’s new Share Item Location feature with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24317119/ios-18-2-apple-intelligence-chatgpt-genmoji"&gt;iOS 18.2 yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.united.com%2Fen%2Fus%2Fnewsroom%2Fannouncements%2Fcision-125359&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F12%2F12%2F24319503%2Fapple-airtag-find-my-network-share-item-location-united-airlines-lost-bag-luggage" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;United Airlines has announced&lt;/a&gt; it has integrated it into its mobile app. Passengers finding themselves at their destination without their luggage can now file a delayed baggage report through United’s app along with a Share Item Location link that will potentially expedite a reunion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ft88BL"&gt;Passengers will need to ensure the United mobile app is up to date, but once a report has been submitted with a Share Item Location link connected to an AirTag or a tracker that’s compatible with Apple’s Find My network, customer service agents will be able to determine its current or last known location using an interactive map, according to United Airlines. Having access to the Find My network data for a missing bag will allow the airline “to more quickly find delayed bags and reunite them with customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The United Airlines mobile app running on an iPhone showing the Share Item Location integration." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fKLyUc-agkkSElnZI8X4dY0QqHo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25786823/united2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: United Airlines&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sharing a lost bag’s location through United’s mobile app will potentially expedite its return.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uqTumr"&gt;You don’t actually need the app to take advantage of the new integration. After filing a delayed baggage report either in person at an airport, over the phone, or through United’s website, passengers will “receive an automatic text notification with information to track misplaced luggage and add a Share Item Location link for their AirTag or Find My network accessory.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Akfl9L"&gt;Once a passenger is reunited with a missing bag its shared location will be disabled automatically. The location sharing can also be manually stopped by the passenger at any time, and for added security and privacy the link will automatically expire after seven days — hopefully long after the luggage is located and returned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nHVIP8"&gt;Apple says that Air Canada has also integrated the feature, and &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/11/apples-find-my-enables-sharing-location-of-lost-items-with-third-parties/"&gt;in the coming months more than 15 airlines&lt;/a&gt; “will begin accepting Find My item locations as part of their customer service process for locating mishandled or delayed bags.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>With iOS 18.2, Apple completes its AI starter kit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Photo of visual intelligence identifying a houseplant." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TRJg4N5piKqghRkb4R-YFc5VAZc=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73782391/DSC08569_processed.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plant identification — now powered by ChatGPT.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tEAhUq"&gt;I was about to okay my friend’s restaurant suggestion for lunch — an Indian place on 2nd — when Apple Intelligence swooped in with another idea. &lt;a href="https://www.threads.net/@allisonjo1/post/DDOR6jcpk3I?xmt=AQGzGq19ESsWdP4DPfs-5-VxlEfmRmQpDU2fmWfEA4cHaw"&gt;“How about The Ritz?”&lt;/a&gt; appeared above the keyboard as a suggested response, highlighted in that telltale AI rainbow glow. The other suggested response, “Sounds good!” was much more reasonable. But ignoring both, I typed out my affirmative answer, hopped on my bike, and headed to downtown Seattle, where there are, to my knowledge, zero Ritzes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c1DmY8"&gt;Suggested replies aren’t new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24317119/ios-18-2-apple-intelligence-chatgpt-genmoji"&gt;in iOS 18.2&lt;/a&gt;, but they’re a piece of the Apple Intelligence feature set that’s falling into place with this week’s public release of 18.2. Those suggestions I got while planning lunch kind of sum up my whole experience with Apple’s AI up ’til now: occasionally helpful, sometimes way off base, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24289939/apple-intelligence-ai-notification-summaries-awkward-funny-bad"&gt;often good for a laugh&lt;/a&gt;. But once the novelty wears off, it’s easily ignored — just like the AI feature sets on every other so-called AI smartphone I’ve used this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="0K4Qt3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple had to get &lt;em&gt;something &lt;/em&gt;out the door for its “built for Apple Intelligence” iPhones&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xaosyI"&gt;Apple took its time getting here. The first set of AI features &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/28/24279804/apple-intelligence-ios-18-1-siri-ai"&gt;dropped with iOS 18.1&lt;/a&gt; at the end of October, including...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic and Lego have a long-term plan to make Fortnite more than battle royale</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A screenshot from the video game Lego Fortnite Brick Life." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kR-VPmo0T3IXAhxmKqXSOClc7kc=/300x0:1920x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73782331/Brick_Life_Screenshot_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zZDCk0"&gt;A year ago, Epic kicked off a bold plan to turn &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; into a broader ecosystem for all kinds of games. And that plan was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23990660/lego-fortnite-release-epic"&gt;led by the launch of &lt;em&gt;Lego Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;-style survival game that sits alongside the likes of battle royale and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/9/23992574/fortnite-festival-harmonix-guitar-hero-rock-band"&gt;the music-themed &lt;em&gt;Fortnite Festival&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; inside of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. Now, Epic is pushing into another new direction with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24316954/lego-fortnite-brick-life-social-roleplay-game"&gt;the launch of &lt;em&gt;Brick Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a Lego-themed city where players can live virtual lives, much &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/11/23828431/rockstar-cfx-re-mod-tools-roleplay-server"&gt;like in &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto &lt;/em&gt;roleplaying servers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EuH3ao"&gt;The ongoing goal, according to Devin Winterbottom, Epic’s executive vice president of game development, is to keep expanding in ways that make people rethink what &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; actually is. “The worst outcome for us is that everything looks like battle royale,” Winterbottom says. “That’s not what we want to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="aAPzHS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Snoop Dogg’s Times Square concert showed the ambitious future of music in Fortnite","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/4/24288014/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-snoop-dogg-times-square-music"},{"title":"Fortnite’s latest concert turned pop stars into kaiju","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/30/24305460/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-concert-eminem-snoop-juice-wrld-ice-spice"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KriiI5"&gt;For &lt;em&gt;Brick Life&lt;/em&gt;, that takes the form of a family-friendly nonviolent space where players can explore and socialize inside of a Lego city. It launches today as part of a broader rebranding of Lego Fortnite; now, those two words refer to a hub that houses all of the Lego experiences in the game, while the survival title has been renamed &lt;em&gt;Lego Fortnite Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;. In between those two major releases, Lego...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Palmer Luckey’s defense tech company will make next-gen military aircraft with Archer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Archer’s Midnight eVTOL aircraft" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N3aCDW7sD8Jl4c46bzgtR9wSx6o=/85x0:4090x2670/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73782336/_Midnight_Flight_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Archer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5JhTen"&gt;Electric aviation startup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/7/24290281/archer-soracle-evtol-air-taxi-japan"&gt;Archer Aviation&lt;/a&gt; signed an exclusive deal with Palmer Luckey’s defense contractor, Anduril Industries, to jointly develop next-generation aircraft for the military. Archer also announced a new funding round of $450 million to help propel its defense ambitions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BkK9CO"&gt;The first product will be a hybrid propulsion vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft that will serve as the basis for the companies’ bid for a contract with the US Department of Defense. Archer is also formalizing its efforts to be an aircraft supplier to the military through the creation of a new internal division called Archer Defense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9GVaRc"&gt;While Archer has been racing to finalize the government certification process that it will need to get the necessary government approvals for its electric vertical takeoff and landing, or eVTOL, aircraft, it’s also getting more deeply involved with the military-industrial complex. The San Jose, California-based company also recently delivered one of its Midnight eVTOL aircraft to the US Air Force as part of its evaluation program. Other advanced aviation companies have made similar moves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Zd1EGk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The first product will be a hybrid propulsion vertical takeoff and landing aircraft&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="05ow3V"&gt;Archer also announced it will be the recipient of a fresh capital round, with $430 million coming from preexisting investors such as Stellantis and United Airlines as well as new funders like Wellington Management and Abu Dhabi investment holding company 2PointZero, a subsidiary of the United Arab Emirates’ largest listed entity, IHC. Archer says it has raised a total of $2 billion to date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xKkVny"&gt;Archer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22529534/archer-maker-air-taxi-evtol-reveal-specs"&gt;came out of stealth in spring 2020&lt;/a&gt; after having poached key talent from Wisk (formerly Kitty Hawk) and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/1/16961688/airbus-vahana-evtol-first-test-flight"&gt;Airbus’ Vahana&lt;/a&gt; project. (Wisk later sued for alleged trade secret theft, which was finally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/10/23827522/wisk-archer-air-taxi-lawsuit-settlement-boeing"&gt;settled last year&lt;/a&gt;.) The company has a &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/united-airlines-orders-1-billion-in-evtol-aircraft-from-archer-2021-2"&gt;$1 billion order from United Airlines&lt;/a&gt; for its aircraft and a deal to mass-produce its eVTOL craft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/4/23538953/stellantis-archer-electric-air-taxi-evtol-midnight-mass-produce-investment"&gt;with global automaker Stellantis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1O3Pe7Lv3iy35aflGkpGeBG-f_M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25786093/2024_1209_Lockup_16_9_vF.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nipPNF"&gt;Alongside Archer, other eVTOL companies hope to eventually win full Federal Aviation Administration approval. That got a boost recently when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24276873/faa-powered-lift-evtol-air-taxi-final-rule-sfar"&gt;the agency published&lt;/a&gt; highly anticipated &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/integration-powered-lift-pilot-certification-and-operations-miscellaneous-amendments"&gt;final regulations&lt;/a&gt; for eVTOL vehicles that it says will chart the path for the “air travel of the future.” &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/billynolen_our-team-at-archer-is-very-pleased-with-the-activity-7254933085937446912-EKcO/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=member_desktop"&gt;Archer praised&lt;/a&gt; the FAA for “providing clear direction on what is required for the safe operation of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ytt78O"&gt;Air taxis, sometimes misidentified by the mainstream media as “flying cars,” are essentially helicopters without the noisy, polluting gas motors (though they certainly have their own unique noise profile). In addition to Archer, companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/1/16959698/joby-aviation-evtol-100-million-investment"&gt;Joby Aviation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21439393/volocopter-air-taxi-flight-ticket-reservation-price"&gt;Volocopter&lt;/a&gt;, and Beta Technologies have claimed they are on the cusp of launching services that will eventually scale up nationwide. But others have floundered; German company Lilium recently said that two of its subsidiaries &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24278673/lilium-air-taxi-evtol-insolvency-operations"&gt;were insolvent and could cease operations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xyKtMv"&gt;Meanwhile, Anduril is a military technology company, founded by Oculus creator Luckey, that makes surveillance and reconnaissance tech &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/7/23392441/palmer-luckey-anduril-military-first-weapons-loitering-munitions-drones"&gt;as well as military drones&lt;/a&gt;. The company recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24313486/openai-anduril-partnership-counterdrone-systems"&gt;teamed up with OpenAI&lt;/a&gt; to integrate the ChatGPT maker’s software into Anduril’s counterdrone systems. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pokémon TCG Pocket’s new expansion drops next week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IvqrOjeKBv-JSgNycduaQs0bATA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73782313/MythicalIsland.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Pokémon Company&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZGOywR"&gt;If you’ve been playing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/19/24248306/pokemon-tcg-pocket-hands-on"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon TCG Pocket&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;since launch, you’ve probably already collected most of the cards from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/19/24223570/pokemon-tcg-pocket-hits-ios-and-android-october-30th"&gt;the game’s first expansion&lt;/a&gt;. But a new set is about to debut in just a few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SJCPDs"&gt;Today, The Pokémon Company announced that Mythical Island, a new expansion set featuring the pokémon Mew, is coming to &lt;em&gt;Pokémon TCG Pocket &lt;/em&gt;on December 17th. A trailer for the expansion reveals a handful of new Pokémon cards coming to the game for the first time like Purrloin, Serperior, and Marshadow. Previously, the only way to obtain a Mew card was by collecting cards featuring each of the 150 original pokémon from the Kantonian Pokédex, but it should be much easier to snag the new Mew EX card simply by ripping a few packs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zi5L0b"&gt;The Pokémon Company also announced that &lt;em&gt;TCG Pocket &lt;/em&gt;has exceeded 60 million iOS and Android downloads since the game launched at the end of October. The ability to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24296690/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trade-cards"&gt;actually trade cards with other people&lt;/a&gt; hasn’t come to the game just yet, but it’s going to be very useful given that there’s a bunch of fresh cards on the way.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Voicemod launches its voice-changing dongle for Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w-s7QnWF5HapaTle7ulTulOG6B4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73782192/Voicemod_Key_hed.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Voicemod&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o5HRES"&gt;Voicemod has released a hardware solution that enables its popular soundboard and voice-changing desktop software to work on Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch consoles. &lt;a href="https://www.voicemod.net/en/vmkey/"&gt;The Voicemod Key dongle&lt;/a&gt; is now available in the US after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/18/24200304/voicemod-key-xbox-playstation-voice-changer-soundboard"&gt;initially being teased in July&lt;/a&gt;, with Voicemod planning to launch it in additional countries “soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9k8dq4"&gt;Universal voice changers have previously been limited to desktop PCs and Macs, with software limitations preventing Voicemod from building an app for consoles. The Voicemod Key serves as a workaround — it sports a USB-C connection that plugs into a tablet or smartphone (including older iPhones thanks to an included lightning adapter), and two audio jacks that connect to your console and a wired gaming headset. The Voicemod mobile app can then be used to access the platform’s soundboard and real-time voice-changing features in console chats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s an example of how the setup works — it’s worth noting that Voicemod Key will only work with wired headsets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="riO24h"&gt;The Voicemod Key is supported on iOS 16 and Android 8.1 or higher. Availability is restricted to paid Voicemod subscribers, and the Key price will depend on your...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic’s dream is starting to come true — its store will be preinstalled on ‘millions’ of Android phones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Illustration of the Epic Games logo and Google logo inside of a Google Play logo." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_aT1nyeM1x3dbvpSeD7T_om1u80=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73782043/236883_Epic_Vs_Google_B_CVirginia.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Cath Virginia / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3wdoKW"&gt;Telefónica, one of the largest carriers in the world serving the UK, Spain, Germany, and Latin America with the O2 and Movistar networks, will begin preinstalling the Epic Games Store on every new compatible Android phone it sells — including Samsung phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ojs9Az"&gt;It’s part of a “long term partnership” to bring the store and smash hit &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; to “millions” of the carrier’s devices, according to Telefónica and Epic. It’ll be the first time the Epic Games Store is preinstalled on consumer phones, and it could be the next big step in realizing Epic’s dreams of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/2024/10/7/24243316/epic-google-permanent-injunction-ruling-third-party-stores"&gt;challenging Google’s app store monopoly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/20/23970123/tim-sweeney-just-laughed-and-agreed-hed-love-to-make-billions-of-dollars-by-not-paying-google-anythi"&gt;increasing its cut of revenue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="9lsVDp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Fortnite is back on the iPhone — with a whole app store in tow","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/16/24221361/fortnite-iphone-epic-games-app-store"},{"title":"Epic v. Google: everything we learned in Fortnite court","url":"https://www.theverge.com/23945184/epic-v-google-fortnite-play-store-antitrust-trial-updates"},{"title":"Epic is suing Google — again — and now Samsung, too","url":"https://www.theverge.com/policy/2024/9/30/24256395/epic-sues-google-samsung-antitrust-auto-blocker"},{"title":"Epic has a plan for the rest of the decade","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/5/24262376/epic-unreal-engine-6-fortnite-metaverse-plans"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="87KrqV"&gt;Last December, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23994174/epic-google-trial-jury-verdict-monopoly-google-play"&gt;a federal jury unanimously sided with Epic Games&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Google&lt;/em&gt;, finding that Google had turned its Android app store and Google Play Billing service into an illegal monopoly. Epic originally sued in 2020, alleging that Google had “blocked” or “bribed” phonemakers and cellular carriers to keep games like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;and alternative app stores from being preinstalled on phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yTSRSu"&gt;But now, roughly a month after Judge James Donato barred Google from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/18/24271996/google-epic-lawsuit-play-third-party-app-store-changes-delayed-administrative-stay-granted#:~:text=Starting%20November%201st%2C%202024%2C%20and%20continuing%20until%20November%201st%2C%202027%2C"&gt;any further potential blocks or bribes&lt;/a&gt;, one of the world’s largest carriers will begin those preinstalls, adding an entire rival game store (one that may also carry non-game apps in the future) to Google’s own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CGtfq1"&gt;Technically, Epic only launched its Epic Games Store on mobile &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/16/24221361/fortnite-iphone-epic-games-app-store"&gt;this past August&lt;/a&gt;. Previously, it wanted nearly every phonemaker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs#:~:text=95.%20Epic%20approached%20nearly%20every%20Android%20phone%20manufacturer%20to%20preinstall%20Fortnite%20%E2%80%94%20and%20it%20gave%20Samsung%2012%20percent%20of%20its%20revenue%20there"&gt;and carrier&lt;/a&gt; to preinstall one of a couple different types of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; installer apps to bring the game to their phones. It offered a variety of deals to tempt them, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/30/23983345/epic-approached-most-every-oem-about-preinstalling-fortnite"&gt;and Samsung, LG, OnePlus and Huawei all initially agreed to do so&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Un7rUK"&gt;But OnePlus only ever managed to do so in India, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/13/23959264/oneplus-needed-permission-from-google-to-preinstall-fortnite-on-its-phones"&gt;allegedly because&lt;/a&gt; it needed permission that Google wouldn’t grant. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/13/23959430/google-suggests-oneplus-made-its-own-strategic-choice-not-to-preinstall-the-fortnite-launcher"&gt;Google disputes that reasoning&lt;/a&gt;.) LG apparently backed out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368395/fortnite-epic-games-oneplus-deal-google-play-store-lawsuit-lg"&gt;because of a Google contract&lt;/a&gt; as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fxoYbX"&gt;Telefónica wasn’t one of the carriers that Google “bribed,” Epic spokesperson Natalie Muñoz confirms to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, so it’s not like Judge Donato’s order is making this newly possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="skLr26"&gt;In fact, Telefónica has partnered with Epic in the past. In 2020, it began letting Movistar customers in Spain tack their &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; purchases onto their phone bill. That year, court documents revealed Telefónica &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs#:~:text=95.%20Epic%20approached%20nearly%20every%20Android%20phone%20manufacturer%20to%20preinstall%20Fortnite%20%E2%80%94%20and%20it%20gave%20Samsung%2012%20percent%20of%20its%20revenue%20there"&gt;could expect to earn five percent of the proceeds&lt;/a&gt; from those &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; players as a result. Verizon and Hutchison (Three, Wind Tre) were offered similar deals, but we don’t know if they’ll now follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8rPux2"&gt;I wonder what Samsung thinks about Telefónica preinstalling the Epic Game Store on its phones — this September, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/2024/9/30/24256395/epic-sues-google-samsung-antitrust-auto-blocker"&gt;Epic sued Samsung as well&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best deals on Apple Watches right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Woman holding a purse while modeling the Stripes watchface on the Apple Watch SE (2022)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vUtHEiuDx24RW8LhsX7Z25vWPX0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976955/226292_Apple_Watch_SE_PHO_akrales_0047.55.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The latest Apple Watch SE is an entry-level smartwatch if there ever was one.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5yaz1u"&gt;In September, Apple launched its latest smartwatch, introducing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24246464/apple-watch-series-10-review-smartwatch-wearables"&gt;Apple Watch Series 10&lt;/a&gt; alongside a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/19/24248380/apple-watch-ultra-2-black-smartwatch-wearables"&gt;black rendition&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23878981/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-review-double-tap-precision-finding-siri"&gt;Apple Watch Ultra 2&lt;/a&gt;. Each wearable has its own pros and cons, as does the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23369207/apple-watch-se-2022-review-smartwatch"&gt;second-gen Apple Watch SE&lt;/a&gt;, but the recent introduction of the new wearables also means there are now more Apple Watch models on the market than ever before — and a lot more deals to be had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="CWUc7k"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:11906226"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sHcaqK"&gt;But with all of those options, which one should you pick? Generally speaking, you want to buy the newest watch you can afford so that it continues to receive software updates from Apple. The latest update, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/25/24253366/watch-os-11-apple-watch-smartwatch"&gt;watchOS 11&lt;/a&gt;, launched in September on the Apple Watch Series 6 and newer, ultimately leaving those still using an older Series 4 or Series 5 behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C0aQBE"&gt;Picking up a watch from the latest (or a recent) generation ensures you’re getting a smartwatch with an updated design, a robust number of features, and plenty of sensors. Now, let’s get to the deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="0Qe5br"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to choose which Apple Watch to buy","url":"https://www.theverge.com/23037217/best-apple-watch-series-se-ultra"},{"title":"The best AirPods deals available right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"},{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hZHCRf"&gt;The best Apple Watch Series 10 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="kuzcBW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:12429524"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="rOw2iI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:12462708"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KCUrjH"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 10 represents the latest wearable in Apple’s flagship Series lineup. It features the new S10 SiP chip, faster charging, and a wide-angle OLED display that’s brighter, larger, and easier to read than that of previous models. It weighs half as much as the Ultra, too, and is about 30 percent thinner despite its new 42mm and 46mm sizing. Other upgrades include an added depth and water temperature sensor, as well as a new FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection feature, the latter of which is also available on the last-gen Series 9 and Ultra 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="rPKDmW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Watch sleep apnea detection gets FDA clearance","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/16/24246150/apple-watch-sleep-apnea-detection-fda-approval"},{"title":"The Apple Watch is now a better TV remote","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/19/24249074/apple-watch-watchos-11-tv-remote"},{"title":"Here’s how the new Apple Watch Series 10 stacks up to other models","url":"https://www.theverge.com/24240412/apple-watch-series-10-vs-ultra-2-se-comparison-specs-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PS4qua"&gt;While the improvements are certainly welcome, the Series 10 isn’t a vast departure from the prior model, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23878981/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-review-double-tap-precision-finding-siri"&gt;Series 9&lt;/a&gt;. That being said, you can already pick up Apple’s latest wearable at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGHV8NLZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; in the 42mm sizing with GPS starting at $329.99 (about $69 off) thanks to an on-page coupon. The GPS-equipped model is also on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGJ4QLYH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; in the 46mm variant for $359.99 (about $69 off), while the LTE models can be had at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGJGX496/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; starting at $429.99 (about $69 off). Both of the latter discounts also require you to clip the on-page coupon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="JK0Ak4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:12152926"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ElCzgR"&gt;In 2023, Apple introduced the Apple Watch Series 9 alongside the second-gen Ultra. It uses Apple’s last-gen S9 SiP chip and a second-gen ultra wideband chip, which allow for onboard Siri processing and precision finding with select iPhone models. It also features a brighter, 2,000-nit display and support for Apple’s nifty “double tap” feature — two minor additions that are also present on the Series 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="eSbn28"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to customize double tap on the Apple Watch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/23930197/double-tap-apple-watch-how-to-use"},{"title":"The best MagSafe and Qi2 chargers for your iPhone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/23505846/best-magsafe-magnetic-chargers-apple-iphone"},{"title":"The Apple Watch made smartwatches the wearable of choice","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/8/24237890/apple-watch-10-years-smartwatch-wearables"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eN7K4x"&gt;The Series 9 has been out for more than a year, but certain configurations have become increasingly difficult to find with the arrival of Apple’s latest watch. Luckily, the GPS-equipped Series 9 is still on sale at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-series-9-2024%2F-%2FA-93149277%2F&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; in the 41mm sizing starting at $299.99 ($100 off), or in the 45mm configuration at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-9-GPS-41mm-Midnight-Aluminum-Case-Sport-Band-S-M-Fitness-Tracker-ECG-Apps-Always-On-Retina-Display-Water-Resistant%2F5405516867&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-series-9-2024%2F-%2FA-93149277%2F&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; starting at $329 ($100 off). There are also a handful of deals to be had on the LTE models with cellular connectivity, though none of them undercut the current price of the LTE-equipped Series 10 model by much, hence their exclusion here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="1D7GZC"&gt;

&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;The Apple Watch SE &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/7/23328608/apple-watch-se-new-second-gen-price-specs-features-release-date"&gt;received a refresh in late 2022&lt;/a&gt;. It has the same chipset as the Series 8, which is great, but with fewer sensors, no always-on display, and a slightly outdated design compared to the Series 8, Series 9, and Series 10. Those omissions might take this out of the running for some people, but it still may be exactly what you’re after. Best of all, it starts at $249 for the 40mm Wi-Fi / GPS model, which is $30 less than the previous generation’s baseline cost. Opting for cellular connectivity bumps the starting price up to $299 for the 40mm size (44mm adds $20 to each configuration).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="58AJpB"&gt;The latest Apple Watch Ultra launched at $799 in September of last year with GPS and LTE support, much like the original model. The ultra-capable smartwatch has the most features, sensors, and ruggedness of any Apple Watch model available thus far, along with a display that’s 50 percent brighter than the first Ultra. The 49mm smartwatch also packs Apple’s S9 SiP and second-gen ultra wideband chips, just like the Apple Watch Series 9, while maintaining long-lasting battery life, precise GPS tracking, and a bevy of diving-friendly sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="pluEiH"&gt;In recent months, we saw the Apple Watch Ultra 2 dip to as low as $642 ($157 off) in select configurations. Right now, however, it’s only on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSVL1GS9/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://howl.link/d29bs492vs57y"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; with a Trail Loop starting at $719.99 (about $79 off) or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSVG1668/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; with an Alpine Loop starting at $759.99 (about $39 off). You can also pick it up with an Ocean Band at either &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSVB9C5G/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://howl.link/14s4vjiis1isj"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, though neither retailer is currently discounting the burlier configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="MpVWgd"&gt;A note on the more premium models&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="7aHrsm"&gt;While all of the Apple Watch models and colorways covered here are encased in aluminum (except the Ultra 2, which has a titanium build), Apple does make a more premium range built out of stainless steel and titanium. These offerings are functionally and aesthetically similar to their aluminum counterparts, with slightly refined colors and finishings — polished for the stainless steel and brushed for the titanium. However, they start at much steeper prices of $699 and above. They, too, can often be found on sale, but they’re never discounted as low as the standard base models, so we don’t include them here.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Steam is adding a new default option for game updates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of the Steam logo." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FgRQ1mP0A5jZfx3eoisCjs7YlLs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73781656/STK138_Stream_Kradtke_01.0.jpg" /&gt;

  &lt;p id="bCyPDn"&gt;Valve is &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/4696782040345941642"&gt;testing an option&lt;/a&gt; in the new Steam client beta that will force games by default to only download updates when you launch them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iarvvb"&gt;Currently, Steam by default decides what game updates to download based on a few different things. As explained by Valve:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="5aalMe"&gt;For games you recently played, Steam will download game updates shortly after they are released. For games that you haven’t played in a while, Steam might wait a few days to bundle multiple updates together or choose to download the update while you are asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="dpJeU4"&gt;This new default option to wait to download an update gives players more control; as Valve points out, it means that users can hold an updating a massive game until they actually want to play it, which could be a relief for people with bandwidth caps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MJGSlw"&gt;You’ll find the new option in the beta Steam client settings under the Downloads section. “You can set the default to: let Steam decide when to update the game (based on factors like when you last played the game, bandwidth availability, etc.) or wait to update until the game is launched,” Valve says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RzD1fP"&gt;You can still set per-game download settings in a game’s Properties that override the global setting, but those options have “cleaned up descriptions,” according to Valve. And with the beta, you can also manage the per-game overrides in the overall Steam client Downloads settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

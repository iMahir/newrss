    <title>Solos challenges Meta’s Ray-Bans with $299 ChatGPT smart glasses</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Solos AirGo Vision smart glasses in the krypton 1 frame style." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U3zCm7bc-loXzewOTl25ad4e0Yw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73778005/Solo_AirGo_Vision_grey.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Solos&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lTT8tD"&gt;Solos’ camera-equipped smart glasses have arrived to provide some much-needed competition against Meta’s Ray-Bans. The AirGo Vision is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsolosglasses.com%2Fpages%2Fairgo%25E2%2584%25A2-v-pre-sale&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F12%2F10%2F24317805%2Fsolos-airgo-vision-chatgpt-ai-smart-glasses-price-availability" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available now starting at $299&lt;/a&gt; — the same price as the Ray-Ban Meta eyewear tech — and features integration with OpenAI’s GPT-4o AI model to identify and answer questions about the people, objects, and text seen by the camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dsIsQZ"&gt;That allows the AirGo Vision to do things like translate text into different languages, provide directions to nearby locations or landmarks, and give the wearer more information about what they’re looking at. Solos says the glasses can also be integrated with other AI models like Google Gemini and Anthropic’s Claude, something the company previously teased &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/28/24188457/solos-airgo-vision-glasses-chatgpt-ray-ban-meta-competitor"&gt;when it announced the AirGo Vision in June&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cL48gY"&gt;Like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23922425/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review"&gt;Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses&lt;/a&gt;, the AirGo Vision camera can capture photos on demand. A swappable frame system means that you can wear the glasses with or without the camera — the battery and touch sensors used to control the device are housed in the frame’s USB-C chargeable hinges, providing an audio-only option when paired with the standard, no-camera-included AirGo frames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mUosO8"&gt;“One thing we promised to deliver on was allowing consumers to have control of their experience with AI and smart technology, particularly with privacy options in mind,” Solos co-founder Kenneth Fan said in the announcement. “That’s why we developed frames that can easily be changed to decide when and where a camera may be appropriate without sacrificing any of the fun features.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7O9L5LvN7FKL8XYA4FDgAiDELy4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25783293/1_R1.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Solos&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s a frontal view of the Krypton 1 frame style...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HUIrkt-RXd_WsJYjghOIbPmHyLQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25783298/1_R1__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Solos&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;...compared to the slimmer Krypton 2 design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7nvDtQ"&gt;Soros says the Vision comes “with the option to purchase the frame only for $149 or bundle a camera frame with a regular frame for enhanced privacy, priced at $349.” It’s available in seven colors and two frame styles: Krypton 1, which sports a large square design with prominent nose pads, and the slimmer Krypton 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xbHqW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LQYOm2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite FTC refunds are starting to show up</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An image from Fortnite" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BOevAsvAqsx32lzKAn-CUr88xlM=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73777983/fortnite_chapter_6_image.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mw0o0d"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; players have finally &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/12/ftc-sends-refund-payments-consumers-impacted-epic-games-unlawful-billing-practices"&gt;started receiving refunds&lt;/a&gt; as part of a settlement Epic Games reached with the Federal Trade Commission, which claimed the developer tricked players into making in-game purchases. So far, &lt;a href="https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2024/12/refunds-way-fortnite-gamers-charged-unwanted-items?utm_campaign=new_consumer_alert:_refun&amp;amp;utm_content=1733768289&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=facebook"&gt;the FTC says&lt;/a&gt; it sent out more than 600,000 payments totaling $72 million, and &lt;a href="https://x.com/aiddennson/status/1866219417652330587"&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://x.com/thoubean/status/1866314100818772374"&gt;players&lt;/a&gt;, including some of us here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, have already reported receiving payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sQHK3W"&gt;In 2022, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/19/23516464/epic-games-ftc-settlement-fortnite-privacy-violations-purchases"&gt;Epic Games agreed to pay $245 million&lt;/a&gt; to compensate players affected by &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s alleged “counterintuitive, inconsistent, and confusing button configuration” that the FTC said led to unwanted purchases. The FTC is currently sending payments to players who submitted valid claims before October 8th, 2024, but it’s reviewing the claims it received after that date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NR59gg"&gt;There’s still time to file a claim for a &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; refund if you haven’t yet, as the FTC is giving players until January 10th, 2025 to submit a claim. You can find more information about the refunds &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/refunds/fortnite-refunds"&gt;on the FTC’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Vergecast Vergecast, part two</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A Vergecast logo, on a Vergecast illustration background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sKxnj-PmLOSBZNO9Z8lZJehbEos=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73777970/VST_1210_Site.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Alex Parkin / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tuLnEq"&gt;Every once in a while, we turn &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt; inward. Not only are we constantly covering and discussing what’s happening in the tech and media worlds, we’re also living it ourselves. We’re trying to navigate changes in platforms and economies, and figure out the best ways to do our work and share it with you. And it’s complicated! So, once a year or so, we get into the weeds of how it all works for us here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qqVZKL"&gt;On &lt;a href="https://link.chtbl.com/vergecast"&gt;this episode of &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it’s all inside baseball, all the time. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/helen-havlak"&gt;Helen Havlak&lt;/a&gt;, our publisher (and everybody’s boss), joins the show to talk about our new subscription: why we’re doing it now, how we decided on a price, why we’re not getting rid of &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;the ads, and what we’re thinking about going forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3D9lDy"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://player.megaphone.fm/VMP8870588891" style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 200px;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RkAqbO"&gt;After that, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/nilay-patel"&gt;Nilay Patel&lt;/a&gt;, our editor-in-chief and your &lt;em&gt;Vergecast&lt;/em&gt; co-host and friend, joins to talk about everything else you’ve been wondering. We talk about host-read ads, what we do during ad breaks, how &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is like a Montessori, what he thinks about our redesign two years later, and more. We got so many good questions — thanks to everyone who called and emailed! — and we couldn’t get to them all, but we tried to answer as many as we could. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6h6OhV"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3IHdf2"&gt;If you want to know more about what &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is up to, and where we think (gestures widely) &lt;em&gt;all this &lt;/em&gt;is headed, here are a few links to get you started:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The dead are still raging in 28 Years Later’s first trailer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A wide shot of a massive tree growing out of a hill. On either side of the tree stand small groups of naked, emaciated zombies." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oJfZxMrroBbw1LFv9hkZwrEd7dQ=/356x0:1895x1026/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73777967/Screenshot_2024_12_10_at_8.27.03_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bsQkjd"&gt;It feels like we only just heard that Danny Boyle and Alex Garland’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24034340/28-years-later-movie-danny-boyle-alex-garland"&gt;&lt;em&gt;28 Years Later  &lt;/em&gt;was in development&lt;/a&gt;, but the long-awaited sequel already has a full-length trailer and a solid release date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cOF53F"&gt;Set almost 30 years after the initial outbreak of the rage virus, &lt;em&gt;28 Years Later &lt;/em&gt;focuses on the lives of a new group of survivors who have managed to find a modicum of safety living on an isolated, tied island. Because the island is only connected to the mainland by a long, thin, heavily-guarded path that seems like it might disappear when the tide comes in, people like Jamie (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) are able to build semi-stable lives for themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ojiiWt"&gt;But things are very different and dangerous on the mainland where time has given rise to all sorts of new mutations in the infected. Though the trailer doesn’t really give you a sense of why Jamie wants to journey into infected territory, it makes it clear that he’ll encounter other people who have somehow managed to survive living among the rabid pseudo-undead. Between the &lt;em&gt;Purge&lt;/em&gt;-like masks and towers of skulls on display in the trailer, the mainland human survivors almost seem more ghoulish than the infected they live in fear of. But as disturbing as the trailer is, what makes it pretty delightful is the news that &lt;em&gt;28 Years Later &lt;/em&gt;is set to hit theaters on June 20th, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Yelp’s new AI-powered review filters will show more of what you want to know</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YPAKY0KUhQjt-fni0jyfE4LvyS8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73777744/Yelp_AI_review_insights.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Yelp&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YRSOxE"&gt;Yelp is introducing some new AI features that aim to help users discover new establishments and narrow down customer reviews. The AI-powered “Review Insights,” &lt;a href="https://blog.yelp.com/news/end-of-year-product-release-2024/"&gt;announced today as part of Yelp’s end-of-year product release&lt;/a&gt;, quickly summarize how customers feel about certain aspects of a business, such as food quality, service, ambiance, and wait times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l1tbQB"&gt;Review insights are aggregated sentiment scores that provide a quick overview of topics using facial icons  — positive, neutral, and critical — displayed above a business’s reviews. Yelp users can click specific topics to read related reviews that focus on those aspects of the business, such as what customers are saying about the food or service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WiAezn"&gt;Yelp says the feature is available on iOS for restaurant, food, and nightlife businesses, and will be expanded to services categories “next year.” Review insights builds on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/30/24054806/yelp-ai-business-summary-reviews"&gt;AI-powered review summaries feature&lt;/a&gt; that Yelp introduced in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RM1W90"&gt;“When searching for a local restaurant, you might have a specific aspect in mind that matters most to you — be it the vibe of the space, how long it takes to get a table, or the quality of the food,” said Yelp’s Chief Product Officer Craig Saldanha in the announcement blog. “Even when a review doesn’t explicitly mention one of the topics, the LLM understands the context in the review to identify and surface the relevant topic and sentiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UPUw17EbiIekTgDF9Au6bD55SU4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25783156/Yelp_AI_homepage.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Yelp&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Heads up — Yelp will autoplay and unmute the full-screen user videos on the iOS app homepage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1sKgbn"&gt;The home feed search bar on iOS now features a trending drop-down that highlights the most popular terms other local users are looking for, which will be coming to Android “early next year.” The iOS app home page has also been expanded to include new reviews, photos, and full-screen video spotlights uploaded by other users that surface recent experiences. Yelp says it’s rolling out an AI-powered update that “better tailors the home feed to your preferences” in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ThkiSK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ScQaNN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Suicide Squad game’s final season is coming less than a year after launch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A screenshot from Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3Yd1d2GV6ugP-AMaOScR0QbeMiA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73777090/ss_6cf9f98dcf74e2c228b1cdae3bbd38ca754398d3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Warner Bros. Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ILz2dD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&lt;/em&gt; only came out in February, but the game’s final season, which starts tomorrow, is going to be its last. Season 4 Episode 7 launches on Tuesday, and Episode 8, which is set to release on January 14th, 2025, will “serve as the last seasonal Episode for &lt;em&gt;Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League,” &lt;/em&gt;developer Rocksteady &lt;a href="https://www.suicidesquadgame.com/en-us/community/season-4-deep-dive"&gt;announced on Monday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g9VbLL"&gt;After the release of the final content, the game will still be available to play online, according to &lt;a href="https://dcgamessupport.wbgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/36121518094995-SEASON-4-FAQ"&gt;a WB Games FAQ&lt;/a&gt;. But the game is also getting an offline mode tomorrow — which had been &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-is-getting-an-offline-mode-after-all-but-not-until-sometime-after-its-out/"&gt;previously announced&lt;/a&gt;, though without a specific date beyond “2024” — that will let you play the main story and all seasonal story mission content without an internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gifbw4"&gt;The game has had a troubled history. The game was originally set to release &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21376280/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-game-trailer-rocksteady"&gt;in 2022&lt;/a&gt; before being delayed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/23/22992865/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-delay-spring-2023-announcement-ps5-xsx-pc"&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/13/23682376/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-delayed-february-2024"&gt;times&lt;/a&gt;. And a largely unsuccessful launch — in our review, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24062243/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review-ps5-xbox-pc"&gt;we said&lt;/a&gt; the game “hides its brash personality under a generic looter shooter” — resulted in Warner Bros. Discovery announcing in May that it would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172905/suicide-squad-kill-justice-league-200-million-loss-wbd-rocksteady"&gt;taking a $200 million loss&lt;/a&gt; on the game.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google reveals quantum computing chip with ‘breakthrough’ achievements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An image showing Google’s quantum computing chip" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mVRMOW5JJ1AYKF0OBxypm7KxTQs=/158x0:2216x1372/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73777044/google_willow_chip.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SNCEpo"&gt;Google’s quantum computing lab just achieved a major milestone. On Monday,&lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/"&gt; the company revealed&lt;/a&gt; that its new quantum computing chip, Willow, is capable of performing a computing challenge in less than five minutes — a process Google says would take one of the world’s fastest supercomputers 10 septillion years, or longer than the age of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VSSPHZ"&gt;That’s a big jump from 2019 when Google announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/23/20928294/google-quantum-supremacy-sycamore-computer-qubit-milestone"&gt;quantum processor could complete&lt;/a&gt; a mathematical equation in three minutes, as opposed to 10,000 years on a supercomputer. IBM &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/google-quantum-computing-quantum-supremacy-claim-by-google-disputed-by-ibm/"&gt;disputed the claim&lt;/a&gt; at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ll8Qav"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FgZ-8NFSysA?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i9Tw9t"&gt;Along with more powerful performance, researchers also found a way to reduce errors, something Google calls “one of the greatest challenges in quantum computing.” Instead of bits, which represent either 1 or 0, quantum computing uses qubits, &lt;a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/qubit#:~:text=A%20classical%20bit%20can%20only%20exist%20in%20either%20a%200%20position%20or%20a%201%20position.%20Qubits%2C%20however%2C%20can%20also%20occupy%20a%20third%20state%20known%20as%20a%20superposition.%20A%20superposition%20represents%200%2C%201%2C%20and%20all%20the%20positions%20in%20between%20taken%20at%20once%2C%20for%20a%20total%20of%20three%20separate%20positions."&gt;a unit that can exist in multiple states&lt;/a&gt; at the same time, such as 1, 0, and anything in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eYQdPw"&gt;As noted by Google, qubits are prone to errors because they “have a tendency to rapidly exchange information with their environment.” However, Google’s researchers discovered a way to reduce errors by introducing more qubits to a system and were able to correct them in real time. Their findings were &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08449-y"&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUkmo6"&gt;“This historic accomplishment is known in the field as ‘below threshold’ — being able to drive errors down while scaling up the number of qubits,” Google Quantum AI founder Hartmut Neven writes on Google’s blog. “You must demonstrate being below threshold to show real progress on error correction, and this has been an outstanding challenge since &lt;a href="https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.52.R2493"&gt;quantum error correction&lt;/a&gt; was introduced by Peter Shor in 1995.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dHgwUo"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" align="center"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Introducing Willow, our new state-of-the-art quantum computing chip with a breakthrough that can reduce errors exponentially as we scale up using more qubits, cracking a 30-year challenge in the field. In benchmark tests, Willow solved a standard computation in &amp;lt;5 mins that would…&lt;/p&gt;— Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sundarpichai/status/1866167429367468422?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 9, 2024&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="noYp4l"&gt;Willow, which has 105 qubits, “now has best-in-class performance,” according to Neven. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/8/24120103/microsoft-says-its-cracked-the-code-on-an-important-quantum-computing-problem"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/16/24158365/quantum-computing-network-aws-amazon-harvard"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23988271/ibm-quantum-heron-system-two-jerry-chow-qubits"&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt; are working on quantum computing systems of their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KL9Wqh"&gt;Google’s next goal is to perform a first “useful, beyond-classical” computation that is both “relevant to a real-world application” and one that typical computers can’t achieve. Going forward, Neven says quantum technology will be “indispensable” for collecting AI training data, eventually helping to “discover new medicines, designing more efficient batteries for electric cars, and accelerating progress in fusion and new energy alternatives.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify shuts down Car Thing, and now owners have one last chance at a refund</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="car thing device mounted to a car vent" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0AohiSbsgfavvcQxXoO60ZzDVkc=/235x28:1938x1163/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73776966/acarman_20210412_4524_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Ashley Carman / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ImhDP4"&gt;Spotify has officially shut down its Car Thing accessory that offered simple and slick control over music and playlists while driving, and it’s giving owners just over a month (January 14th) to reach out to the company and get a refund. The device started to display its final words early today as &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CarThing/comments/1haaywe/car_thing_is_officially_dead/"&gt;enthusiasts mourn the loss of the device on its dedicated subreddit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wX4GQD"&gt;The final message on the Car Thing reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="9KzaF9"&gt;Car Thing is discontinued and no longer operational. Thank you for being on this journey with us, safe travels. For more information, visit &lt;a href="http://carthing.com"&gt;carthing.com&lt;/a&gt;. Contact customer service by no later than January 14th, 2025 to discuss your refund options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="QVqfJZ"&gt;Spotify &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/23/24163383/spotify-car-thing-discontinued-december-2024"&gt;announced in May&lt;/a&gt; that it intended the already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/27/23280357/spotify-stops-manufacturing-car-thing-q2-2022-earnings"&gt;discontinued&lt;/a&gt; devices would shut down in December, and now they have. The company also said, eventually, that it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/30/24168081/spotify-car-thing-end-of-life-customer-refund"&gt;work to issue refunds&lt;/a&gt;, but owners need to contact the company and provide proof of purchase to receive compensation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UfEAiC"&gt;For most users, the Spotify Car Thing is just another piece of e-waste humans will have to deal with later. The company recommends resetting it to factory settings and “safely disposing of your device following local electronic waste guidelines.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rUkIOf"&gt;However, tinkerers are finding new uses for the hardware: Car Thing can be hacked to run custom software that doesn’t require Spotify’s backend. &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2024/12/09/spotify-officially-kills-car-thing-remaining-units-no-longer-work/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;, it’s a bit underpowered to run full-on Android, but some projects like “&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DeskThing/"&gt;Desk Thing&lt;/a&gt;” can repurpose them as a controller at your computer desk.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Meta’s new Quest update has faster hand tracking and at-a-glance PC connections</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A photo of the Quest 3 and its controllers." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/chw1Ao8aQQ8JG2ZIOdvQD5PtGzY=/0x3:4240x2830/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73776936/Quest3hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: David Pierce / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CXWv9v"&gt;Meta has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meta.com%2Fblog%2Fquest%2Fmeta-quest-v72-update-remote-desktop-hand-tracking-keyboard-more%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F12%2F9%2F24317237%2Fmeta-quest-v72-update-pc-pairing-hand-tracking-keyboard-look" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the v72 Quest update, and it’s packed with features like faster hand tracking, an easier way to pair your headset with a Windows 11 PC, and better support for showing your keyboard while you’re in full virtual reality. The update is rolling out gradually, which also goes for certain features so you may not be able to use them immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="adxgwM"&gt;Meta says you can now connect to a paired PC with the Quest’s Remote Desktop feature simply by looking at it and tapping the “Connect” button that appears above your keyboard. That’s similar to how it works on the Vision Pro, but here, you’ll need the &lt;a href="https://aka.ms/mrlink"&gt;Mixed Reality Link app&lt;/a&gt; installed on your computer before you can pair the devices together from within your Quest headset’s Settings app. The feature requires Windows 11 22H2 and newer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot showing the new PC-connecting feature in action." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qRZ_9Ltw0z6AyyZHKDcOZYFz0g8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25782300/Meta_Quest_PC_connect.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Meta&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now you can connect to your PC just by looking at it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="M6AWbv"&gt;Also, in Quest v72, the company says it’s “rolling out a more general keyboard tracking system” that should detect and let any keyboard around you appear through a passthrough “window” while you’re in a virtual environment, similar to the Vision Pro. Quest headsets have had a feature that shows a virtual version of your keyboard where your real one is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22382805/oculus-quest-2-facebook-wireless-pc-streaming-120hz-infinite-office"&gt;since 2021&lt;/a&gt;, but that has only ever worked with specific keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nFRKN2"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0yx4V1655eA?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Cz6PeV"&gt;Meta also says it has made the hand cursor more stable when navigating, pinching to select things, and pinching and dragging windows. The company also says it’s now easier to use your hands while in confined spaces and that it added a “hand ray visualization” to help find and target things with the cursor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="whsEwG"&gt;There is a little bit more in the update, too, including new live captions for calls from the People app and the addition of direct messaging in the Instagram app. Meta also added a Media Gallery app for viewing your images, videos (spatial included), and screenshots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tKoSc2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="omrPIT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1l5iiH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Scientists advise EU to halt solar geoengineering</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A thin layer of ice thaws on a puddle in the sunshine." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a7NzGVV6zvnnh2DVYSE8QFKgaEk=/43x0:5728x3790/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73776836/2188259933.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="puc3RF"&gt;Scientific advisers to the European Commission are calling for a moratorium across the EU on efforts to artificially cool Earth through solar geoengineering. That includes controversial technologies used to reflect sunlight back into space, primarily by sending reflective particles into the atmosphere or by brightening clouds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dA5m8X"&gt;Proponents argue that this can help in the fight against climate change, especially as planet-heating greenhouse gas emissions continue to climb. But small-scale experiments have triggered backlash over concerns that these technologies could do more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T8XZVO"&gt;The European Commission asked its &lt;a href="https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2777/391614"&gt;Group of Chief Scientific Advisors&lt;/a&gt; (GCSA) and &lt;a href="https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2777/951016"&gt;European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies&lt;/a&gt; (EGE) to write up their opinions on solar geoengineering, which were published today alongside a &lt;a href="https://scientificadvice.eu/advice/solar-radiation-modification/"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; synthesizing what little we know about how these technologies might work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Xh9F7g"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Experiments have triggered backlash over concerns that these technologies could do more harm than good&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5c8AZg"&gt;There’s “insufficient scientific evidence” to show that solar geoengineering can actually prevent climate change, says the opinion written by the GCSA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LVBXyc"&gt;“Given the currently very high...&lt;/p&gt;

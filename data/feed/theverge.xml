    <title>Yelp’s new AI-powered review filters will show more of what you want to know</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YPAKY0KUhQjt-fni0jyfE4LvyS8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73777744/Yelp_AI_review_insights.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Yelp&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YRSOxE"&gt;Yelp is introducing some new AI features that aim to help users discover new establishments and narrow down customer reviews. The AI-powered “Review Insights,” &lt;a href="https://blog.yelp.com/news/end-of-year-product-release-2024/"&gt;announced today as part of Yelp’s end-of-year product release&lt;/a&gt;, quickly summarize how customers feel about certain aspects of a business, such as food quality, service, ambiance, and wait times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l1tbQB"&gt;Review insights are aggregated sentiment scores that provide a quick overview of topics using facial icons  — positive, neutral, and critical — displayed above a business’s reviews. Yelp users can click specific topics to read related reviews that focus on those aspects of the business, such as what customers are saying about the food or service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WiAezn"&gt;Yelp says the feature is available on iOS for restaurant, food, and nightlife businesses, and will be expanded to services categories “next year.” Review insights builds on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/30/24054806/yelp-ai-business-summary-reviews"&gt;AI-powered review summaries feature&lt;/a&gt; that Yelp introduced in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RM1W90"&gt;“When searching for a local restaurant, you might have a specific aspect in mind that matters most to you — be it the vibe of the space, how long it takes to get a table, or the quality of the food,” said Yelp’s Chief Product Officer Craig Saldanha in the announcement blog. “Even when a review doesn’t explicitly mention one of the topics, the LLM understands the context in the review to identify and surface the relevant topic and sentiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UPUw17EbiIekTgDF9Au6bD55SU4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25783156/Yelp_AI_homepage.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Yelp&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Heads up — Yelp will autoplay and unmute the full-screen user videos on the iOS app homepage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1sKgbn"&gt;The home feed search bar on iOS now features a trending drop-down that highlights the most popular terms other local users are looking for, which will be coming to Android “early next year.” The iOS app home page has also been expanded to include new reviews, photos, and full-screen video spotlights uploaded by other users that surface recent experiences. Yelp says it’s rolling out an AI-powered update that “better tailors the home feed to your preferences” in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ThkiSK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ScQaNN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Suicide Squad game’s final season is coming less than a year after launch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A screenshot from Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3Yd1d2GV6ugP-AMaOScR0QbeMiA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73777090/ss_6cf9f98dcf74e2c228b1cdae3bbd38ca754398d3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Warner Bros. Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ILz2dD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&lt;/em&gt; only came out in February, but the game’s final season, which starts tomorrow, is going to be its last. Season 4 Episode 7 launches on Tuesday, and Episode 8, which is set to release on January 14th, 2025, will “serve as the last seasonal Episode for &lt;em&gt;Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League,” &lt;/em&gt;developer Rocksteady &lt;a href="https://www.suicidesquadgame.com/en-us/community/season-4-deep-dive"&gt;announced on Monday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g9VbLL"&gt;After the release of the final content, the game will still be available to play online, according to &lt;a href="https://dcgamessupport.wbgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/36121518094995-SEASON-4-FAQ"&gt;a WB Games FAQ&lt;/a&gt;. But the game is also getting an offline mode tomorrow — which had been &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-is-getting-an-offline-mode-after-all-but-not-until-sometime-after-its-out/"&gt;previously announced&lt;/a&gt;, though without a specific date beyond “2024” — that will let you play the main story and all seasonal story mission content without an internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gifbw4"&gt;The game has had a troubled history. The game was originally set to release &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21376280/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-game-trailer-rocksteady"&gt;in 2022&lt;/a&gt; before being delayed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/23/22992865/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-delay-spring-2023-announcement-ps5-xsx-pc"&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/13/23682376/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-delayed-february-2024"&gt;times&lt;/a&gt;. And a largely unsuccessful launch — in our review, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24062243/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review-ps5-xbox-pc"&gt;we said&lt;/a&gt; the game “hides its brash personality under a generic looter shooter” — resulted in Warner Bros. Discovery announcing in May that it would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172905/suicide-squad-kill-justice-league-200-million-loss-wbd-rocksteady"&gt;taking a $200 million loss&lt;/a&gt; on the game.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google reveals quantum computing chip with ‘breakthrough’ achievements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An image showing Google’s quantum computing chip" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mVRMOW5JJ1AYKF0OBxypm7KxTQs=/158x0:2216x1372/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73777044/google_willow_chip.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SNCEpo"&gt;Google’s quantum computing lab just achieved a major milestone. On Monday,&lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/"&gt; the company revealed&lt;/a&gt; that its new quantum computing chip, Willow, is capable of performing a computing challenge in less than five minutes — a process Google says would take one of the world’s fastest supercomputers 10 septillion years, or longer than the age of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VSSPHZ"&gt;That’s a big jump from 2019 when Google announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/23/20928294/google-quantum-supremacy-sycamore-computer-qubit-milestone"&gt;quantum processor could complete&lt;/a&gt; a mathematical equation in three minutes, as opposed to 10,000 years on a supercomputer. IBM &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/google-quantum-computing-quantum-supremacy-claim-by-google-disputed-by-ibm/"&gt;disputed the claim&lt;/a&gt; at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ll8Qav"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FgZ-8NFSysA?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i9Tw9t"&gt;Along with more powerful performance, researchers also found a way to reduce errors, something Google calls “one of the greatest challenges in quantum computing.” Instead of bits, which represent either 1 or 0, quantum computing uses qubits, &lt;a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/qubit#:~:text=A%20classical%20bit%20can%20only%20exist%20in%20either%20a%200%20position%20or%20a%201%20position.%20Qubits%2C%20however%2C%20can%20also%20occupy%20a%20third%20state%20known%20as%20a%20superposition.%20A%20superposition%20represents%200%2C%201%2C%20and%20all%20the%20positions%20in%20between%20taken%20at%20once%2C%20for%20a%20total%20of%20three%20separate%20positions."&gt;a unit that can exist in multiple states&lt;/a&gt; at the same time, such as 1, 0, and anything in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eYQdPw"&gt;As noted by Google, qubits are prone to errors because they “have a tendency to rapidly exchange information with their environment.” However, Google’s researchers discovered a way to reduce errors by introducing more qubits to a system and were able to correct them in real time. Their findings were &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08449-y"&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUkmo6"&gt;“This historic accomplishment is known in the field as ‘below threshold’ — being able to drive errors down while scaling up the number of qubits,” Google Quantum AI founder Hartmut Neven writes on Google’s blog. “You must demonstrate being below threshold to show real progress on error correction, and this has been an outstanding challenge since &lt;a href="https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.52.R2493"&gt;quantum error correction&lt;/a&gt; was introduced by Peter Shor in 1995.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dHgwUo"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" align="center"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Introducing Willow, our new state-of-the-art quantum computing chip with a breakthrough that can reduce errors exponentially as we scale up using more qubits, cracking a 30-year challenge in the field. In benchmark tests, Willow solved a standard computation in &amp;lt;5 mins that would…&lt;/p&gt;— Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sundarpichai/status/1866167429367468422?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 9, 2024&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="noYp4l"&gt;Willow, which has 105 qubits, “now has best-in-class performance,” according to Neven. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/8/24120103/microsoft-says-its-cracked-the-code-on-an-important-quantum-computing-problem"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/16/24158365/quantum-computing-network-aws-amazon-harvard"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23988271/ibm-quantum-heron-system-two-jerry-chow-qubits"&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt; are working on quantum computing systems of their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KL9Wqh"&gt;Google’s next goal is to perform a first “useful, beyond-classical” computation that is both “relevant to a real-world application” and one that typical computers can’t achieve. Going forward, Neven says quantum technology will be “indispensable” for collecting AI training data, eventually helping to “discover new medicines, designing more efficient batteries for electric cars, and accelerating progress in fusion and new energy alternatives.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify shuts down Car Thing, and now owners have one last chance at a refund</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="car thing device mounted to a car vent" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0AohiSbsgfavvcQxXoO60ZzDVkc=/235x28:1938x1163/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73776966/acarman_20210412_4524_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Ashley Carman / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ImhDP4"&gt;Spotify has officially shut down its Car Thing accessory that offered simple and slick control over music and playlists while driving, and it’s giving owners just over a month (January 14th) to reach out to the company and get a refund. The device started to display its final words early today as &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CarThing/comments/1haaywe/car_thing_is_officially_dead/"&gt;enthusiasts mourn the loss of the device on its dedicated subreddit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wX4GQD"&gt;The final message on the Car Thing reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="9KzaF9"&gt;Car Thing is discontinued and no longer operational. Thank you for being on this journey with us, safe travels. For more information, visit &lt;a href="http://carthing.com"&gt;carthing.com&lt;/a&gt;. Contact customer service by no later than January 14th, 2025 to discuss your refund options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="QVqfJZ"&gt;Spotify &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/23/24163383/spotify-car-thing-discontinued-december-2024"&gt;announced in May&lt;/a&gt; that it intended the already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/27/23280357/spotify-stops-manufacturing-car-thing-q2-2022-earnings"&gt;discontinued&lt;/a&gt; devices would shut down in December, and now they have. The company also said, eventually, that it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/30/24168081/spotify-car-thing-end-of-life-customer-refund"&gt;work to issue refunds&lt;/a&gt;, but owners need to contact the company and provide proof of purchase to receive compensation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UfEAiC"&gt;For most users, the Spotify Car Thing is just another piece of e-waste humans will have to deal with later. The company recommends resetting it to factory settings and “safely disposing of your device following local electronic waste guidelines.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rUkIOf"&gt;However, tinkerers are finding new uses for the hardware: Car Thing can be hacked to run custom software that doesn’t require Spotify’s backend. &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2024/12/09/spotify-officially-kills-car-thing-remaining-units-no-longer-work/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;, it’s a bit underpowered to run full-on Android, but some projects like “&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DeskThing/"&gt;Desk Thing&lt;/a&gt;” can repurpose them as a controller at your computer desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="A8TQKS"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RxUmyFUajiE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Meta’s new Quest update has faster hand tracking and at-a-glance PC connections</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A photo of the Quest 3 and its controllers." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/chw1Ao8aQQ8JG2ZIOdvQD5PtGzY=/0x3:4240x2830/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73776936/Quest3hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: David Pierce / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CXWv9v"&gt;Meta has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meta.com%2Fblog%2Fquest%2Fmeta-quest-v72-update-remote-desktop-hand-tracking-keyboard-more%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F12%2F9%2F24317237%2Fmeta-quest-v72-update-pc-pairing-hand-tracking-keyboard-look" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the v72 Quest update, and it’s packed with features like faster hand tracking, an easier way to pair your headset with a Windows 11 PC, and better support for showing your keyboard while you’re in full virtual reality. The update is rolling out gradually, which also goes for certain features so you may not be able to use them immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="adxgwM"&gt;Meta says you can now connect to a paired PC with the Quest’s Remote Desktop feature simply by looking at it and tapping the “Connect” button that appears above your keyboard. That’s similar to how it works on the Vision Pro, but here, you’ll need the &lt;a href="https://aka.ms/mrlink"&gt;Mixed Reality Link app&lt;/a&gt; installed on your computer before you can pair the devices together from within your Quest headset’s Settings app. The feature requires Windows 11 22H2 and newer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot showing the new PC-connecting feature in action." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qRZ_9Ltw0z6AyyZHKDcOZYFz0g8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25782300/Meta_Quest_PC_connect.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Meta&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now you can connect to your PC just by looking at it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="M6AWbv"&gt;Also, in Quest v72, the company says it’s “rolling out a more general keyboard tracking system” that should detect and let any keyboard around you appear through a passthrough “window” while you’re in a virtual environment, similar to the Vision Pro. Quest headsets have had a feature that shows a virtual version of your keyboard where your real one is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22382805/oculus-quest-2-facebook-wireless-pc-streaming-120hz-infinite-office"&gt;since 2021&lt;/a&gt;, but that has only ever worked with specific keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nFRKN2"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0yx4V1655eA?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Cz6PeV"&gt;Meta also says it has made the hand cursor more stable when navigating, pinching to select things, and pinching and dragging windows. The company also says it’s now easier to use your hands while in confined spaces and that it added a “hand ray visualization” to help find and target things with the cursor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="whsEwG"&gt;There is a little bit more in the update, too, including new live captions for calls from the People app and the addition of direct messaging in the Instagram app. Meta also added a Media Gallery app for viewing your images, videos (spatial included), and screenshots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tKoSc2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="omrPIT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1l5iiH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Scientists advise EU to halt solar geoengineering</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="puc3RF"&gt;Scientific advisers to the European Commission are calling for a moratorium across the EU on efforts to artificially cool Earth through solar geoengineering. That includes controversial technologies used to reflect sunlight back into space, primarily by sending reflective particles into the atmosphere or by brightening clouds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dA5m8X"&gt;Proponents argue that this can help in the fight against climate change, especially as planet-heating greenhouse gas emissions continue to climb. But small-scale experiments have triggered backlash over concerns that these technologies could do more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T8XZVO"&gt;The European Commission asked its &lt;a href="https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2777/391614"&gt;Group of Chief Scientific Advisors&lt;/a&gt; (GCSA) and &lt;a href="https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2777/951016"&gt;European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies&lt;/a&gt; (EGE) to write up their opinions on solar geoengineering, which were published today alongside a &lt;a href="https://scientificadvice.eu/advice/solar-radiation-modification/"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; synthesizing what little we know about how these technologies might work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Xh9F7g"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Experiments have triggered backlash over concerns that these technologies could do more harm than good&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5c8AZg"&gt;There’s “insufficient scientific evidence” to show that solar geoengineering can actually prevent climate change, says the opinion written by the GCSA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LVBXyc"&gt;“Given the currently very high...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Manchester City is letting fans design its new kit with AI</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A screenshot of an AI-generated soccer uniform design" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4es_ATglVmgGU7a4RbnMGOdmv6A=/0x0:984x656/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73776830/ai_manchester_city_cats.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Will Manchester City’s next uniform feature AI-generated cats?&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: Puma AI Creator&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aONj43"&gt;Manchester City is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mancity.com%2Fnews%2Fclub%2Fpuma-ai-kit-creator-launch-63869006&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F12%2F9%2F24317157%2Fmanchester-city-puma-ai-uniform-design" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;holding a competition&lt;/a&gt; that asks fans to generate its future kit design with AI. Players will wear the winning design during the 2026-2027 season as City’s official third kit, and it will even be sold to fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HEJDTY"&gt;The club partnered with Puma to launch &lt;a href="https://aicreator.puma.com/create"&gt;a text-to-image&lt;/a&gt; uniform generator powered by the AI company DeepObjects. To use the tool, you’ll have to create an account and enter a prompt that describes the look you’re going for. You then have to choose a style the AI will use when generating your design, such as “abstract,” “emotive brushstrokes,” or “dream visions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fQMNoik9zzJi-QdKxVcfzObLwhI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25782035/ai_uniform_design.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Puma AI Creator&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This wasn’t quite what I was envisioning when I entered a prompt for “soccerballs shooting through space like stars on a galaxy background.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ofeucp"&gt;The Puma AI Creator will then generate four different design options that appear on a virtual uniform, allowing you to customize the collars, trim colors, and badges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NES3Z0"&gt;You get 15 credits to create designs (generating one design costs one credit), but you can only enter two of your creations in the contest, which ends December 20th. Fan ratings, along with experts from Manchester City and Puma will help determine the winner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TL41uVUhpAMHxToPQbPNZF4DbAs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25782278/manchester_city_goalkeeper.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Manchester City&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;City players designed this goalkeeper kit with AI.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cQ9sPB"&gt;Manchester City says its players, Ederson, Stefan Ortega, and Rico Lewis first used the Puma AI Creator to design a goalkeeper kit “creatively inspired by the net of a football goal.” It will be the first AI-generated soccer uniform to be worn on the pitch, according to the club.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eSA9YP"&gt;The announcement comes at an awkward time for City, which is mired in a poor run of form and &lt;a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/man-city-115-charges-timeline-30549136"&gt;awaiting the verdict of an investigation into breaching Premier League financial rules&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Pay’s first competitor on the iPhone has arrived in Norway</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Image showing tap to pay with Vipps app." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UnflyrfcyY7rb_8Zj8fLkUOaLiU=/0x128:1117x873/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73776771/VippsNO_1600x1600_hero_02_copy__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iPhone owners in Norway can now select Vipps as their default mobile payment app.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Vipps&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zcI5F1"&gt;A Norwegian payment app called Vipps is &lt;a href="https://vipps.no/nyheter/2024/12/03/naa-kan-du-taeppe-med-vipps-i-butikken"&gt;the first service to take advantage&lt;/a&gt; of a new, more open iOS ecosystem thanks to EU regulations. Starting today, Norwegians can use Vipps for tap-to-pay transactions and online payments, and they can even set the app as the default payment option on their iPhones, as reported by &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/09/vipps-mobilepay-first-iphone-apple-pay-alternative/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rzCfHu"&gt;It’s all thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/19/24043965/apple-iphone-nfc-payments-open-up-third-party-developers-european-union-antitrust"&gt;commitments Apple made&lt;/a&gt; in response to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21292651/apple-eu-antitrust-investigation-app-store-apple-pay"&gt;scrutiny from EU regulators&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="o9kGwF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"10 years later, Apple Pay is amazing — and about to change ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/5/24235874/apple-pay-10-years-open-nfc-ios"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DaSK2P"&gt;Since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/9/6128371/apple-pay-hands-on"&gt;its launch a decade ago&lt;/a&gt;, Apple Pay has been the only way to use tap to pay on an iPhone. That’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/14/24220323/apple-iphone-tap-to-pay-nfc-api"&gt;changing with iOS 18.1&lt;/a&gt;, which makes tap-to-pay via NFC available to third-party developers for the first time. Apple committed earlier this year to open up the API &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/2/23048116/apple-pay-eu-antitrust-nfc-payment-wallet"&gt;after EU regulators ruled Apple Pay anti-competitive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mXa4kJ"&gt;This pressure from the EU has recently forced Apple to open up the famously locked-down iPhone in unprecedented ways, from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/10/24171315/apple-messages-rcs-ios-18-imessage-green-bubble"&gt;adding RCS support&lt;/a&gt; to letting you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/22/24226110/apple-iphone-ipad-default-apps-eu-competition"&gt;delete pretty much any app you want&lt;/a&gt; from your phone. But unlocking the NFC chip is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/5/24235874/apple-pay-10-years-open-nfc-ios"&gt;a particularly interesting test case&lt;/a&gt; since it could usher in a whole bunch of new and helpful ways to use your phone — or create a mess of competing payment and ID storage platforms that don’t cooperate with each other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K1pwbz"&gt;Either way, it’s going to be a big deal, and the first step forward into that new era comes from a small financial organization in Scandinavia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WqktiA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It sure sounds like Trump would be okay with a TikTok sale</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A picture of Donald Trump talking with Kristen Welker." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k0bzTrlupMK44X9lzAOVGmV4C6k=/69x0:2931x1908/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73776743/2188309592.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xJofCB"&gt;President-elect Donald Trump gave a murky answer when NBC’s Kristen Welker asked whether he would protect TikTok from its impending ban during a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-interview-meet-press-kristen-welker-election-president-rcna182857"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meet the Press&lt;/em&gt; interview&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday. He didn’t say he would save the app from its ban but did seem to imply that ByteDance should sell it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="stHcli"&gt;After its argument that the ban is unconstitutional came up short in the DC Circuit Court of Appeals last week, ByteDance is requesting an injunction to stop the ban from taking effect until the Supreme Court can hear its appeal, and it now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24316941/tiktok-divest-ban-court-ruling-breakdown-first-amendment"&gt;faces an uphill legal battle&lt;/a&gt;. If ByteDance’s motion isn’t granted, it has to sell TikTok by January 19th or face its expulsion from the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lCPjhE"&gt;Welker asked Trump what he would do after ByteDance’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24316941/tiktok-divest-ban-court-ruling-breakdown-first-amendment"&gt;failed appeal of the ban&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="af5pQN"&gt;This week a federal court upheld a law that could result in TikTok being banned. You said you’re going to rescue TikTok when you get into office. Are you going to take steps to protect it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="vdW1nw"&gt;Trump’s response praised his campaign’s use of the platform before deflecting the question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="vs8OE3"&gt;I used TikTok very successfully in my campaign. I have a man named TikTok Jack, he was very effective, obviously, because I won youth by 30 percent. All Republicans lose youth. I don’t know why. Maybe it’s changing. And last time we were down 30 percent with youth. This time we were up 35 percent with youth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UjV50e"&gt;And I used TikTok, so I can’t really, you know, I can’t totally hate it. It was very effective. But I will say this, if you do do that, something else is going to come along and take its place. And maybe that’s not fair. And really, what the judge actually said was that you can’t have Chinese companies. In other words, they have the right to ban it if you can prove that Chinese companies own it. That’s what the judge actually said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="q6X6lr"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@nbcnews/video/7446130950444010795" data-video-id="7446130950444010795" data-embed-from="oembed" style="max-width:605px; min-width:325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@nbcnews" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@nbcnews?refer=embed"&gt;@nbcnews&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;President-elect Donald &lt;a title="trump" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/trump?refer=embed"&gt;#Trump&lt;/a&gt; weighs in on a potential ban on TikTok that could take effect one day before he assumes the White House if the app’s Chinese parent company does not divest. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - nbcnews" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7446130921360968491?refer=embed"&gt;♬ original sound - nbcnews&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7yJLTS"&gt;Pressed again on if he would “protect TikTok” once he’s in office, Trump responded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ThEKkN"&gt;I’m going to try and make it so that other companies don’t become an even bigger monopoly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="69UYYt"&gt;A TikTok sale to an American company would be one way to achieve that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XB8nGC"&gt;Trump’s position has been murky since he started positioning himself opposite of the Biden administration’s support of a ban — something Trump pushed for during his last term. Over the last several months, that’s included his &lt;a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113081258242253706"&gt;Truth Social video&lt;/a&gt; urging people who “want to save TikTok” to vote for him and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2Fvideo%2F2024%2F03%2F11%2Fformer-president-donald-trump-i-consider-facebook-to-be-an-enemy-of-the-people.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F12%2F9%2F24317094%2Fdonald-trump-tiktok-ban-sale-meet-the-press-interview" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;CNBC &lt;/em&gt;in March&lt;/a&gt; that getting rid of the platform would only benefit Facebook, which he called an “enemy of the people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6VWQN2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

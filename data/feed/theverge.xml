    <title>AI is booming on the App Store, and developers are taking advantage of it</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Many high-ranking AI apps feel like an attempted cash grab, and it’s not easy to spot the trash from the treasure.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Software developer arrested in connection with UnitedHealthcare CEO killing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A NYPD photo of the person of interest in the case. The person is in a taxi." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lc1PsJ3d3Dh7VZrJ4KyixnfdMcY=/55x0:1248x795/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73776604/GeQPY4pXMAAjCCH.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The NYPD released &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://x.com/NYPDnews/status/1865633072185495574" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;this photo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; of the person of interest in the case.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: NYPD&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vvF1Tj"&gt;Police have arrested Luigi Mangione, a 26-year-old software developer, in connection with the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Mangione, of Maryland, was detained at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania on Monday morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yrG38t"&gt;Mangione was taken into custody on local firearm charges, New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch told reporters. He has not been charged in connection with the shooting but is “believed to be our person of interest,” Tisch said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bcw4Gk"&gt;Police have been searching for Thompson’s killer for nearly a week, despite the shooting taking place in public outside a Manhattan hotel. The manhunt has thus far relied on just &lt;a href="https://x.com/NYPDnews/status/1865633072185495574"&gt;a few grainy images of a man&lt;/a&gt; whose face is largely obscured by a mask and hoodie. Investigators have reportedly been &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/brian-thompson-unitedhealthcare-news-12-6-24/index.html"&gt;looking for more surveillance images of the suspect&lt;/a&gt; to load into facial recognition software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yoWXtz"&gt;Police were led to Mangione via a “combination of old-school detective work and new age technology,” Tisch said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D0xKTv"&gt;Despite scant visual evidence, a McDonald’s employee recognized Mangione on Monday morning and called police, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/09/nyregion/uhc-ceo-murder-suspect"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. “He was just sitting there eating,” Joseph Kenny, the New York Police Department’s chief of detectives, said at a press briefing Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZcC4td"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UdaqEezK2Ks?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jQs8nV"&gt;Mangione reportedly had a gun, a silencer, and four fake IDs in his possession. The gun appeared to be a 3D-printed “ghost gun,” Kenny told reporters. After being apprehended, Mangione showed police a fake New Jersey ID, Kenny said. The ID was the same one used to check into a hostel in Manhattan on November 24th, eight days before the shooting. Sources also &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/09/us-news/person-of-interest-in-fatal-shooting-of-unitedhealthcare-boss-brian-thompson-idd-as-luigi-mangione-an-ex-ivy-league-student/"&gt;tell the &lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that he was carrying a “manifesto” criticizing the US healthcare industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3uGxT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rivian’s new Joshua Tree outpost is what EV charging should be  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Rivian EV charging station Joshua Tree" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_cRPVIVSWC5xDE6MHPpNaxJdx7E=/0x6:6791x4533/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73776588/Rivian_J_Tree_4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Rivian&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IK3RJm"&gt;When I first started testing electric vehicles, finding a charging station was the means to an end. I didn’t care what it looked like or what neighborhood it was in — it was a minor miracle that I found a charger, any charger, to juice up. But now consumers want more. Heck, I want more, and I don’t even own an EV. After all, this is a place where you’ll spend at least 20 minutes to shove some electrons into your vehicle. Is a bathroom too much to ask for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QeUmpu"&gt;Rivian has heard the call and has answered with its own chain of outpost charging stations. The first one &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/19/24201215/rivian-brings-ev-charging-to-yosemite"&gt;opened up in Yosemite&lt;/a&gt;, California, this past summer, and now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24313327/rivian-ev-charging-open-up-joshua-tree"&gt;one is right in my own backyard in Joshua Tree&lt;/a&gt;, just six miles away from the town’s national park entrance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IjDSUD"&gt;Charge up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="d5xWJj"&gt;First, let’s talk about charging. There are 12 900-volt 300kW CCS chargers, and the outpost is open to any EV, although Teslas will need an adapter. There is one pullthrough spot for folks with a trailer, but if others are charging across the lot from that space, it might be a tight turn for longer rigs. Rivian owners can pay through the app or tap their credit cards at the charger at 46 cents per kWh, while non-Rivian cars can tap...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OpenAI has finally released Sora</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A screenshot of Sora" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VB-1jw6l8PkztEkYpaIolUHM2uU=/170x0:2147x1318/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73776425/openai_sora_explore.10.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Free users can still browse a feed of AI-generated videos created by the community.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: OpenAI&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QcIUWq"&gt;OpenAI launched Sora, &lt;a href="https://openai.com/index/sora-is-here/"&gt;its text-to-video AI model&lt;/a&gt;, on Monday as part of its 12-day &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24314146/openai-12-days-ship-mas-chatgpt-sora-o1-update"&gt;“ship-mas” product release series&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24312352/openai-sora-o1-reasoning-12-days-shipmas"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; it would. It’s available today on &lt;a href="http://Sora.com"&gt;Sora.com&lt;/a&gt; for ChatGPT subscribers in the US and “most other countries,” and a new model, Sora Turbo. This updated model adds features like generating video from text, animating images, and remixing videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PGQ6Ts"&gt;With a ChatGPT Plus subscription, &lt;a href="https://openai.com/sora/"&gt;OpenAI says&lt;/a&gt; you can generate up to 50 priority videos (1,000 credits) at resolutions up to 720p with 5-second durations. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24314147/openai-reasoning-model-o1-strawberry-chatgpt-pro-new-tier"&gt;$200 per month ChatGPT Pro subscription that launched last week&lt;/a&gt; comes with “unlimited generations” and up to 500 priority videos while bumping the resolution to 1080p and the duration to 20 seconds. The more expensive plan also allows subscribers to download videos without a watermark and perform up to five generations simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7og9SF"&gt;OpenAI &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/15/24074151/openai-sora-text-to-video-ai"&gt;first teased&lt;/a&gt; its text-to-video AI model, Sora, in February, and earlier today, Marques Brownlee, aka MKBHD, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24317090/openai-sora-text-to-video-ai-generator-confirmed-release"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; the launch with&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY2x0TyKzIQ"&gt; a preview&lt;/a&gt; based on his experiences testing Sora so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zD5WJa"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2jKVx2vyZOY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="AqgADM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OpenAI’s 12 days of ‘ship-mas’: all the new announcements","url":"https://www.theverge.com/24314146/openai-12-days-ship-mas-chatgpt-sora-o1-update"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r7EjAS"&gt;During the livestream, OpenAI showed off Sora’s new explore page with a feed of AI-generated videos created by other community members. The company &lt;a href="https://openai.com/sora/"&gt;highlighted a feature&lt;/a&gt; called “storyboards” that let you generate videos based on a sequence of prompts, as well as the ability to turn photos into videos. OpenAI also demonstrated a “remix” tool that lets you tweak Sora’s output with a text prompt, along with a way to “blend” two scenes together with AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bD1lHy"&gt;OpenAI says videos generated with Sora will have visible watermarks and C2PA metadata to indicate they’re made with AI. Before uploading an image or video to Sora, OpenAI prompts you to check off an agreement that says what you’re uploading doesn’t contain people under 18, explicit or violent content, and copyrighted material. It says the “misuse of media uploads” could result in an account ban or suspension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GiX9TX"&gt;“We obviously have a big target on our back as OpenAI,” OpenAI vice president of research Aditya Ramesh said during the livestream. “We want to prevent illegal activity of Sora, but we also want to balance that with creative expression. We know that... will be an ongoing challenge, we might not get it perfect on day one. We’re starting a little conservative, and so if our moderation doesn’t quite get it right, just give us that feedback.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Edysfk"&gt;If you don’t have a ChatGPT subscription, you’ll still be able to browse through the feed of AI-generated videos created by other people using Sora. While the model will become available in the US and many other countries today, &lt;a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1866187529650917618"&gt;OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said&lt;/a&gt; that it may “be a while” for a launch in “most of Europe and the UK.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TBc5jW"&gt;The release of Sora comes just a week after a group of artists, who claimed to be part of the company’s alpha testing program, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/26/24306879/openai-sora-video-ai-model-leak-artist-protest"&gt;leaked&lt;/a&gt; the product in protest of being used by OpenAI for what they claim was “unpaid R&amp;amp;D and PR.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Pixel Tablet has returned to its Black Friday all-time low price </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel Tablet resting on a dock." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mMxvW1izhDTUVXWDDqg--mtqb34=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73776256/236705_Google_Pixel_Tablet_DSeifert_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s Pixel Tablet uniquely turns into a smart display of sorts when you buy the charging speaker dock.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7UiJnr"&gt;Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/21/24302508/google-pixel-tablet-2-canceled-rumor"&gt;might soon stop selling tablets&lt;/a&gt; altogether, which is a shame, because we were fans of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23765921/google-pixel-tablet-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Pixel Tablet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when it was released last year. Yet while we may never see a&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Pixel Tablet 2, luckily the original slate is still around and receiving a steep discount. Normally $399, right now the base Google Pixel Tablet with 128GB of storage has returned to its Black Friday price of $279 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Tablet-Extra-Long-Porcelain/dp/B0CZMFZ84J?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://howl.link/hb6vyghwauykp"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://store.google.com/config/pixel_tablet" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;directly from Google&lt;/a&gt;. You can buy it with a charging speaker dock starting at $459 ($140 off) from the &lt;a href="https://howl.link/fovblvdr0flpn"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://store.google.com/config/pixel_tablet" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="hYNdFG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google’s abandoned Pixel Tablet might’ve launched with this pen","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24317008/googles-abandoned-pixel-tablet-mightve-launched-with-this-pen"},{"title":"Google’s abandoned Pixel Tablet 2 had a better display and 5G upgrades","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/2/24311118/google-canceled-pixel-tablet-2-better-display-5g-tensor-g4"},{"title":"The Verge’s 2024 holiday gift guide","url":"https://www.theverge.com/24224043/holiday-gift-guide-2024-best-ideas-unique-tech-gadgets"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SZKsyL"&gt;If you’re looking for an Android tablet that’s great for watching movies, web browsing, video chatting, and other basic tasks, the Pixel Tablet remains an excellent option. Powered by Google’s Tensor G2 chip, it’s a snappy entertainment device. Its sharp 11-inch LCD display offers wide viewing angles ideal for streaming, while its four speakers provide clear audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cqd2La"&gt;It’s the optional magnetic charging speaker dock that really makes the Pixel Tablet stand out, though. The dock effectively turns the Pixel Tablet into smart display similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20855944/google-nest-hub-max-review-assistant-smart-display-price-specs-features"&gt;Nest Hub Max&lt;/a&gt;, allowing it to deliver a full, room-filling sound quality that outperforms the tablet’s built-in speakers. That means you can also enjoy some Nest Hub Max capabilities, using the tablet to control smart home devices with just your voice via Google Assistant, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="v4mpaU"&gt;A few more deals worth a look&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="id__w8xdnn87i3m"&gt;The&lt;strong&gt; UE Wonderboom 4&lt;/strong&gt; is on sale at an all-time low price of $59.99 ($40 off) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BRXJ9WTD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1835426-REG%2Flogitech_984_001878_ultimate_ears_wonderboom_4.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F12%2F9%2F24317037%2Fgoogle-pixel-tablet-ue-wonderboom-4-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike its predecessor, the Bluetooth speaker now supports USB-C for faster charging and sports a new megaphone feature that amplifies your voice. It also still sports an IP67 rating, meaning it’s waterproof and dustproof so you can take it outdoors without worrying.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WkXKDH"&gt;The new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24271197/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-e-reader-12th-gen-2024"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kindle Paperwhite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;is back on sale for $134.99 ($25 off) at &lt;a href="https://howl.link/y2klei94x7ltd"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-kindle-paperwhite-2024-black%2F-%2FA-91563138&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, which is $5 shy of the all-time low price we saw first set during Black Friday. The latest Paperwhite is faster than its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22745670/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2021-review-usb-c-signature-edition-display-e-reader-books"&gt;predecessor&lt;/a&gt;, with a larger seven-inch display and long battery life. It also retains all the features we loved in the last-gen model, including IPX8 waterproofing and a USB-C port. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GRqK2k"&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;1080p Ring Pan-Tilt Indoor Cam&lt;/strong&gt; is down to $49.99 ($30 off) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CG2VS5FD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://howl.link/95mpfgkpnbvkm"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fring-pan-tilt-indoor-cam-with-360-horizontal-pan-coverage-live-view-two-way-talk-hd-video%2F-%2FA-93001874%3Fpreselect%3D91368473%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, matching its all-time low. Its mechanically rotating head offers 360-degree panning and is capable of tilting up and down, so you can see every corner of the room it’s in. The camera also supports two-way talk and can even sound a siren, while you can get motion alerts with person detection if you subscribe to the Ring Protect Plan.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>OpenAI’s video generator Sora is launching today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vector illustration of the Chat GPT logo." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JTeGcPZIan729gl8v_ZS8Vck4W4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73776240/STK155_OPEN_AI_CVirginia_A.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LdZbuR"&gt;OpenAI’s highly-anticipated AI text-to-video generator, Sora, will become available to everyone today. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY2x0TyKzIQ"&gt;In a video posted on Monday&lt;/a&gt;, Marques Brownlee confirmed its imminent release and detailed his experience using Sora over the past few weeks, calling the results “horrifying and inspiring at the same time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="qCkQTC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OpenAI is finally releasing Sora","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24317092/openai-sora-text-to-video-ai-launch"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kNwt54"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/15/24074151/openai-sora-text-to-video-ai"&gt;OpenAI first revealed&lt;/a&gt; Sora in February but only made the tool available to a select number of visual artists, designers, and filmmakers to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NGmh9m"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OY2x0TyKzIQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="02ltVJ"&gt;Brownlee shows how Sora can convert your text prompt into a video, which you can then customize with additional text prompts as part of its “remix” tool. You can also use Sora to transform a photo into a video, as well as use its storyboard feature to “string together” several text prompts that Sora will attempt to blend into cohesive scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QLLWyc"&gt;During his video, Brownlee points out that Sora currently struggles with generating realistic physics and often shows objects that disappear or pass through each other. He also found that Sora often rejects prompts that include public figures and copyrighted characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RykedQ"&gt;Sora will launch today, and will most likely be announced during the 12 days of “ship-mas” video OpenAI plans on releasing at 1PM ET. Last Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24314147/openai-reasoning-model-o1-strawberry-chatgpt-pro-new-tier"&gt;OpenAI announced a $200 / month ChatGPT Pro subscription&lt;/a&gt; and the full release of its o1 reasoning model.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>China opens an antitrust investigation into Nvidia</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vector collage of the Ndivia logo." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hbv7vgApbWFtXTlHVchpaJAgpzs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73776229/STK083_B_NVIDIA_D.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Cath Virginia / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ma8R6o"&gt;China is investigating Nvidia over antitrust violations, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/technology/china-nvidia-investigation-antitrust-ai.html"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; over claims the chipmaker failed to follow conditions set during China’s approval for its $6.9 billion acquisition of Israeli network hardware company Mellanox in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bYXqbz"&gt;While&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21258419/nvidia-ampere-gpu-ai-data-centers-specs-a100-dgx-supercomputer"&gt; announcing the DGX A100 GPU&lt;/a&gt; after acquiring Mellanox, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said this while explaining its importance to his company:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="qHMOH9"&gt;“If you take a look at the way modern data centers are architected, the workloads they have to do are more diverse than ever,” explains Huang. “Our approach going forward is not to just focus on the server itself but to think about the entire data center as a computing unit. Going forward I believe the world is going to think about data centers as a computing unit and we’re going to be thinking about data center-scale computing. No longer just personal computers or servers, but we’re going to be operating on the data center scale.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="pAr9RJ"&gt;Since then, the boom in demand for AI chips and servers has driven Nvidia’s value from under $200 billion to over $3 trillion in 2024, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/18/24181393/nvidia-most-valuable-company-microsoft-apple-google"&gt;surpassing Microsoft, Apple, and Google&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UV1yUf"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-09/china-targets-nvidia-for-potential-breaches-of-anti-monopoly-law"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Chinese regulators say Nvidia failed to follow agreements to provide new Mellanox product information within 90 days to other chipmaking firms in the country to avoid a monopoly. At the same time, the US Justice Department is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/3/24235233/nvidia-doj-ai-antitrust-investigation"&gt;also investigating the company for monopolistic behavior&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rxNeWh"&gt;The Biden administration also placed new sanctions on China last week to make it more difficult to produce advanced AI chips there, as it also restricts the capabilities of exports by companies like Nvidia. China retaliated with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24311929/china-us-export-chipmaking-components-sanctions"&gt;new limitations on key mineral exports to the US&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>David Sacks is Trump’s AI and crypto ‘czar’</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5djfLf"&gt;President-elect Donald Trump says that VC and &lt;em&gt;All-In &lt;/em&gt;podcast co-host David Sacks will be the “White House A.I. &amp;amp; Crypto Czar.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cz4Kz0"&gt;The appointment of Sacks, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/7/24173787/silicon-valley-donald-trump-david-sacks-fundraiser"&gt;who hosted a $300,000-a-person dinner&lt;/a&gt; at his San Francisco mansion to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/14/24244137/jd-vance-all-in-david-sacks-trump"&gt;fundraise for Trump’s campaign&lt;/a&gt;, follows the appointment of fellow PayPal mafia member Elon Musk to co-lead the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24295165/trump-elon-musk-doge-cut-government-spending"&gt;“Department of Government Efficiency.”&lt;/a&gt; According to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-06/trump-names-david-sacks-as-white-house-ai-and-crypto-czar"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, like Musk, Sacks will be “a special government employee” who can serve up to 130 days a year without divesting or publicly disclosing his assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="flgKsX"&gt;Here’s what Sacks will be tasked with in his role, &lt;a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113603133222686186"&gt;according to Trump&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="qCKSzd"&gt;In this important role, David will guide policy for the Administration in Artificial Intelligence and Cryptocurrency, two areas critical to the future of American competitiveness. David will focus on making America the clear global leader in both areas. He will safeguard Free Speech online, and steer us away from Big Tech bias and censorship. He will work on a legal framework so the Crypto industry has the clarity it has been asking for, and can thrive in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="99ony1"&gt;Trump says Sacks will also head up the Presidential Council of Advisors for Science and Technology, an independent advisory committee &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/pcast/"&gt;that exists today&lt;/a&gt;. In a &lt;a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113603132751633733"&gt;second Truth Social post&lt;/a&gt;, Trump highlighted Sacks’ history at PayPal (where he worked with Musk) and his founding of Yammer, which Microsoft bought for $1.2 billion in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rOz1j7"&gt;Sacks is a vocal, longtime supporter of Musk. He’s an investor in SpaceX and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23551060/elon-musk-twitter-takeover-layoffs-workplace-salute-emoji"&gt;played a key role in Musk’s takeover of Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. His VC firm, Craft Ventures, has backed tech firms like the AI enterprise startup Glean and Palantir, the Peter Thiel-founded government contractor. Sacks has also become an influential figure in the Republican Party. He spoke at the 2024 Republican National Convention and was at Mar-a-Lago on Election Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C9Gfl8"&gt;Shortly after Trump announced his appointment, leaders from key AI and crypto companies, including &lt;a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1864861265488941151"&gt;OpenAI CEO Sam Altman&lt;/a&gt;, rushed to X to congratulate Sacks. “Great pick,” &lt;a href="https://x.com/emiliemc/status/1864837701251535130"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; Coinbase COO Emilie Choi. “&lt;a href="https://x.com/DavidSacks"&gt;@DavidSacks&lt;/a&gt; was in crypto early and has a nuanced understanding of the space. Time to build in the US!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LIsIWa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, December 5th:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added more info about Sacks and responses from tech leaders.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iFixit now sells official Xbox parts</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RITCc2"&gt;iFixit now sells genuine Xbox parts you can use to repair your Xbox Series X or S and offers official guides to help with fixes. You can browse what’s available from iFixit’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2Fcollaborations%2Fmicrosoft&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F12%2F5%2F24314464%2Fifixit-now-sells-official-xbox-parts" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Repair Hub&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQ1J4TN8G-1733441960.889559-thread-list-Thread_1733445764.048229"&gt;“We’re excited to be working with Microsoft to keep Xboxes running longer and out of the waste heap,” Elizabeth Chamberlain, iFixit’s director of sustainability, says in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We now offer official Microsoft parts and step-by-step repair guides for Xbox Series S and Series X, including both the all-digital and disk drive editions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="64hYGK"&gt;iFixit’s Microsoft Repair Hub also features iFixit’s parts for repairing Microsoft Surface devices, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/26/23933468/ifixit-microsoft-surface-parts-repair"&gt;which it started selling in 2023&lt;/a&gt;. “Since we launched our Surface parts collaboration with Microsoft last year, we’ve been helping our customers repair their own Microsoft laptops and tablets — and it’s awesome to be able to offer Xbox owners the same opportunity,” Chamberlain says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="GEvXpA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iFixit now sells Microsoft Surface parts for repair ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/26/23933468/ifixit-microsoft-surface-parts-repair"},{"title":"iFixit will sell nearly every part of the Steam Deck — including the entire motherboard","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/21/23133302/ifixit-steam-deck-repair-parts-leak"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D7Bxxg"&gt;Microsoft isn’t the only gaming company that iFixit has partnered with; iFixit sells &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/21/23133302/ifixit-steam-deck-repair-parts-leak"&gt;nearly every part of the Steam Deck&lt;/a&gt; and offers &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FDevice%2FSteam_Deck&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F12%2F5%2F24314464%2Fifixit-now-sells-official-xbox-parts" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a bunch of repair guides for Valve’s handheld PC&lt;/a&gt;, too. Microsoft itself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/31/23814642/microsoft-xbox-elite-controllers-repair-diy"&gt;offers first-party parts&lt;/a&gt; for the standard and Elite Series 2 Xbox controllers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3QGSx6"&gt;iFixit also offers genuine repair parts for Google’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/29/23188693/google-pixel-repair-kit-ifixit-battery-screen-usb-port-replacement"&gt;Pixel phones&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/14/23873136/google-pixel-tablet-ifixit-parts-self-repair-guides"&gt;the Pixel Tablet&lt;/a&gt;. The company had sold genuine parts from Samsung, but that partnership ended &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/samsung/2024/5/23/24162135/ifixit-end-samsung-repair-parts-deal"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A hands-on photo of Apple’s AirPods 4 wireless earbuds." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bq2UauzneQJaXGBfsqp9eb89ijo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/DSCF0048.72.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new AirPods 4 deliver better sound and voice call quality than prior entry-level models.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9MWLQH"&gt;If you know where to look, you can often score discounts on Apple’s ever-expanding AirPods lineup. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/9/23313529/apple-airpods-4-noise-cancellation-price-features"&gt;new AirPods 4&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/9/24236804/airpods-max-second-gen-price-specs-features-release-date"&gt;AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt; are just starting to receive discounts, for instance, while both the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22671344/apple-new-airpods-3-spacial-audio-specs-price-release-date-features"&gt;second-&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22671344/apple-new-airpods-3-spacial-audio-specs-price-release-date-features"&gt;third-gen AirPods&lt;/a&gt; can often be found at a steep discount. The same goes for the original Max, which are nearly indistinguishable from the last-gen model aside from the switch to a USB-C connector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="FtAh67"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:11906226"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2Ywi2P"&gt;Here, we’ve rounded up the best deals currently available on each model, including the second-gen and third-gen AirPods, both iterations of the AirPods 4, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23878402/apple-airpods-pro-usb-c-adaptive-audio-conversation-awareness-test-review"&gt;latest AirPods Pro with USB-C&lt;/a&gt;, and the last-gen AirPods Max. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="9jF4AW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s AirPods Pro hearing health features are as good as they sound","url":"https://www.theverge.com/24275178/apple-airpods-pro-hearing-aid-test-protection-preview"},{"title":"The best wireless earbuds to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ej2msf"&gt;The best AirPods (second-gen) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="upOxaE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:12147763"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eg29V6"&gt;Before they were discontinued alongside the AirPods 4 announcement, the second-gen AirPods were Apple’s entry-level earbuds. Despite being released in 2019, they still offer terrific wireless performance, great ease of use, and reliable battery life, making them a solid pick if you can live without a wireless charging case or some of the more advanced software features afforded by Apple’s newer H2 chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h8mHSN"&gt;The second-gen AirPods originally launched for $159; however, Apple eventually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733184/apple-second-generation-airpods-wired-charging-case-price-cut-129"&gt;lowered their list price&lt;/a&gt; to $129, and we now often see them on sale for far less. Right now, for instance, you can buy them for $89 ($49 off) at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-2nd-Generation%2F604342441&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, which is $20 more than their all-time low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="4mc9Pf"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Read our AirPods (second-gen) review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;The best AirPods (third-gen) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="mhoBWc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:12375658"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="odwqvs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10744075" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ri9LM8"&gt;With support for the company’s MagSafe charger and an asking price of $179, Apple’s third-gen AirPods were once considered the middle child in the AirPods lineup. The shorter stems made for a more subtle design, too, while improved sound and features like sweat and water resistance, support for head-tracking spatial audio, and improved battery life rendered them a nice upgrade over their predecessor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="RzidsV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"},{"title":"All the news from Apple’s ‘week’ of Mac announcements","url":"https://www.theverge.com/24279307/apple-mac-m4-updates-news-announcements"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MJ29Rx"&gt;However, the AirPods 4 and AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation have since replaced the third-gen AirPods in Apple’s lineup. The new earbuds run $129 and $179, respectively, with the step-up model offering a few perks once reserved for the Pro models, including ANC, a helpful transparency mode, and a case with a built-in speaker. You can also squeeze the stem to control media playback — a feature also available on the entry-level AirPods 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="orderTotalOutput"&gt;We recently saw the third-gen AirPods with a Lightning charging case drop to $94 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-3rd-Generation%2F5527780373%2F&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. However, the best deal you can get right now is only available at &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.costco.com/apple-airpods-3rd-generation-with-magsafe-charging-case.product.100806298.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt;, where members can buy them with a MagSafe charging case for $129.99 ($40 off). That said, it’s worth noting that you can buy the AirPods 4 at Amazon for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Headphones-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized/dp/B0DGHMNQ5Z/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$119&lt;/a&gt;, which is a far better deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="c6aOwk"&gt;

&lt;h2 id="yCNINu"&gt;The best AirPods 4 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="hqo5md"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:12434797"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="ng7wov"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:12434303"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2GeIQP"&gt;During &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24239739/apple-iphone-16-event-announcements-watch-series-10-airpods"&gt;Apple’s “It’s Glowtime” event&lt;/a&gt; in September, the company introduced the AirPods 4, a pair of wireless earbuds available in two flavors: a $129 standard model and a noise-canceling version for $179. Both models represent significant upgrades over the second-gen AirPods, with a more comfortable design and improved audio performance. They’re also better for taking calls thanks to Apple’s Voice Isolation feature, which better isolates your voice so that you can more clearly be heard in noisy environments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="L8Gwaz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"What’s really different about the AirPods 4 models?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/2/24260385/whats-really-different-about-the-airpods-4-models"},{"title":"The best MagSafe and Qi2 chargers for your iPhone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/23505846/best-magsafe-magnetic-chargers-apple-iphone"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r0td1H"&gt;For $50 extra, you can also buy the AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation, which offer ANC, a helpful transparency mode, and several more Pro-like features. Admittedly, the latest AirPods Pro do a better job of tuning out noise, but Apple’s newest pair of wireless earbuds still do a good job of reducing sound. They also offer other perks formerly reserved for Apple’s highest-end earbuds, including wireless charging and a case with a built-in speaker that allows you to easily track it down via Apple’s Find My app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XaR39J"&gt;Although they just launched, we’re already starting to see slight discounts on both versions of the AirPods 4. Right now, for instance, Amazon is offering the standard AirPods 4 for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Headphones-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized/dp/B0DGHMNQ5Z/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$119 ($10 off)&lt;/a&gt; and the AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Headphones-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized/dp/B0DGJ7HYG1/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$164.99 ($15 off)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="Iewbkw"&gt;The best AirPods Pro (second-gen) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="PDko4O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:12375646"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zaa6jO"&gt;In 2022, Apple released the second-gen AirPods Pro, which feature a similar build to the first-gen model but offer better noise cancellation, swipe-based controls, and an extra-small pair of swappable silicone ear tips for smaller ears. Apple followed them up last year with a minor refresh, one that features a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23878402/apple-airpods-pro-usb-c-adaptive-audio-conversation-awareness-test-review"&gt;USB-C charging case&lt;/a&gt; and an upgraded IP54 rating for water and dust resistance. The newest model also supports lossless audio when used with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24054862/apple-vision-pro-review-vr-ar-headset-features-price"&gt;Apple’s new Vision Pro headset&lt;/a&gt; and now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24242929/apple-airpods-pro-hearing-aids-fda-authorization"&gt;double as FDA-approved hearing aids&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="fJbrPD"&gt;Apple’s updated AirPods Pro are currently available at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAirPods-Pro-2nd-generation-with-MagSafe-Case-USB-C%2F5689919121&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; for $169.99, which is just $1 shy of their all-time low. You can also buy them at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for the same price, though they’re temporarily unavailable and Amazon hasn’t provided a shipping estimate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="FlijvB"&gt;The AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ears that have become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, comprised of aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and expansive, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response and features. They’re not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for most people — blame the sticker price — but it’s hard to find a better pair of Bluetooth headphones if you’re an iPhone user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="irGZgJ"&gt;At the beginning of September, Apple replaced the first-gen Max with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/17/24242378/airpods-max-usb-c-unchanged-missing-features"&gt;new model&lt;/a&gt; that features support for USB-C charging and a few new color options. They’re currently on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Pink/dp/B0DGJC52FP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; starting at $529.99 ($20 off) — which matches their second-best price to date — while the first-gen model is on sale at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1610237-REG%2Fapple_mgym3am_a_airpods_max_pink.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21302051%2Fbest-apple-airpods-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; starting at $429 ($120 off). That’s about $34 shy of the lowest price we’ve seen on the original model, which dropped to $394.99 several times this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Riot is making a League of Legends card game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A photo of a League of Legends collectible card game." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eTY3MRUUDh8SvLdEnyrucBa5He0=/141x0:1581x960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73769530/ProjectK_Dec5_SELECT2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Riot Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mAAj4S"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; universe is expanding once again — this time with a physical card game. Riot Games announced today that it’s developing a physical trading card game set in the &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; universe. The game is currently known as “Project K,” and Riot says it’s working with an unnamed partner in China to release the game there in early 2025. As for a global release, Riot says, “We are taking our time to find the right publishing partners.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MRE9Ga"&gt;There aren’t a lot of details available about Project K. According to Riot, the game “has unique gameplay and is best when played with friends and in person,” and development is being led by director Dave Guskin and producer Chengran Chai. You can get a sense of the game in the images below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AqUwIN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:12498453"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Z5YA26"&gt;Of course, this is far from the first spinoff from &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt;. So far, that has included mobile games like &lt;em&gt;Teamfight Tactics&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Wild Rift&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24291592/arcane-season-2-review-netflix"&gt;the Netflix series &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/22/24079608/project-l-2kxo-fighting-game-league-of-legends"&gt;the competitive fighting game &lt;em&gt;2XKO&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is expected to launch next year. Not all of these bets have paid off. In January, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/22/24047568/riot-games-league-of-legends-forge-runeterra-layoffs"&gt;Riot announced that it was cutting more than 500 jobs&lt;/a&gt;, which included shutting down Riot Forge Games, a publishing label for indie games set inside of &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt;. Also impacted was &lt;em&gt;Legends of Runeterra&lt;/em&gt;, a mobile card game that launched in 2020, which Riot said “hasn’t performed as well as we need it to.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tWejpa"&gt;The Project K news comes as card games are having another moment, led largely by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/19/24248306/pokemon-tcg-pocket-hands-on"&gt;the new smartphone version of the &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Trading Card&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Game&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google will support the Pixel 6, 7, and Fold with two extra years of OS updates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pixel 6 Pro and Pixel 6" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HfXxn0kHGDZxTapsNH_HSnTJH20=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73769522/bfarsace_211014_4802_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two more OS upgrades are on the way for the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HUb5Az"&gt;Owners of Pixel 6-series, 7-series and Pixel Fold phones can look forward to a couple extra years of OS upgrades than initially expected, &lt;a href="https://www.threads.net/@mishaal_rahman/post/DDNLshVRhr_?xmt=AQGziWqbxwO4PZax4szvOsv47sH6UwtZT_Wqm2yYWJOfmA"&gt;as discovered by Android expert Mishaal Rahman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://x.com/madebygoogle/status/1864794840673980452"&gt;confirmed by Google on X&lt;/a&gt;. When they were introduced, Google originally promised three years of OS upgrades and five years of security patches for each device, starting from the time they went on sale. But a quiet update to &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#zippy=%2Cpixel-a-pixel-pixel-pro-pixel-a-pixel-pixel-pro-pixel-fold"&gt;a support page&lt;/a&gt; confirms that these phones will get two additional OS upgrades, giving them a full five years of OS and security support that “may also include new and upgraded features with Pixel Drops.” That, my friends, rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HSCGgB"&gt;Google’s three-and-five policy wasn’t &lt;em&gt;bad, &lt;/em&gt;but it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/6/23861563/google-pixel-8-pro-rumors-android-os-software-support"&gt;wasn’t the best either&lt;/a&gt; — after the Pixel 6 arrived in 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/9/22923577/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-android-upgrades-4-years"&gt;Samsung did one better&lt;/a&gt; by offering four years of OS updates for the Galaxy S22. Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23904092/google-pixel-update-seven-years-editorial"&gt;got its act together&lt;/a&gt; with the Pixel 8, announcing a class-leading seven years of OS and security update support. Which is great! But you wouldn’t blame a Pixel 6 or 7 owner for feeling like they were unfairly left behind. Google seems to be making up some of the shortfall by offering these additional OS upgrades, and it’s a welcome change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qb6YXD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" align="center" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;And ICYMI, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PixelFold?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#PixelFold&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pixel6?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Pixel6&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pixel7?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Pixel7&lt;/a&gt; generation users will now get two additional years of OS updates! This extended support will total five years starting from when the device first became available on the Google Store in the US: &lt;a href="https://t.co/Y50A92TiqC"&gt;https://t.co/Y50A92TiqC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Made by Google (@madebygoogle) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/madebygoogle/status/1864794840673980452?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 5, 2024&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GiB1Rs"&gt;Of course, an ‘OS update’ isn’t quite what it used to be — for better and worse. Google is emphasizing pushing out more updates across older versions of Android through its Play framework. That’s a great thing, but it does mean that the yearly OS upgrade &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/13/23720419/android-14-google-io-keynote-announcements"&gt;isn’t quite as important as it once was&lt;/a&gt;. The company can also gate certain features to pricier or more recent models, as it has with &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://store.google.com/intl/en/ideas/articles/night-sight-video/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Night Sight Video&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2024/08/19/pixel-8-pro-google-photos-zoom-enhance/"&gt;Zoom Enhance&lt;/a&gt;. Google’s mention of new features via Pixel Drops for the next couple of years is promising, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uLjoY0"&gt;Going by Google’s original schedule, the Pixel 6 should have gotten its last OS platform upgrade with this year’s Android 15. &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2024/11/19/pixel-6-android-16-dp1/"&gt;Inquiring minds wondered if something was up&lt;/a&gt; when the Pixel 6 series was deemed eligible for the Android 16 beta, and now we know: Pixel 6 phones are on track to get Android 16 &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; 17 when they become available. Not too shabby.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google just made it easier to turn off personalized search results</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of Google’s multicolor “G” logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MedTji8IeuK7Bu0AgCmqESLL9jg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73769463/STK093_Google_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration: The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a6zPMY"&gt;Google is making it easier to switch off personalized search results thanks to an option that sometimes appears at the bottom of the results page, &lt;a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-search-results-are-personalized-try-without-personalization-38520.html"&gt;as reported by &lt;em&gt;Search Engine Roundtable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. After searching for something, scroll all the way down and look for a link to “Try without personalization.” Click or tap that and Google will load a new page without personalized results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IRyJaR"&gt;The link might not be present for you in all searches. Some results for me include a message at the end of the results page that already says “Results are not personalized.” This might be user error — maybe I have other settings that prevent it from appearing or am not using the right queries. But I did get the option to turn off personalized results much more often for searches on my iPhone than on my Mac, for some reason. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bRL3Fb"&gt;“This change makes it easier for people to get an accurate understanding of whether their results have been personalized, while also providing them with the opportunity to explore non-personalized results,” spokesperson Ned Adriance says in a statement. “We also make it easy for people to adjust their personalization settings at any time.” Adriance adds that “while we previously showed this information in About this result on individual results, this display is more accessible and clear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cD2OoF"&gt;Adriance also says that the link “gives people the option to temporarily view results that aren’t personalized” — so note that if you tap the link to try results without personalization, you’re not &lt;em&gt;permanently&lt;/em&gt; changing your personalization settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="de5Ohv"&gt;You have already been able to get unpersonalized search results for a very long time; as &lt;em&gt;Search Engine Roundtable&lt;/em&gt; reported &lt;a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/archives/013989.html"&gt;in 2007&lt;/a&gt;, you can see unpersonalized results by appending a parameter, “&amp;amp;pws=0,” to the end of a Google search URL. You can also turn off personalized search from your Google account settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xoejix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updates, December 5th&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added context from Google.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Gnpo1U"&gt;Following news that foreign hackers may &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24313187/encrypted-apps-salt-typhoon-hack-telecom-fbi-cisa"&gt;still be in US telecom networks&lt;/a&gt;, the Federal Communications Commission &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/rosenworcel-proposed-requiring-telecom-carriers-secure-their-networks"&gt;proposed a new rule&lt;/a&gt; that would require telecom companies to secure their networks from “unlawful access or interception of communications.” It would also force providers to submit an annual certification to the FCC stating they have implemented a plan to counter cybersecurity threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IfuC2b"&gt;On Wednesday, US officials recommended Americans use encrypted apps to make phone calls and texts in response to the ongoing infiltration of telecom networks linked to the Chinese hacking group Salt Typhoon. Deputy national security advisor Anne Neuberger confirmed that at least eight telecom providers have been impacted by the hack, as &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/white-house-salt-typhoon-hacked-telcos-in-dozens-of-countries/"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OrNs2U"&gt;“We cannot say with certainty that the adversary has been evicted because we still don’t know the scope of what they’re doing,” Neuberger said during a press briefing, &lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt; reports. Neuberger added that the attack has been going on for “likely one to two years” but doesn’t “believe any classified communications has been compromised.”&lt;/p&gt;

In a letter on Wednesday, Senators Eric Schmitt (R-MO) and Ron Wyden (D-OR) &lt;a href="https://www.nextgov.com/cybersecurity/2024/12/senators-call-investigation-dods-comms-following-chinese-telecom-breach/401431/"&gt;urged Department of Defense Inspector General Robert Storch&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the DOD’s “failure to secure its unclassified telephone communications from foreign espionage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JueOlF"&gt;If the FCC’s proposed rule is adopted, it will go into effect immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iqjxbO"&gt;“While the Commission’s counterparts in the intelligence community are determining the scope and impact of the Salt Typhoon attack, we need to put in place a modern framework to help companies secure their networks and better prevent and respond to cyberattacks in the future,” FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel said in the press release. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PC Gaming Show’s best trailers: creepy aliens, strategic turtles, and desktop platformers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A screenshot from the video game MainFrames." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CQ1rkgR5Sr28raz9-BYSbPtRN_0=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73769330/MainFrames_screenshot_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;MainFrames.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: The Arcade Crew&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qG6hyA"&gt;Before we all settle in for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/18/24299681/and-the-nominees-are"&gt;The Game Awards next week&lt;/a&gt;, this year’s PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted had its own assortment of interesting reveals and excellent trailers. It was an indie-focused showcase, which means that there was quite a bit of inventiveness on display; everything from a unique take on TMNT to a platformer where you jump around computer windows. If you missed the show live — which also included some news updates, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24313965/pubg-brendan-playerunknown-greene-new-games-krafton"&gt;like PlayerUnknown’s ambitious plans for the future&lt;/a&gt; — here’s a curated list of some of the best stuff that was on display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nRxLYl"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uZW8MwekNHk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SuCZTZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OYEcE9"&gt;The original &lt;em&gt;Moonlighter&lt;/em&gt; mixed action RPG gameplay with the mundanity of running a shop, and the sequel looks like much of the same: only this time, players are transported to another dimension they need to escape. &lt;em&gt;The Endless Vault&lt;/em&gt; launches in 2025 on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JlhJ2P"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WwKmulVHmXI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="T32Pa2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dhKD9B"&gt;One of the biggest surprises was&lt;em&gt; Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown&lt;/em&gt;, from indie studio Strange Scaffold. It’s billed as a turn-based take on the turtles, which is billed as an experience designed in part for “quick-play sessions that feel meaningful.” It takes place in a timeline without icons Shredder and Splinter. Given the studio’s history — see &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3011440/CLICKOLDING/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clickolding&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1246250/An_Airport_for_Aliens_Currently_Run_by_Dogs/?curator_clanid=41064705"&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Airport for Aliens Currently Run by Dogs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — it will hopefully also be weird in a good way. &lt;em&gt;Tactical Takedown &lt;/em&gt;launches on PC in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GYFVGB"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q4In8-k2A-I?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VUhbNN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cairn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6r6CSd"&gt;This rock-climbing adventure / survival game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24171651/day-of-the-devs-showcase-summer-game-fest-2024-best"&gt;has been looking good for a while now&lt;/a&gt;, and you can finally check it out for yourself: &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1588550/Cairn/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cairn&lt;/em&gt; just got a free demo on Steam&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4Lycj5"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zmCnI9Z2h5c?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="y1lIAA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sol Mates&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="r2tXvW"&gt;There can never be enough co-op games. This release from Daruma Games supports local and online co-op for up to four players, who are tasked with surviving in the great expanse of space by doing “odd jobs through the galaxy.” It’s also pretty darn cute. &lt;em&gt;Sol Mates&lt;/em&gt; launches in early access next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vhehLa"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e5yxJ1S5QLY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qx8TLn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Legend of Baboo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="flLvIJ"&gt;Billed as a “heartfelt nod to Middle Eastern fables,” this game looks like a potentially great mix of adventure, action, and puzzle solving, with a great big fluffy dog to ride on. In fact, you play as both the boy and the dog, who form a bond over the course of the game. Let’s hope it has a happier ending than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/5/13837896/the-last-guardian-review-ps4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Last Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Baboo&lt;/em&gt; is launching in 2025 on both PC and Xbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lbDmPa"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nde1ob2AqqQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tVNJzc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abyssus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="aWbq6h"&gt;Thanks to this game, I’ve learned of a fictional genre called “brinepunk,” where tech is powered by sea brine. It sounds weird, but this co-op shooter does take place in the fascinating underwater ruins of a long-gone civilization. Developer DoubleMoose says &lt;em&gt;Abyssus&lt;/em&gt; will go into alpha on December 6th, with a full release next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4vJZ3K"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aptfdb-ou5E?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="v63Ccw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MainFrames&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wiWeN1"&gt;All you really need to know is that this is a platformer where you’re jumping across a desktop PC interface, rearranging icons to solve puzzles, and fighting bosses controlled by the OS. It launches on both PC and the Nintendo Switch on March 6th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PsP9nj"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zsw5hRbtd7A?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="W7Umak"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deepest Fear&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xwe70h"&gt;Developed by Variable State, the indie studio behind games &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2016/9/22/13001942/virginia-game-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Virginia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Last Stop&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Deepest Fear&lt;/em&gt; is an immersive sci-fi horror title with distinct shades of &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Thing&lt;/em&gt;. The developers say that it “combines Metroidvania level design in the context of a classic FPS immersive sim, where the game’s setting is a puzzle to unravel and where creativity and improvisation are your greatest assets.” There’s no release date yet, but &lt;em&gt;Deepest Fear&lt;/em&gt; will (obviously) be launching on PC whenever it’s ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gijVBC"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SxT2jjn2yZ8?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Q9KQic"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blue Prince&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hFw4O4"&gt;It looks a bit like a more colorful take on &lt;em&gt;Myst&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Blue Prince&lt;/em&gt; is described as a game that “combines compelling mystery, strategy, and puzzle elements to create an unpredictable journey through Mt. Holly, a peculiar manor with ever-changing rooms.” It doesn’t have a release date yet, but according to the new trailer, it’s due out next spring.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sundar Pichai says Google Search will ‘change profoundly’ in 2025</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An image of Sundar Pichai in front of a Google logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x8BmqDYK0TF0RG7vWLCHFWmUBHY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73769147/VRG_Illo_STK179_L_Normand_SundarPichai_Neutral.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Laura Normand / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="j7YNVl"&gt;Google CEO Sundar Pichai says the company’s search engine will “change profoundly” in 2025. “I think we are going to be able to tackle more complex questions than ever before,” Pichai said &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/business/dealbook/google-ai-sundar-pichai.html"&gt;during the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;’s DealBook Summit&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sWERxk"&gt;“I think you’ll be surprised, even early in ‘25, the kind of newer things Search can do compared to where it is today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="s3YGQx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google is redesigning its search engine — and it’s AI all the way down","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/14/24155321/google-search-ai-results-page-gemini-overview"},{"title":"From ChatGPT to Gemini: how AI is rewriting the internet","url":"https://www.theverge.com/23610427/chatbots-chatgpt-new-bing-google-bard-conversational-ai"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OK1dU8"&gt;Pichai also responded to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s comment from earlier this year, in which he said Google should’ve &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/satya-nadella-google-default-winner-ai-race-microsoft-2024-3"&gt;been the “default winner” in the AI race&lt;/a&gt;. “I would love to do a side-by-side comparison of Microsoft’s own models and our models,” Pichai said. He added that Microsoft is “using someone else’s models,” alluding to the company’s partnership with OpenAI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1TZlj2"&gt;“When I look at what’s coming ahead, we are in the earliest stages of a profound shift,” Pichai said. “I just think there’s so much innovation ahead. We are committed to being at the state of the art in this field, and I think we are.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EBoGbf"&gt;Google started its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/14/24155321/google-search-ai-results-page-gemini-overview"&gt;big AI overhaul of Search&lt;/a&gt; this year, which included the addition of AI search summaries and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/3/24259759/google-lens-search-video-ai-launch"&gt;Lens update that lets you search&lt;/a&gt; the web with a video. The company is also preparing to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/25/24279600/google-next-gemini-ai-model-openai-december"&gt;launch a major update to its Gemini model&lt;/a&gt; as it aims to compete with Microsoft, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24314147/openai-reasoning-model-o1-strawberry-chatgpt-pro-new-tier"&gt;OpenAI&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/18/24299574/perplexity-ai-search-engine-buy-products"&gt;AI search engine Perplexity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

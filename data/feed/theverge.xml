    <title>Microsoft’s AI boss and Sam Altman disagree on what it takes to get to AGI </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Photo of Mustafa Suleyman." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PJ2O3LHT5CSz75MyWBg7UG8l674=/0x0:3321x2214/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73775996/1757293275.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HsLUH0"&gt;Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman disagrees with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s recent &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/article/openai-sam-altman-ama-reddit"&gt;claim in a Reddit AMA&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24201441/ai-terminology-explained-humans#:~:text=Artificial%20general%20intelligence%20(AGI)%3A"&gt;artificial general intelligence, or AGI&lt;/a&gt;, is possible on today’s hardware. While AGI is “plausible,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Nilay Patel in the latest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24314821/microsoft-ai-ceo-mustafa-suleyman-google-deepmind-openai-inflection-agi-decoder-podcast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt; episode&lt;/a&gt; that it could take as long as 10 years to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QZRF0S"&gt;With current hardware defined by Nilay as “within one or two generations of what we have now, I would say,” Suleyman replied, explaining why he thinks that’s unlikely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="oG4tVB"&gt;I don’t think it can be done on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/18/24105157/nvidia-blackwell-gpu-b200-ai"&gt;[Nvidia] GB200s&lt;/a&gt;. I do think it is going to be plausible at some point in the next two to five generations. I don’t want to say I think it’s a high probability that it’s two years away, but I think within the next five to seven years since each generation takes 18 to 24 months now. So, five generations could be up to 10 years away depending on how things go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="0FQJWE"&gt;“The uncertainty around this is so high,” Suleyman said, “that any categorical declarations just feel sort of ungrounded to me and over the top.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="s1zp2L"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://player.megaphone.fm/VMP3665150620" style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 200px;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="unSFWj"&gt;He’s also drawing a line between AGI and the “singularity”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="zgV0yt"&gt;It depends on your definition of AGI, right? AGI isn’t the singularity. The singularity is an exponentially recursive self-improving system that very rapidly accelerates far beyond anything that might look like human intelligence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s642A5"&gt;To me, AGI is a general-purpose learning system that can perform well across all human-level training environments. So, knowledge work, by the way, that includes physical labor. A lot of my skepticism has to do with the progress and the complexity of getting things done in robotics. But yes, I can well imagine that we have a system that can learn — without a great deal of handcrafted prior prompting — to perform well in a very wide range of environments. I think that is not necessarily going to be AGI, nor does that lead to the singularity, but it means that most human knowledge work in the next five to 10 years could likely be performed by one of the AI systems that we develop. And I think the reason why I shy away from the language around singularity or artificial superintelligence is because I think they’re very different things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sz6L0Y"&gt;The challenge with AGI is that it’s become so dramatized that we sort of end up not focusing on the specific capabilities of what the system can do. And that’s what I care about with respect to building AI companions, getting them to be useful to you as a human, work for you as a human, be on your side, in your corner, and on your team. That’s my motivation and that’s what I have control and influence over to try and create systems that are accountable and useful to humans rather than pursuing the theoretical super intelligence quest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="vYW2sb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Sam Altman lowers the bar for AGI","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24313130/sam-altman-openai-agi-lower-the-bar"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QagMSO"&gt;Last week, during &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; DealBook Summit, Altman &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24313130/sam-altman-openai-agi-lower-the-bar"&gt;set out a lower set of goalposts&lt;/a&gt; for AGI than the superintelligence-style phenomenon he’s &lt;a href="https://ia.samaltman.com/"&gt;described in the past&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rllAsp"&gt;Now, Altman says AGI will arrive “sooner than most people in the world think and it will matter much less.” And when it comes to superintelligence, “a lot of the safety concerns that we and others expressed actually don’t come at the AGI moment. AGI can get built, the world mostly goes on in mostly the same way, things grow faster, but then there is a long continuation from what we call AGI to what we call superintelligence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="snat8V"&gt;This is a relationship that appears strained only one year after Microsoft helped reseat Altman as OpenAI’s CEO. After confirming that Microsoft is working on its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24201441/ai-terminology-explained-humans#:~:text=images%2C%20and%20video.-,Frontier%20models%3A,-In%20addition%20to"&gt;frontier AI model&lt;/a&gt; capable of competing at the “GPT-4, GPT-4o scale,” Suleyman also commented on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/17/24273255/openai-and-microsoft-should-ask-chatgpt-for-ways-to-fix-a-relationship"&gt;tension&lt;/a&gt; between Microsoft and OpenAI:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="VdygYk"&gt;Every partnership has tension. It’s healthy and natural. I mean, they’re a completely different business to us. They operate independently and partnerships evolve over time... partnerships evolve and they have to adapt to what works at the time, so we’ll see how that changes over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="mWmvW4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lego Fortnite is getting a big expansion with a GTA-style roleplaying city</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Promotional art for Lego Brick Life, a social game inside of Fortnite." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AhzddTurtAkvVAGkOlJ4uy-nR50=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73775930/LEGO_Fortnite_Brick_Life_KeyArt.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JF62ri"&gt;Lego is building something new in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. A year after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23990660/lego-fortnite-release-epic"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lego Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; launched a new era inside of the game&lt;/a&gt; — one based on the idea that &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is a collection of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/9/23992574/fortnite-festival-harmonix-guitar-hero-rock-band"&gt;many game experiences&lt;/a&gt;, rather than just a battle royale — Lego is expanding its presence with a new title that sounds reminiscent of &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/em&gt; roleplaying as well as a rebrand of its core survival game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PUxdvD"&gt;First up is a game called &lt;em&gt;Brick Life&lt;/em&gt;, which is billed as “an all-new social roleplay experience.” Players explore a Lego-ified city location with 31 other people and can take on specific jobs like courier, security guard, or sushi chef. Players can design their own homes and explore locations like a magical school and rooftop club, and there are missions to take on as well. From the sounds of it, &lt;em&gt;Brick Life&lt;/em&gt; is a more family-friendly take on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/11/23828431/rockstar-cfx-re-mod-tools-roleplay-server"&gt;the enduring popularity of roleplaying servers in &lt;em&gt;GTA V&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and Epic isn’t being all that subtle about the connection:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mQW4WB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" align="center"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Ah bricks here we go again... &lt;a href="https://t.co/1HiNMIbUKX"&gt;pic.twitter.com/1HiNMIbUKX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— LEGO Fortnite (@LEGOFortnite) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LEGOFortnite/status/1865803561210204202?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 8, 2024&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rGTSp2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brick Life&lt;/em&gt; is launching inside of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on December 12th, though it won’t be available for players in South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h1e7E5"&gt;As part of the announcement, &lt;em&gt;Lego Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; — the &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;-style survival experience that launched last December — is being renamed &lt;em&gt;Lego Fortnite Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;. From now on, “Lego Fortnite” will be the name of the hub inside of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; that houses all of the Lego experiences. Epic and Lego have been steadily expanding their partnership over the last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/27/24084644/fortnite-new-lego-games-raft-survival-obby-fun"&gt;launching new games&lt;/a&gt; and also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/20/24106477/lego-fortnite-user-created-games-epic"&gt;letting &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; players build their own Lego games&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QaXblH"&gt;The ongoing collaboration between Lego and &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; could provide a hint at what to expect from the upcoming “persistent universe” that Epic and Disney are making together, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/7/24065281/disney-epic-games-investment-fortnite-metaverse"&gt;following a $1.5 billion investment from Disney in February&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24261555/epic-disney-fortnite-unreal-fest"&gt;we’ve heard very little specifics&lt;/a&gt; about what the virtual world might look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yLSF7g"&gt;Meanwhile, Epic has also announced that &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is getting support for a revamped version of text chat, which will be available as an option across all of its experiences starting on December 10th. There will be three kinds of text chat available: party channel for talking with your squad; game channel for a public conversation with people on the same island; and DMs with people on your friends list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o00PVY"&gt;Epic says there will be two kinds of chat filters — one that removes personal information, and another that filters out “various kinds of mature language and toxicity” — which will be always on for players under the age of 13 in all forms of text chat. They will also be always on for all players in the channel chats. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/16/23962354/epic-games-fortnite-report-voice-conversations"&gt;The feature will also include a reporting system similar to the voice reporting tool Epic launched last year&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s an example of what text chats look like in the game:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of Fortnite featuring an in-game text chat." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3ubHynyP_fizIJkpa20ygm1uT1M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25781166/Fortnite_Text_Chat.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Epic Games&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VEGMdP"&gt;All of these announcements come at a particularly busy time for &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. The battle royale game is currently in the midst of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/26/24306403/fortnite-minus-one"&gt;a brand-new chapter&lt;/a&gt; that kicked off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/4/24288014/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-snoop-dogg-times-square-music"&gt;following an ambitious music-themed season&lt;/a&gt;, and Epic also recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24294616/fortnite-og-permanent-december-release-date"&gt;brought back the nostalgia-filled &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; OG as a permanent mode&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/7/24315134/fortnite-ballistic-counter-strike-first-person-shooter-fps"&gt;Epic just announced “Ballistic,”&lt;/a&gt; a multiplayer first-person shooter mode that launches inside of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on December 11th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Raspberry Pi’s new keyboard computer can power an optional $100 display</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Raspberry Pi 500 computer keyboard on a desk connected to the Raspberry Pi Monitor." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gAErz__ovF5snzd-csyG0LW3hgU=/0x1:1220x814/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73775927/raspberry_pi_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Raspberry Pi 500 computer keyboard starts at $90, but you’ll need to add your own mouse, power supply, and screen for that price.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Raspberry Pi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Id14Bq"&gt;Raspberry Pi has announced an &lt;a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-500-and-raspberry-pi-monitor-on-sale-now/"&gt;upgraded version of its compact computer-in-a-keyboard&lt;/a&gt;, adding the new features and performance improvements of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/28/23889238/raspberry-pi-5-specs-availability-pricing"&gt;Raspberry Pi 5&lt;/a&gt; microcomputer it introduced last September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G6EgNp"&gt;The Raspberry Pi 500, which is &lt;a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-500/"&gt;available now&lt;/a&gt; starting for $90, is $20 more expensive than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/2/21542278/raspberry-pi-400-keyboard-computer-arm-release-date-news-features"&gt;Raspberry Pi 400 that debuted in late 2020&lt;/a&gt;. That extra cost gets you a 2.4GHz 64-bit quad-core Arm Cortex-A76 processor and 8GB of RAM. If you want more than just the computer keyboard, a $120 Desktop Kit includes it plus a matching mouse, a 27W USB-C power supply, a single micro HDMI cable, and a printed copy of the &lt;em&gt;Raspberry Pi Beginner’s Guide&lt;/em&gt; book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Raspberry Pi Monitor against a gray background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6d0SkysoV042v3Woyk-R4uafcLw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25781160/raspberry_pi_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Raspbery Pi&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Raspberry Pi Monitor features a 15.6-inch full HD IPS panel and built-in speakers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="90jrP0"&gt;The company is also introducing a display for those looking to buy a $220 all-in-one desktop solution. The $100 Raspberry Pi Monitor features a 15.6-inch full HD IPS panel with a built-in pair of 1.2W speakers and a folding stand. The display can be powered directly from a Raspberry Pi microcomputer with a USB port that outputs 1.5A at 5V, which includes the new Raspberry Pi 500 computer and its predecessor. But brightness will be limited to 60 percent while volume maxes out at 50 percent. With its own power supply —which you’ll need to buy separately — you’ll get full volume and brightness.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Raspberry Pi 500’s keyboard features a compact tenkeyless design with its various ports accessible on the back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RcjSzv"&gt;Other features of the Raspberry Pi 500 computer keyboard include an 800MHz VideoCore VII GPU, a 40-pin Raspberry Pi GPIO connector for attaching peripherals, support for 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5.0, two USB 3.0 ports, one USB 2.0 port, a gigabit ethernet port, and a single USB-C port that’s only used for power. There are also a pair of micro HDMI ports that can drive two 4K displays at 60Hz each, and a microSD card slot that comes with a 32GB card preloaded with the Debian-based Raspberry Pi operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JjaMrN"&gt;The new Raspberry Pi 500 won’t entirely replace the older Raspberry Pi 400, which is being kept around with a price drop from $70 to $60. The Raspberry Pi 400 Personal Computer Kit, which includes additional accessories like a mouse and power supply, is also getting a price cut from $100 to $80.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reddit’s new AI search tool helps you find Reddit answers without Google</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An image showing the Reddit logo on a red and white background" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lLYKIbCvk9SbeF-SSYa1hLYpTHI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73775861/STK115_Reddit_04.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration: The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LgLcfs"&gt;Reddit is launching a new AI-powered search tool called Reddit Answers to help you more easily find information on the platform. The tool, similar to other AI search products, responds to queries by generating well-formatted responses and showing links to its sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5F6f0A"&gt;But the distinction with Reddit Answers is that it sources things directly from Reddit, which means it could be a way to skip Google and get information directly from the source. Reddit has already been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/24/24205244/reddit-blocking-search-engine-crawlers-ai-bot-google"&gt;cracking down&lt;/a&gt; on where you can search for things from Reddit, and Google is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/24/24205244/reddit-blocking-search-engine-crawlers-ai-bot-google"&gt;only major search engine&lt;/a&gt; that shows recent Reddit results. But Reddit probably would prefer if you did searches right on its platform, and Reddit Answers might prove to be a good way to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ilmLf"&gt;Reddit Answers will initially roll out to “a limited number of users” in the US and in English, and it will be available on the web (not on Old Reddit) and iOS. (“We’re working on Android as we speak,” Serkan Piantino, Reddit’s VP of product, said in an interview.) Reddit plans to bring the tool to more languages and locations “in the future,” &lt;a href="https://redditinc.com/blog/introducing-reddit-answers"&gt;according to a blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0gG3oN"&gt;Reddit gave me access to a test version of Reddit Answers, and while I haven’t been able to mess around with it very much, I’ve liked what I’ve seen. There’s a big box to ask a query, but the initial Reddit Answers page also floats a bunch of suggested searches you can click on, like “favorite Nintendo character of all time,” “best mystery novels of 2025,” and “tips for flying with a baby for the first time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7tL7LT"&gt;I clicked that last one, and the tool quickly pulled together a list and some bulleted suggestions with hyperlinks on the text &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; an arrow to click to see the source of the information. When you click either, a sidebar pops up showing the exact post where the information comes from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An example results page for Reddit Answers." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SoTpotPdO_U-cAqLDSb1Q59fJ40=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25777694/Screenshot_2024_12_06_at_2.34.47_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is from a test version of Reddit Answers, so things might look a tad different when you try it. But you can get the gist.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0yCFZ2"&gt;A Reddit site search for the same query on Google, on the other hand, just gave me a standard long list of links to evaluate and click through. On its face, Google’s version, which doesn’t have the summaries or bullet points, isn’t as immediately informative as Reddit Answers. But personally, I’m pretty skeptical of AI summaries anyway — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24313222/chatgpt-pardon-biden-bush-esquire"&gt;they can make some pretty bad errors!&lt;/a&gt; — so for me, the Google results are still perfectly fine as a way to explore some potentially useful posts on Reddit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of a Google search for “site:reddit.com + tips for flying with a baby for the first time”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mbYYa3fEGWI5MF93eDruffiFbrg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25777858/Screenshot_2024_12_06_at_4.29.29_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Reddit site search on Google.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="B9rDh8"&gt;Reddit Answers can also pick up on things happening on Reddit within minutes, according to spokesperson Tim Rathschmidt, so there’s also a chance responses to your queries will have timely results. I haven’t had much luck with that; on Friday, for example, I asked “who won yesterday’s NFL game,” and instead of pulling up answers about Thursday’s Packers-Lions game, it included details on the Eagles-Ravens game that happened on December 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3PV7kd"&gt;That might have just been a quirk of the product not being fully ready yet. In my testing, though, Reddit Answers has been much more useful as a jumping off point to dig into a more general topic on Reddit rather than an up-to-the-minute search tool. And while Reddit Answers is useful, I’m not sure yet if it’s good enough for me to change my habits around using Google to search for things on Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Q8OCy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Itch.io went offline due to a ‘trash AI-powered’ phishing report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Itch indie store" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EyIiBX2jETfau7K9ueh1nJRZZDs=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73775550/itch.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UERCht"&gt;Indie game storefront &lt;a href="http://Itch.io"&gt;Itch.io&lt;/a&gt; went offline early Monday morning after what it described as a bogus phishing report. While the game store’s servers were still online during the outage, the domain for the website pointed towards IP addresses that itch.io doesn’t own — making it inaccessible for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hN5hr7"&gt;After going offline at around 2AM ET, the site seemed to come back at around 7AM ET. Itch.io blames pop culture collectibles company Funko for the issues in a &lt;a href="https://x.com/itchio/status/1866017758040993829"&gt;post on X&lt;/a&gt;, “because they use some trash ‘AI-powered’ Brand Protection Software called Brand Shield that created some bogus Phishing report to our registrar.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KBL1rw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" align="center"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I kid you not, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/itchio?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@itchio&lt;/a&gt; has been taken down by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OriginalFunko?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@OriginalFunko&lt;/a&gt; because they use some trash "AI Powered" Brand Protection Software called &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BrandShieldltd?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@BrandShieldltd&lt;/a&gt; that created some bogus Phishing report to our registrar, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/iwantmyname?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt;, who ignored our response and just disabled the domain&lt;/p&gt;— itch.io (@itchio) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/itchio/status/1866017758040993829?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 9, 2024&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aB6YLH"&gt;While the disputed page was taken down, itch.io’s domain registrar, &lt;a href="https://iwantmyname.com/"&gt;iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt;, still disabled the domain likely due to automated systems. According to a &lt;a href="https://x.com/itchio/status/1866022784222245305"&gt;post on X&lt;/a&gt;, the indie game marketplace had to wait for the domain registrar to respond and re-enable its domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ehpT6"&gt;The domain issues come just days after itch.io &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/13/24295998/you-can-now-use-your-itch-io-url-as-your-username-on-bluesky"&gt;started allowing its users&lt;/a&gt; to use its domain name for Bluesky accounts. If you have spent $10 on the platform then you have the option to use your itch.io profile URL on Bluesky, but the domain issues meant anyone who switched to the custom itch.io URLs had an “invalid handle” error on Bluesky until the main itch.io domain came back online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BHwv2S"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, December 9th: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Noted that Itch is back online.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trailers of the week: Star Trek, Severance, and Gundam</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Stylized picture of Michelle Yeoh’s Emperor Philippa Georgiou sitting in a chair." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CLq4tjFTS9rALVHscbYk6s1FX08=/426x0:2000x1049/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73774999/Section_31_Michelle_Yeoh.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cswHyX"&gt;It’s the first week of December, and the end of the year is coming in fast and with a lot to look forward to at theaters this month. That very cool-looking &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24226288/the-lord-of-the-rings-war-of-the-rohirrim-anime-trailer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; anime&lt;/a&gt; hits US theaters on the 13th; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24228966/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-trailer-keanu-reeves"&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&lt;/a&gt; follows on the 20th; and I’m deeply excited to see &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/2/24311195/thank-goodness-robert-eggers-saw-nosferatu-1922-on-a-bootlegged-vhs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nosferatu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on December 25th. (If you’re not with me on that last one, give Matt Zoller Seitz’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/13/24295480/y2slay"&gt;RogerEbert.com review&lt;/a&gt; of it a read and get back to me.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iopXfc"&gt;While I’m waiting to go be unnerved by Robert Eggers’ new spooky vampire movie, let’s take a look at some good trailers from the last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="crZLiJ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/7/24315722/star-trek-section-31-official-movie-trailer-michelle-yeoh-paramount-plus-streaming"&gt;Star Trek: Section 31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="QCPjxq"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/63k1Otp9qtM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lDd5YR"&gt;I’ll admit that the biggest appeal for me about this straight-to-streaming spy movie spinoff of &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Discovery&lt;/em&gt; is Michelle Yeoh as Emperor Philippa Georgiou. She’s just having so much &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt; in this trailer. The trailers haven’t revealed yet what threat she’ll be facing, other than being forced to do teamwork, but it seems like it’ll be pretty heavy on the rag-tag team of antiheroes action thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4N6mx8"&gt;The Olatunde Osunsanmi-directed movie also stars Omari Hardwick, Kacey Rohl, Sven Ruygrok, Humberly Gonzalez, Rob Kazinsky, and Sam Richardson. It premieres on Paramount Plus starting January 24th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vBMz5J"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/7/24314837/severance-season-2-trailer-goats-apple-tv-plus"&gt;Severance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="DPw7N5"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_UXKlYvLGJY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QCkxq9"&gt;I was late to the &lt;em&gt;Severance &lt;/em&gt;party, having finally finished it a few months ago, so I can only imagine how eager people who saw its cliffhanger ending have been to see the story continue. Well, the second season of creator Dan Erickson’s bizarro sci-fi drama is almost here, and it looks like it’s probably going to bring answers, with even more mystery heaped on top of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9BLP7z"&gt;All of the first season’s main characters, including Mark (Adam Scott), Dylan (Zach Cherry), Helly (Britt Lower), and Irving (John Turturro) are returning, and they’ll be joined by characters played by the likes of Alia Shawkat, Gwendoline Christie, and Bob Balaban. Season two of &lt;em&gt;Severance&lt;/em&gt; premieres January 17th on Apple TV Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dkyCkN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/8/24316383/invincible-season-3-trailer-amazon-prime-video"&gt;Invincible&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="z9gD82"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rbHUhCcSXEM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5iv07T"&gt;The third season of &lt;em&gt;Invincible&lt;/em&gt; will see a stronger, older Mark Grayson (Steven Yeun) tell off GDA director Cecil Stedman (Walton Goggins) and episodes that show creator Robert Kirkman hopes will each feel like a finale. And there’s no season break this time around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s8a1Iu"&gt;The show debuts with three episodes February 6th on Amazon Prime, with new episodes releasing every Thursday after until March 13th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IBLEie"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/8/24316339/wheel-of-time-season-3-streaming-premiere-amazon-prime-trailer-release-date"&gt;The Wheel of Time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="vvcKHt"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/erxeLAg85fg?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LOmNiw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wheel of Time&lt;/em&gt; continues its retelling of the Robert Jordan fantasy epic on March 13th next year. In its third season, the show follows Joshua Stradowski’s Rand al’Thor — the “Dragon Reborn” — and Moiraine Damodred (Rosamund Pike) as they go into the Aiel Waste. It’s been more than two decades since I read the book series, so I couldn’t spoil what happens there for you if I wanted to, but I seem to recall this was a fairly dark time in the series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sAhqs7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/7/24315769/whats-in-the-gorge-stays-in-the-gorge"&gt;The Gorge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="L97o1w"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rUSdnuOLebE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NoVTgP"&gt;Who knows what evil is in &lt;em&gt;The Gorge&lt;/em&gt;’s, uh, gorge, but it’s apparently contained well enough that humanity only needs two snipers — who aren’t allowed to interact with each other — stationed on either side of it to make sure it stays there. The snipers, Levi (Miles Teller) and Drasa (Anya Taylor-Joy), &lt;em&gt;do &lt;/em&gt;interact and fall for eachother, then end up in the gorge. Oops! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MSiErv"&gt;Scott Derrickson directs the movie, which also stars Sigourney Weaver, Sope Dirisu, and William Houston. It premieres February 14th on Apple TV Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IK1mSD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24313105/gundam-gquuuuuux-trailer-hideaki-anno-yoji-enokido"&gt;Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="NHiGtS"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VZaqtgVtL1M?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Tazqnv"&gt;Giant robot anime fans rejoice: there’s a new &lt;em&gt;Mobile Suit Gundam&lt;/em&gt; coming next year. It’s called &lt;a href="https://en.gundam.info/about-gundam/series-pages/gquuuuuux/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and it’s produced by Khara, the studio behind the &lt;em&gt;Rebuild of Evangelion&lt;/em&gt; films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZQOax"&gt;The weird name references a Gundam called the gMS-Ω GQuuuuuuX. The show will follow a highschooler — named Yuzuriha “Machu” Amate (Tomoyo Kurosawa) — who learns to co-pilot the building-sized, sword-wielding robot with pilot Shuji Ito (Shimba Tsuchiya). Some of its episodes will head to Japanese theaters on January 17th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qfKJBm"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RqVG4N"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="BSyL6G"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JMVPiI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CxF9Qb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="S1lPIO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Invincible &lt;/em&gt;season three is on its way, and Amazon has &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/rbHUhCcSXEM?si=uYVYLDo_w0xcVbHH"&gt;released a new trailer&lt;/a&gt; in which hero Mark Grayson takes on robots, rams a rocket in space, and chastises Oliver. He also gets a new blue suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l6gNYT"&gt;“Mark’s speed has increased 65 percent; his endurance, 70 percent; and his strength, 138 percent,” says GDA agent Donald Ferguson (Chris Diamantopoulos), setting up the action-filled trailer. What follows are a &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat-&lt;/em&gt;style beheading, nuclear explosions, and the promise of drama as Mark (Steven Yeun) tells GDA director Cecil Stedman (Walton Goggins) that he’s quitting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HtJx8s"&gt;The action will apparently persist all season long, as &lt;em&gt;Invincible&lt;/em&gt; creator Robert Kirkman &lt;a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/invincible-season-3-tease-robert-kirkman/"&gt;said earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; that he wanted every episode of it to “feel like it’s a finale.” And unlike the last season, this one &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/15/24270890/invincible-season-3-premiere-date-no-break-amazon"&gt;won’t have a midseason break&lt;/a&gt;. Three episodes will start streaming on February 6th, 2025, with a new one following every Thursday through March 13th.&lt;/p&gt;

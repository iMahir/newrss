  &lt;p&gt;The shooter had a message, and the internet was happy to spread it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft kills off Skype credits and phone numbers in favor of subscriptions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple IOS Application Illustrations" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2i72hZiVtdvMN-3jK3UU0NdS5vs=/0x2:7592x5063/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73784230/1231496630.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MOivpN"&gt;Microsoft has quietly ended the sale of new credits and phone number features for Skype this week. Skype Credit and Skype Number are both being discontinued in favor of Microsoft pushing subscriptions instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k8ys2z"&gt;Skype Credit was a pay-as-you-go plan for making calls both locally and internationally, and Skype Number allowed you to have a phone number that people could call and get through to your Skype account. Both have existed in Skype for years, making it a popular choice for calling landlines and mobile phones over the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aD8fi2"&gt;“New sales of Skype numbers and Skype credit have stopped, but customers can still use existing Skype numbers and credits,” says Amit Fulay, vice president of Microsoft Teams and Skype, in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Users can also purchase new outbound PSTN calling services through monthly Skype subscriptions or use Skype’s free VoIP services for voice or video calls.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L22YhI"&gt;While existing Skype phone numbers will continue to work for now, it seems inevitable that Microsoft will eventually force existing users into a subscription, too. Existing Skype Credit can also be used, but you can’t buy any additional top ups. Even with Microsoft’s Skype subscriptions, there’s still no direct replacement for having a phone number that people can ring to get to your Skype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9DlQZo"&gt;Microsoft made the surprise decision to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/31/24210273/microsoft-skype-ads-removal"&gt;remove ads from Skype&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, alongside new features like AI image creation. The communications app, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/10/14/2489611/microsoft-skype-deal-complete"&gt;acquired by Microsoft in 2011&lt;/a&gt;, has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21200844/microsoft-skype-zoom-houseparty-coronavirus-pandemic-usage-growth-competition"&gt;struggled to remain relevant&lt;/a&gt; in recent years up against WhatsApp, Zoom, FaceTime, and other video calling apps. Microsoft has also turned its attention more to Teams in recent years, especially after launching a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298766/microsoft-teams-personal-launch-preview-accounts"&gt;personal version of Teams &lt;/a&gt;in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel executives hint at potential manufacturing spinoff</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Image of the Intel logo in a blue circle on a black background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7YrQk04v0AsVXdzE1NVGhsBtN1M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73784212/acastro_STK094_02.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fplBwJ"&gt;After the surprise ousting of former Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/2/24310983/intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger-retired"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;, the chip maker is facing an uncertain future that could involve splitting the company up. The temporary co-CEOs of Intel both appeared at Barclays investment banking conference on Thursday, hinting at a potential manufacturing spinoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JGkAyB"&gt;Intel’s manufacturing business finances and operations are already being separated into a standalone subsidiary, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-executives-say-manufacturing-spinoff-is-possible-2024-12-12/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Intel’s chief financial officer, David Zinsner, admitted “that’s going to happen,” but stopped short of confirming whether Intel would ever fully spin off its manufacturing business. “Does it ever fully separate? That’s an open question for another day,” said Zinsner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Nptoe"&gt;Intel Products CEO, Michelle Johnston Holthaus, also discussed the possibility of a manufacturing spinoff, as the two co-CEOs wait for Intel’s board to find a Gelsinger replacement. “Pragmatically, do I think it makes sense that they’re completely separated and there’s no tie? I don’t think so. But someone will decide that,” said Holthaus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="X9xdII"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Intel’s CEO is out after only three years","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/2/24310983/intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger-retired"},{"title":"What happened to Intel? ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24311594/intel-under-pat-gelsinger"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ehNwJB"&gt;The decision on splitting up Intel will be a key one for the company, and any incoming CEO. Intel had to outsource the manufacturing of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24169115/intel-lunar-lake-architecture-platform-feature-reveal"&gt;Lunar Lake laptop chips&lt;/a&gt; to its rival TSMC earlier this year, in what turned out to be a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/1/24285513/intel-ceo-lunar-lake-one-off-memory-package-discrete-gpu"&gt;financial mistake&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1pmGut"&gt;It won’t be easy for Intel to spin off its own foundries, though. Intel receives &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/26/24306348/intel-awarded-8-billion-chips-act-funding-us-chipmaking"&gt;nearly $8 billion in CHIPS and Science Act funding&lt;/a&gt; from the US government, and the US Department of Commerce has &lt;a href="https://www.intc.com/filings-reports/all-sec-filings/content/0000050863-24-000169/0000050863-24-000169.pdf"&gt;oversight over any change of control&lt;/a&gt;. If Intel does end up spinning off its manufacturing business, then it will turn into a company that designs chips much like its direct rivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3rpvM7"&gt;Now, it’s all eyes on Intel’s “18A” process which is set to arrive next year and may struggle to beat TSMC and deliver a flagship PC chip to rival AMD. Intel has faced a series of setbacks this year, ranging from the Lunar Lake financial mistake to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24262287/intel-13th-14th-gen-crash-raptor-lake-root-cause-fix"&gt;crashing 13th and 14th Gen chips&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24278407/intel-ultra-9-285k-benchmarks-performance-hands-on"&gt;underwhelming next-gen desktop CPUs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Naughty Dog reveals sci-fi game Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A screenshot from Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AUDTrVh1qCFbhFXFi5ElcsHQY7o=/160x0:1510x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73783885/Screenshot_2024_12_12_at_7.54.35_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PpvBTg"&gt;The Game Awards’ final world premiere was &lt;a href="https://www.naughtydog.com/blog/intergalactic_the_heretic_prophet_announcement"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Developed by Naughty Dog,&lt;em&gt; Intergalactic&lt;/em&gt; is a futuristic space opera with the kind of futurepunk vibes that remind me of &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt;. That comparison is apt as &lt;em&gt;Intergalactic&lt;/em&gt; game director and Naughty Dog studio head Neil Druckmann mentioned &lt;a href="https://www.naughtydog.com/blog/intergalactic_the_heretic_prophet_announcement"&gt;on the game’s website&lt;/a&gt; that it stars a space bounty hunter. Indeed, the trailer even featured an anime playing in the background reminiscent of &lt;em&gt;Dirty Pair&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lo1I8K"&gt;Here’s Naughty Dog’s description of the game, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLGy63pt9vA"&gt;from the YouTube trailer&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="yQDOye"&gt;Set thousands of years in the future, Intergalactic puts players into the role of Jordan A. Mun, a dangerous bounty hunter who ends up stranded on Sempiria — a distant planet whose communication with the outside universe went dark hundreds of years ago. Jordan will have to use all her skills and wits if she hopes to be the first person in over 600 years to leave its orbit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Raj1wr"&gt;Tati Gabrielle, who played Prudence Night in the &lt;em&gt;Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, &lt;/em&gt;stars as Jordan. Ironically, Gabrielle was part of the cast of another Naughty Dog project playing Jo Braddock in the &lt;em&gt;Uncharted &lt;/em&gt;movie. It also will feature comedian and actor Kumail Nanjiani who makes a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it appearance as the bounty Jordan’s after. Druckmann ended &lt;em&gt;Intergalactic&lt;/em&gt;’s announcement with the news that Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross have taken a break from winning all the awards for their movie soundtracks to work on the music for the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T8zgJv"&gt;There’s no release date yet, but the game is in development for the PS5.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Okami is getting a sequel</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The logo for an Okami sequel." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SH2zYbLZoGas6zTpRx873F6V9iA=/254x0:1871x1078/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73783875/Screenshot_2024_12_12_at_10.51.05_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Capcom&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kqhiwT"&gt;Capcom had quite the surprise in store at The Game Awards. The developer announced a sequel to &lt;em&gt;Okami&lt;/em&gt;, a beautiful and beloved action-adventure game that originally launched back in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DrPo9K"&gt;The sequel — which doesn’t currently have a name — was revealed in dramatic fashion with a musical performance. Original director &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/12/23914228/hideki-kamiya-bayonetta-platinum-games-retiring-youtube"&gt;Hideki Kamiya&lt;/a&gt; is returning for the game, which will be developed by his new studio Clovers. It’s still very early though; during the reveal TGA host Geoff Keighley said that “production is about to begin.” Capcom, meanwhile, says only that “a new adventure in the same vein as &lt;em&gt;Okami&lt;/em&gt; has been set in motion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qXmO2l"&gt;Not only has it been quite some time since &lt;em&gt;Okami&lt;/em&gt; debuted, its announcement also comes at a time when Capcom seems intent on doubling down on its biggest franchises. Right now that means a lot of &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt;. Up next is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24167998/monster-hunter-wilds-date-trailer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Wilds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is launching next year, as well as the mobile spinoff &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24294524/monster-hunter-outlanders-mobile-game"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Outlanders&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zJRngv"&gt;However, Okami isn’t the only Capcom franchise being revived: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24320142/onimusha-is-back-and-very-bloody"&gt;the company also revealed a new entry in the action franchise &lt;em&gt;Onimusha&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is launching in 2026. Here’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOiJGLZDnFw"&gt;the very bloody debut trailer &lt;/a&gt;for that.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Borderlands 4’s first trailer is all out war</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The logo for the video game Borderlands 4." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GqECg5hypLONkJHX9vLwKDLEghI=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73783787/borderlands4.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Gearbox Software&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2REkJR"&gt;We already knew it was in the works, and now we have an idea of how it will look and play. At the Game Awards, Gearbox Software revealed the first proper trailer for &lt;em&gt;Borderlands 4&lt;/em&gt;, which is due out in 2025. The trailer starts with a cinematic depicting a large-scale conflict of some sort, before getting into the actual gameplay — which is as colorful and violent as you’d expect from the franchise. The game is playable solo or co-op with up to three other players, and Gearbox says that there are “billions” of weapons to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpNn3m"&gt;Here’s the basic set-up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="1SeAw7"&gt;Break free from the oppressive Timekeeper, a ruthless dictator who dominates the masses from on high. Now a world-altering catastrophe threatens his perfect Order, unleashing mayhem across the planet. Ignite a resistance and blast your way through mechanical monstrosities, bloodthirsty bandits, and vicious beasts. Amass an arsenal of death-dealing firepower to wreak havoc as you tear your way across Kairos. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="yAOHiB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Borderlands 4&lt;/em&gt; was first announced this summer, and will be the first new entry in the looter shooter series since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/14/20803683/borderlands-3-preview-gearbox-interview-social-media-streamers-vlogging"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Borderlands 3&lt;/em&gt; in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. It also follows the franchise’s debut on the big screen, as the &lt;em&gt;Borderlands&lt;/em&gt; movie hit theaters in August to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/30/24232389/borderlands-movie-review-interview-video-on-demand"&gt;less than critical acclaim&lt;/a&gt;. The game is also in development during an interesting time for Gearbox; in March &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/28/24114402/embracer-selling-gearbox-borderlands-developer-take-two"&gt;the studio was sold to Take-Two&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/23/24163110/embracer-laid-off-more-employees-than-riot-games-entire-workforce"&gt;beleaguered publisher Embracer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zvdqcJ"&gt;While &lt;em&gt;Borderlands 4&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t have a specific release date yet, it’s coming to PS5, Xbox, and PC next year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Split Fiction is the next co-op game from Hazelight Studios</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A screenshot from the video game Split Fiction." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Era7CPtpmaE3crTVnWvRj40GT7k=/238x0:1561x882/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73783771/Screenshot_2024_12_12_at_8.43.20_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: EA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vQFJFx"&gt;Josef Fares is back and so &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22826987/josef-fares-hazelight-studios-it-takes-two-game-of-the-year"&gt;is his penchant for cursing&lt;/a&gt;. The director of Hazelight Studios has returned to The Game Awards to debut his next game: &lt;em&gt;Split Fiction&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kx4c8G"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Split Fiction&lt;/em&gt; is a game that feels very much in Hazelight’s wheelhouse. Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22352157/it-takes-two-interview-developer-josef-fares-hazelight-studio-co-op"&gt;&lt;em&gt;It Takes Two&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/22/17151056/a-way-out-coop-multiplayer-review-ps4-xbox-one"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Way Out&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; before it, &lt;em&gt;Split Fiction&lt;/em&gt; is a two-person split-screen co-op game. In it, two game developers have been trapped in a world they created and must play together to escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1hvYQ6"&gt;It’s been a quiet but massively successful handful of years for Hazelight Studios. In 2021, it took home Game of the Year for &lt;em&gt;It Takes Two &lt;/em&gt;in which two players must work together to overcome the myriad dangers of their home (and their failing marriage) &lt;em&gt;Honey, I Shrunk The Kids&lt;/em&gt;-style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Wb0xa"&gt;Earlier this year, the studio announced that &lt;a href="https://x.com/HazelightGames/status/1846588233573937193"&gt;&lt;em&gt;It Takes Two&lt;/em&gt; sold 20 million copies&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/analysis/489856/it-takes-two-sales-20-million"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polygon &lt;/em&gt;did a deep dive into the game’s sales numbers&lt;/a&gt;, determining that it sold at an astonishingly consistent and enviable clip of half a million copies per month since its release in March 2021. A truly remarkable feat given the game had very little marketing outside its initial release window &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;at a time when most consumers’ multiplayer tastes were wrapped up in “forever games” like &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Fortnite. &lt;/em&gt;With bona fides like that, it’s safe to say folks will be looking at &lt;em&gt;Split Fiction, &lt;/em&gt;launching March 6th on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, with great interest.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FromSoftware debuts a new Elden Ring game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The logo for Elden Ring Nightreign." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ki-mLb0HjJoCXuho6h93Y8RlngY=/246x0:1752x1004/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73783768/Screenshot_2024_12_12_at_8.28.44_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Bandai Namco&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ehi7n6"&gt;FromSoftware, the studio that &lt;a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/elden-ring-director-hidetaka-miyazaki-says-fromsoftware-isnt-really-considering-elden-ring-2-right-now-but-hes-still-not-ruling-out-more-of-the-lands-between-in-the-future/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;just this month&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said it was “not really considering developments such as an &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring 2,&lt;/em&gt;” has revealed a game that looks a lot like it could be &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring 2&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qDG6dP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elden Ring Nightreign&lt;/em&gt; is the next entry in the &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt; series. The trailer, debuting during this year’s The Game Awards, didn’t share much narrative details, but from &lt;a href="https://www.bandainamcoent.com/news/elden-ring-nightreign-announcement"&gt;the game’s official announcement&lt;/a&gt;, it doesn’t seem like game director Hidetaka Miyzaki told a fib. &lt;em&gt;Nightreign&lt;/em&gt; goes in a completely different gameplay direction from the base game and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180536/shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-elden-ring-dlc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shadows of the Erdtree&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; DLC. Described as an action survival game, &lt;em&gt;Nightreign&lt;/em&gt; is a standalone co-op multiplayer game lets up to three players work together to survive a single day in a parallel universe to the Lands Between. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1dWS0x"&gt;Players, called Nightfarers, will have up to eight different characters to choose from each with unique abilities and ultimate attacks. Each day, they have to fight through a battery of monsters to ultimately face off against a tough boss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2xXjIx"&gt;While we don’t yet know when this takes place in Lands Between chronology, the trailer did show off a ton of gameplay. It appears to be similar to &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt; but with a greater emphasis on aggressive, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/21/24079145/while-you-were-studying-the-erdtree-i-studied-the-blade"&gt;flippy-dippy martial arts moves&lt;/a&gt; rather than the slower, more thoughtful combat in &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Erdtree&lt;/em&gt;. The announcement also mentioned a constantly changing map that shrinks with each day along with abilities and gear players can use to customize their characters upon death. Taken all together, it sounds like FromSoftware put a little &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt; chocolate in the &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring &lt;/em&gt;peanut butter with a dash of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; co-op and &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; hero classes for flavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tnYsl1"&gt;FromSoftware has, so far, only confirmed Xbox, PlayStation, and PC platforms and, surprisingly, a release date. &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring Nightreign&lt;/em&gt; will launch sometime next year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s your very first look at The Witcher 4</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A screenshot from the video game The Witcher 4." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R9RLS0JLgIiPOd0DFYb6xvjKecQ=/241x0:1876x1090/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73783757/Screenshot_2024_12_12_at_8.18.04_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="COWD09"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24319637/the-game-awards-2024-trailers-annoucements"&gt;2024 edition of The Game Awards&lt;/a&gt; started with a bang — the very first look at the next &lt;em&gt;Witcher&lt;/em&gt; game. It’s called &lt;em&gt;The Witcher 4&lt;/em&gt; and was revealed via a lengthy cinematic trailer that starred Ciri in place of Geralt, who led the original trilogy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M0QV1C"&gt;There aren’t many details yet, but CD Projekt Red says that in the new game, “Ciri takes center stage as the protagonist, embarking on her own journey to become a professional monster slayer.” It will be a single-player, open-world RPG. The studio says that “the cinematic trailer is pre-rendered in a custom build of Unreal Engine 5 on an unannounced NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPU.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p7kvcz"&gt;It doesn’t sound like the trailer will necessarily be representative of the final game, however. Here’s how CD Projekt Red explains it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="PUgbk5"&gt;In the nearly six-minute trailer, viewers were introduced to Ciri, the adopted daughter of Geralt of Rivia, as she takes on a witcher contract in a remote village that has been terrorized for generations by a fearsome monster demanding human sacrifices. Framed as a short, self-contained &lt;em&gt;Witcher&lt;/em&gt; story, the trailer showcases Ciri’s new abilities and tools, including a chain and advanced magic powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="67qsq6"&gt;At the heart of the trailer is Ciri’s perspective as an outsider to the village. As the villagers say goodbye to one of their own — a young girl they are preparing for a traditional ritual sacrifice — Ciri chooses to intervene. Aiming to slay the beast and save the girl at the same time, Ciri finds herself at odds with the prejudices and superstitions of the people she tries to protect, leading her to confront a painful witcher lesson: that monsters come in all forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="HLD4h6"&gt;We’ve known for some time that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/4/23387206/cyberpunk-witcher-new-games-cd-projekt-red-cdpr-franchise-hadar-multiplayer"&gt;CD Projekt Red was working on a follow up&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/12/23505545/the-witcher-3-next-gen-update-ps5-xbox-pc-hands-on"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is meant to kick off a new saga for the fantasy franchise. In November &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/26/24306590/the-witcher-keeps-on-witching"&gt;the studio revealed&lt;/a&gt; that the game, previously codenamed “Polaris,” was in the “full-scale production phase” of development.” It’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/26/23424463/witcher-remake-cd-projekt-red-unreal-engine-5"&gt;being built using Unreal Engine 5&lt;/a&gt;, which the studio shifted to following the troubled launch of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4MGS9q"&gt;No word yet on platforms or release timing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk is mad at the SEC again</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Photo collage of Elon Musk." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8yMxC9Xy-Sq2xu9lMzwvRxVr8Y8=/20x0:2021x1334/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73783736/STK022_ELON_MUSK_CVIRGINIA_B.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration: Cath Virginia / The Verge; Photo: Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0FpFJc"&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission is preparing “numerous counts” against Elon Musk, according to a letter from his lawyer that &lt;a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1867357433493872874"&gt;Musk posted to X&lt;/a&gt;.  It has also “reopened an investigation into Neuralink.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xsfEIg"&gt;The letter is short on specifics — such as what the charges may be, and how many Musk companies are affected. Instead, Musk’s lawyer, Alex Spiro, complains that “the Commission Staff issued a settlement demand that required Mr. Musk agree within 48 hours to either accept a monetary payment or face charges on numerous accounts.” Even this is somewhat unclear; presumably, Spiro means that Musk would &lt;em&gt;pay&lt;/em&gt; a penalty rather than accept money from the SEC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="v8JDGo"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" align="center"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Oh Gary, how could you do this to me?   &lt;a href="https://t.co/OoooQI77ZS"&gt;pic.twitter.com/OoooQI77ZS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1867357433493872874?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 12, 2024&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WAK4Bw"&gt;Musk has a long and storied history with the SEC, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/14/18139544/elon-musk-60-minutes-tesla-sec-investigation-fine"&gt;he has said he does not respect.&lt;/a&gt; In 2018, Musk &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/7/17661178/tesla-elon-musk-private-420-share-considering"&gt;briefly pretended he’d take Tesla private&lt;/a&gt; before admitting two weeks later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/24/17780714/elon-musk-tesla-staying-public"&gt;Tesla would stay public&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/27/17911428/sec-lawsuit-elon-musk-tesla-funding-tweet"&gt;SEC then sued him over a tweet&lt;/a&gt; saying he had “funding secured” to take Tesla private. Musk reached a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/29/17918252/elon-musk-tesla-sec-securities-fraud-lawsuit-settlement-fine-penalty"&gt;settlement with the agency, &lt;/a&gt;paying $20 million, stepping down as chair of Tesla’s board and agreeing to a “Twitter sitter,” or a lawyer who’d supervise his tweets. Musk then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/18/18271914/sec-elon-musk-contempt-twitter-court-fraud"&gt;reneged on the Twitter sitter thing&lt;/a&gt;. That particular kerfuffle went all the way to the Supreme Court, which declined to hear the case; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/29/24144317/elon-musk-supreme-court-twitter-sitter-sec-tesla"&gt;Musk was stuck with his Twitter sitter.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="33713N"&gt;The letter characterizes this history as “more than six years of harassment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hjzm40"&gt;More recently, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-sec-intends-seek-sanctions-against-elon-musk-twitter-probe-2024-09-20/"&gt;the SEC sought to sanction Musk&lt;/a&gt; for no-showing on them in a separate investigation over his Twitter takeover. A judge declined to sanction him because he reimbursed the SEC for the &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-23/musk-ducks-sanction-for-choosing-rocket-launch-over-sec-meeting?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;airfare of the lawyers he stood up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0T5Lrf"&gt;It is unclear from Spiro’s letter whether the charges the SEC is pursuing have to do with the Twitter matter or something else. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24151881/tesla-justice-investigation-securities-wire-fraud-self-driving"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; previously reported&lt;/a&gt; that the Department of Justice was probing whether Tesla’s self-driving claims were actually securities fraud. In 2023, &lt;em&gt;Reuter&lt;/em&gt;s reported that &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-lawmakers-ask-sec-scrutinize-musk-comments-neuralink-2023-11-22/"&gt;lawmakers had asked the SEC&lt;/a&gt; to probe Neuralink over Musk’s comments about the safety of the company’s brain device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VYk8UI"&gt;Musk also asked his AI, Grok, to draw a picture of SEC chair Gary Gensler. The &lt;a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1867357990140944434"&gt;image depicted a snail&lt;/a&gt; in a business suit, seemingly a reference to Gary the Snail from &lt;em&gt;Spongebob Squarepants&lt;/em&gt;, a television show for children.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Arcade’s best exclusive game is finally on console and PC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A screenshot from the video game Fantasian." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CcgiA6-fZhfRUfNrEA_ymnufLoM=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73765123/FANTASIAN_nd_mediakit_240925__01.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Square Enix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kL1qSo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; was an easy game to recommend &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22383403/fantasian-review-apple-arcade-rpg-iphone-ipad"&gt;when it launched in 2021&lt;/a&gt;. Developed by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2021/3/2/22309074/fantasian-diorama-rpg-apple-arcade-hironobu-sakaguchi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; creator Hironobu Sakaguchi’s Mistwalker studio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; was an approachable old-school roleplaying game that had a lot of clever ideas, along with an adorable aesthetic thanks to its world made out of hand-crafted dioramas. There was just one problem: it was exclusive to Apple Arcade, so anyone who wasn’t a subscriber missed out. Now, that has finally changed as the game launches this week on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and the Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6Exoz"&gt;The new port is called &lt;em&gt;Fantasian Neo Dimension&lt;/em&gt;, but it’s mostly identical to the Apple Arcade version, aside from the very welcome addition of voice acting. (In a nice bit of circular storytelling, &lt;em&gt;Neo Dimension&lt;/em&gt; is being published by &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; maker Square Enix.) In many ways, &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; is classic &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; in all but name. It stars a hero named Leo, who — with the help of a tough princess, a mysterious magic wielder, and a grizzled ship captain — gets pulled into a quest that spans multiple realms, as they attempt to thwart a mechanical infestation led by a tall, dark, and dangerous villain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="QQuT8Y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Fantasian isn’t just charming; it’s the most approachable JRPG I’ve ever played","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22383403/fantasian-review-apple-arcade-rpg-iphone-ipad"},{"title":"Final Fantasy’s creator is back with a classic RPG made of incredible handcrafted dioramas","url":"https://www.theverge.com/games/2021/3/2/22309074/fantasian-diorama-rpg-apple-arcade-hironobu-sakaguchi"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MVedFG"&gt;There’s plenty that &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; fans will recognize: the amnesiac lead character, the playful love triangle, a world that blends fantasy and sci-fi, similar spells and items, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586744/fantasian-soundtrack-apple-music-nobuo-uematsu"&gt;a beautiful soundtrack from famed composer Nobuo Uematsu&lt;/a&gt;. Hell, there’s even &lt;a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_EU/news/final-fantasy-cid"&gt;a character named Sid&lt;/a&gt;. The basis of &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; is Sakaguchi and his team working with the framework they know but building on top of it in interesting ways. So you’re left with a rock-solid RPG that makes some nice tweaks to the formula.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="RQsyFJ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bgKMcrpvQNQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ksxsMA"&gt;The most obvious difference is the visual style, which is like a hand-crafted take on the old prerendered backgrounds from PlayStation-era &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt;. It lends the game a very tactile aesthetic, and it’s surprisingly flexible; there are warm and cozy forests and cabins but also cold mechanical areas made of metal and old circuit boards. And while the game has its origins on mobile, it still looks sharp and clear on console. I’ve been replaying it on the Switch, and the only issue has been the occasionally long load time before a battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TO1IYp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; also makes some tweaks to the turn-based RPG formula that make it both more approachable and less frustrating. The first is a fun twist on combat that lets you aim many of your attacks, which can be incredibly satisfying when you line things up &lt;em&gt;just right&lt;/em&gt; and hit a whole bunch of enemies in one shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HeDOrA"&gt;Even more useful is the awkwardly named feature Dimengeon — a portmanteau of dungeon and dimension — which takes the sting out of random battles. When you have it switched on, those pesky monsters are zapped to another dimension, where you can battle them at your leisure. The twist is that they accumulate. So when the device fills up and you have to finally fight them, you can get into a battle against a whole bunch of bad guys at once. These fights have a strategic, almost puzzle-like feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GXyW6K"&gt;Those seemingly subtle tweaks are more than enough to make &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; an easy recommendation if you’re looking for a classic RPG. Much like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24297436/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-review"&gt;the recent remake of &lt;em&gt;Dragon Quest III&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a large part of the appeal of &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; is how traditional it is, while smoothing out the rough edges that can make the genre feel clunky and tedious. And as &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; itself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24079544/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5"&gt;continues to expand&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23767669/final-fantasy-xvi-review-ps5"&gt;in different ways&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; is a comforting look back at how things used to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UwMARp"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Fantasian Neo Dimension &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;launches on December 5th on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and the Switch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft closes the door on Windows 11 supporting older hardware</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Illustration of Windows 11 running on a tablet" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QbqX6QkNkA5BiME2h1w1xxfZUqY=/0x0:1650x1100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73765108/windows11main.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xRS4YU"&gt;Microsoft has poured cold water on any hopes of lower hardware requirements for Windows 11. With Windows 10 end of support approaching in October 2025, the software giant now says that its Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 requirement for Windows 11 is “non-negotiable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y2sMN1"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/windows-itpro-blog/tpm-2-0-%e2%80%93-a-necessity-for-a-secure-and-future-proof-windows-11/4339066"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; entitled “TPM 2.0 – a necessity for a secure and future-proof Windows 11,” Microsoft makes it very clear that it won’t lower &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555371/microsoft-windows-11-cpu-support-hardware-requirements-tpm-response"&gt;Windows 11’s strict hardware requirements&lt;/a&gt; to encourage people to upgrade from Windows 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4sMCOC"&gt;TPM was a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550376/microsoft-windows-11-tpm-chips-requirement-security"&gt;surprise requirement for Windows 11&lt;/a&gt; when it was first announced in 2021, and now practically every modern PC ships with support for TPM 2.0. It’s a hardware-level chip or firmware capability that helps encrypt or decrypt data, confirm digital signatures, and assist with any other cryptographic operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6PWel1"&gt;“TPM 2.0 plays a crucial role in enhancing identity and data protection on Windows devices, as well as maintaining the integrity of your system,” says Steven Hosking, a senior product manager at Microsoft. “TPM 2.0 also helps future-proof Windows 11. One way it does so is by helping to protect sensitive information as more AI capabilities come to physical, cloud, and server architecture.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z1On3l"&gt;Microsoft details how TPM integrates with new security features in Windows 11 like Credential Guard and Windows Hello for Business, as well as BitLocker disk encryption. TPM 2.0 also helps support Secure Boot, a key technology that secures the boot process from any unauthorized changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lfTmiY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why Windows 11 is forcing everyone to use TPM chips ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550376/microsoft-windows-11-tpm-chips-requirement-security"},{"title":"Windows 11 will leave millions of PCs behind, and Microsoft is struggling to explain why ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555371/microsoft-windows-11-cpu-support-hardware-requirements-tpm-response"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3qiE8I"&gt;Hosking says Microsoft has implemented TPM 2.0 “as a non-negotiable standard for the future of Windows,” so there’s no going back on the hardware requirements here. Microsoft also requires that Windows 11 devices are capable of virtualization-based security and hypervisor-protected code integrity (HVCI), which means Windows 11 is only supported on CPUs released from 2018 onward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lfkA79"&gt;Despite the requirements, there have been several workarounds over the years to allow Windows 11 to run on unsupported hardware. Microsoft didn’t apply a hardware-compliance check initially for virtualized versions of Windows 11, but the company has been gradually locking down the upgrade and setup process in recent years — especially with the 24H2 update. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hWivz5"&gt;The improved compatibility checks with 24H2 have forced &lt;a href="https://github.com/builtbybel/Flyby11"&gt;tools like Flyby11&lt;/a&gt; to leverage a feature of the Windows 11 setup that uses a Windows Server variant of the installation to bypass the hardware compatibility checks. Businesses can also use Microsoft’s official &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot/iot-enterprise/Hardware/System_Requirements?tabs=Windows11LTSC#optional-minimum-requirements"&gt;Windows 11 LTSC 2024 release&lt;/a&gt;, which makes TPM an optional requirement but still enforces a list of compatible CPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XMtxGB"&gt;Microsoft is now trying to convince Windows 10 users to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301768/microsoft-windows-10-upgrade-prompt-copilot-plus-pcs"&gt;buy a new PC with full-screen prompts&lt;/a&gt;. The latest prompts &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/11/24127497/microsoft-windows-10-upgrade-prompt-windows-11"&gt;follow warnings&lt;/a&gt; about the Windows 10 end of support date earlier this year. Microsoft has used similar prompts like this in the past, with the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/2/10893620/microsoft-windows-10-upgrade-recommended-update"&gt;pushing Windows 10 upgrades&lt;/a&gt; for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 users.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A shocking coup attempt sent South Korea into political upheaval. But on the ground, at the protests that would prevent the President from seizing power, people were organized, angry, and a little drunk.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ubisoft shooter XDefiant is shutting down and sending refunds to players</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Promotional art for XDefiant." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OUhKq0ItS1MaD7IoCZKctQlavBQ=/120x0:930x540/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73764511/XD_PhantomSinga_GUNSAFE_Final.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Ubisoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DxY660"&gt;Despite only officially launching the game in spring of this year, Ubisoft has &lt;a href="https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/482924/864200/12050?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ubisoft.com%2Fxdefiant-our-message-to-players&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;already announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’s ending development and sunsetting its free-to-play team-based shooter &lt;em&gt;XDefiant&lt;/em&gt;. Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/27/22904775/ubisoft-hyper-scape-cancelled-battle-royale"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hyper Scape&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; before it, &lt;em&gt;XDefiant&lt;/em&gt; had high expectations, with Ubisoft touting more than 1 million players in its closed beta last year. Now, it will disappear quickly, as it’s no longer accepting new players as of today and is &lt;a href="https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/482924/864200/12050?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ubisoft.com%2Fxdefiant-our-message-to-players&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;scheduled to shut off the servers&lt;/a&gt; entirely next June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l7L1mr"&gt;Despite a delayed launch, Ubisoft said that &lt;em&gt;XDefiant &lt;/em&gt;had reached more than 10 million players in its first two weeks and “outperformed expectations thanks to acquisition and strong average revenue per session day.” However, it couldn’t maintain that momentum, and by this fall, rumors of trouble surfaced, with &lt;a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers-2/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insider Gaming&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reporting that concurrent player numbers across all platforms had fallen below 20,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="tgng49"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Concord was worse than bad — it was forgettable","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235163/concord-cancellation-live-service-games"},{"title":"Why the video game industry is such a mess","url":"https://www.theverge.com/24172733/summer-game-fest-video-game-announcements-layoffs-labor-live-service-fortnite"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T1UEgY"&gt;Ubisoft states, “The game will remain available to all players who joined &lt;em&gt;XDefiant &lt;/em&gt;before December 3rd, 2024. All functionalities, including progression, events, rewards, and achievements, will continue to be available until June 3rd, 2025.” The planned Season 3 content will still launch, and the company is refunding anyone who bought the Ultimate Founders Pack, as well as players who bought VC and DLC in the last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5XtIT0"&gt;Like with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/3/24234909/sony-concord-ps5-shutdown-poor-sales-launch-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Concord&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; developer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282900/sony-shutting-down-concord-firewalk-studios"&gt;Firewalk Studios&lt;/a&gt;, this shutdown comes with job losses. According to Ubisoft, “difficult consequences” are leading to “the closing of our San Francisco and Osaka production studios and to the ramp down of our Sydney production site, with 143 people departing in San Francisco and 134 people likely to depart in Osaka and Sydney.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Walmart bought Vizio</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An image showing a Vizio TV in a living room" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z_L9zsHyZxxBVffPLnEWatbkDM8=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73764456/vizio_tv_on_wall.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Vizio&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Gz2t5q"&gt;After announcing plans to acquire Vizio in February, Walmart officially owns the company after the &lt;a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/news/2024/12/03/walmart-completes-acquisition-of-vizio"&gt;$2.3 billion transaction closed&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday. The retail giant says the acquisition will help bolster its advertising business, as Platform Plus — the TV-maker’s advertising and data division — “accounts for all the company’s [Vizio's] gross profit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J4vSNk"&gt;All that data will be a boon for &lt;a href="https://www.marketingdive.com/news/walmart-q2-2024-earnings-retail-media-networks/724470/"&gt;Walmart’s growing advertising business&lt;/a&gt;, which has already started leveraging &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24152172/walmart-disney-plus-hulu-targeted-ads"&gt;shopper information to target ads&lt;/a&gt; on Disney Plus and Hulu. The move will likely open up more opportunities for Walmart to sell more ads on Vizio TVs in stores, something it &lt;a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/news/2024/04/01/how-walmart-connect-is-putting-walmarts-purpose-in-motion"&gt;talked about expanding&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, and maybe even stick ads on the Vizio TVs in people’s living rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="foh47Q"&gt;The deal has raised concerns &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/4/24087963/privacy-and-competition-advocates-urge-ftc-doj-to-investigate-walmarts-2-3-billion-vizio-acquisition"&gt;among privacy advocates&lt;/a&gt;, as Vizio has gotten in trouble over advertising and data tracking in the past. In 2017, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/6/14522582/vizio-ftc-lawsuit-tv-viewing-habits-tracking-privacy"&gt;paid a $2.2 million fine&lt;/a&gt; to settle a Federal Trade Commission lawsuit that accused it of tracking viewers without their consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R3Skmf"&gt;An acquisition by Walmart could help Vizio compete with other budget-friendly TV brands that rely on advertising as a significant source of revenue. Roku, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/4/23537503/roku-select-plus-tvs-features-price"&gt;started selling its own TVs last year&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.thewrap.com/roku-earnings-q3-2024/"&gt;made $908.2 million in advertising sales&lt;/a&gt; and subscriptions in the third quarter of 2024, with an average revenue per user of $41.10, while Vizio’s last earnings report showed it was making about $37.17 per user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O5YzYa"&gt;There’s also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/1/23984444/amazon-fire-tv-autoplay-ads-on-startup"&gt;Amazon’s ad-frien&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.lowpass.cc/p/amazon-fire-tv-advertising-business"&gt;dly Fire TVs&lt;/a&gt;, Telly — the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/15/23721674/telly-free-tv-streaming-ilya-pozin-ads"&gt;that promises free TVs in exchange&lt;/a&gt; for showing persistent advertisements, and an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301519/sonos-trade-desk-venture-tv-operating-system"&gt;incoming platform from advertising firm The Trade Desk&lt;/a&gt; that Sonos will use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9nbjWm"&gt;Despite the acquisition, Walmart and Vizio will continue operating independently “for the foreseeable future.” Vizio CEO William Wang will also remain in his position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nGxmyX"&gt;“VIZIO has also expertly changed their business over time, like building and quickly scaling a profitable advertising business,” Seth Dallaire, the executive vice president and chief growth officer of Walmart US, said in the announcement. “Pairing it with Walmart Connect will be impactful and allow us to invest in our business even further on behalf of our customers.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Two data brokers banned from selling  ‘sensitive’ location data by the FTC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Illustration of location placket dropped on a map." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gEUZ0tmJ_4Dan7N2azU3uwg8z9I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73764313/STK476_LOCATION_DATA_CVIRGINIA_C.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Cath Virginia / The Verge, Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xtDeoP"&gt;The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/12/ftc-takes-action-against-gravy-analytics-venntel-unlawfully-selling-location-data-tracking-consumers"&gt;banning data brokers Gravy Analytics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/12/ftc-takes-action-against-mobilewalla-collecting-selling-sensitive-location-data"&gt;Mobilewalla&lt;/a&gt; from collecting, using, and selling “sensitive” location data of Americans, the agency announced on Tuesday. The FTC targeted Gravy Analytics, its subsidiary Venntel, and Mobilewalla for allegedly violating the FTC Act by collecting and selling information that could be used to track people to healthcare facilities, military bases, religious sites, labor union gatherings, and other sensitive locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y577vK"&gt;The FTC says (&lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/2023196mobilewallacomplaint.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) Mobilewalla “relied primarily on consumer information that Mobilewalla collected from real-time bidding exchanges” by bidding to show people personalized ads on their mobile devices and then retaining tracking info identifying them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rtS7bj"&gt;It also bought info from other sources and used additional data to build out the profiles attached to each advertising ID. Combining that data, according to the complaint, allowed Mobilewalla to create audience segments targeting pregnant women, as well as provide analysis of people who attended protests over the death of George Floyd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="YZJUxD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Brokered cell location data led to the outing and resignation of a Catholic official","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22586161/cell-phone-location-data-grindr-catholic-church-report-data-brokers"},{"title":"Feds are tracking phone locations with data bought from brokers","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/18/23268592/feds-buying-location-data-brokers-aclu-foia-dhs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5UkFqZ"&gt;Meanwhile, Venntel’s scheme is explained (&lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/2123035gravyanalyticscomplaint.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) as collecting location data from otherwise ordinary mobile apps, and then selling access to the data to other businesses or government agencies. &lt;a href="https://www.404media.co/ftc-bans-location-data-company-that-powers-the-surveillance-ecosystem/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;404 Media&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports that the IRS, DEA, FBI, CBP, and ICE have all purchased Venntel data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aD9LcT"&gt;Now, the companies must comply by never “selling, disclosing, or using sensitive location data in any product or service, and must establish a sensitive data location program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7vkNuM"&gt;Mobilewalla’s proposed settlement order will prohibit the company from:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="LjEFdx"&gt;Misrepresenting how it collects, maintains, uses, deletes or discloses consumers’ personal information, and the extent to which consumers’ location data is deidentified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vmnysc"&gt;Using, transferring, selling and disclosing sensitive location data from health clinics, religious organizations, correctional facilities, labor union offices, LGBTQ+-related locations, political gatherings and military installations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="mjyZp2"&gt;Senator Ron Wyden from Oregon, who led efforts to target a loophole data brokers used to sell sensitive personal data on the market, applauded the FTC and CFPB for limiting what the companies can collect. In a statement sent to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Wyden said these companies could sell information about “law enforcement, judges and members of the armed forces is on the open market” to “anyone with a credit card,” putting citizens and military personnel in danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tbJBSw"&gt;Wyden also said US government agencies spied on Americans by obtaining this data without a warrant. “Many federal agencies hid behind the flimsy claim that Americans consented to the sale of their data, but the FTC’s orders make it clear how untrue these claims were,” said Wyden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UM1DWl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft accuses FTC of leaking news of its antitrust investigation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Illustration of the Microsoft wordmark on a green background" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/39-JPW4R70n1zud44cum1h9MDP4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73764055/STK095_Microsoft_03.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration: The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pwKMvS"&gt;Microsoft is asking the inspector general at the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether agency management improperly leaked news of its antitrust investigation into the company, and make their findings public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XLpXks"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-27/us-antitrust-watchdog-launches-broad-microsoft-investigation"&gt;first reported&lt;/a&gt; that the probe was underway last week, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/27/24307790/microsoft-is-being-investigated-by-the-ftc-over-antitrust-concerns"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; later confirmed&lt;/a&gt;. The investigation covers Microsoft’s cloud and software licensing businesses, AI, and cybersecurity offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D9bpJQ"&gt;Now, Microsoft’s corporate vice president and deputy general counsel Rima Alaily is accusing FTC management of leaking details of the probe, in violation of the agency’s &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/UD-ieo-for-new-ftc-employees.pdf"&gt;own ethics guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. The agency instructs new employees that “the existence of an FTC investigation is nonpublic information,” though it may be disclosed after the Office of Public Affairs determines the target of a probe already made it public in a press release or government filing. Still, the guidelines add that the Commission has authority to make “appropriate disclosures” when “it determines that doing so would be in the public interest.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FAlamv"&gt;Alaily writes that the information and sourcing in the &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; story “strongly suggests” the details came from “within the FTC.” She says that the story “appears to be consistent with an unfortunate trend over the last two years of the FTC strategically leaking nonpublic information,” citing &lt;a href="https://oig.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/reports/2024-11/2024-09-30the-FY-2024-TMC.pdf"&gt;a September report&lt;/a&gt; from the FTC IG that found a “steadily increasing” volume of “unauthorized disclosures” of nonpublic information to the press. The FTC declined to comment on the Microsoft letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sbBJcc"&gt;Microsoft claims it learned about the FTC’s information demand “like the rest of the world, through the Bloomberg story.” Even when it inquired with FTC staff about the validity of the story, Alaily says, they wouldn’t confirm the information demand existed, and she adds that Microsoft still hasn’t seen the information demand reported by the press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bmiwLA"&gt;The letter is the latest example of a more aggressive approach Microsoft has taken in recent months when it comes to antitrust scrutiny of its business. In October, Alaily accused Google in a &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2024/10/28/googles-shadow-campaigns/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/28/24281926/microsoft-google-cloud-lobbying-european-commission-regulators"&gt;launching an astroturf group&lt;/a&gt; “to discredit Microsoft with competition authorities, and policymakers and mislead the public.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VUXcrG"&gt;Microsoft has mostly flown under the radar in past years as a target of antitrust lawsuits while its Big Tech peers were hit with complaints from US regulators. But it’s increasingly faced scrutiny in both the US and in Europe amid major cybersecurity issues, its acquisition of game studio Activision Blizzard, and its partnership with OpenAI. Still, the fate of any existing investigation will ultimately depend on how officials in the incoming Trump administration view the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What happened to Intel?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z1XlV2n7d93dWThBFbSL9FjOpRM=/374x0:2714x1560/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73763981/Intel_Innovation_Day1_Keynote_15.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger holds up an early Intel 18A wafer in late 2023.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Intel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CqWL8E"&gt;On Monday, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger abruptly decided to retire after less than four years on the job. That was the &lt;em&gt;official&lt;/em&gt; story, anyhow. Within hours, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger-retire-2024-12-02/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-02/intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger-retires-amid-chipmaker-s-turnaround-plan"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/technology/intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger.html"&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; had a different one: the board of directors pushed him out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8OVAOL"&gt;Three and a half years ago, Gelsinger announced an ambitious plan to turn around the troubled chipmaker within four years — now, he’s reportedly been kicked out of the company before he could see it through. It happened so abruptly that Intel doesn’t have a planned successor in mind, and so completely that Gelsinger won’t even stick around as an adviser. He’s gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OMqDqd"&gt;Intel has been in a tailspin for years. It missed the smartphone revolution, has been plagued by quality control issues with its chips, lost customers like Apple to alternative processors, and now is at risk of missing out on AI, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Wp05EO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This isn’t just about stock price and golden parachutes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8PMtut"&gt;If Intel is falling apart, this isn’t just a business story. The United States government has called it a national security story, too. Intel isn’t just the world’s former leading maker of computer chips; it’s one of the last companies to both design and manufacture them itself...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24311594/intel-under-pat-gelsinger"&gt;Read the full story at The Verge.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon announces its own set of Nova AI models</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Illustration of the Amazon logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/10PBVjVjTZ7Ok-Ka7i8gSgFSN-U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73763973/acastro_STK103__02.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WUqwjv"&gt;Amazon has announced a series of new AI foundation models under a new “Nova” branding that will be available as part of the Amazon Bedrock model library in AWS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8fdLEx"&gt;There are three “understanding” models available now, &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-amazon-nova-frontier-intelligence-and-industry-leading-price-performance/"&gt;Amazon says in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="8WwQlp"&gt;Amazon Nova Micro, a text model that’s “optimized for speed and cost.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pXK4xv"&gt;Amazon Nova Lite, a “very low-cost” multimodal model that can take in images, video, and text to generate text.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dA3jGa"&gt;Amazon Nova Pro, a “highly capable” multimodal model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="0geArR"&gt;The company is also training a model called Amazon Nova Premier, which it says will be “our most capable multimodal model for complex reasoning tasks.” Amazon aims to make Nova Premier available in “early 2025.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iJXn71"&gt;Amazon is releasing content generation models, too: Amazon Nova Canvas, an image generation model, and Amazon Nova Reel, a video generation model. The company says that these models have “watermarking capabilities” to “promote responsible AI use.” As an example of what’s possible with Nova Reel, Amazon has shared &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g87NaWcszq0"&gt;this mock ad for a fake pasta brand&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aA8OKF"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g87NaWcszq0?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ni12ix"&gt;Later in 2025, Amazon plans to release a speech-to-speech model and “a native multimodal-to-multimodal” model, &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/amazon-nova-artificial-intelligence-bedrock-aws"&gt;according to a blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JEcA5p"&gt;Amazon announced these new models at its AWS re:Invent conference, which is happening now in Las Vegas. At the show, the company also said that it’s building a huge AI compute cluster that relies on its Trainium 2 chips in partnership with Anthropic (which it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/22/24303185/amazon-anthropic-investment-ai-alexa"&gt;has invested $8 billion in&lt;/a&gt;). “When completed, it is expected to be the world’s largest AI compute cluster reported to date available for Anthropic to build and deploy its future models on,” &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/aws-reinvent-2024-keynote-live-news-updates?p=aws-trainium2-instances-now-generally-available"&gt;according to Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="gifUtN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon scrambles for its place in the AI race","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/29/24116056/amazon-ai-race-anthropic-olympus-claude"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ec5SoT"&gt;The company, like many other big tech players, is racing to release new AI products and features to stay ahead of newer companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-sales-chief-sees-paradigm-shift-in-corporate-ai-spending?rc=v4bmzs"&gt;OpenAI&lt;/a&gt;. Where Amazon could have an advantage is how much internet infrastructure is already powered by AWS — large enterprises may be more willing to use Amazon’s AI offerings because the company has already a trusted reputation. An Apple exec even &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2024%2F12%2F03%2Fapple-says-it-uses-amazons-custom-ai-chips-.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F12%2F3%2F24312260%2Famazon-nova-foundation-ai-models-anthropic" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;appeared onstage today at re:Invent&lt;/a&gt; to talk about how the company relies on Amazon’s custom AI chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R3KR8x"&gt;Amazon is also working on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/20/23880764/amazon-ai-alexa-generative-llm-smart-home"&gt;a revamped, AI-powered Alexa&lt;/a&gt;, but while voice assistant was reportedly set to launch this fall, the launch has apparently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24284772/amazon-new-alexa-llm-voice-assistant-delayed-2025"&gt;slipped into next year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Eve’s new app unlocks more smart features for Android users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aRgw_eqE3B22HTMxt-IfDCa7c-c=/25x0:840x543/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73763944/eve.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eve’s Android app has finally arrived, but it only supports the Eve Thermo at launch.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Eve Systems&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2ut8np"&gt;Eve Systems has finally launched its first Android app — over two years after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/1/23331803/eve-homekit-android-app-smart-light-switch-matter"&gt;announcing it was working on one&lt;/a&gt;. This week, the once Apple-only smart home device maker launched the &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.evehome.eve"&gt;Eve for Matter app&lt;/a&gt; on the Google Play Store. The app will allow Android users to access the custom features of Eve’s devices that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23568091/matter-compatible-devices-accessories-apple-amazon-google-samsung#:~:text=Feature%20support%20for,is%20still%20spotty."&gt;Matter doesn't support&lt;/a&gt;, something previously only accessible to iOS users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m06jYb"&gt;However, at launch, the new app will &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; work with Google Home and &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; with one Eve device, the new &lt;a href="https://www.evehome.com/en-us/eve-thermo"&gt;Eve Thermo&lt;/a&gt; (79.99 Euros) — a Matter-over-Thread smart radiator valve designed for European homes. While the earlier version of the Eve Thermo can be upgraded to support Matter and Thread, the new version has them pre-installed.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The newest version of Eve’s smart radiator valve — the Eve Thermo — comes with Matter-over-Thread on board.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5f5QGm"&gt;“The plan is to continuously expand support for other Eve devices and platforms and turn the app into a comprehensive tool,” Lars Felber, director of PR at Eve Systems, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Nevertheless, we wanted to make the app available to our Eve Thermo customers with Android and Google Home as early as possible in the heating season, hence the initial exclusive release for this hardware,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XITB0J"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"All the&amp;amp;nbsp;smart home&amp;amp;nbsp;news, reviews, and gadgets you need to know","url":"https://www.theverge.com/24190824/smart-home-news-reviews-guides-gadgets"},{"title":"Google opens up its smart home to everyone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/15/24157154/google-home-api-matter-smart-home-chromecast-google-tv"},{"title":"Smart home&amp;amp;nbsp;company Eve plans to use Matter to move beyond Apple’s&amp;amp;nbsp;HomeKit ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22827727/eve-matter-thread-upgrade-smart-shades-release-date"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="b2AoRS"&gt;There hasn’t been an Android app for Eve products before because the &lt;a href="https://www.evehome.com/en/privacy"&gt;company’s commitment to privacy&lt;/a&gt;, along with eschewing cloud-to-cloud connections or requiring users to sign up for an account, meant it focused all its development efforts on Apple Home. However, the advent of &lt;a href="https://www.evehome.com/en/matter"&gt;the Matter smart home standard&lt;/a&gt; and its option for local control has allowed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22827727/eve-matter-thread-upgrade-smart-shades-release-date"&gt;company to branch out&lt;/a&gt; and work with the other platforms while maintaining its core values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GNW3G9"&gt;The new Eve app lets you add the Eve Thermo to Google Home through Matter and control it on that platform, as well as share it with any other Matter-compatible platform. But it also simultaneously adds it to the Eve app, where you can access additional features, such as creating and managing autonomous on-device schedules. Without the Eve app, you only get basic controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="isq2cp"&gt;Currently, Android users can add any of Eve’s other Matter devices — such as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23899810/best-smart-plugs#:~:text=Eve%20Energy%20Smart%20Plug%20(Matter)"&gt;Eve Energy smart plug&lt;/a&gt; and Eve Motion blinds — to compatible platforms, including Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Samsung SmartThings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qyqcPL"&gt;But, until Eve adds support for more devices, Android users will be limited to those devices' capabilities in Matter. In contrast, Apple Home users can access all of Eve’s innovative features, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23899810/best-smart-plugs#:~:text=The%20Eve%20app%20gives,in%20the%20Eve%20app."&gt;in-depth energy data&lt;/a&gt; for smart plugs and &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/meeteve_adaptive-shading-activity-7176243207276531712-h_jI/"&gt;adaptive shading&lt;/a&gt; for smart shades, through the &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/eve-for-matter-homekit/id917695792"&gt;Eve for Matter &amp;amp; HomeKit iOS app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xR1vpT"&gt;The Android app only works with Google Home as it was built on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/15/24157154/google-home-api-matter-smart-home-chromecast-google-tv"&gt;Google Home APIs&lt;/a&gt; released earlier this year. Eve CEO Jerome Gackel said that these enabled the company to “turbo-charge the development of Eve for Android.” Felber said support for additional platforms, including Amazon Alexa and Samsung SmartThings, is coming in future versions.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android 15’s first major update has arrived</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Android logo on a green and blue background" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2Legkf8E1XontiCji1_Yix-7-0o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73768580/acastro_STK112_android_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;More features are coming to Android and Pixel phones starting today.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Xrtmol"&gt;New features are on the way for Android phones and Pixel devices thanks to &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/android/new-android-features-december-2024"&gt;Android 15’s first quarterly platform update&lt;/a&gt;. New features for all eligible Android phones include more descriptive video captions, a Gemini-powered update to the Lookout app, and a Spotify extension for Gemini. Pixel owners are getting a few additional updates, including deeper integration of the Pixel Screenshots app for Pixel 9 phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2hfUWB"&gt;The enhanced captions — or Expressive Captions as Google calls them — add descriptive phrases to try and capture non-spoken moments in dialogue; think [gasp] or [applause]. They’ll appear throughout the system wherever you can access video captions, including social media apps and video messages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot of descriptive captions feature" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qd80hCW53qVc8QxoBCevoqPkKVE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25775079/captions.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Descriptive Captions will capture more of what’s going on in the audio track.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3FVg6t"&gt;Another accessibility-minded update targets Lookout, an app that provides audio descriptions of photos and objects for people with low vision or blindness. Google is bringing its Gemini 1.5 model to the Image Q&amp;amp;A portion of the app to offer better descriptions of photos taken or opened with the app. It’s a continuation of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/16/24158453/google-accessibility-features-android-low-vision"&gt;an effort Google highlighted at I/O&lt;/a&gt; to bring more AI features to Lookout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LKNzbZ"&gt;On the AI front, Google is adding more extensions to Gemini Assistant. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/26/24306815/google-gemini-spotify-extension-rollout-android"&gt;The Spotify extension&lt;/a&gt; allows you to play music from Spotify through Gemini. When Gemini Assistant debuted, it was missing basic features like this one — capabilities that the non-AI Assistant has been offering for the better part of a decade. This is one more step toward feature parity between Gemini and the standard Google Assistant. Gemini will also get access to &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/15235441?hl=en"&gt;the Utilities extension&lt;/a&gt; that’s been rolling out, allowing it to take more actions on your behalf, like making phone calls, sending emails, and changing phone settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OxNrpX"&gt;Other highlights of this update include the ability to create stickers with Emoji Kitchen inside Gboard, share photos with a QR code in Quick Share, and an improved scanning mode for receipts and the like in Google Drive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dFldjd"&gt;Pixel phones get a little more with the December feature drop, with several new features specifically for the Pixel 9 series. The call screening feature gets a potentially useful update with contextual reply suggestions. As the caller speaks to the assistant, you can tap on a response to answer questions without picking up the call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshots app on Pixel 9" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OQLhNv0S5UwTwjNJfPlQX3v060E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25775087/screenshots.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gboard will offer some suggested phrases based on things you add to Screenshots.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="76t0fK"&gt;The Pixel 9’s Screenshots app also gets a few updates. Now, when you use Circle to Search you’ll have an option to save that search in the Screenshots app, which feels like a logical place to keep tabs on your previous queries. You can also turn on a new feature to show suggested search phrases in Gboard based on things you save to Screenshots. And if you’ve added tickets or credit cards to Google Wallet with a screenshot, you’ll be able to save those in the Screenshots app, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eXgut3"&gt;There are a handful of other features in the feature drop for previous-gen Pixel phones, including Identity Check, which will require additional authentication if the phone detects it’s in a new location and sensitive settings are being accessed. It all starts rolling out today for phones on Android 15 and Pixel 6 and newer phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9LU2oj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft and Google are fighting over the future of Xbox</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vector collage of the Xbox logo." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n10Op4p-aGg2XFbVwwkO8LOFkQY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73768539/STK048_XBOX2__C.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dxFGqU"&gt;In October, it became very clear that Microsoft and Google were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24284543/microsoft-google-cloud-war-notepad"&gt;at war again&lt;/a&gt;. After a six-year truce on legal battles ended in 2021, Google has, in recent months, been voicing its concerns about Microsoft’s cloud business. That particular dispute is at the “lobbying regulators” stage, but another disagreement between the two tech giants has slipped into the courts and the public sphere and could sway the very future of Xbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h8KAUP"&gt;Microsoft revealed last week that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/27/24307867/microsoft-google-xbox-game-store-android-purchase-games"&gt;built a new Xbox game store for Android but has been unable to launch it&lt;/a&gt;. The store relies on a key court ruling that would force sweeping changes to Google’s Play Store, opening it up to competition and ending the requirement for apps to use Google Play Billing. Microsoft has been desperate for regulators to act and pave the way for its ambitious Xbox mobile efforts. But after the court ruling offered a brief moment of hope, Google won a temporary administrative stay blocking the changes from coming into effect in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AlKdpl"&gt;Microsoft had planned to sell games directly in its Xbox app for Android and allow customers to immediately stream those games directly to their phones and tablets. These two features combined aren’t...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s Copilot can browse the web with you using AI ‘Vision’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vector collage of the Microsoft Copilot logo." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bTtm54Ei0elUhZuI2ng4F758rV8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73768532/STK259_MICROSOFT_COPILOT__C.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qeChdU"&gt;Microsoft is starting to test its new Copilot Vision feature today. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24259187/microsoft-copilot-redesign-vision-voice-features-inflection-ai"&gt;Originally unveiled in October&lt;/a&gt;, Copilot Vision allows Microsoft’s AI companion to see what you see on an Edge webpage you’re browsing. You can then ask it questions about the text, images, and content you’re viewing or use it to assist you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yVapvz"&gt;“When you choose to enable Copilot Vision, it sees the page you’re on, it reads along with you, and you can talk through the problem you’re facing together,” says the Copilot team &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmicrosoft-copilot%2Fblog%2F%3Fp%3D3831%26preview%3Dtrue%26_thumbnail_id%3D3834" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “Browsing no longer needs to be a lonely experience with just you and all your tabs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BZZ3uM"&gt;It’s an entirely optional experience, and you have to explicitly grant permission for Copilot Vision to be able to read webpages in Microsoft’s Edge browser. Microsoft originally demonstrated the feature in October by showing how its AI assistant could read images from a collection on OneDrive on the web and even decipher hand-written recipes and offer up cooking tips. You could also use this feature while you’re shopping on the web to find product recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eXDukD"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vSOp4uhgSjw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9D05cN"&gt;Copilot Vision is in limited testing right now, available only to Copilot Pro subscribers through Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmicrosoft-copilot%2Ffor-individuals%2Fcopilot-labs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Copilot Labs program&lt;/a&gt;. It’s clear Microsoft is taking its time on this particular feature as it allows AI models to start reading things you’re seeing onscreen in a web browser, which will naturally generate privacy concerns. I’m sure the security concerns around the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/27/24255721/microsoft-windows-recall-ai-security-improvements-overhaul-uninstall"&gt;Recall feature&lt;/a&gt;, which finally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/22/24302947/microsoft-recall-windows-insider-testing-dev-channel-click-to-do"&gt;entered testing last month&lt;/a&gt;, played a big part in Microsoft treading carefully here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lLcbos"&gt;“As we roll this out, Vision will only interact with a select set of websites to start,” says the Copilot team. “Over time, we will cautiously expand this list. It’s important to stress that Vision does not capture, store or use any data from publishers to train our models. In short, we’re prioritizing copyright, creators, and our user’s privacy and safety — and are putting them all first.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="18pBTP"&gt;A limited number of Copilot Pro subscribers will be able to get access to Copilot Vision today in the US as Microsoft works to listen to feedback and iterate on Copilot Vision. It plans to expand access to more Pro subscribers and websites “over time.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PlayStation kicks off esports tournament series with live event in London</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z1BA7XIS05yVoHuCP6ZfmFczoGs=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73768528/ss_853e5ffd8d75e9b5aa171e0b332d026866e1b5af.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tekken 8 will be one of the games people can compete in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="x6fASv"&gt;Sony is building on its PlayStation esports efforts with a new series of live tournament events called PlayStation Tournaments: XP. The first event will take place on January 18th, 2025 in London and feature &lt;em&gt;Tekken 8&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;EA Sports FC 25&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Astro Bot&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X2HFfn"&gt;“Qualifying players from across the globe and the competitive gaming community on PS5 will represent teams Triangle, Circle, Cross, and Square to earn points during the competition and vie for the title of champion, in addition to winning exclusive prizes,” &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/12/05/announcing-playstation-tournaments-xp-a-new-live-studio-event-and-competition-open-to-the-global-ps5-community/"&gt;Sony says in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4Xtfp"&gt;Open qualifiers for &lt;em&gt;Tekken 8&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;EA Sports FC 25&lt;/em&gt; begin today, while qualifiers for &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; start on December 6th and for &lt;em&gt;Astro Bot&lt;/em&gt; on December 13th.

    <title>NZXT responded to the Flex PC rental program controversy, but it’s not over yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Screenshot of Flex: One Subscription PC page takn on December 5th showing the specs of a $59 per month rental PC." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l0Xf0IhM5pQxh0Fnn21bJfFmtIc=/44x0:1441x931/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73768498/flex_subscription.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Screenshot: NZXT.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ycIyUQ"&gt;After &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pomC1CfpC0"&gt;a long video published over the weekend by Gamers Nexus&lt;/a&gt; called NZXT’s Flex PC rental program &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/1/24310181/nzxt-pc-rental-program-gamers-nexus-investigation"&gt;“a scam,”&lt;/a&gt; the company responded Tuesday with a statement titled &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnzxt.com%2Fnews%2Fnzxt-update-addressing-your-concerns-about-the-flex-subscription-program&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F12%2F5%2F24313974%2Fnzxt-flex-pc-rental-response" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;“Addressing Your Concerns About the Flex Subscription Program.”&lt;/a&gt; “I want to acknowledge that we messed up,” said NZXT CEO Johnny Hou &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSp5B--HKL4"&gt;in a video&lt;/a&gt;, promising changes like making the names of PCs available for rent or purchase easier to tell apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZpa5W"&gt;However, what it said has not satisfied Gamers Nexus, which &lt;a href="https://x.com/GamersNexus/status/1864657751986626988?"&gt;posted its own response&lt;/a&gt;, saying NZXT’s statement “not only misrepresents facts, but distorts the reality of their predatory rental computer program. The statement ignores major points and introduces several new concerns.” The post says GN is working on a new investigation into the program that “will take weeks or months to finalize.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HDlHbE"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FSp5B--HKL4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ySxPgA"&gt;The two main actions NZXT says it’s taking are on the PC names, like switching the name of its “Player: One” rental PC to “Flex: One Subscription PC,” and influencer campaigns “where the statements did not accurately reflect the details of our NZXT Flex program.” NZXT says it has pulled all of its “influencer-led” advertising while it updates the language and process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AlyB5d"&gt;NZXT says it is adjusting the language in its subscriber agreement as well and will make it clear that the company doesn’t sell user data on customers’ returned PCs. “Every Flex PC that comes back is fully wiped,” Hou said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Amnhrg"&gt;Hou also addressed the rental PC specs that Gamers Nexus said fluctuated “day-to-day,” noting that the Flex program “doesn’t give you fixed specs” due to the changing availability of components. “Sometimes we don’t have more supply coming in, so in the midst of that we actually have to change the specs of our PCs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UIamHz"&gt;However, this still doesn’t explain why NZXT displayed the same estimated frames per second across builds with different components.&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has contacted NZXT about the program, but the company has not responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TI3m5v"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" align="center"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;NZXT has posted a statement which not only misrepresents facts, but distorts the reality of their predatory rental computer program. The statement ignores major points and introduces several new concerns. GamersNexus has become aware of deeper elements connected to this story…&lt;/p&gt;— GamersNexus (@GamersNexus) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GamersNexus/status/1864657751986626988?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 5, 2024&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>EA adds more tech patents to its accessibility program</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bGi8lAE7zREBlY2yBxK0dlx7tTs=/114x0:1341x818/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73768427/m24_firstlookscreens_fredwarner_scooptackle.png.adapt.crop16x9.818p.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;EA is also releasing a UE5 plugin for it’s Iris photosensitivity tech, which features on games like Madden NFL 24 (Pictured).&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Electronic Arts&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="02t1SH"&gt;Electronic Arts is expanding its accessibility program with 23 additional tech patents that other companies and developers can freely use without being slapped with an infringement lawsuit. The expansion more than doubles the total number of patents that EA has opened up since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22638535/ea-accessibility-patent-pledge-apex-legends-ping-system"&gt;launching the pledge in 2021&lt;/a&gt;, and includes generation and recognition tools for speech and audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gi0m8E"&gt;“We believe that games should be accessible to everyone and our industry-leading teams are always looking for new ways to make this a reality,” Kerry Hopkins, SVP of Global Affairs at EA, said in a press release. “By making this technology available to others, we continue to work to enhance accessibility and inclusivity for players around the world by removing unintended barriers to access.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5CF3oB"&gt;Some examples of open tech patents include systems that can improve speech recognition, generate expressive speech audio from text data, and generate speech that mimics a player’s voice based on minimal sample speech data. One system uses machine learning to make a player’s voice sound older, while another “infers a player’s emotion while playing a video game” and automatically adjusts the game’s background music to best suit their emotional state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="371Zap"&gt;EA says these patents could be used to improve gaming experiences for players with speech disorders or who struggle with verbally expressing themselves, helping them to communicate in a way that better represents their age, emotion, language, and speaking style. Alongside this announcement, EA is also releasing a &lt;a href="https://github.com/electronicarts/IRIS-Unreal-Plugin/"&gt;Unreal Engine 5 plugin that enables in-engine use of IRIS&lt;/a&gt; — EA’s photosensitivity analysis tech — to help game developers identify frames that could impact photosensitive players.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Master &amp; Dynamic revived a pair of wired earphones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A close-up of Master &amp;amp;amp; Dynamic’s updated ME05 wired earphones on a white table." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hdgfAcnx1KhAHClSQQRUS6vQU7Q=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73768411/masterdynamic1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Master &amp;amp; Dynamic is bringing back a pair of wired earbuds it first introduced in 2015.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Master &amp;amp; Dynamic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ADJA8M"&gt;Master &amp;amp; Dynamic has announced an updated version of its ME05 wired earphones. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.masterdynamic.com%2Fblogs%2Fnews-culture%2Fnew-me05-earphones-turn-solid-brass-into-spectacular-sound&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F12%2F5%2F24314000%2Fmaster-dynamic-headphones-wired-earphones-me05" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;First introduced in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, the ME05 were eventually &lt;a href="https://www.soundguys.com/master-dynamic-me05-review-7387/"&gt;discontinued in early 2022&lt;/a&gt; but the company is reintroducing them with familiar design elements including “precision-machined brass acoustic enclosures” while updating other components to improve their performance. Like the originals, the new ME05 are $199 and are &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.masterdynamic.com%2Fproducts%2Fme05&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F12%2F5%2F24314000%2Fmaster-dynamic-headphones-wired-earphones-me05" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available now through Master &amp;amp; Dynamic’s website&lt;/a&gt;, and coming to Amazon “this winter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FoBNxC"&gt;Upgrades made to the new version of the ME05 include “custom high-excursion 8mm bio-cellulose drivers” and a better microphone with “with proprietary wind reduction” to improve the quality of your voice during calls, even while outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Master &amp;amp;amp; Dynamic ME05 earphones laid out with their USB-C adapter." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Eged9dLKUGko3JZHQsf5tbiVcr4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25774984/masterdynamic3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Master &amp;amp; Dynamic&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An included USB-C to 3.5mm adapter serves as a digital to audio converter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kmdohl"&gt;The new ME05 also offer improved compatibility, says Master &amp;amp; Dynamic, with the inclusion of a 3.5mm to USB-C adapter featuring a built-in digital to analog converter that supports hi-res audio up to 32-bit/384kHz resolutions. For comparison, &lt;a href="https://support.tidal.com/hc/en-us/articles/17412130162961-HiRes-FLAC-audio"&gt;Tidal’s hi-res streaming audio&lt;/a&gt; maxes out at 24-bit / 192 kHz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A close-up of the Master &amp;amp;amp; Dynamic ME05’s four different colorways." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XZhD7swKW6KVLMfmMz6ukBxqbBE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25774986/masterdynamic2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Master &amp;amp; Dynamic&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new version of the ME05 come in four different color options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6LeMdr"&gt;The earphones come with foam ear tips in two sizes and silicone tips in five different sizes, and are available in four color options including gold and black, gunmetal and black, palladium and black, and palladium and white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eX7UWD"&gt;Although Master &amp;amp; Dynamic has focused on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22900752/master-dynamic-mg20-review-gaming-headset-specs-performance"&gt;premium wireless headphone&lt;/a&gt; offerings in recent years (amongst other headphone makers), wired headphones, including Apple’s iconic tethered EarPods, still &lt;a href="https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/wired-headphones-earbuds-trend/"&gt;remain popular&lt;/a&gt;. But while &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MYQY3AM/A/earpods-usb-c"&gt;Apple still sells wired earphones&lt;/a&gt; for $19, Master &amp;amp; Dynamic’s revived ME05 are priced more in line with wired offerings from companies like &lt;a href="https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/earphones"&gt;Shure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sennheiser-hearing.com%2Fen-US%2Fp%2Fie-200%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F12%2F5%2F24314000%2Fmaster-dynamic-headphones-wired-earphones-me05" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sennheiser&lt;/a&gt; that are targeted at audiophiles or musicians.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Waymo’s next robotaxi city will be Miami </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Photo illustration of an autonomous vehicle." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/87rG8g2Ds5y3Xj41Q8tbZwkunxM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73768273/STK418_Autonomous_Vehicles_Cvirginia_A.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Cath Virginia / The Verge | Photo from Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wnZdOg"&gt;Waymo is making the moves on Magic City. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iCmjze"&gt;Alphabet’s robotaxi service said it would launch in Miami in 2026. The company has been testing its autonomous vehicles in the Florida city on-and-off &lt;a href="https://waymo.com/blog/2019/08/rain-testing-in-sunshine-state/"&gt;since 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and more recently has begun to &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/waymos-self-driving-cars-on-miami-streets-as-company-tests-its-technology/"&gt;lay the groundwork in earnest&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Eoi2Q"&gt;Waymo plans to start “reacquainting” its autonomous Jaguar I-Pace vehicles to Miami’s streets in 2025. And in 2026, it expects to start making its vehicles available to riders through its Waymo One ridehail app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="KA5P68"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Waymo plans to start “reacquainting” its autonomous Jaguar I-Pace vehicles to Miami’s streets in 2025&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0sRasM"&gt;The vehicles will be maintained by a company called &lt;a href="https://www.moove.io/"&gt;Moove&lt;/a&gt;, which provides fleet services, as well as a range of financial products for mobility companies. The African company (it has several offices in Nigeria) is backed by Uber and was recently &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/19/uber-leads-100m-investment-in-african-mobility-fintech-moove-as-valuation-hits-750m/"&gt;valued at $750 million&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CVW6oY"&gt;Moove will start out by taking over Waymo’s fleet management operations in Phoenix. That includes cleaning the vehicles, charging them, and making sure that the sensors are calibrated and unobstructed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3UDMF4"&gt;Waymo’s robotaxi business is slowly growing. It currently operates fleets of driverless cars in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin, and Phoenix. It also plans to launch a robotaxi service in Atlanta in an exclusive partnership with Uber. Waymo said recently it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24283127/waymo-now-does-150000-paid-trips-per-week"&gt;crossed the threshold of providing 150,000 paid trips per week&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KlVMti"&gt;Miami once played host to Ford-backed ArgoAI’s autonomous vehicle testing, but the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/26/23423998/argo-ai-shut-down-ford-vw-av-self-driving"&gt;company shut down&lt;/a&gt; when Ford pulled its funding. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Secret Level is a hollow anthology of video game cutscenes  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A still image from the animated series Secret Level." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bPfelw5mUWFP_MUqGg2GcFkqexA=/243x0:1668x950/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73768251/PCM_FINAL_11496_CC.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pac-Man.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9g3OSN"&gt;Ever since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224612/thats-a-lot-of-video-games"&gt;it was announced&lt;/a&gt;, there has been some confusion over just what &lt;em&gt;Secret Level&lt;/em&gt; actually is. The video game-themed anthology streaming on Prime Video — helmed by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23132482/love-death-and-robots-volume-3-review-netflix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Love, Death &amp;amp; Robots&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; creator Tim Miller — is a collection of animated shorts, each based on a different gaming property. So there’s a &lt;em&gt;Mega Man&lt;/em&gt; episode that explores the character’s origin and a &lt;em&gt;Spelunky&lt;/em&gt; episode that attempts to create a metanarrative around the concept of a roguelike. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZeUIxy"&gt;It’s an interesting idea let down by a lack of interesting ideas. The 15 shorts are almost universally dull and manage to neither make their source material seem compelling nor provide new insights for existing fans. The real confusion is who this is actually for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYcKO8"&gt;The main problem is how homogenous &lt;em&gt;Secret Level&lt;/em&gt; is. Working directly with game publishers, the show pulls from an oddball but also impressively global list, with titles like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/18/16469736/tencent-arena-of-valor-honor-of-kings-north-america-launch"&gt;Chinese megahit &lt;em&gt;Honor of Kings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Korean shooter &lt;em&gt;Crossfire&lt;/em&gt;. But despite featuring a large variety of video games, its episodes all feel very samey. It’s kind of the opposite of &lt;em&gt;Love, Death &amp;amp; Robots&lt;/em&gt;, which featured a number of different styles and tones as it explored horror and sci-fi. That’s how we...&lt;/p&gt;

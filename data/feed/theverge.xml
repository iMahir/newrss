    <title>Large drones are flying over New Jersey at night and no one knows why</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Photo collage of a big eye with a camera lens instead of a pupil in front of a background of location plackets over a topographical map." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4Wzj4VzJTv1qLMa00TYbRh8E1i4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73771033/STK471_Government_Surveillance_CVirginia_E.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="l8NAO9"&gt;For over a week, New Jersey residents have spotted unidentified aircraft in the northern part of the state, including Morris County and near Newark — and now the authorities are urging people to remain calm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hUHe7d"&gt;The FBI’s Newark office, along with Morris County officials, recently issued a statement asking the public to &lt;a href="https://www.morriscountynj.gov/Morris-County-News/Law-Enforcement-Advises-Public-How-to-Report-Drones-Activity"&gt;share any information&lt;/a&gt; they might have on the mysterious drones, while reiterating that there is “no known threat” to the public. And NJ Governor Phil Murphy said that his office is &lt;a href="https://x.com/GovMurphy/status/1864717982275965389"&gt;actively monitoring&lt;/a&gt; the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="blurry and dark photo of the bottom of an airplane that is speculated to be a drone, red lights underneath." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/enD21qIKXflyueCuVOBpt75svVo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25777065/Screenshot_2024_12_06_at_1.31.08_PM.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Julie Shavalier via NBC News&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of the drones looks like an airplane.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="n93UcE"&gt;The drones were captured on camera by residents in multiple boroughs in the state, mostly at night. Some images and videos shared in &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/ph3kpJT6a30?feature=shared"&gt;news broadcasts&lt;/a&gt; and social media depict &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@krisandersen7/video/7445182560658787615"&gt;strange winged aircraft&lt;/a&gt; that look like small planes (or “&lt;a href="https://x.com/Kobe_for_3/status/1863786489508675605"&gt;car-sized drones&lt;/a&gt;”). Others seem like groups of consumer-level drone copters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JZBgxy"&gt;The drones would fly back and forth for “hours,” some witnesses said. Following the reports, the FAA has banned drones from flying over President-elect Donald Trump’s New Jersey golf course, &lt;a href="https://www.nj.com/morris/2024/12/after-nighttime-flights-faa-bans-drones-over-trumps-nj-golf-course.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NJ.com&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YrHUUa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@krisandersen7/video/7445182560658787615" data-video-id="7445182560658787615" data-embed-from="oembed" style="max-width:605px; min-width:325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@krisandersen7" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@krisandersen7?refer=embed"&gt;@krisandersen7&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;finally got a video of my own. the mystery "drones" that have been circling nj and puzzling its residents. even the FBI has requested these sightings be reported as they are allegedly investigating them further. the best I could do given my shite phone and the fact that I was freezing my fingies off &lt;a title="newjersey" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/newjersey?refer=embed"&gt;#newjersey&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="drones" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/drones?refer=embed"&gt;#drones&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="mysterydrones" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/mysterydrones?refer=embed"&gt;#mysterydrones&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Jenny Talia" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7445182501955373854?refer=embed"&gt;♬ original sound - Jenny Talia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q9yRC5"&gt;This drone mystery has taken over the &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1h6xanb/12424_drone_megathread/"&gt;New Jersey subreddit&lt;/a&gt; and is spawning a bunch of &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/1h79nub/mysterious_unidentified_drones_flying_over_north/"&gt;citizen investigations&lt;/a&gt;. It even has the &lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wlcm2int-times.bsky.social/post/3lcjdeo6xj22u"&gt;attention of UFO enthusiasts&lt;/a&gt;. Some are speculating that the aircraft could be foreign spy drones like the &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2023/2/3/23584947/china-spy-surveillance-balloon-blinken-xi"&gt;Chinese spy balloon last year&lt;/a&gt;, or US &lt;a href="https://x.com/UAPJames/status/1865048390146424870"&gt;military tests&lt;/a&gt;, or surveillance drones from the local authorities. Even the FBI is being targeted as a potential culprit. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Pixel 9A looks destined to ditch the camera bar</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of the Google logo." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CD4eIaIA4ku5Z2BekVOButYTJbc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73770993/STK093_Google_02.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration: The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eFErMm"&gt;There’ve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24283754/google-pixel-9a-bigger-display-price-rumors-leak"&gt;already been renders&lt;/a&gt; of Google’s yet-to-be-announced Pixel 9A and one &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2024/08/26/pixel-9a-leak/"&gt;real-world sneak peek&lt;/a&gt;. Now we’re getting yet another look at an early prototype of Google’s next mid-range phone. &lt;a href="https://x.com/feni_book/status/1864698852584116696/"&gt;X user fenibook&lt;/a&gt; has posted two shots of the phone, and it’s got the company’s usual markings that designate this as a still-under-development device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kW0JxD"&gt;These latest images offer yet more proof that Google plans to ditch the camera bar — &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/google-pixel-camera-bar/"&gt;a visual hallmark of recent Pixels&lt;/a&gt; — on the 9A in favor of making the camera flush with the back of the phone. That’s a bit surprising to see, but Google’s Claude Zellweger &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24220359/google-pixel-9-camera-bar-small-phones-claude-zellweger-interview"&gt;told us back in August&lt;/a&gt; that designers were likely to reevaluate the ratio of camera hardware to phone hardware thanks to advancements in computational photography. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="o83gUs"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" align="center"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Google Pixel 9a leaked. &lt;a href="https://t.co/XxP67PsY0D"&gt;pic.twitter.com/XxP67PsY0D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— fenibook (@feni_book) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/feni_book/status/1864698852584116696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 5, 2024&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VlSULz"&gt;The Pixel A-series might be the ideal phone for Google to test whether it can get away with a smaller sensor and camera housing without sacrificing too much in the way of image quality. It’s logical to expect the company’s very best photo capabilities from the flagship models, but as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24154473/google-pixel-8a-camera-hands-on"&gt;my colleague Allison Johnson can attest&lt;/a&gt;, “pretty good” is often enough for the mid-tier Pixel. That said, this phone looks rather bland as is, so hopefully Google will give us a good selection of colors to pick from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oj9B6r"&gt;Rumors indicate the 9A will have a larger 6.3-inch display with a maximum refresh rate of 120Hz and the same Tensor G4 used in the Pixel 9, 9 Pro, and 9 Pro Fold. But there have also been reports that Google will &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2024/09/03/pixel-9a-tensor-g4-modem/"&gt;saddle it with an older modem&lt;/a&gt;, which would be a shame since the Pixel 9 lineup really made strides in cellular performance this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yrj4kO"&gt;Google could announce the Pixel 9A as early as March, so the rumors claim. The series has traditionally stuck to a spring release timeframe, but after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24218825/google-pixel-9-event-announcements-products"&gt;Google changed up the schedule&lt;/a&gt; this year, anything’s possible. Android 16 will be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24284665/android-16-release-schedule-q2-2025"&gt;rolling out earlier than usual&lt;/a&gt;, so the two might line up nicely.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This Game Boy Advance clone could satisfy your purple taco nostalgia </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A person is playing a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game on the Anbernic RG34XX retro handheld." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R5QG2jy0BuZiC4dpFd85_1pYyMQ=/1x0:1186x790/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73770953/anbernic1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Anbernic RG34XX looks inspired by Nintendo’s GBA but with a larger screen and more buttons.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bGDos7"&gt;Anbernic announced its next retro handheld today and it’s easy to see where the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64M_BHXsiiE&amp;amp;t=1s"&gt;design of the RG34XX draws its inspiration&lt;/a&gt;. It appears to be a faithful clone of Nintendo’s original Game Boy Advance, although updated with &lt;a href="https://x.com/KeepRetro/status/1865057457157877766"&gt;additional action and shoulder buttons&lt;/a&gt; allowing games from more recent systems to be played. Pricing and availability hasn’t been revealed yet, but the RG34XX will come in transparent red and green colors, as well as the GBA’s purple and black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HPg8X8"&gt;One feature Anbernic didn’t carry forward is the Game Boy Advance’s LCD screen which lacked a backlight and was notoriously difficult to see unless you were playing outside on a sunny day or cozied up next to a bright lamp. The RG34XX will instead feature a larger 3.4-inch display with a 720x480 resolution. The display will also use the same 3:2 aspect ratio as the Game Boy Advance, so GBA titles should look great, and older games developed for 4:3 TV screens will fit without extensive stretching or pillarboxing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Anbernic RG34XX pictured in its four color options." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yvv2YsuXyHeyuog5iDnKOglF7O0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25777028/anbernic3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Keep Retro&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The RG34XX will be available in purple or black colors, and transparent red or green.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IcgRa8"&gt;As with previous Anbernic handhelds, the RG34XX doesn’t have a cartridge slot like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24236829/analogue-pocket-handheld-gaming-game-boy-color"&gt;Analogue Pocket&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170572/modretro-chromatic-game-boy-color-palmer-luckey-price-release-date"&gt;ModRetro Chromatic&lt;/a&gt;. It’s instead designed to play games through software emulation. Details on the RG34XX’s processor aren’t known yet, but &lt;a href="https://retrohandhelds.gg/anbernic-rg34xx-announced/"&gt;Retro Handhelds speculates&lt;/a&gt; it will be based on the Allwinner H700 chipset the company has &lt;a href="https://anbernic.com/products/rg28xx"&gt;used in its other XX series handhelds&lt;/a&gt;. If that’s the case, you can expect it to play games from older consoles up to the original Sony PlayStation, and even some N64 and Sega Dreamcast titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A close-up look at the top of the Anbernic RG34XX including its ports, card slots, and shoulder buttons." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k-gvlVhhVOX5u3ID5emVECDHJ0Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25777023/anbernic2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Keep Retro&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The RG34XX will include two sets of shoulder buttons, a mini HDMI port, USB-C for charging, and dual microSD slots.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qNUY7l"&gt;The RG34XX will include Wi-Fi connectivity facilitating online play as well as streaming PC titles through &lt;a href="https://moonlight-stream.org/"&gt;Moonlight&lt;/a&gt;, and Bluetooth for connecting multiple wireless controllers for shared screen multiplayer. If that 3.4-inch screen still seems too small, the RG34XX also includes a mini HDMI port for connecting it to a TV, alongside a USB-C port for charging, and a pair of microSD card slots for storing ROMs and its operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="o8TUE5"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/64M_BHXsiiE?rel=0&amp;amp;start=1" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1oBKFL"&gt;This isn’t the first time that Anbernic has copied Nintendo’s homework. Earlier this year the company released its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24152105/can-you-resist-anbernics-game-boy-advance-sp-that-plays-ps1-and-n64-games"&gt;RG35XXSP with a design inspired by the clamshell Game Boy Advance SP&lt;/a&gt; but with an improved screen, a more capable processor, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/13/24177983/this-amazing-knockoff-gba-sp-comes-stuffed-with-software-piracy"&gt;concerning number of pre-installed pirated ROMs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s in-house 5G modem plans are just getting started with next year’s iPhone SE</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An image showing the iPhone SE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o3deRsledj3JUKmowX8TwhwiJB0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73770951/ajohnson_221103_5070_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new modem is rumored to appear in next year’s iPhone SE.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZhW66J"&gt;Apple’s betting that its upcoming in-house 5G modem could help it beat Qualcomm's performance eventually, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-06/apple-s-three-year-modem-road-map-company-plans-to-beat-qualcomm-by-2027"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Mark Gurman&lt;/a&gt;. Apple has worked on developing its own modem for years, but the initiative reportedly experienced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/21/23883565/apple-5g-modem-failure-inside-story"&gt;technical issues and other setbacks&lt;/a&gt; despite &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/8909671/apple-intel-5g-smartphone-modems-acquisition"&gt;purchasing Intel’s modem unit&lt;/a&gt; in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d93I7k"&gt;The first Apple modem is rumored to come to the iPhone SE before appearing in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/25/24305670/iphone-17-slim-rumors-sim-card-battery-problems"&gt;the rumored iPhone “Slim”&lt;/a&gt; and entry-level iPads. Down the line, Apple is reportedly planning to roll out a second-generation modem with mmWave in 2026, putting it in the iPhone 18 line and higher-end iPads. In 2027, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports that Apple “hopes to top Qualcomm” with its “Prometheus” modem, which could support AI features and “next-generation satellite networks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="gEuZgx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s next iPhone SE might get an OLED upgrade","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/3/24234749/apple-iphone-se-4th-generation-oled-display-rumor-leak"},{"title":"The new Mac Mini is great — now do the&amp;amp;nbsp;iPhone&amp;amp;nbsp;SE","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/15/24296505/apple-iphone-se-rumors-mac-mini"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PzAfpL"&gt;However, its first chip may fall short of Qualcomm’s in terms of the absolute highest possible speed for a couple of reasons: lacking support for the mmWave technology available in some cities from carriers like Verizon and supporting four-carrier aggregation instead of six. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nDtW4H"&gt;Those features boost the maximum bandwidth available to multiple gigabits per second, but speeds are typically much slower in the real world, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22968066/apple-iphone-se-5g-mmwave-verizon-uw"&gt;the current iPhone SE also lacks mmWave support&lt;/a&gt;. The new modem will, however, support dual SIM standby, allowing people to have two active SIM cards at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bPOrKb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XQ8kLF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now try Microsoft’s Recall AI feature on Intel and AMD Copilot Plus PCs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A timeline with buttons for yesterday, today, and now, with apps like Teams and Excel at the bottom." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2hmYXe1FmoByFlUS6e3LDnKqnZw=/144x0:1698x1036/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73770949/Gen_AI_feature3_VP5_1842x1036.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3zPjMX"&gt;Microsoft is expanding the testing of its new Recall AI feature to Intel- and AMD-powered Copilot Plus PCs. The software giant first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/22/24302947/microsoft-recall-windows-insider-testing-dev-channel-click-to-do"&gt;released a preview of Recall&lt;/a&gt; on Qualcomm-powered laptops last month, allowing Windows Insiders in the Dev Channel to test the new AI-powered feature. Now Intel and AMD Copilot Plus PCs &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/12/06/previewing-more-copilot-experiences-with-windows-insiders-in-the-dev-channel/"&gt;are getting access&lt;/a&gt; in a new build today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QL974Z"&gt;Recall takes screenshots of almost everything you do on a Copilot Plus PC to make it searchable and easy to recall a memory or retrace your steps. Microsoft has made the AI experience entirely optional, so you can enable snapshots to find what you were working on previously through natural language search or a scrollable timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XfzmcyXUD84A0yvmrnIYQ79JkGk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25749006/2_recall_timeline.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Recall timeline feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="e5hjkx"&gt;Much like the experience on Qualcomm Copilot Plus PCs, Windows 11 will download the models for Recall and Click to Do in the background once you install the Dev Channel build. You’ll then need to enable snapshots yourself. You can control what snapshots are saved and delete them based on apps or much like you’d delete browsing history by date. Microsoft also provides a way to exclude apps and websites from Recall, and the feature also automatically detects sensitive information like credit card details, passwords, and personal ID numbers to ensure snapshots are not saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3xAwzO"&gt;Microsoft has made a variety of security upgrades to Recall after researchers raised the alarm over the controversial feature. You now need to use Windows Hello to confirm your presence and access snapshots, and it also requires BitLocker and Secure Boot — both of which should be enabled already on a Copilot Plus PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vni8CC"&gt;Click to Do is also part of this Recall testing. Click to Do can recognize text and images in Recall snapshots so you can use AI-powered actions on them like copying text or saving images out of old snapshots. Microsoft is also expanding Click to Do outside of Recall so you can use it to take actions on images and text by summoning it through Windows key + mouse click. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JDCT2v"&gt;Lastly, Microsoft is also introducing its Image Creator and Restyle Image features to the Photos app for Intel- and AMD-powered Copilot Plus PCs. These devices will also get access to Cocreator in Paint today to let you create AI-powered images directly in Paint.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>X’s Grok AI chatbot is now available to all users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vector illustration of the Grok logo." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vLbhdlMz3xdYHmdVmVbhaWWr5xA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73770853/STK262_GROK_D.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eVergz"&gt;Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok is now available to free users on X. &lt;a href="https://x.com/blankspeaker/status/1864826210951307330"&gt;Several users&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://x.com/nima_owji/status/1865058483529290086"&gt;noticed the change&lt;/a&gt; on Friday, which gives non-Premium subscribers the ability to send up to 10 messages to Grok every two hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="swGogS"&gt;xAI launched Grok last year as a “humorous AI assistant,” but it was only available to Premium subscribers. In August, xAI added a text-to-image generation feature to Grok, which turned out to be capable of producing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/14/24220173/xai-grok-image-generator-misinformation-offensive-imges"&gt;some questionable images&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Making Grok more widely available might help it compete with the already-free chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, and Anthropic’s Claude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lpff3M"&gt;xAI, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-05/musk-s-xai-wraps-up-6-billion-in-funding-in-latest-round"&gt;which raised $6 billion in its latest funding round&lt;/a&gt;, is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/27/24307571/xai-consumer-app-planned-report"&gt;also considering launching&lt;/a&gt; a standalone app for Grok — something ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude already have, according to a report from &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation hit new all-time low with $40 off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A hands-on photo of Apple’s AirPods 4 wireless earbuds." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1BvlauaUYN3KC1t_3onLxqT4JyI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73770847/DSCF0028.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You should definitely skip the base AirPods 4, which are only $9 cheaper right now.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K01ihQ"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23365910/apple-airpods-pro-second-generation-review"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; stole the spotlight recently with an incredible discount that made them even cheaper than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24245570/apple-airpods-4-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods 4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; with Active Noise Cancellation&lt;/strong&gt;. But now the script is flipped and the AirPods 4 are currently discounted to $139 ($40 off) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0DGJ7HYG1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. That’s a new record low for Apple’s newest pair of wireless earbuds and just $9 more than the version without ANC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="dRj2tj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"},{"title":"Why is Apple sleeping on the AirPods Max?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/17/24242378/airpods-max-usb-c-unchanged-missing-features"},{"title":"The best wireless earbuds to buy right now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dDZG3r"&gt;The AirPods 4 are a substantial upgrade over the previous generation, with better overall sound quality and a stronger bass profile. They also borrow a couple more features from the AirPods Pro, like the Voice Isolation feature that analyzes your voice to separate it and cancel out the environment, resulting in clearer voice calls. Other features include a wireless charging case with a speaker that lets you trigger a sound from Apple’s Find My app, spatial audio with head-tracking, and adaptive audio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G9XfO4"&gt;Active noise cancellation is solid in the upgraded pair, but since there are no canal-sealing ear tips, they won’t offer the same dampening. That’s where you’d opt instead for the AirPods Pro, which ultimately sound better and offer a few extra capabilities, like more intuitive volume controls and the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24275178/apple-airpods-pro-hearing-aid-test-protection-preview"&gt;use them as hearing aids&lt;/a&gt;. But if you don’t mind making some tradeoffs, the entry-level AirPods 4 offer a lot for the money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="e2p9Xl"&gt;A few more deals to kick the weekend off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="TREAkg"&gt;If you need a solid pair of earbuds but you can’t justify spending close to $100 or more, the &lt;strong&gt;JLab Go Air Pop&lt;/strong&gt; should have your attention right now. They’re just $9.88 ($15 off) at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FJLab-Go-Air-Pop-Bluetooth-Earbuds-True-Wireless-with-Charging-Case-Slate%2F799981023&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, which is their lowest price to date. They don’t do much but play music, but they sound decent, they’re reasonably comfortable, and you can get them in a variety of fun colors. You’ll get eight hours of runtime per charge, with an extra 24 hours available in the charging case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nxaF3q"&gt;Today only, you can get a two-pack of black&lt;strong&gt; Xbox Core Wireless Controllers&lt;/strong&gt; with a USB-C cable from &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2F2-pack-xbox-core-wireless-controller-usb-c-cable&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F12%2F6%2F24314768%2Fapple-airpods-4-with-active-noise-cancellation-wireless-earbuds-xbox-core-controller-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot&lt;/a&gt; for $73.59 (about $46 off) with code &lt;strong&gt;20PERCENT&lt;/strong&gt;. The controllers are often on sale for $40 on their own, so you’re getting a better deal compared to buying them separately. Although Microsoft created the controllers specifically for the Xbox Series X/S launch, you can use them with older Xbox One consoles and on Windows PCs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Xd4JJx"&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Ring Battery Doorbell Plus&lt;/strong&gt;, which we think is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22954554/best-video-doorbell-camera"&gt;best battery-powered video doorbell&lt;/a&gt;, is matching its all-time low of $99.99 ($50 off) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Ring-Battery-Doorbell-detection/dp/B09WZBPX7K?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://howl.link/2b4pzb9n9vuf6"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fring-battery-doorbell-plus-8211-smart-wi-fi-video-doorbell-with-head-to-toe-hd-video-satin-nickel%2F-%2FA-88293229&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. The doorbell boasts an impressive 1536p video resolution as well as a head-to-toe view that offers better visibility for packages and visitors. While there are cheaper wireless options from Ring and competitors, they’re not quite as responsive as the Doorbell Plus. Other handy features include color night vision, live view, and two-way audio, though you’ll need to pay $4.99 a month for others like recorded video and package alerts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Anthem BCBS is reversing its anesthesia policy after online outrage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cigna Corp. And Anthem Inc. Offices As Insurers Face Off Against U.S. To Save $48 Billion Deal" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/giT7X3mY1qiQS54-Uro5uV3jn-s=/0x0:5616x3744/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73770821/626407904.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C3nhi8"&gt;Beginning in February, health insurer Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield was planning to set a time limit for anesthesia coverage during surgeries and procedures. Now, following days of widespread outrage at the health insurance industry generally, Anthem is walking that policy back, the insurer &lt;a href="https://providernews.anthem.com/connecticut/articles/update-to-anesthesia-billed-time-units-policy-23311"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nvJ5E5"&gt;In mid-November, the American Society of Anesthesiologists &lt;a href="https://www.asahq.org/about-asa/newsroom/news-releases/2024/11/anthem-blue-cross-blue-shield-will-not-pay-complete-duration-of-anesthesia-for-surgical-procedures"&gt;issued a press release&lt;/a&gt; about the policy, which was set to take effect in February in states like Connecticut, New York, and Missouri. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8veL0d"&gt;“If an anesthesiologist submits a bill where the actual time of care is longer than Anthem’s limit, Anthem will deny payment for the anesthesiologist’s care,” they group writes. “With this new policy, Anthem will not pay anesthesiologists for delivering safe and effective anesthesia care to patients who may need extra attention because their surgery is difficult, unusual or because a complication arises.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nsxL5v"&gt;The letter appears to have garnered little public attention until this week when &lt;a href="https://x.com/MorePerfectUS/status/1864363128584130774"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://x.com/GovKathyHochul/status/1864495315362926753"&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; on social media about the policy change began circulating. The posts gained traction after the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, Brian Thompson, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/05/us/unitedhealthcare-ceo-killed-what-we-know-hnk/index.html"&gt;was shot and killed in New York&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday in what police say was a targeted attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GzJmHI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" align="center"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Outrageous. I’m going to make sure New Yorkers are protected. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Mqtjeu0ZD7"&gt;https://t.co/Mqtjeu0ZD7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Governor Kathy Hochul (@GovKathyHochul) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GovKathyHochul/status/1864495315362926753?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 5, 2024&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QJ99KQ"&gt;A spokesperson for Anthem’s parent company, Elevance Health, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/health/blue-cross-blue-shield-anesthesia-anthem.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that “misinformation” about the plan contributed to Anthem’s reversal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xg4pIM"&gt;“We realized, based on all the feedback we’ve been receiving the last 24 hours, that our communication about the policy was unclear, which is why we’re pulling back,” Janey Kiryluik, staff vice president for corporate communications, is quoted as saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gG3Kn2"&gt;Thompson’s shooting shocked the public, but it also ignited discussions about the havoc wreaked by the US healthcare system and insurers like UnitedHealthcare. United specifically has been &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/11/14/unitedhealth-algorithm-medicare-advantage-investigation/"&gt;the subject of investigations by outlets like &lt;em&gt;Stat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;which found the company uses algorithms to cut off payments and deny rehabilitation care for patients. The rate at which insurers deny patient claims &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-often-do-health-insurers-deny-patients-claims"&gt;is a closely guarded secret&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;em&gt;ProPublica &lt;/em&gt;last year &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/unitedhealth-healthcare-insurance-denial-ulcerative-colitis"&gt;followed one chronically ill patient’s fight&lt;/a&gt; to get coverage from United. In some online forums, there was little sympathy for the company and Thompson’s death: Americans carry &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/health-costs/issue-brief/the-burden-of-medical-debt-in-the-united-states/"&gt;at least $220 billion in medical debt&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/06/16/1104969627/medical-debt-upended-their-lives-heres-what-it-took-from-them"&gt;upends lives&lt;/a&gt; as insurance companies profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fVHBH9"&gt;The shooter’s motives are not yet clear, but shell casings &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/05/us/unitedhealthcare-ceo-killed-what-we-know-hnk/index.html"&gt;discovered at the scene&lt;/a&gt; were found to have &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/05/nyregion/brian-thompson-unitedhealthcare-news?smid=url-share#b394ac8b-4b7c-5962-8c6e-04d61f0166c7"&gt;the words “delay” and “deny”&lt;/a&gt; written on them. Following the murder, healthcare companies like &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/healthcare-industry-rethinks-risk-after-murder-unitedhealth-exec-2024-12-05/"&gt;CVS Health&lt;/a&gt; began &lt;a href="https://www.404media.co/multiple-major-health-insurance-companies-take-down-leadership-pages-following-murder-of-united-healthcare-ceo/"&gt;taking down webpages about corporate leadership&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VMc99V"&gt;Researchers from the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland and UC Irvine have developed a drone capable of landing and taking off in areas that would otherwise leave a fixed-wing aircraft stranded. Their &lt;a href="https://actu.epfl.ch/news/bird-inspired-drone-can-jump-for-take-off-2/"&gt;Robotic Avian-inspired Vehicle for multiple ENvironments&lt;/a&gt; (RAVEN) trades traditional landing gear for a pair of bird-inspired articulated legs that allow the drone to walk around, hop over obstacles, and even &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/bird-drone"&gt;leap into the air to take flight&lt;/a&gt; without the need for a runway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kzfvd5"&gt;Quadcopter drones may offer more flexibility when it comes to where they can take off and land, but most rely on four motors which are less energy-efficient than fixed-wing drones that use a single motor paired with gliding for flight. To expand the capabilities of fixed-wing drones, the researchers took inspiration from birds like crows and ravens which can easily maneuver on the ground using a scrawny pair of legs, as detailed in a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08228-9"&gt;paper published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this week.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;RAVEN’s legs and feet use a simplified design but still offer enough articulation for the drone to maneuver on the ground.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="M1fw6p"&gt;Recreating the strength and capabilities of a bird’s legs mechanically without adding significant weight to a drone and reducing its operating range required a mix of “mathematical models, computer simulations, and experimental iterations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="khbZQP"&gt;The final design for the legs uses a combination of springs and motors to mimic “powerful avian tendons and muscles” while its simplified feet use “two articulated structures” plus toes with a passive elastic joint. The toes not only prevent RAVEN from constantly face planting, they’re also critical for walking and positioning the drone at the right angle of attack for an effective takeoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TiPIAN"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-8DJ1a3sLIc?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mGaJ2M"&gt;Fixed-wing drones that take advantage of legs for short takeoffs and landings aren’t an entirely new idea. In 2019, a South African startup called Passerine &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/delivery-drones-use-birdinspired-legs-to-jump-into-the-air"&gt;demonstrated a drone called Sparrow&lt;/a&gt; that used a pair of spring-loaded legs to leap into the air and take flight from a standstill. What sets RAVEN apart is the complexity of its legs that allow the drone to walk across rough terrain, jump over gaps, and hop onto obstacles as high as 10 inches — in addition to being able to leap into flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X1FYag"&gt;RAVEN’s operations aren’t limited to airports or areas with smooth surfaces, which traditional wheeled landing gear requires. It also doesn’t require human intervention to get airborne again. It’s capable of landing and exploring areas that may be dangerous or restricted to humans, and then repositioning itself to an area that’s safe for takeoff. And it does it all using less power than a quadcopter drone would, giving it a larger operational range.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Eufy’s new floodlight cam will watch over your backyard in HD for $150</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Eufy&amp;amp;nbsp;Floodlight Camera E30 attached to a wall covered in siding." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/niTvTfsrR2aeWS8u8OK6S9yQJpQ=/1x0:1000x666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73719080/uefy1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eufy’s new hardwired floodlight camera can record all day long.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Eufy&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="50FBR8"&gt;Eufy’s new Floodlight Camera E30 attaches a 2K camera that can tilt and pan 360 degrees to a pair of 2,000-lumen LED floodlights and throws in local video capture without subscription fees. Although Eufy, the smart home brand of Anker, sells similar products with batteries and solar panels offering more flexibility on where they can be mounted, most homes already have a floodlight. That makes the hardwired E30 an easy replacement that is available now through the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eufy.com%2Fproducts%2Ft8426121%3Fvariant%3D44347001536698&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F11%2F12%2F24294751%2Fanker-eufy-floodlight-camera-e30-security" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;company’s website&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DDTRM7DJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $149.99,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DxvXvn"&gt;There are alternatives we currently recommend in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22811985/best-smart-floodlight-security-camera"&gt;floodlight camera buyer’s guide&lt;/a&gt;, but for $150, the Eufy E30 offers several premium features without requiring ongoing fees to actually use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L1BLlv"&gt;Being hardwired also means the E30,...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>VW and Rivian officially kick off $5.8 billion joint venture, announce leadership</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Rivian&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="axXFJZ"&gt;Volkswagen and Rivian have crossed all their T’s and dotted all their I’s in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185946/vw-rivian-joint-venture-investment-software-r2"&gt;their new $5.8 billion joint venture&lt;/a&gt;, which officially kicks off its work on November 13th, the companies announced today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iVTI1A"&gt;Last June, VW said it would invest $5 billion in Rivian as part of a new joint venture that’s focused on developing a new electrical architecture and vehicle software for future models, including subcompact cars, with the first planned for 2027. The investment size has now increased to $5.8 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="8tINAu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Rivian and VW Group Technology, LLC”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6yqGaf"&gt;The new joint venture, dryly named “Rivian and VW Group Technology, LLC,” will be led by Rivian software chief Wassym Bensaid and VW Group chief technology engineer Carsten Helbing. Teams will be based in...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dragon Age: The Veilguard has fantastic hair tech thanks to FIFA and Madden</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Screenshot from Dragon Age: The Veilguard showing off the game’s new hair technology." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RxDQwf5dBSZi-H13qJnth7j1Zwg=/86x0:1444x905/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73719015/unnamed__5_.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7cmiX1"&gt;EA has shared &lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/technology/news/strand-hair-dragon-age-the-veilguard"&gt;a lengthy blog&lt;/a&gt; detailing all the technical work that went into rendering hair in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24281631/dragon-age-the-veilguard-early-review-ps5-xbox-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dragon Age: The Veilguard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N6WuHw"&gt;While it used to be, and in some cases still is, a struggle to find a game with a character creator that included a diverse range of hairstyles, newer games are getting better at providing styles to represent folks on the kinky / curly hair spectrum where a lot of people of color reside. However, the new struggle is getting those hairstyles to look and act natural. I remember looking at all the hairstyles in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22929852/horizon-forbidden-west-ps5-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and being bemused that the dreadlocks on Varl &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/horizon/comments/wdde3q/our_boy_with_the_beard/#lightbox"&gt;looked like they were made out of foam&lt;/a&gt;, while his beard was simply straight hair without an ounce of kink a Black man like him typically has....&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Starbucks now offers delivery in its own app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Promotional photo of people with a Starbucks delivery order." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ABqyJ7B_EuZDP35KP1JN1GoY-KM=/0x0:2337x1558/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73718508/DoorDash_FeatureImage.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Get your red cup delivered straight to your door. | Photo: Starbucks&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Qr2IpL"&gt;A new way to spend $10 on a 12-ounce coffee just dropped. Starting today, Starbucks is &lt;a href="https://about.starbucks.com/stories/2024/starbucks-app-gets-delivery-boost-from-doordash/"&gt;accepting delivery orders right inside its app&lt;/a&gt;. Delivery is handled by DoorDash, and right now, it’s limited to “participating stores” in the US and Canada. But if you’re in the delivery area and willing to pay a small fortune in fees, getting your Starbucks order into your hands has never been easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YacwNA"&gt;Starbucks has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/17/23559108/doordash-starbucks-delivery-us-expansion"&gt;offering delivery through DoorDash&lt;/a&gt; in the US since early last year, but only within Doordash’s app. Previously, order ahead options in the Starbucks app were limited to in-store and drive-through pickup. Now, you can toggle between pickup and delivery. Placing a delivery order brings up an interface identical to the one on DoorDash’s...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo’s Black Friday sale has discounts on Switch games and controllers</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HhJWZQ"&gt;Nintendo games rarely see big discounts, but the holiday shopping season always proves a good opportunity to save on some contemporary classics. After initially offering special &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/16/24246126/nintendo-switch-mario-kart-8-oled-bundle-nintendo-online"&gt;holiday bundles of its Switch consoles&lt;/a&gt;, Nintendo has also announced &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/nintendo-announces-black-friday-offers-providing-even-more-ways-to-play-this-holiday-season/"&gt;a Black Friday sale on various games and controllers&lt;/a&gt; set to begin November 24th and run through the 30th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5mmoyb"&gt;Major Nintendo titles like &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Pikmin 4&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Kirby and the Forgotten Land&lt;/em&gt;, and more will be $20 off at retailers like Best Buy, Target, and Walmart once the sale commences. Additionally, Switch accessories like Joy-Con controllers and Nintendo’s Pro Controller will also be $20 off, along with a slick &lt;em&gt;Tears of the Kingdom&lt;/em&gt; carrying case getting a $10 discount....&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Turn your smartphone into a playable wind instrument with this USB-C mouthpiece</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Zefiro is a tiny USB-C MIDI controller that can be played like a wind instrument.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Kickstarter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Is9Nge"&gt;An Italian startup called Artinoise has created an unusual USB-C accessory for mobile devices that turns them into playable musical instruments. The Zefiro looks like a flash drive or a tiny vape, but by gently blowing into one end, it can be used to play simulated instruments with even less skill than what was needed to play those plastic recorders in grade school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OV5fbV"&gt;The Zefiro is being made available through a &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/artinoise/zefiro-wind-instrument-for-smartphone-users"&gt;Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign&lt;/a&gt; looking to raise just over $5,300 to fund production. According to the company, “We have been developing and manufacturing musical instruments for years; now we just need to collect pre-orders for our latest creation and kick off manufacturing!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uvd88s"&gt;Those backing the campaign early can preorder a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best iPad deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A photo of the iPad Mini on a coffee table." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OcECdVheHU7AHvceHLN1W7-l9ZY=/0x3:4240x2830/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66899976/iPad_Mini_1.59.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you need the latest and greatest, we’re already seeing (slight) discounts on Apple’s newest iPad Mini.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: David Pierce / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BAaqdG"&gt;While the best iPad deals usually land during major sale events like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24288220/black-friday-best-deals-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets-2024"&gt;Black Friday and Cyber Monday&lt;/a&gt;, many great iPad deals are attainable outside those times. The day-to-day discounts may come and go like changing winds, but there’s often something to be saved, particularly on the more affordable iPads. The most recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24146276/apple-ipad-pro-oled-features-specs-let-loose-event"&gt;iPad Pro and iPad Air&lt;/a&gt; are causing prices on older models to drop even further, and now that Apple has a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24275956/apple-ipad-mini-2024-review"&gt;new iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt;, we’re seeing regular discounts on the last-gen Mini as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="8iS4ez"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:11906226"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WBzk5S"&gt;It’s difficult to know where exactly you can find the most notable iPad deals unless you’re scouring the major retailers on a daily basis. But that’s often what our deal hunters at &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;are doing each and every day, so let us help you out....&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="F530Q1"&gt;VMware made its Fusion and Workstation software that creates and manages virtual machines free for &lt;a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/workstation/2024/05/vmware-workstation-pro-now-available-free-for-personal-use.html"&gt;personal use&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. Now, the company announced that as of Monday, it’s &lt;a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/cloud-foundation/2024/11/11/vmware-fusion-and-workstation-are-now-free-for-all-users/"&gt;free for everyone&lt;/a&gt;, including commercial customers.

Since then, it has bundled the company’s products to “simplify its portfolio” and dropped many existing SKUs. It has already announced an end to &lt;a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/cloud-foundation/2024/01/22/vmware-end-of-availability-of-perpetual-licensing-and-saas-services/"&gt;offering VMware perpetual licensing&lt;/a&gt; for standalone offerings to push enterprises towards its Cloud Foundation or vSphere Foundation subscription...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="4Ias5S"&gt;Sony is cutting the price of the “slim” PS5 digital edition by $70, making it more affordable for the holiday season. Typically, that PS5 model costs $449.99, but it will start at $379.99 through December 24th, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J40QG4CVaww"&gt;according to a new ad&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E2g4yT"&gt;This holiday deal brings the slim PS5 digital edition just under the original $399.99 price of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21436287/sony-ps5-digital-edition-price-release-date"&gt;launch version of the PS5 digital console&lt;/a&gt;. The footnote at the end of the ad specifies that this price is only for the disc-free console, so it seems like the model with a disc drive already attached will still start at $499.99. But the holiday pricing also means that by buying a digital PS5 slim and one of Sony’s separate $79.99 PS5 disc drives, you can make your own PS5 with a disc drive and save about $40.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hyundai’s touchscreen honeymoon is over because sometimes buttons are just better</title>

  &lt;p id="aFVkDs"&gt;Hyundai, a company that has been just as guilty in the past of spreading the touchscreen scourge in cars as any other, has been course-correcting lately, putting more buttons and knobs into its cars. The reason isn’t surprising: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23801545/car-infotainment-customer-satisifaction-survey-jd-power"&gt;people hate touchscreens&lt;/a&gt;, at least for certain essential controls like HVAC systems, and they told Hyundai so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oUqfOn"&gt;“As we were adding integrated [infotainment] screens in our vehicles, we also tried putting touchscreen-based controls, and people didn’t prefer that,” Hyundai Design North America VP Ha Hak-soo &lt;a href="https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/2024-11-07/business/industry/Hyundai-made-a-big-bet-on-touch-screens-in-cars-Heres-why-its-going-back-to-buttons/2172220"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Korea JoongAng Daily&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in an interview that &lt;a href="https://insideevs.com/news/740529/hyundai-touchscreen-physical-buttons/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;InsideEVs&lt;/em&gt; spotted&lt;/a&gt;. He said Hyundai, which was as infatuated with touchscreens as the rest of the industry at first, found that in focus group testing people got...&lt;/p&gt;

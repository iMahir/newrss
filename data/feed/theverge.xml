    <title>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle’s early access period won’t include full ray tracing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A screenshot from Indiana Jones and the Great Circle." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gico98KKY8DgWmB5pLeOUVGJBKk=/300x0:1920x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73768817/ss_8221cf729bc6491919a8532679be64f1c67dcdaf.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Bethesda Softworks&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LqvHpM"&gt;If you pay the premium to play &lt;em&gt;Indiana Jones and the Great Circle&lt;/em&gt; early on PC, the game won’t initially include full ray tracing. The game’s early access period for Premium Edition and Collector’s Edition buyers launches at 7PM ET today, but full ray tracing won’t be added until December 9th, when the game launches for everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="No87qi"&gt;“Following the release of the update, shadows, reflections, and global illumination will all be accurately rendered in &lt;em&gt;Indiana Jones and the Great Circle&lt;/em&gt; using Full Ray Tracing, elevating image quality,” &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Findiana-jones-marvel-rivals-geforce-game-ready-driver%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F12%2F5%2F24314171%2Findiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-early-access-full-ray-tracing" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nvidia says in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/22/23841148/nvidia-dlss-3-5-ray-reconstruction-ray-tracing-quality"&gt;DLSS Ray Reconstruction&lt;/a&gt; will be “coming soon,” according to an emailed media alert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="SCRNxQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"When does Indiana Jones release in early access, and is it on Game Pass?","url":"https://www.polygon.com/indiana-jones-great-circle-guide/486012/release-time-early-access-game-pass"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sk76Yr"&gt;The belated addition of the graphics options could sting for early access buyers, especially given that early access isn’t cheap: the Premium Edition, for example, costs $99.99, a $30 increase over the game’s standard $69.99 price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hJf42t"&gt;The game already has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24312550/the-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-pc-specs-are-an-adventure"&gt;hefty PC specs&lt;/a&gt;, including that GPU hardware ray tracing is required even at minimum. Jim Kjellin, the CTO of &lt;em&gt;Great Circle&lt;/em&gt; developer MachineGames, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24313654/bethesda-fixed-the-typos-on-indiana-jones-pc-specs-and-answered-our-question-about-ray-tracing"&gt;gave us a reason&lt;/a&gt; for as to why that’s the case:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="bzv8dW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Indiana Jones and the Great Circle&lt;/em&gt; uses a technique called global illumination to light the environment and characters. Our engine MOTOR, used by MachineGames, uses hardware raytracing to calculate this. While this isn’t what players may typically think of as “ray tracing,” the compatible hardware is required to do this is in a performant, high fidelity way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jDNzZf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Great Circle&lt;/em&gt; will also be available on Xbox Series X / S, and it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224284/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release-date"&gt;coming to PS5 in spring 2025&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OpenAI’s 12 days of ‘ship-mas:’ all the new announcements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vector illustration of the Chat GPT logo." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C9gBmAFuusic1OfYoKoC7d8ZHFk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73768802/STK155_OPEN_AI_CVirginia_2_B.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;OpenAI is planning to launch new features, products, and demos for 12 days straight — starting with the full release of its o1 reasoning model.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="SxdEiY"&gt;OpenAI’s 12 days of “ship-mas” have officially begun, with the company set to reveal some new features, products, and demos during all 12 days starting December 5th, just a few days shy of the second anniversary of ChatGPT’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/8/23499728/ai-capability-accessibility-chatgpt-stable-diffusion-commercialization"&gt;explosive launch in 2022&lt;/a&gt;. According to the company, ChatGPT now has over 300 million weekly users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4thf8v"&gt;The event started with the release of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24314147/openai-reasoning-model-o1-strawberry-chatgpt-pro-new-tier"&gt;improved OpenAI o1 reasoning model&lt;/a&gt; out of preview, along with a new $200 ChatGPT Pro subscription that offers unlimited access to GPT-4o, Advanced Voice Mode, and an exclusive version of o1 that &lt;a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1864738531249475623"&gt;Sam Altman says&lt;/a&gt; “can think even harder for the hardest problems.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4vxVkn"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24312352/openai-sora-o1-reasoning-12-days-shipmas"&gt;Sources tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that OpenAI will also launch Sora, its text-to-video AI generator. There’s likely a lot more to come, and we’re keeping track of all the announcements from OpenAI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="38IYSa"&gt;You can follow along below as we continue to report on all the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>James Gunn wants DC Studios to be able to make a little bit of everything</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The interior of an airship. Sitting in the ship from left to right are: a skeleton lit up in fluorescent green flames, the Bride of Frankenstein, an amphibious woman wearing a diving suit, a robot in army fatigues, and a humanoid weasel.

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Max / Warner Bros.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="l5NtAs"&gt;Between its reanimated corpses and humanoid animals, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/26/24207258/james-gunns-creature-commandos-looks-like-some-sort-of-monstrous-suicide-squad"&gt;HBO’s new &lt;em&gt;Creature Commandos &lt;/em&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t really look or sound anything like Warner Bros.’ other upcoming projects featuring characters from DC’s comics. But DC Studios co-head James Gunn says that’s by design and part of his plan to make the studio a place where any kind of story can be greenlit if it’s got the right script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R4PU4u"&gt;While DC Studios has plans for fresh, live-action takes on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/2023/1/31/23579837/dc-studios-james-gunn-batman-superman-legacy-supergirl-the-authority-paradise-lost"&gt;Batman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/6/24150308/james-gunn-is-giving-superman-a-little-wiggle-room"&gt;Superman&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24266192/hbo-lanterns-john-stewart-casting-aaron-pierre-dc-comics"&gt;Green Lantern&lt;/a&gt;s, it’s kicking off its latest cinematic universe with &lt;em&gt;Creature Commandos&lt;/em&gt;, an animated series about Amanda Waller’s (Viola Davis) secret squad of monster mercenaries. The show will feature a couple of nifty connections to previous DC shows like &lt;em&gt;Peacemaker &lt;/em&gt;and films like &lt;em&gt;The Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt;, but its offbeat characters and TV-MA rating are part of why Gunn (DC Studios’ co-hed alongside Peter Safran) sees it as the start of something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yMxAYF"&gt;In a recent interview with &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/james-gunn-creature-commandos-launches-new-dc-universe-1236235324/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Gunn described &lt;em&gt;Creature Commandos &lt;/em&gt;as a “soft intro” that will waste no time establishing how metahumans, monsters, and magic are all core parts of DC Studios’ interconnected world. It took the old DCEU a while and cost it quite a bit of money to introduce some of its more fantastical heroes and villains in ways that felt organic for the big screen. But Gunn noted that part of the reason he felt so bullish about greenlighting &lt;em&gt;Creature Commandos &lt;/em&gt;(which he also wrote) boiled down to the simple fact that, in animation it basically “costs as much to create a battlefield as it does to create a kitchen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BYRzPO"&gt;Gunn also explained that &lt;em&gt;Creature Commandos &lt;/em&gt;felt like a good jumping off point because of its ability to convey to audiences that DC Studios isn’t limiting its output to family-friendly fare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmSdZK"&gt;“We can make something that’s for general audiences, like &lt;em&gt;Superman&lt;/em&gt;,” Gunn said. “We can make something that’s violent and sexual, like [&lt;em&gt;Creature Commandos&lt;/em&gt;]  — which I didn’t think was that violent and sexual; &lt;em&gt;Peacemaker&lt;/em&gt; is both more violent and more sexual — but I want every project to have its own voice. It isn’t about creating a world in which everything is all sex and violence. It’s about creating a world in which we can tell the story about, you know, one type of character in different genres.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sus1om"&gt;DC Studios wouldn’t exactly be the first to test that idea out — Marvel’s been trying to pull it off for the past few years with mixed results — but it’s interesting to hear that Gunn intends for it to be central to the studio’s brand. And after &lt;em&gt;Creature Commandos &lt;/em&gt;premieres tonight on Max, we’ll have a chance to see how the idea actually plays.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OpenAI’s ‘ship-mas’ starts with $200 ChatGPT Pro subscription</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An image of OpenAI’s logo, which looks like a stylized and symmetrical braid." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xa9lqgZt3tBjrbaHx83fc-b1mf0=/0x0:1820x1213/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73768755/lp_logo_3.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: OpenAI&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X4fJu2"&gt;OpenAI is creating a new, more expensive tier for its flagship chatbot ChatGPT, and is bringing its “reasoning” model series out of preview with an update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U8ini0"&gt;The company is releasing the full version of its o1 model (replacing o1-preview), which was initially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24242439/openai-o1-model-reasoning-strawberry-chatgpt"&gt;released as a limited preview&lt;/a&gt; in September (code-named ‘Strawberry’). The new model will be available for ChatGPT Plus and Team users today, while Enterprise and Edu users will have access to it starting next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="q23Gdk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OpenAI’s 12 days of ‘shipmas’ include Sora and new reasoning model","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24312352/openai-sora-o1-reasoning-12-days-shipmas"},{"title":"OpenAI’s 12 days of ‘ship-mas:’ all the new announcements","url":"https://www.theverge.com/24314146/openai-12-days-ship-mas-chatgpt-sora-o1-update"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yoUxxG"&gt;The company is also introducing ChatGPT Pro, a new $200 monthly subscription tier that includes unlimited access to OpenAI o1, GPT-4o, and Advanced Voice mode. It also includes a version of o1, exclusive to Pro users, that uses more compute to provide the best possible answer to the hardest problems (called o1 pro mode). The company will continue to offer a Plus tier for $20 a month that includes early access to new features, access to all the company’s models (except the more powerful o1 version), and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="OpenAI compares the performance of o1 preview, o1, and o1 pro mode." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xebueaxvSTgk67S48VT1RAxoa5c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25775208/GeDdzEQb0AAJL6H.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;OpenAI&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;OpenAI compares the performance of o1 preview, o1, and o1 pro mode.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Bq1hg7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24312352/openai-sora-o1-reasoning-12-days-shipmas"&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt; on the startup’s plans to kick off a “shipmas” period of new features, products, and demos for 12 days, with announcements that’ll include OpenAI’s long-awaited text-to-video AI tool Sora and a new model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RdK08u"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rsFHqpN2bCM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jDkBPG"&gt;The company said that compared to o1-preview, users can expect a faster, more powerful, and more accurate model that is better at coding and math. It can also provide “reasoning” responses to images. And OpenAI promises it’s been trained to be more concise, which should result in faster response times than o1-preview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1733420178.469909"&gt;OpenAI plans to add support for web browsing, file uploads, and more in ChatGPT — though there’s no timeline for these changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zk9YX8"&gt;It also announced a ChatGPT Pro Grant Program that awards 10 grants of ChatGPT Pro to medical researchers at leading institutions, with plans for additional grants across various disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The pope goes electric with first EV popemobile from Mercedes-Benz</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/inlgVPK1NSp8_87Kj7wIFCiZq1c=/188x58:1434x889/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73768679/electric_g_an_papst_1_w1680xh945_cutout.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Mercedes-Benz&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m68BvK"&gt;Pope Francis will be riding in a new, all-electric popemobile after receiving a modified G-Class vehicle from Mercedes-Benz, &lt;a href="https://group.mercedes-benz.com/company/news/electric-popemobile.html"&gt;the company announced Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7GIyYt"&gt;It’s the first electric popemobile from the luxury German automaker, which has been manufacturing vehicles for the Vatican for the last 90 years. For half that time, the popemobile has been based on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/23/24134951/mercedes-g-wagen-electric-eqg-price-specs-photos"&gt;Mercedes’ G-Class wagon&lt;/a&gt;. And now, for the first time, it wil be operating without any pollution, powered by the company’s EV technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wPFI0S"&gt;“With the new Popemobile, Pope Francis is the first pope to be traveling in a fully electric Mercedes-Benz when making public appearances,” CEO Ola Kallenius, who personally delivered the vehicle to Pope Francis this week. “This is a special honor for our company, and I would like to thank His Holiness for his trust. With this Popemobile, we are also sending out a clear call for electromobility and decarbonisation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="npMutQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“With this Popemobile, we are also sending out a clear call for electromobility and decarbonisation”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xtZGED"&gt;The vehicle was modified to utilize four individual motors at each wheel for low-speed travel as the Pope greets visitors in St. Peter’s Square in Vatican City, for example. In the rear, the bench seat was replaced by an elevated, swiveling single seat, so the pope can face his followers from all sides. Two other seats were included behind the pope’s spot for additional passengers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8PRnpi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:12499135"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aRUSzz"&gt;This is the first all-electric popemobile, but it isn’t Pope Francis’ first experience with zero-emission transportation. The Vatican was gifted &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-19508637"&gt;a Renault Kangoo electric van in 2012&lt;/a&gt;, but it wasn’t used for official transport. Pope Francis was driven around in a hydrogen-powered Toyota Mirai in Japan in 2019. And Mercedes-Benz has even made hybrid popemobiles for his holiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S4vO1s"&gt;The possibility of an electric popemobile has been floating around for years. The now-defunct EV startup Fisker even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22526209/fisker-electric-popemobile-papal-transport-ocean-suv-vatican"&gt;proposed building one&lt;/a&gt; after founder Henrik Fisker met briefly with Pope Francis in 2021. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/18/24181228/fisker-bankrupt-chapter-11-ev-ocean-tesla-playbook-musk"&gt;declared bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <updated>2024-12-05T12:04:32-05:00</updated>
    <title>Android 15’s first major update has arrived</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Android logo on a green and blue background" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2Legkf8E1XontiCji1_Yix-7-0o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73768580/acastro_STK112_android_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;More features are coming to Android and Pixel phones starting today.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Xrtmol"&gt;New features are on the way for Android phones and Pixel devices thanks to &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/android/new-android-features-december-2024"&gt;Android 15’s first quarterly platform update&lt;/a&gt;. New features for all eligible Android phones include more descriptive video captions, a Gemini-powered update to the Lookout app, and a Spotify extension for Gemini. Pixel owners are getting a few additional updates, including deeper integration of the Pixel Screenshots app for Pixel 9 phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2hfUWB"&gt;The enhanced captions — or Expressive Captions as Google calls them — add descriptive phrases to try and capture non-spoken moments in dialogue; think [gasp] or [applause]. They’ll appear throughout the system wherever you can access video captions, including social media apps and video messages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot of descriptive captions feature" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qd80hCW53qVc8QxoBCevoqPkKVE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25775079/captions.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Descriptive Captions will capture more of what’s going on in the audio track.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3FVg6t"&gt;Another accessibility-minded update targets Lookout, an app that provides audio descriptions of photos and objects for people with low vision or blindness. Google is bringing its Gemini 1.5 model to the Image Q&amp;amp;A portion of the app to offer better descriptions of photos taken or opened with the app. It’s a continuation of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/16/24158453/google-accessibility-features-android-low-vision"&gt;an effort Google highlighted at I/O&lt;/a&gt; to bring more AI features to Lookout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LKNzbZ"&gt;On the AI front, Google is adding more extensions to Gemini Assistant. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/26/24306815/google-gemini-spotify-extension-rollout-android"&gt;The Spotify extension&lt;/a&gt; allows you to play music from Spotify through Gemini. When Gemini Assistant debuted, it was missing basic features like this one — capabilities that the non-AI Assistant has been offering for the better part of a decade. This is one more step toward feature parity between Gemini and the standard Google Assistant. Gemini will also get access to &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/15235441?hl=en"&gt;the Utilities extension&lt;/a&gt; that’s been rolling out, allowing it to take more actions on your behalf, like making phone calls, sending emails, and changing phone settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OxNrpX"&gt;Other highlights of this update include the ability to create stickers with Emoji Kitchen inside Gboard, share photos with a QR code in Quick Share, and an improved scanning mode for receipts and the like in Google Drive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dFldjd"&gt;Pixel phones get a little more with the December feature drop, with several new features specifically for the Pixel 9 series. The call screening feature gets a potentially useful update with contextual reply suggestions. As the caller speaks to the assistant, you can tap on a response to answer questions without picking up the call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshots app on Pixel 9" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OQLhNv0S5UwTwjNJfPlQX3v060E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25775087/screenshots.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gboard will offer some suggested phrases based on things you add to Screenshots.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="76t0fK"&gt;The Pixel 9’s Screenshots app also gets a few updates. Now, when you use Circle to Search you’ll have an option to save that search in the Screenshots app, which feels like a logical place to keep tabs on your previous queries. You can also turn on a new feature to show suggested search phrases in Gboard based on things you save to Screenshots. And if you’ve added tickets or credit cards to Google Wallet with a screenshot, you’ll be able to save those in the Screenshots app, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eXgut3"&gt;There are a handful of other features in the feature drop for previous-gen Pixel phones, including Identity Check, which will require additional authentication if the phone detects it’s in a new location and sensitive settings are being accessed. It all starts rolling out today for phones on Android 15 and Pixel 6 and newer phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9LU2oj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft and Google are fighting over the future of Xbox</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vector collage of the Xbox logo." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n10Op4p-aGg2XFbVwwkO8LOFkQY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73768539/STK048_XBOX2__C.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dxFGqU"&gt;In October, it became very clear that Microsoft and Google were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24284543/microsoft-google-cloud-war-notepad"&gt;at war again&lt;/a&gt;. After a six-year truce on legal battles ended in 2021, Google has, in recent months, been voicing its concerns about Microsoft’s cloud business. That particular dispute is at the “lobbying regulators” stage, but another disagreement between the two tech giants has slipped into the courts and the public sphere and could sway the very future of Xbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h8KAUP"&gt;Microsoft revealed last week that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/27/24307867/microsoft-google-xbox-game-store-android-purchase-games"&gt;built a new Xbox game store for Android but has been unable to launch it&lt;/a&gt;. The store relies on a key court ruling that would force sweeping changes to Google’s Play Store, opening it up to competition and ending the requirement for apps to use Google Play Billing. Microsoft has been desperate for regulators to act and pave the way for its ambitious Xbox mobile efforts. But after the court ruling offered a brief moment of hope, Google won a temporary administrative stay blocking the changes from coming into effect in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AlKdpl"&gt;Microsoft had planned to sell games directly in its Xbox app for Android and allow customers to immediately stream those games directly to their phones and tablets. These two features combined aren’t...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s Copilot can now browse the web with you using AI ‘Vision’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vector collage of the Microsoft Copilot logo." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bTtm54Ei0elUhZuI2ng4F758rV8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73768532/STK259_MICROSOFT_COPILOT__C.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qeChdU"&gt;Microsoft is starting to test its new Copilot Vision feature today. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24259187/microsoft-copilot-redesign-vision-voice-features-inflection-ai"&gt;Originally unveiled in October&lt;/a&gt;, Copilot Vision allows Microsoft’s AI companion to see what you see on an Edge webpage you’re browsing. You can then ask it questions about the text, images, and content you’re viewing or use it to assist you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yVapvz"&gt;“When you choose to enable Copilot Vision, it sees the page you’re on, it reads along with you, and you can talk through the problem you’re facing together,” says the Copilot team &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmicrosoft-copilot%2Fblog%2F%3Fp%3D3831%26preview%3Dtrue%26_thumbnail_id%3D3834" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “Browsing no longer needs to be a lonely experience with just you and all your tabs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BZZ3uM"&gt;It’s an entirely optional experience, and you have to explicitly grant permission for Copilot Vision to be able to read webpages in Microsoft’s Edge browser. Microsoft originally demonstrated the feature in October by showing how its AI assistant could read images from a collection on OneDrive on the web and even decipher hand-written recipes and offer up cooking tips. You could also use this feature while you’re shopping on the web to find product recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eXDukD"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vSOp4uhgSjw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9D05cN"&gt;Copilot Vision is in limited testing right now, available only to Copilot Pro subscribers through Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmicrosoft-copilot%2Ffor-individuals%2Fcopilot-labs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Copilot Labs program&lt;/a&gt;. It’s clear Microsoft is taking its time on this particular feature as it allows AI models to start reading things you’re seeing onscreen in a web browser, which will naturally generate privacy concerns. I’m sure the security concerns around the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/27/24255721/microsoft-windows-recall-ai-security-improvements-overhaul-uninstall"&gt;Recall feature&lt;/a&gt;, which finally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/22/24302947/microsoft-recall-windows-insider-testing-dev-channel-click-to-do"&gt;entered testing last month&lt;/a&gt;, played a big part in Microsoft treading carefully here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lLcbos"&gt;“As we roll this out, Vision will only interact with a select set of websites to start,” says the Copilot team. “Over time, we will cautiously expand this list. It’s important to stress that Vision does not capture, store or use any data from publishers to train our models. In short, we’re prioritizing copyright, creators, and our user’s privacy and safety — and are putting them all first.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="18pBTP"&gt;A limited number of Copilot Pro subscribers will be able to get access to Copilot Vision today in the US as Microsoft works to listen to feedback and iterate on Copilot Vision. It plans to expand access to more Pro subscribers and websites “over time.”&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z1BA7XIS05yVoHuCP6ZfmFczoGs=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73768528/ss_853e5ffd8d75e9b5aa171e0b332d026866e1b5af.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tekken 8 will be one of the games people can compete in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="x6fASv"&gt;Sony is building on its PlayStation esports efforts with a new series of live tournament events called PlayStation Tournaments: XP.

&lt;p id="X2HFfn"&gt;“Qualifying players from across the globe and the competitive gaming community on PS5 will represent teams Triangle, Circle, Cross, and Square to earn points during the competition and vie for the title of champion, in addition to winning exclusive prizes,” &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/12/05/announcing-playstation-tournaments-xp-a-new-live-studio-event-and-competition-open-to-the-global-ps5-community/"&gt;Sony says in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4Xtfp"&gt;Open qualifiers for &lt;em&gt;Tekken 8&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;EA Sports FC 25&lt;/em&gt; begin today, while qualifiers for &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; start on December 6th and for &lt;em&gt;Astro Bot&lt;/em&gt; on December 13th.

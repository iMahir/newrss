    <title>Why is Apple sleeping on the AirPods Max?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AMGF61jjUAS6tKywTNFiSYGATp4=/93x0:4634x3027/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73590860/Sleeping_on_AirPods_Max.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FWAFUF"&gt;Apple announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/9/24236804/airpods-max-second-gen-price-specs-features-release-date"&gt;new set of AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt; during its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/9/24237601/apple-iphone-16-event-announcements-products"&gt;event&lt;/a&gt; last week, updating them with USB-C and in a new set of colors. The switch to USB-C is a welcome one, to be sure, but Apple changed nothing else about them. And that feels weird, right? What gives?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jCLFRI"&gt;Apple’s high-end luxury headphones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;were impressive&lt;/a&gt; when they launched in 2020. They had all the features of the AirPods Pro and made clever use of the Apple Watch’s digital crown for volume control. They also sounded fantastic — still do, in fact! But the rest of the market didn’t sit still; alternatives from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23067645/sony-wh-1000xm5-noise-canceling-headphones-review"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23920591/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-review"&gt;Bose&lt;/a&gt;, and more recently, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24169086/sonos-ace-headphones-review"&gt;Sonos&lt;/a&gt;, all offer comparable features and sound — most notably, they each compete with the AirPods Max when it comes to noise cancellation (Bose does...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Setapp Mobile’s open beta adds more apps for European iPhone users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Two iPhone models displaying the Setapp Mobile app marketplace." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bLgABdmiBTEZ8z4jW3XjRIsuO4M=/171x70:2370x1536/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73590729/Setapp_Mobile_Focused_Work.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Setapp Mobile is now available in open beta in the EU following invite-only testing.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Setapp&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HddF7i"&gt;The Setapp Mobile alternative app store is now available in open beta for iPhone users in the European Union, featuring &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsetapp.com%2Fapps&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F9%2F17%2F24243950%2Fsetapp-mobile-alternative-ios-app-store-eu-open-beta" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50 different productivity- and lifestyle-focused apps&lt;/a&gt; at launch. While most of these apps, like the &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/travel-planner-guide-tripsy/id1429967544"&gt;Tripsy itinerary planner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mindnode-mind-map-outline/id1218718027"&gt;MindNode mind mapping tool&lt;/a&gt;, are already available on the official iOS App Store, Setapp creator MacPaw says its own platform provides a simplified user experience and a fair, performance-based compensation model for app developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hkxuKT"&gt;Setapp was originally released as an app marketplace for macOS before the company launched a mobile version for iOS users. Setapp Mobile launched as a closed beta in May, shortly after the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/6/23859570/european-union-commission-digital-markets-act-gatekeepers-apple-google-meta-microsoft"&gt;European Union’s Digital Markets Act&lt;/a&gt; forced Apple to start &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/5/24090161/ios-17-4-update-released-dma-eu-third-party-app-store-nfc-payments"&gt;allowing iPhones...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s next Prime Day sale is happening on October 8th and 9th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Illustration of Amazon’s logo on a black, orange, and tan background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wRYdNHncDrnywC3EaS-BNkUkVf4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73590638/acastro_STK103__01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SRI1Z3"&gt;It’s official: Amazon’s second Prime Day event of the year will take place at the beginning of October. The two-day shopping event — which Amazon is calling Prime Big Deal Days for the second year in a row — will begin at 12:01AM PT / 3:01AM ET on Tuesday, October 8th, and run through Wednesday, October 9th, the company &lt;a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/2024/9/prime-big-deal-days-is-back-october-8-9-offering-prime-members-exclusive-access-to-millions-of-early-holiday-deals"&gt;announced on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8314sT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23903764/amazon-october-prime-day-deals-tips-news-guide-2023"&gt;Like last year&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon is running the 48-hour promo in an attempt to jumpstart the holiday shopping season, giving Amazon Prime members another chance outside of Prime Day proper to save on everything from home goods to everyday essentials. Although we typically see the lowest sale prices during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, Amazon’s fall sale often provides solid deals on a range of tech, including...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trump is hawking tokens for a crypto project he still hasn’t explained</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Pqwpta"&gt;After a disclaimer that nothing we’d hear tonight is financial or legal advice, followed by a 40-minute interview with former President Donald Trump — which touched on the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/16/us/trump-shooting-news"&gt;apparent attempt on his life&lt;/a&gt; at a Florida golf course, the border, the “evil forces” conspiring against him, and his granddaughter’s foreign language skills — and subsequent conversations with Trump’s sons and associates, the X Space dedicated to announcing Trump’s “crypto platform” more or less got to the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LgYJqQ"&gt;The goal of World Liberty Financial, Trump’s new decentralized finance project, is to drive “the mass adoption of stablecoins and decentralized finance,” according to a statement &lt;a href="https://x.com/worldlibertyfi/status/1831348468578672817"&gt;posted on its X account&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month. But over the course of the lengthy...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok faces a skeptical panel of judges in its existential fight against the US government</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FagAms"&gt;TikTok — an app used to by 170 million Americans — now has its future resting in the hands of three judges. The company fought for its life during oral arguments on Monday only for the judges to express a great deal of skepticism towards TikTok’s case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CmdDdS"&gt;Attorneys for TikTok and a group of creators suing to block the law popularly known as “the TikTok ban” made their case before a panel of three judges on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. Though the bill seeks a divestment of the app from its Chinese owner ByteDance by a January 19th deadline, the company says the ultimatum is in truth a ban that would stifle the speech of TikTok and its creators, and improperly limit the information Americans are able to receive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d4bgds"&gt;The Department of Justice...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OpenAI is launching an ‘independent’ safety board that can stop its model releases</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vector illustration of the ChatGPT logo." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9wFN_XCEf9H6R3yOiF33uwi28DA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73590150/STK155_OPEN_AI_CVirginia_B.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fWkiDB"&gt;OpenAI is turning its Safety and Security Committee into an independent “Board oversight committee” that has the authority to delay model launches over safety concerns, &lt;a href="https://openai.com/index/update-on-safety-and-security-practices/"&gt;according to an OpenAI blog post&lt;/a&gt;. The committee made the recommendation to make the independent board after a recent 90-day review of OpenAI’s “safety and security-related processes and safeguards.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HKAFqD"&gt;The committee, which is chaired by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/8/24216256/openai-gets-a-new-board-member"&gt;Zico Kolter&lt;/a&gt; and includes Adam D’Angelo, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/13/24178079/openai-board-paul-nakasone-nsa-safety"&gt;Paul Nakasone&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/8/24094885/openai-sam-altman-investigation-board-results"&gt;Nicole Seligman&lt;/a&gt;, will “be briefed by company leadership on safety evaluations for major model releases, and will, along with the full board, exercise oversight over model launches, including having the authority to delay a release until safety concerns are addressed,” OpenAI says....&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>JD Vance doesn’t care that his viral story about Haitian migrants is false</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Graphic photo collage of J. D. Vance." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uwZOgOzeSUWnaKwjjEz8iRB_pMU=/20x0:2021x1334/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73590138/STK204_JD_VANCE_B.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Cath Virginia / The Verge; Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="G35YPD"&gt;JD Vance almost gave the game away. In an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash on Sunday, the Republican vice presidential candidate came close to acknowledging that rumors about Haitian migrants eating cats in Springfield, Ohio, are completely fabricated — and then backtracked, saying the rumors are true after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m50r30"&gt;“If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that’s what I’m going to do,” Vance said. When Bash asked him to clarify whether he created the story, Vance made an about-face, claiming he had heard “firsthand accounts” from his constituents. “I say that we’re creating a story meaning that we’re creating the American media focusing on it,” Vance...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel’s big turnaround plan includes spinning off its chipmaking business</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A blue and black illustration of the Intel logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2WhZR4jbU0V--hd4yg133RhtBLc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73590116/acastro_STK094_01.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jeq4Vl"&gt;Intel is spinning off its chipmaking business as part of its plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/2/24119454/intels-chipmaking-business-7-billion-loss"&gt;reverse billions in losses&lt;/a&gt; and a tumbling stock price. In an &lt;a href="https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1710/a-message-from-intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger-to-employees"&gt;announcement on Monday&lt;/a&gt;, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said the Intel Foundry will become an independent subsidiary with “clearer separation and independence” from Intel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oto8V9"&gt;With the change, the Intel Foundry will have its own operating board and report its financial earnings separately from Intel. Intel will also stop work on the factories it’s building in Poland and Germany for two years “based on anticipated market demand.” The company is still moving forward with its plants in Arizona, Oregon, New Mexico, and Ohio, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Qjo97g"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Intel’s advanced chipmaking process reportedly runs into trouble","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235682/intel-18a-chipmaking-process-broadcom-test"},{"title":"Sony reportedly picked AMD over Intel for the PS6","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/16/24246234/playstation-6-rumor-sony-intel-amd"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Halide’s advanced camera app is now as easy to launch as Apple’s</title>

      &lt;img alt="A close-up of the Halide camera shortcut added to an iPhone’s lock screen. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dtajVLWGs9sy0PNUMa-d0a-lZXI=/0x1:1580x1054/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73590013/halide1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;With iOS 18 and Halide’s recent update, the third-party camera app can now be opened without unlocking an iPhone.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sebastiaan de With&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="maaRLD"&gt;Halide users who’ve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/16/24246090/ios-18-iphone-launch-rcs-homepage-customization-features"&gt;upgraded their iPhones to iOS 18&lt;/a&gt; are now able to quickly access the &lt;a href="https://halide.cam/"&gt;advanced camera app&lt;/a&gt; directly from their phone’s lockscreen without having to unlock it first. Previously, only the native iOS camera app could be conveniently accessed that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UqznGL"&gt;Although Halide &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/3/28/17173232/iphone-x-halide-camera-notch-android"&gt;offers advanced features&lt;/a&gt; like manual shutter speed adjustments and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/14/24220178/halide-camera-app-process-zero-ai"&gt;“Process Zero” option&lt;/a&gt; that delivers images without any AI processing, accessing Apple’s camera app was always faster thanks to its lockscreen shortcut. Halide could be made accessible through a lockscreen widget, but actually getting into the third-party camera app required an iPhone to be unlocked using Face ID, Touch ID, or by entering a passcode.&lt;/p&gt;

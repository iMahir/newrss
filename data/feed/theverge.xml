    <title>Why every company wants a podcast now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Collage of podcaster" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ckVa9LkA7zbPPOYR5rjfm7axtLk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73780268/DCD_1212_Podcast.0.jpg" /&gt;

  &lt;p id="GqNY2Q"&gt;Hello, and welcome to &lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt;! I’m David Pierce, editor-at-large of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. As you may have noticed, we’re dropping some extra episodes in the feed this week. You’ll have Nilay back on Friday and for next week, as we run toward the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZltfB6"&gt;But I’m really excited to be here with you all today because I’m getting to talk about one of my favorite things: podcasts. There’s something strange happening these days in the podcast world — well, actually, there are kind of a lot of things happening. It’s &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/kamala-harris-should-do-joe-rogans-podcast.html"&gt;been a wild year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pDN0AV"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RCywXt"&gt;One thing I’ve noticed recently is the way companies that deal in money have been using podcasts not just as an entertainment medium but also as a weird hybrid of marketing, thought leadership, and networking. It’s something we’ve seen for a few years now with venture capital firms, for example: not only do most of the top-level VC companies have their own podcasts but also people who do podcasts &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; venture capital &lt;a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/ben-gilbert-and-david-rosenthal-founders-of-podcast-acquired-are-raising-an-investment-fund/"&gt;end up going into it&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/harry-stebbings-third-fund-400-news"&gt;meeting and talking to all these folks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SvGKVx"&gt;It’s kind of a weird, complicated web that goes both ways, and it’s not getting any less weird or less complicated once you add stuff like crypto and politics to the mix. So I...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>We asked our staff for their 2025 predictions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1xDe_eMFBtXu_NCEA6dtTmnWQTI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73780267/VRG_TEC_248_Illo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fSajhU"&gt;2024 had some stand-out moments in tech: from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/22/24225972/ai-photo-era-what-is-reality-google-pixel-9"&gt;AI-generated images&lt;/a&gt; to TikTok’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24297454/tiktok-divest-or-ban-dc-circuit-court-appeals"&gt;near ban,&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24316196/pantone-2025-color-of-the-year-mocha-mousse-party"&gt;beigecore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/19/24201864/crowdstrike-outage-explained-microsoft-windows-bsod"&gt;Windows BSOD&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24259284/oura-ring-samsung-galaxy-ring-ultrahuman-ring-air-ringconn-circular-ring-evie-ring-review-wearables"&gt;best smart ring&lt;/a&gt; of them all, and the list goes on. If you want to see the technology that we just couldn’t ignore, check out our video &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/yYjBf94WY2M?si=0Es9N-8MDBPSzduJ"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SXX5RC"&gt;But now, we’re looking toward 2025, and it’s gearing up to be another eventful year. Will we have an actual fulfilling X replacement? Will more health and wellness features be cleared by the FDA on wearables? Will nothing really change but everything will just get more expensive? While we’re not fortune tellers, we can probably take some educated guesses about what’s to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FmGMVt"&gt;We asked &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staff for their biggest predictions on trends we could see in 2025. Take a look, and spoiler alert, some are already coming true.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube is a hit on TVs — and is starting to act like it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="YouTube’s logo with geometric design in the background" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ubayt-UIcdhmZNpmPNForQOusQ4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73780210/acastro_STK092_04.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7qKXs1"&gt;YouTube just released some new stats that show how the service is being consumed on televisions, and the numbers are enormous. Watch time on TV for sports content was up 30 percent year over year; viewers watched more than 400 million hours of podcasts on their TVs every month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FrnPcF"&gt;This is YouTube we’re talking about, though, so of course the numbers are huge. The living room has been YouTube’s fastest-growing platform for years — Alphabet’s chief business officer, Philipp Schindler, said on the company’s &lt;a href="https://abc.xyz/2024-q3-earnings-call/"&gt;most recent earnings call&lt;/a&gt; that watch time is growing across YouTube “with particular strength in Shorts and in the living room.” Even as YouTube continues to dominate basically all facets of the entertainment business, the arrow on your TV still points up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I0psR5"&gt;The trend hasn’t changed in forever, but YouTube has spent the last couple of years finally doing something about it. It launched a way to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/1/23149976/youtube-connect-tv-phone-android-ios"&gt;sync your phone and your TV&lt;/a&gt;, so you can watch a video on the big screen and interact with it on the small one. Earlier this year, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/13/24099533/youtube-tv-app-redesign-comments-shopping"&gt;redesigned the TV interface&lt;/a&gt; to make it easier to find comments, links, and channel pages while you’re watching a video. It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/18/24248206/youtube-season-episode-format-organizing-tv-netflix-binge"&gt;redesigned those channel...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 18.2 is rolling out today, adding ChatGPT integration and more Apple Intelligence tools</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qW3jQ0Ixp2s_A2qAMitkl3EDUhA=/154x0:1807x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73780112/Apple_Intelligence_hero_big.jpg.large_2x.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iOS 18.2 is now available for iPhone, iPad, and Mac.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pqvEp8"&gt;Apple announced the release of iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and macOS Sequoia 15.2, adding many new Apple Intelligence features, including Image Playground, Genmoji, and integration with ChatGPT. According to &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/12/apple-intelligence-now-features-image-playground-genmoji-and-more/"&gt;Apple’s press release&lt;/a&gt;, the updates are available now, but we’re not seeing them on our (non-beta) devices yet. If you get the update, let us know in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KXviWd"&gt;With Image Playground, users can generate an image from a prompt or make something based on one of Apple’s suggestions. However, Image Playground seems to opt for cartoony or stylistic photos instead of photorealistic images, which could prevent potential misuse. Image Playground is available as a standalone app, alongside being integrated into Messages, Freeform, and Keynote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="08tDef"&gt;Genmoji allows users to generate their custom emoji images (&lt;em&gt;Emojipedia &lt;/em&gt;calls them &lt;a href="https://blog.emojipedia.org/hands-on-with-apples-genmoji-ai-emoji-generator-beta/"&gt;“emoji-like stickers”&lt;/a&gt;), which I think could be a big hit in group chats. The Notes app is also getting an “Image Wand” tool that transforms rough drawings into more detailed images, with preset styles available for animation, illustration, and sketch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Simulated MacBook scren, showing an Apple Intelligence window with ChatGPT open next to a text documente ready to make sugestions" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p098AuKYNE8paMvbZQrXMDkC9bM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25784989/Apple_Intelligence_ChatGPT_integration.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;ChatGPT in Apple Intelligence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="r1Ykpq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Siri’s big ChatGPT upgrade is here — for better and worse","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/25/24278716/siri-chat-gpt-ios-18-2-developer-beta-apple-intelligence"},{"title":"Here’s what your iPhone 16 will do with Apple Intelligence — eventually","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24237714/apple-intelligence-generative-ai-features-update-schedule"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lwX7bz"&gt;The ChatGPT integration, which has been one of the most notable Apple Intelligence features in the works, lets you access the OpenAI tool from Siri or when using Apple’s Writing Tools. Features include a compose tool that generates text based on what the user is already writing about and ChatGPT’s text-to-image generation to insert images directly into the document. You don’t need to have a ChatGPT account to use it, but you are able to log in to your account if you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lCN9Bt"&gt;Other new features in iOS 18.2 include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/9/24240094/apple-visual-intelligence-camera-control-iphone-16-ai-camera-control-google-lens"&gt;Visual Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;, the ability to share &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/11/24293654/apple-ios-18-2-share-airtag-locations"&gt;AirTag locations with a link&lt;/a&gt;, daily &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/25/24279430/daily-sudoku-is-coming-to-apple-news-plus"&gt;sudoku puzzles&lt;/a&gt; in Apple News Plus, and more. Localized English language support has also been expanded to Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, and the UK, with support for additional languages like Chinese, French, Portuguese, and Spanish. The expanded language support will roll out throughout 2025, with the initial set launching in April at around the same time Apple Intelligence features &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/28/24281947/apple-intelligence-eu-iphones-april"&gt;are scheduled to start rolling out in the EU&lt;/a&gt;, according to Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hR7xtu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, December 11th:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Noted we’re not seeing the updates available on our devices yet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trump’s pick for FTC chair promises to go after ‘censorship’ from tech companies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A photograph of Andrew Ferguson." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Eo6mhJ_rVhIPbqXbol_Gxd1XnzE=/0x115:3149x2214/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73779473/commissioner_andrew_n_ferguson_res.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: FTC&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q79QdD"&gt;President-elect Donald Trump has selected Andrew Ferguson to be the next chair of the Federal Trade Commission. Ferguson will take over for Lina Khan, who has earned praise &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24199314/jd-vance-donald-trump-vp-antitrust-big-tech-ftc-lina-khan-elizabeth-warren-google"&gt;from Vice President-elect J.D. Vance&lt;/a&gt; for her efforts to fight big tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NG1OFh"&gt;“Andrew has a proven record of standing up to Big Tech censorship, and protecting Freedom of Speech in our Great Country,” Trump says in &lt;a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113631003888738065"&gt;a post on Truth Social&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CNEIdv"&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://punchbowl.news/article/tech/ftc-commissioner-artificial-intelligence-trans-care/"&gt;document obtained by &lt;em&gt;Punchbowl News&lt;/em&gt;’ Ben Brody&lt;/a&gt;, Ferguson’s pitch for the job included intentions to “reverse Lina Khan’s anti-business agenda,” “hold big tech accountable and stop censorship,” and “protect freedom of speech and fight wokeness.” The document also said Ferguson would “fight back against the trans agenda.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDD9ry"&gt;Ferguson was first sworn in as an FTC commissioner in April, but Trump says that Ferguson will begin his role as chair on “day one” of his administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="gAhHdF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Trump names Brendan Carr as his FCC leader","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/17/24299207/brendan-carr-fcc-chairman-trump"},{"title":"David Sacks is Trump’s AI and crypto ‘czar’","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24314514/trump-david-sacks-white-house-ai-crypto-czar"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i7WfMH"&gt;“At the FTC, we will end Big Tech’s vendetta against competition and free speech,” Ferguson &lt;a href="https://x.com/AFergusonFTC/status/1866641731892154546"&gt;writes in a post on X&lt;/a&gt;. “We will make sure that America is the world’s technological leader and the best place for innovators to bring new ideas to life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5O48vr"&gt;Trump &lt;a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113631103871440926"&gt;also announced&lt;/a&gt; that he is nominating Mark Meador, currently a partner at an antitrust law firm, to be an FTC commissioner.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WordPress parent company must stop blocking WP Engine, judge rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vector illustration of the WordPress logo." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NGD3-0zn3n-HyN_aD_Jfv5kbkeQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73779405/STK302_WORDPRESS_C.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Cath Virginia / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dfxvb8"&gt;WP Engine just won a preliminary injunction against WordPress.com parent company Automattic. On Tuesday, a California District Court &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25451524-wp-engine-v-wordpress-injunction/"&gt;judge ordered Automattic to stop blocking&lt;/a&gt; WP Engine’s access to WordPress.org resources and interfering with its plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OQI8Ki"&gt;The preliminary injunction comes after WP Engine, a third-party WordPress hosting service, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/3/24261016/wordpress-wp-engine-lawsuit-automattic-matt-mullenweg"&gt;filed a lawsuit that accused&lt;/a&gt; Automattic and its CEO, Matt Mullenweg, of “multiple forms of immediate irreparable harm.” It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/18/24273448/wp-engine-injunction-matt-mullenweg-wordpress-resources"&gt;later asked the court to stop Mullenweg&lt;/a&gt; from restricting WP Engine’s access to &lt;a href="http://WordPress.org"&gt;WordPress.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ALqxdX"&gt;Mullenweg &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/27/24256361/wordpress-wp-engine-drama-explained-matt-mullenweg"&gt;waged a public campaign against&lt;/a&gt; WP Engine in September, accusing the service of misusing the WordPress trademark and not contributing enough to the WordPress community. After blocking WP Engine from WordPress.org’s servers, Automattic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/12/24268637/wordpress-org-matt-mullenweg-acf-fork-secure-custom-fields-wp-engine"&gt;took control of WP Engine’s ACF Plugin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lSl9XB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"WordPress cofounder asks court to dismiss WP Engine’s lawsuit","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24284537/wordpress-court-dismiss-wp-engine-lawsuit"},{"title":"Matt Mullenweg: ‘WordPress.org just belongs to me’ ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24262232/matt-mullenweg-wordpress-org-wp-engine"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NSsSNm"&gt;Judge Araceli Martínez-Olguín found merit in WP Engine’s claims that Automattic’s actions harmed business relationships, saying Mullenweg’s “conduct is designed to induce breach or disruption.” As for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/23/24277666/wordpress-org-is-not-wordpress"&gt;Automattic’s argument that blamed WP Engine&lt;/a&gt; for relying on WordPress.org to power its business, Judge Martínez-Olguín didn’t find it very compelling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FY8A8q"&gt;“While Defendants characterize WPEngine’s harm as self-imposed because it built its business around a website ‘that it had no contractual right to use...’ Defendants’ role in helping that harm materialize through their recent targeted actions toward WPEngine, and no other competitor, cannot be ignored,” the ruling states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VSSRzU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" align="center"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We are grateful that the court has granted our motion for a preliminary injunction that restores access to and functionality of wordpressdotorg for WP Engine, its customers and its users. &lt;br&gt;This ruling provides much-needed stability for the WordPress ecosystem. We deeply…&lt;/p&gt;— WP Engine (@wpengine) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wpengine/status/1866691174599131634?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 11, 2024&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P0hHKC"&gt;The ruling found the WP Engine showed it will suffer irreparable harm without injunctive relief, while also impacting members of the WordPress community. Under the preliminary injunction, Automattic will have to take down the list of companies it displayed on a site it created to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/7/24290394/wordpress-coms-owner-launched-a-tracker-for-sites-leaving-wp-engine"&gt;track outgoing WP Engine customers&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24266426/the-latest-volley-in-the-wordpress-beef"&gt;remove the checkbox&lt;/a&gt; that asks WordPress users to verify they’re not affiliated with WP Engine when logging in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZEK2R"&gt;WP Engine responded to the &lt;a href="https://x.com/wpengine/status/1866691174599131634?"&gt;ruling in a post on X&lt;/a&gt;, saying “We are grateful that the court has granted our motion for a preliminary injunction that restores access to and functionality of wordpressdotorg for WP Engine, its customers and its users.” Meanwhile, Automattic spokesperson Megan Fox tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; the company looks “forward to prevailing at trial:”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="bJIAyY"&gt;Today’s ruling is a preliminary order designed to maintain the status quo. It was made without the benefit of discovery, our motion to dismiss or the counterclaims we will be filing against WP Engine shortly. We look forward to prevailing at trial as we continue to protect the open source ecosystem during full-fact discovery and a full review of the merits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="qIUDHk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, December 11th: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statements from Automattic and WP Engine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Valve is now selling refurbished Steam Deck OLEDs starting at $439</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A portable handheld gaming PC faces us, colorful screen pointed our way" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pK83kIpOe0hzGVgdkoqSFGbdAJo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73779322/DSCF9137.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kLfLzO"&gt;The Steam Deck OLED, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review"&gt;the best version of Valve’s gaming handheld&lt;/a&gt; with additional battery life, a slight increase to performance, and an eye-popping screen, can now be purchased refurbished for $110 less than it costs brand-new. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="VqyV0D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Steam Deck OLED review: better, not faster","url":"https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5UC3FY"&gt;Valve has just begun &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steamdeckrefurbished/"&gt;selling certified refurbished Steam Deck OLED models&lt;/a&gt; starting at $439 in the US, UK, Canada, and EU. That buys you the 512GB model with a glossy screen, while the 1TB anti-glare model can be had for $519 — less than the $549 you’d pay to get even the 512GB model brand-new. (The 1TB model normally costs $649.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nMZA40"&gt;Like my colleague Jay Peters just told me in Verge Slack, “$439 is a steal for the OLED.” Valve doesn’t currently have stock of refurbished LCD models, though they can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/19/24135233/value-steam-deck-deal-sale"&gt;be as cheap as $279&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RuTQNY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="bluesky-embed" data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:k73nnk2pzsgsj7ehkfuxougu/app.bsky.feed.post/3lcydvixtyc2y" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreidaenuubmh4azd4uo7i23ajt4j6cfoancaqrywtcnok5hmo7kbcdy"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en"&gt;Happy Tuesday! We've officially added Steam Deck OLED to our Valve Certified Refurbished program today, and refurbished Steam Deck OLED units are now available for sale in the US, Canada, UK, and EU. 

Learn more here: store.steampowered.com/sale/steamde...&lt;/p&gt;— &lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:k73nnk2pzsgsj7ehkfuxougu?ref_src=embed"&gt;Steam Deck (@steamdeck.com)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:k73nnk2pzsgsj7ehkfuxougu/post/3lcydvixtyc2y?ref_src=embed"&gt;2024-12-10T23:01:42.824Z&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://embed.bsky.app/static/embed.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UgUJLK"&gt;Like Valve’s refurbished versions of the original LCD model, which has a slightly smaller and slower screen, Valve says it gives each unit “an extensive examination involving over 100 tests at one of Valve’s facilities,” including a battery health check, and Valve says they’ll “meet or even exceed the performance standards” of brand-new units. They each come with a carrying case, refurbished power supply, and one-year warranty — but they may have “minor cosmetic blemishes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bck42X"&gt;Valve introduced the Steam Deck OLED in November 2023, and a year later, it’s still one of the very best ways to play PC games on the go. No other handheld has surpassed its ease of use, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc"&gt;the Asus ROG Ally X&lt;/a&gt; did finally meet or beat it in battery life while offering better performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WCJgYV"&gt;While lots of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22579493/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc"&gt;other Windows handhelds&lt;/a&gt; are on the way, and maybe even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24315098/valve-steam-machines-steamos-steam-deck-vr"&gt;some other intriguing hardware from Valve&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s been pretty clear it won’t release a new Steam Deck soon — not till newer chips let it offer a big leap in performance without sacrificing battery life. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube’s AI-powered dubbing is now available to many more creators </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Illustration of a YouTube logo with geometric background" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m7FnufI4KCL9MPr3ADkiRWxdFTU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73779277/acastro_STK092_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QWcFdv"&gt;YouTube &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/auto-dubbing-on-youtube/"&gt;says it has expanded&lt;/a&gt; its AI-powered auto-dubbing to “hundreds of thousands of channels” in the YouTube Partner Program that are “focused on knowledge and information.” YouTube says it will bring the feature to “other types of content soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U6qm4o"&gt;What the dubs consist of depends on the language used in the original video. If it was in English to start, it’ll be translated into French, German, Hindi, Italian, Spanish, Indonesian, Japanese, and Portuguese. If the starting video was made in one of those languages, YouTube will only produce an English dub. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t8q245"&gt;For channels that have it, AI-dubbed videos are created automatically when the original video is uploaded, but creators can opt to preview them before they’re published. YouTube also provides options to unpublish or delete dubs, according to a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/15569972"&gt;support document for the feature&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HXONqm"&gt;The dubs aren’t very natural-sounding now, but YouTube promises they’ll get better at emulating “tone, emotion, and even the ambiance of the surroundings” with later updates. Here’s an English dub example of a French video about making potatoes au gratin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PgBwhs"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SNUvDiCAEkY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZsNRH9"&gt;However, YouTube cautions that “this technology is still pretty new, and it won’t always be perfect.” The company says it’s “working hard to make it as accurate as possible, but there might be times when the translation isn’t quite right or the dubbed voice doesn’t accurately represent the original speaker.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EEoube"&gt;YouTube initially announced its tests of auto-dubbing with “hundreds” of creators in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/22/23769881/youtube-ai-dubbing-aloud"&gt;June 2023&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

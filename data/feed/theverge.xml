    <title>Elmo needs a new streaming home after Max drops Sesame Street</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="big bird, Elmo, cookie monster and other characters together in a yellow background" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FSWWdybnXXfqJvwcvJcrTvIB9y8=/0x0:1574x1049/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73785158/9b073e6d4693f2b139f9fb526d554a14d43dcb55.jpg.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Max&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TZgVFq"&gt;After next season, Max will no longer be the place to watch new episodes of beloved children's show &lt;em&gt;Sesame Street &lt;/em&gt;first, &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/hbo-cancels-sesame-street-licensing-deal-show-streaming-service-1235985075/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports. Platform owner Warner Bros. Discovery has decided not to renew its HBO and Max deal with producer Sesame Workshop, which means new episodes of the series will need to find a new home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iqj6Hs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sesame Street&lt;/em&gt; is one of several shows for children on Max, but I find that other streaming services such as Disney Plus, Netflix, and even YouTube Kids have more content for parents to play for kids. According to &lt;em&gt;THR&lt;/em&gt;, ending its deal for new  &lt;em&gt;Sesame Street&lt;/em&gt; episodes is part of a change in strategy to focus on adult and broader family content, such as the upcoming Harry Potter series &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/23/24080947/the-harry-potter-tv-series-is-a-couple-more-years-away"&gt;for 2026&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="55a2E6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Warner Bros. Discovery restructures to split up streaming and cable businesses","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24319520/warner-bros-discovery-split-streaming-cable-businesses"},{"title":"Max raises prices across its ad-free plans","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/4/24171193/max-price-raise-ad-free-plans-hbo"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PwvXZz"&gt;The company is still going to keep current episodes streaming through 2027. Last year, Sesame Workshop executive Kay Wilson Stalling told &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt; that the upcoming 56th season (season 55 will be available on Max starting next month) would be a “reimagining” of the show with longer narrative segments and more sophisticated stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHcmF3"&gt;Sesame Street &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/13/9148163/sesame-street-hbo-five-seasons"&gt;moved over to HBO in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, where new episodes aired before eventually making their way to PBS for free viewing months later. At the time, you could watch the show on demand via the long-gone HBO Go and HBO Now apps, and when Max launched, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/3/20897104/sesame-street-streaming-hbo-max-warnermedia-pbs-disney-apple-streaming-wars"&gt;picked up the timed-exclusive&lt;/a&gt; streaming deal. But a few years removed from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287816/hbo-max-kids-content-shows-competitors"&gt;investing heavily in kids’ programming&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/12/23673475/warner-bros-discovery-max-new-name-hbo"&gt;dropping the “HBO” from Max&lt;/a&gt; to become more welcoming as a service parents are comfortable with their kids using, now Warner Bros. Discovery is moving forward with a very different plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C7zcx3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MBmkzN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OpenAI just dropped new Elon Musk receipts: ‘You can’t sue your way to AGI’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Elon Musk and Sam Altman overlayed in a collage." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fHJN7RTGoDKaCpVSAfzvyu505N4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73785151/247386_Elon_Musk_Open_AI_CVirginia.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Cath Virginia / The Verge, Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y8vAT0"&gt;The lawsuit between Elon Musk and OpenAI is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; heating up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wWdxDB"&gt;OpenAI just dropped&lt;a href="https://openai.com/index/elon-musk-wanted-an-openai-for-profit/"&gt; a new blog post&lt;/a&gt; defending itself against Musk that outlines some new text messages between cofounders Ilya Sutskever, Greg Brockman, Sam Altman, Elon Musk, and former board member Shivon Zilis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7d6TZJ"&gt;“You can’t sue your way to AGI,” the OpenAI blog post reads, referring to artificial general intelligence, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24313130/sam-altman-openai-agi-lower-the-bar"&gt;which Altman has promised soon&lt;/a&gt;. “We have great respect for Elon’s accomplishments and gratitude for his early contributions to OpenAl, but he should be competing in the marketplace rather than the courtroom. It is critical for the U.S. to remain the global leader in Al. Our mission is to ensure AGI benefits all of humanity, and we have been and will remain a mission-driven organization. We hope Elon shares that goal, and will uphold the values of innovation and free market competition that have driven his own success.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ua0SuF"&gt;The blog highlights Musk’s attempts to maneuver into the CEO position and gain majority control of the company (though it adds that on one call Musk said he “didn’t care about equity” but “just needed to accumulate $80B for a city on Mars”). Musk also proposed that OpenAI spin into Tesla, which has &lt;a href="https://openai.com/index/openai-elon-musk/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;been previously revealed&lt;/a&gt;. When the negotiations fell apart because OpenAI’s cofounders rejected his proposal (Brockman and Sutskever admitted they had fears of a power struggle), Musk resigned from the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hNt3EV"&gt;The blog said that after Musk resigned, he hosted a goodbye all-hands with the team where he encouraged them to “pursue the path we saw to raising billions per year” and that “he would pursue advanced Al research at Tesla, which was the only vehicle he believed could obtain this level of funding.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IinZTq"&gt;Later, around the time Musk was working to acquire Twitter, he texted Altman that he was “disturbed” to see the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-valued-at-nearly-20-billion-in-advanced-talks-with-microsoft-for-more-funding?rc=mshudk"&gt;new $20 billion valuation&lt;/a&gt;. “De facto. I provided almost all the seed, A and most of B round funding,” he wrote, according to the disclosed texts. “This is a bait and switch.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GkYTjw"&gt;A few months after that interaction, Musk started an OpenAI competitor, xAI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xAqE2h"&gt;Some of the messages published by OpenAI were previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/18/24299787/elon-musk-openai-lawsuit-sam-altman-xai-google-deepmind"&gt;outlined in court filings&lt;/a&gt; that Musk made in his ongoing suit against OpenAI and its partner Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XFLEvu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leak: Lenovo’s larger Legion handheld adds OLED and keeps the detachable mouse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A gaming tablet with a kickstand and two detachable controllers alongside, one of which is oriented vertically on a table as a mouse" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JRVG53FUIY4SWjlIo4OFN6dIZfw=/0x10:720x490/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73785140/s9yFGuCS.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A leaked image of the new Lenovo Legion Go.&lt;/em&gt; | Image via &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2Bh5r2"&gt;Earlier today, &lt;a href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1867499994090963132"&gt;Evan Blass revealed&lt;/a&gt; an unannounced Lenovo Legion Go S handheld gaming PC with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320477/lenovo-legion-go-s-steamos-handheld-gaming-pc-rumors"&gt;an &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; intriguing twist&lt;/a&gt;: a Steam button that suggests it could be the first third-party SteamOS handheld, and thus the first true competitor to the Steam Deck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4JtWWP"&gt;But that handheld gaming PC apparently won’t be alone: Blass just provided &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; with these images of a new, larger Lenovo Legion Go as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pl2C6d"&gt;As you can see, this Legion Go plans to keep the detachable Joy-Con like gamepads and kickstand that were the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24088011/lenovo-legion-go-review"&gt;single most distinctive features of the original&lt;/a&gt; — and they’ll keep the “FPS mode” where you can plop one of those controllers on a disc-shaped skate and use it like a vertical mouse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RScv2CocDSaeEbinJbfdDQDkIQQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25788819/1N4rErHX.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image via &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WMZjwT"&gt;But one model may also swap out the Legion Go’s 8.8-inch IPS LCD screen for one with an OLED panel at the same size, according to the original filenames of these images. That should mean improved colors and deeper blacks, and potentially improved response times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uP9Re5"&gt;We don’t have any specs or marketing claims yet, though, like the all-important battery life size. Nor have we gotten a glimpse of the ports on this system. There is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/6/24237735/amd-z2-extreme-gaming-handheld-pc-chip"&gt;an AMD Z2 Extreme chip coming&lt;/a&gt; that could likely be the core of this handheld, but we don’t yet know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/obx0UAw1mJ7-X-s33GmUVtdfmTw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25788821/Ga2IkcmN.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image via &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YM6gJH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24088011/lenovo-legion-go-review"&gt;In my review of the original Legion Go&lt;/a&gt;, I was mixed on the detachable controllers with their sharp-ish edges and loads of extra mouse buttons that made them awkward to hold. These one seem to be far more smoothly sculpted, though, with revised mouse buttons on the right detachable pad, and a cover you can place over the mounting rail so the copper charging pins don’t poke your palm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FqIWEa"&gt;The images we’ve seen do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; feature a Steam button, so it’s quite likely Lenovo is still hedging its bets with Windows in addition to SteamOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wVjuNa"&gt;But we &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; much more confident in our prediction that the smaller Lenovo Legion Go S will be a SteamOS handheld. Blass showed me filenames that suggest the S will be “powered by” Steam, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24315098/valve-steam-machines-steamos-steam-deck-vr#:~:text=Valve%20now%20has%20an%20explicit%20label%20for%20third%20parties%20to%20create%20%E2%80%9CPowered%20by%20SteamOS%E2%80%9D%20devices"&gt;mirroring Valve’s new branding guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for “Powered by SteamOS” devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="llLt7J"&gt;Valve defines “Powered by SteamOS” as “hardware running the SteamOS operating system, implemented in close collaboration with Valve.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="klmejy"&gt;We’ve reached out to Valve and Lenovo to hopefully learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trump is probably going to kill the crash reporting rule that made Tesla look bad</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Orange County Register Archive" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g1jzACnO6JFI3fTq73vziHbA90s=/207x0:4082x2583/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73784972/1032138698.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jeff Gritchen/Digital First Media/Orange County Register via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aa0qSp"&gt;Donald Trump’s transition team is taking aim at a Biden-era rule requiring automakers and tech companies to report crashes that involve fully or partially autonomous vehicles, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/trump-transition-recommends-scrapping-car-crash-reporting-requirement-opposed-by-2024-12-13/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Scrapping the crash reporting rule would greatly benefit Tesla, which to date, has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/26/24141361/tesla-autopilot-fsd-nhtsa-investigation-report-crash-death"&gt;reported the most number of crashes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T7zID4"&gt;In 2021, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555666/nhtsa-autonomous-vehicle-crash-report-data"&gt;issued a standing general order&lt;/a&gt; (SGO) requiring automakers and tech companies to report crashes involving autonomous vehicles as well as Level 2 driver-assist systems found in millions of vehicles on the road today. Companies are now required to document collisions when an automated driving system was in use within 30 seconds of impact and report those incidents to the government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="JUL1uX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Automakers plead with Trump: don’t kill the EV tax credit","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/21/24302592/trump-ev-tax-credit-auto-alliance-av-framework"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TG3TNo"&gt;The idea was to create more transparency around the deployment of a new technology that purports to improve safety but has also been tied to a number of deadly incidents. Regulators argued that more data was needed to determine whether these new systems were making roads safer or simply making driving more convenient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gt0mlC"&gt;Tesla, in particular, came under scrutiny. The company’s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features, which are considered Level 2 systems that require drivers to pay attention, are both covered under the rule. Since it was implemented, Tesla has reported over 1,500 crashes to the federal government, &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; says. An analysis of the crash data shows Tesla accounted for 40 out of 45 fatal crashes reported to NHTSA through October of this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W1oq8Y"&gt;Tesla’s numbers were much higher than other companies, most likely due to the fact that it sells more vehicles equipped with Level 2 systems than its rivals and collects more data. But it also resulted in a huge headache for the company. NHTSA has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/26/24141403/tesla-autopilot-nhtsa-investigation-recall-software-fix"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/18/24273418/nhtsa-tesla-full-self-driving-investigation-crashes"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24151077/tesla-autopilot-nhtsa-recall-crash-data-request"&gt;investigations&lt;/a&gt; into Tesla’s driver-assist technology, most of which centered on crashes reported under the SGO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1xfrb7"&gt;Several sources close to Tesla told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; that the company “despises” the standing general order and concluded that it would need a change in administration in order to get rid of it. Tesla CEO Elon Musk was one of Trump’s most vocal defenders, spending at least $277 million of his own money to back his campaign. Musk has since been appointed to head the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301975/elon-musk-vivek-ramaswamy-doge-plan"&gt;Department of Government Efficiency&lt;/a&gt; with the goal of cutting government spending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7CY07Q"&gt;Trump is also considering &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24296723/tesla-reportedly-supports-canceling-the-7500-ev-tax-credit"&gt;getting rid of other policies opposed by Tesla&lt;/a&gt;, including generous subsidies for EV companies. Musk believes Tesla is better positioned to weather a subsidy-free environment than other automakers due to its scale and maturity. Musk is also lobbying Trump to ease restrictions on fully autonomous vehicles in advance of Tesla’s plans to produce its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/10/24265530/tesla-robotaxi-elon-musk-features-range-price-release-date"&gt;robotaxi in 2026&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EVgo nabs $1.25 billion loan as Biden races to approve more EV spending</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="EVGO" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YBuUJSnoEqrnuNTKTA4zLZfs0v8=/0x0:5196x3464/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73784921/2183269024.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="USIAsE"&gt;The US Department of Energy &lt;a href="https://www.energy.gov/lpo/articles/doe-announces-125-billion-loan-evgo-expand-nationwide-public-fast-charging"&gt;announced a $1.25 billion loan&lt;/a&gt; to electric vehicle charging company EVgo as the Biden administration races to finalize its spending on EVs before Donald Trump takes office. The money will fund EVgo’s plans to install approximately 7,500 chargers at roughly 1,100 charging stations across the US over the next five years, with a particular focus on fast-charging 350kW stalls that can charge two vehicles simultaneously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FYoQQH"&gt;But more importantly, it shows how President Joe Biden is intent on doling out as much money for EV projects as he can before leaving office. Trump has promised to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289494/trump-election-electric-vehicle-tax-credit-tesla-elon-musk"&gt;reverse or cancel much of the spending by Biden on EVs&lt;/a&gt; once he assumes office. He has said he will kill the $7,500 tax credit for new EV purchases and wipe out the rest of the spending from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) on EV charging infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="y2OKLi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;President Joe Biden is intent on doling out as much money for EV projects as he can before leaving office&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XiuZGd"&gt;With a little more than a month left in office, Biden’s Energy Department has been furiously approving EV-related loans. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24312175/stellantis-samsung-doe-atvm-ev-battery-loan"&gt;Stellantis and Samsung&lt;/a&gt; were given preliminary approval for $7.54 billion for a battery factory in Indiana, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/26/24306402/rivian-doe-atvm-loan-georgia-ev-factory-trump"&gt;Rivian will receive $6.6 billion&lt;/a&gt; for an EV plant in Georgia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4LJuHN"&gt;The loans are also intended to be job creators, the administration says. For example, EVgo said its expansion project will support the creation of 180 external construction jobs and over 550 maintenance and support jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sQOuRc"&gt;EVgo, which is based in Los Angeles, is working with General Motors on the installation of thousands of EV chargers across the country. The companies recently celebrated the activation of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24313038/gm-and-evgo-now-have-over-2000-ev-charging-stalls-and-counting"&gt;their 2,000th charging stall&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GShDVI"&gt;The fragmented and frustrating nature of our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/6/24214581/electric-vehicle-charging-reliability-study-chargehelp"&gt;current EV charging landscape&lt;/a&gt; has been widely — and correctly — cited as one of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23758095/electric-vehicle-charging-news-nacs-ccs-tesla-supercharger-us-infrastructure"&gt;the most significant barriers to EV adoption&lt;/a&gt;. Owners frequently complain about unreliable charging or broken equipment as one of the most frustrating things about driving an EV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xj19DT"&gt;After his election, Biden vowed to build 500,000 chargers by 2030 as a way to spur more EV sales, including $7.5 billion for charging expansion in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill. While the first few years of funding were rather sluggish, recent updates have shown that things are finally picking up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qPmLCq"&gt;In its release, the DOE said, “there are currently more than 204,000 publicly available charging ports, with nearly 38,000 new public chargers already having been added this year and nearly 1,000 new public chargers being added every week thanks to a combination of direct federal funding, federal tax incentives, state and local funding, and private investment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lBIwnF"&gt;That includes both Level 2 chargers and DC fast chargers. That’s roughly double the number of ports in operation at the outset of 2021 when Biden first took office.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Anker’s new 5K MagSafe battery is slimmer and faster</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Anker’s MagGo Power Bank in blue attached to an iPhone and white on its own." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b2l68l4PGgfB43vRAFTQn0wxUUo=/0x0:2712x1808/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73784871/anker_maggo1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anker’s slim MagSafe power bank now supports Qi2 wireless charging speeds.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Anker&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mrJny5"&gt;Anker has released its &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1631013/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FHRWY2LL%2FA%2Fanker-maggo-power-bank-5k-slim-white" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;thinnest MagSafe-compatible power bank&lt;/a&gt;, measuring about a third of an inch thick. It’s only got a 5,000mAh battery inside, so you probably won’t get two full iPhone charges with it, but Anker has updated it with 15W Qi2 wireless charging speeds so your phone can charge faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zVbM0i"&gt;It’s currently available exclusively through Apple’s online and retail stores for $49.95 in either blue or white, making it $10 more expensive than the older &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anker.com%2Fproducts%2Fa1610%3Fref%3Dselect_your_product%26variant%3D42116102979734&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F12%2F13%2F24320423%2Fanker-apple-magsafe-maggo-power-bank-qi2-battery" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MagGo 621 Magnetic Battery&lt;/a&gt; that Anker still sells through its website. For comparison, the older version of the 5K battery is 0.45-inches thick and only supports wireless charging speeds up to 7.5W.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="GRzHrL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best MagSafe and Qi2 chargers for your iPhone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/23505846/best-magsafe-magnetic-chargers-apple-iphone"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XoPAGi"&gt;The bidirectional USB-C port on the bottom of the power bank can charge it or other devices at 20W. However, when both power outputs are in use, wireless charging speeds drop to 5W, while the USB-C port slows to 12W. The battery is compatible with iPhone models &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/2/24119203/apple-iphone-12-qi2-support-ios-update"&gt;going back to the iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;, but it will also work with Android devices that fully support the Qi2 specifications.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Game-like ‘task scams’ stole more than $220 million in six months</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Graphic photo collage of a wallet." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s9d44tL-2FWFGlQRaLlsV6tNTjo=/20x0:2021x1334/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73784792/STK417_MONEY_CVIRGINIA_C.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Cath Virginia / The Verge; Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KbJHUO"&gt;The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/12/new-ftc-data-show-skyrocketing-consumer-reports-about-game-online-job-scams"&gt;warning Americans about “game-like online job scams”&lt;/a&gt; that get people to perform tasks with the promise of a continuous income stream — only to be duped into giving money to the scammer. The FTC says in the first six months of this year, these “task scams” have raked in over $220 million from victims, often in the form of cryptocurrency. It’s accounted for about 40 percent of all scam reports in 2024. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J5Lh8s"&gt;There were 20,000 reports of task scams in the first half of 2024, a sharp increase from only 5,000 from 2020-2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="zigEhW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The cruel temptation of the job offer scam","url":"https://www.theverge.com/23376976/job-offer-scam-linkedin-bad-check-security-suspicion"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZFIWc4"&gt;These scams often start with a WhatsApp or text message to a victim asking them to do tasks about “app optimization” or “product boosting.” Sometimes, the scammers initially pay small amounts of money to seem trustworthy. Afterward, they convince victims to pay into some tasks with the promise of a larger payout, and then the scammers run away with the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Task scam reports bar graphs, by year: 0 in 2020, less than 500 in 2021, 1,000 in 2022, 5,000 in 2023, 20,000 in 2024 through June." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dvy-Uh5gt8QeXWHzvCLjA8Lfflg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25788524/Screenshot_2024_12_13_at_11.33.35_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: FTC&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PE31lX"&gt;These are the three tips the FTC listed to avoid getting scammed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="dKWjkZ"&gt;Ignore generic and unexpected texts or WhatsApp messages about jobs. Real employers will never contact you that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PoV0Ow"&gt;Never pay anyone to get paid. Someone telling you to pay money to get the money you have supposedly earned is a sure sign of a scam. No legit business would ever do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z60KPZ"&gt;Don’t trust anyone who says they’ll pay you to rate or “like” things online. That’s illegal and no honest company will do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Lenovo might soon announce a SteamOS handheld</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Lenovo Legion Go S" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZrBKT9JJFUJimOINTaCTb8lZA_o=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73784760/lenovolegiongos.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Evan Blass (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1867499994090963132" target="_blank"&gt;X&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HNIOy6"&gt;Valve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219469/valve-steamos-asus-rog-ally-steady-progress-dual-boot"&gt;revealed earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; that it will support the ROG Ally handheld with its Steam Deck operating system, and now it looks like Lenovo will soon have its own SteamOS handheld, too. &lt;a href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1867499994090963132"&gt;Evan Blass has posted&lt;/a&gt; images of an unannounced Lenovo Legion Go S on X today, revealing black and white variants of a handheld gaming PC. The interesting part? The black one has a Steam button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t5Ek7K"&gt;While the low resolution images don’t immediately scream SteamOS, if you look closely you’ll notice a Steam logo is visible on a button to the left of the display. Interestingly, the white model doesn’t have the same Steam button — which could indicate Lenovo is preparing Windows- and SteamOS-powered models of its Legion Go S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nSVS1mSajyzATb-P0FtfFuMEuRo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25788502/lenovolegiongos2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Evan Blass (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1867499994090963132" target="_blank"&gt;X&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can clearly see a Steam logo on the button to the left of the display.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9BoMdr"&gt;PC makers like Lenovo, Asus, and MSI have all opted for Windows-based handhelds so far, but as consumer patience with Windows on tiny screens wears thin and Microsoft’s progress in improving the experience is slow, it seems like OEMs are looking for a better alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jnh8ly"&gt;Lenovo’s potential entry into a SteamOS handheld comes just days after Valve quietly updated a document with new branding guidelines that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24315098/valve-steam-machines-steamos-steam-deck-vr"&gt;include “Powered by SteamOS” hardware&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the surest sign yet that Valve is working with more third-party hardware manufacturers, beyond Asus, to certify devices with SteamOS. With CES 2025 just a few weeks away, we could be about to witness a lot more SteamOS-powered hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UN28eQ"&gt;Valve has been here before, though. At CES in 2013, it tried to tempt PC manufacturers to sign up to its Steam Machines initiative, but it didn’t get far enough with developers to convince them to port games to Linux to make these machines successful. There’s reason to believe this time things will be very different, thanks to Proton. The Steam Deck uses the Proton software compatibility layer and has already proved that many Windows games can even run better on Linux as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8RlMQM"&gt;As my colleague Sean Hollister &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24315098/valve-steam-machines-steamos-steam-deck-vr"&gt;wrote earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;: “it’s just as intriguing an idea &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/16/3652756/valve-big-picture-mode-steam-os-linux-game-console"&gt;as it was 12 years ago&lt;/a&gt; when Gabe Newell &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/8/3852144/gabe-newell-interview-steam-box-future-of-gaming"&gt;explained the initial vision to us&lt;/a&gt;, and this time, there’s a far better chance it’ll work.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s NotebookLM AI podcast hosts can now talk to you, too  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of Google’s multicolor “G” logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A7MocGwsGzQ7kBVrAabktih_ChM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73784598/STK093_Google_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration: The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3DBpRp"&gt;Google’s NotebookLM and its podcast-like Audio Overviews have been a surprise hit this year, and today Google company is starting to roll out a big new feature: the ability to actually talk with the AI “hosts” of the overviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WzzqFW"&gt;When the feature is available to you, you can try it out with new Audio Overviews. (It won’t work with old ones.) Here’s how, &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/google-labs/notebooklm-new-features-december-2024/"&gt;according to a blog post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Xo3rtx"&gt;Create a new Audio Overview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KVWkxE"&gt;Tap the new Interactive mode (BETA) button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ipusmC"&gt;While listening, tap “Join.” A host will call on you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IC7isI"&gt;Ask your question. The hosts will respond with a personalized answer based on your sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGbWlq"&gt;After answering, they’ll resume the original Audio Overview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="32XpIu"&gt;The ability to actually talk with NotebookLM seems like a potentially useful way to learn more about what you’ve collected in the app. But Google cautions that it’s an “experimental feature” and that “hosts may also pause awkwardly before responding or occasionally introduce inaccuracies,” so it may not be a totally polished experience to start. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rcczNm"&gt;In addition to the interactive Audio Overviews, Google is introducing a new interface for NotebookLM that organizes things into three areas: a “sources” panel for your information, a “chat” panel to talk with an AI chatbot about the sources, and a “studio” panel that lets you make things like Audio Overviews and Study Guides. I think it looks nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A GIF showing NotebookLM’s new interface." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9eoQUazpa-jo9hJCpMqHJcTZNg8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25787564/NotebookLM.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TirK79"&gt;Google is announcing a NotebookLM subscription, too: NotebookLM Plus. The subscription will give you “five times more Audio Overviews, notebooks, and sources per notebook,” let you “customize the style and tone of your notebook responses,” let you make shared team notebooks, and will offer “additional privacy and security,” Google says. The subscription is available today for businesses, schools and universities, and organizations and enterprise customers. It will be added to Google One AI Premium in “early 2025.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6e0n6F"&gt;Google is also launching “Agentspace,” a platform for custom AI agents for enterprises. “Agentspace can provide conversational assistance, answer complex questions, make proactive suggestions and take actions based on your company’s unique information,” Google says. It also has connectors for apps like Microsoft SharePoint, Jira, and ServiceNow.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cruise hit with $1.5 million fine for failing to report robotaxi crash involving pedestrian</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GbWqk1"&gt;Cruise’s failure to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/24/23930629/california-dmv-suspends-cruise-robotaxi-permit-safety"&gt;disclose the fact that a pedestrian was seriously injured&lt;/a&gt; by one of its driverless vehicles in San Francisco last year has now resulted in a $1.5 million fine to the federal government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qKe96C"&gt;Last October, a Cruise vehicle hit a pedestrian and then drug her 20 feet after she was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/3/23901233/cruise-crash-hit-run-pedestrian-injury-sf-robotaxi"&gt;initially struck by a human driver in a hit-and-run incident&lt;/a&gt;. In the aftermath, Cruise disclosed that its vehicle had struck a pedestrian, but omitted details about the victim being dragged.  As a result, the California DMV pulled the GM-backed company’s permit to operate self-driving cars in the state, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration launched an investigation into the incident. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PrjeHu"&gt;Today, NHTSA announced the $1.5 million...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hurricane Helene barreled through a crucial chip mining area in North Carolina </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oCxX05"&gt;Hurricane Helene brought historic rainfall and flooding to western North Carolina last week, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-north-carolina-asheville-f02869c7d01e68f2d7f0553abb82252f"&gt;leaving dozens dead and catastrophic damage&lt;/a&gt; stretching across the state’s mountain towns. The devastation also reached the small town of Spruce Pine, which is home to the purest quartz on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q8dWKr"&gt;Spruce Pine’s high-quality quartz is an essential ingredient in the chipmaking process, as &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/bespoke/made-on-earth/how-the-chip-changed-everything/"&gt;it’s the only naturally occurring source&lt;/a&gt; of the ultrapure mineral. The quartz mined from this area is used as a crucible to melt polysilicon, which is then used to produce silicon wafers — the base of a semiconductor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="26gUVI"&gt;Even though it’s possible to produce pure silicon from the quartz found in abundance elsewhere in the world, it takes a considerable amount of time...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>California governor signs one driverless vehicle bill, vetoes two others</title>

  &lt;p id="PayHu2"&gt;Amid the hullabaloo around &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/29/24232172/california-ai-safety-bill-1047-vetoed-gavin-newsom"&gt;California Gavin Newsom vetoing a closely watched artificial intelligence bill&lt;/a&gt;, three other bills that would regulate a different type of AI — autonomous vehicles — landed on his desk with less fanfare. The governor signed one and vetoed two others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iTgKjp"&gt;For the second time in two years, Newsom vetoed legislation (AB 2286) that would have banned autonomous trucks from operating on public roads. He also vetoed another (AB 3061) that would set up new data reporting requirements for AV companies. And he signed a third bill into law (AB 1777) that would create guidelines for when an autonomous vehicle gets in a crash or encounters first responders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oNoCcf"&gt;Labor groups have been pushing the state legislature to adopt an AV...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reddit is making sitewide protests basically impossible</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An image showing the Reddit logo on a red and white background" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oLis6xIvYqPUW5Eg6Fe04N2niU4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73621714/STK115_Reddit_04.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ujn79V"&gt;Reddit is giving its staff a lot more power over the communities on its platform. Starting today, Reddit moderators will not be able to change if their subreddit is public or private without first submitting a request to a Reddit admin. The policy applies to adjusting all &lt;a href="https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/15484546290068-Community-settings#h_01H15ATSVVNG35T5X4Y0G3JNKJ"&gt;community types&lt;/a&gt;, meaning moderators will have to request to make a switch from safe for work to not safe for work, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZfGDFU"&gt;By requiring admin approval for the changes, Reddit is taking away a lever many communities used to protest the company’s API pricing changes last year. By going private, the community becomes inaccessible to the public, making the platform less usable for the average visitor. And that’s part of the reason behind the change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZEmot2"&gt;“The ability to instantly...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon is launching its own Shark Tank where winners get to be Amazon sellers</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Screenshot: YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jT4xIl"&gt;Amazon Prime has released a trailer for its spin on the &lt;em&gt;Shark Tank&lt;/em&gt; concept: &lt;a href="https://press.amazonmgmstudios.com/us/en/original-series/buy-it-now/1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Buy It Now&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;a JB Smoove-hosted show where people put their product ideas before a panel of investors. The twist is that they’ll also be judged by “The 100,” which Amazon says is an audience of “potential customers” (otherwise known as “people”), and if their products are picked, Amazon will sell them in a special section of the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NyAi8C"&gt;The company announced the show earlier this year but has now &lt;a href="https://press.amazonmgmstudios.com/us/en/press-release/90-seconds-to-success-prime-video-releases-trailer"&gt;released a trailer&lt;/a&gt; showing what it will look like. Contestants pitch their ideas to the audience. If the crowd votes for them, then the panelists pick which ones will show up on Amazon’s Buy It Now Store: a new storefront launching alongside the show that viewers can reach...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="VoU3CB"&gt;Verizon is experiencing a huge outage affecting its mobile services across the country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="FmBk4n"&gt;There are also more than 100,000 user reports of problems &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/verizon/"&gt;on Downdetector&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Tesla starts pushing Full Self-Driving access for some Cybertrucks</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="Tesla Cybertruck outside" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qk8TdGEph87VFaacdri47UEcv64=/0x168:4032x2856/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73621478/IMG_0618.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0Ck1AL"&gt;Some Tesla Cybertruck owners are starting to get Full Self-Driving (FSD) access on their vehicles. The company’s polarizing electric pickup truck has lacked the driver-assistance software feature since its launch in November 2023. Now, members of the &lt;a href="https://www.cybertruckownersclub.com/forum/threads/fsd-for-cybertruck-is-released-%F0%9F%98%B1-now-pushing-to-early-access.24449/"&gt;Cybertruck Owners Club&lt;/a&gt; (as &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2024/09/29/tesla-has-finally-enabled-fsd-on-some-cybertrucks/"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) are reporting that the update has been installed on their vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WLFJlh"&gt;Tesla had promised that FSD would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/5/24236628/tesla-fsd-full-self-driving-cybertruck-europe-eu-china-launch-regulators"&gt;come to the Cybertruck in September&lt;/a&gt;, after the launch of the Autopark feature — and with today’s news, it would appear that it just hit that deadline. It’s the latest version of FSD (12.5.5), and to start, it’s coming to Cybertrucks set up for the early access program. The update includes a promised vision-based attention monitoring system for...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oasis won’t use Ticketmaster’s dynamic pricing for North America tour</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y1QR94"&gt;Oasis announced the &lt;a href="https://oasisinet.com/"&gt;North America leg of its 2025 reunion tour&lt;/a&gt; this morning, and the band’s management also shared a decision that will be welcome news to fans: they won’t have to worry about inflated “dynamic pricing” rates when ticket sales kick off on October 4th. Dynamic pricing allows for ticket costs to fluctuate based on demand, but all too often, the end result is that prices surge far beyond face value for high-profile performances. This has led many people to bemoan the feature in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TSQZDd"&gt;“It is widely accepted that dynamic pricing remains a useful tool to combat ticket touting and keep prices for a significant proportion of fans lower than the market rate and thus more affordable,” the statement reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uxON5E"&gt;“But, when...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mike Flanagan is writing a Clayface movie for DC Studios</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A humanoid man made of dripping clay looking lovingly at his severed lower half, which is also made of dripping clay and has a face." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C3OI0L4-D_w_bdrl0m69L2qI3v4=/244x0:2637x1595/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73783006/Screenshot_2024_12_12_at_1.08.03_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Max&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dkWzpo"&gt;The DC Comics character Clayface has been getting plenty of play on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24318912/harley-quinn-is-moving-to-metropolis"&gt;Max’s &lt;em&gt;Harley Quinn &lt;/em&gt;series&lt;/a&gt;, where he’s voiced by Alan Tudyk. But it’s looking like the shape-shifting villain’s next act will take him to the big screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iYKrYe"&gt;&lt;a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/clayface-movie-dc-studios-mike-flanagan-1236246625/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports that &lt;em&gt;The Haunting of Hill House &lt;/em&gt;creator Mike Flanagan has signed on to write a new Clayface feature for DC Studios that will be produced by Matt Reeves and Lynn Harris’ company 6th &amp;amp; Idaho. Currently, there are no details about who will direct the project, but Warner Bros. Discovery reportedly intends for it to begin filming some time next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PmifUr"&gt;WBD fast-tracking a movie about one of Batman’s goopier rogues might sound odd at first blush, but it makes quite a bit of sense coming after DC Studios co-CEO James Gunn’s reveal of his plan to build a new cinematic universe. Gunn explained last year that DC Studios is “going to have characters move into animation [and] out of animation; usually having the same actor play their voice as who plays them in live-action.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wHdMcv"&gt;We’ve already seen a bit of that borne out in &lt;em&gt;Creature Commandos&lt;/em&gt; where Viola Davis has reprised her role as Amanda Waller and Frank Grillo is voicing Rick Flagg Sr. ahead of portraying the same role in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/11/24293526/and-just-like-that-hbo-is-ready-to-send-in-the-clown"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peacemaker&lt;/em&gt;’s upcoming second season&lt;/a&gt;. Though Clayface hasn’t appeared in &lt;em&gt;Creature Commandos &lt;/em&gt;just yet, the character (who will once again by voiced by Tudyk) is set to become part of the show some time some time this season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qCcCzy"&gt;Because Tudyk also voices &lt;em&gt;Creature Commandos&lt;/em&gt;’ Doctor Phosphorous and Will Magnus, it’s not clear yet whether WBD intends for him to portray Clayface is the new feature. But that might not wind up being an issue given how &lt;em&gt;Creature Commandos &lt;/em&gt;kinda feels like a show designed to kill off and cycle through DC’s weirder characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MQCIRs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SE1i8p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gemini AI can now summarize what’s in your Google Drive folders</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An image showing the Google Drive logo on a blue background" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wn8t47xjU3y_zc7inwS5pMH3K90=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73782967/acastro_STK459_02.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b1ZKPc"&gt;Gemini’s integration into Google Drive is getting a little more useful. In addition to summarizing documents or answering questions about a project, the AI assistant can now &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/06/gemini-in-side-panel-of-google-docs-sheets-slides-drive.html"&gt;generate summaries of everything inside a folder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DH0e8Z"&gt;With the feature, you can open a folder and select the new “Summarize this folder” button at the top of the page. Gemini will then give you a breakdown of the folder’s contents. As noted by Google, you can use Gemini to find specific files inside a folder, or ask questions about it, like “What is the theme of this folder?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a4cNU8"&gt;You can also drag and drop a folder into the Gemini sidebar, as well as right-click on a folder and choose “Ask Gemini.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tAtHvpUo5LLDK02maq-PqJrVeiM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25787138/gemini_folder_summaries.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="sVZpeT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google launched Gemini 2.0, its new AI model for practically everything","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24318444/google-gemini-2-0-flash-ai-model"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F9IKgr"&gt;For now, Google says Gemini can only provide information about text documents, PDFs, spreadsheets, and presentations. However, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2024/12/12/gemini-summarizes-entire-folders-google-drive/"&gt;when &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; tested the tool&lt;/a&gt;, it found that Gemini could identify images in a folder, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ngpRKl"&gt;Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/14/24155310/google-gemini-ai-sidebar-gmail-docs-slides-io"&gt;first brought Gemini&lt;/a&gt; to the sidebar in Drive, Docs, Sheets, and Slides &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/06/gemini-in-side-panel-of-google-docs-sheets-slides-drive.html"&gt;in June&lt;/a&gt;. Gemini’s folder summary feature is rolling out now to Google One AI Premium subscribers, along with Gemini Business, Enterprise, Education, and Education Premium users.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The extremely online life of the American teenager</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Photo illustration of pixels coming out of a locker." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G5K1ujVVetyHaLzUcbdLk-smdTA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73782957/STK419_DEEPFAKE_CVIRGINIA_J.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Cath Virginia / The Verge | Photos from Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1NQhQx"&gt;Nearly half of US teens are “almost constantly” online, though the platforms they spend their time on vary significantly, according to &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2024/12/12/teens-social-media-and-technology-2024/"&gt;a new Pew survey&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kpf6D9"&gt;Despite some variety in their overall online habits, virtually all teenagers use YouTube. Of the 1,391 teenagers polled by the Pew Research Center, 90 percent said they use the site, a slight decrease from 95 percent in 2022. And 73 percent of them go on YouTube every day, making it by far the most popular platform for teenage users. The second-most popular app is TikTok, which 63 percent of teens say they use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A Pew Research Center graph tited “YouTube, TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat top the list for teens”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hmDQfTXm1Tq3NWEwwt8Dg5dDEP8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25787153/PI_2024.12.12_teens_social_media_tech_0_01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Pew Research Center&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Almost all teenagers polled by Pew use YouTube, but very few are on Threads.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="KLCxXe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"TikTok teens’ latest passion is enterprise software","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215782/tiktok-notion-enterprise-software-teen-studyblr"},{"title":"The teens making friends with AI chatbots","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/4/24144763/ai-chatbot-friends-character-teens"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PzY0Lk"&gt;But there’s a gender divide, especially among teenagers who say they “almost constantly” use either app: 19 percent of girls say they use TikTok that often, while the same share of boys are constantly on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JG7VtK"&gt;And even this extremely online demographic isn’t using all websites equally. Just 6 percent of teenagers polled said they use Threads, Meta’s microblogging app, and only 32 percent use Facebook — down from 71 percent a decade ago. The only Meta product a majority of teenagers use is Instagram, whose popularity has increased since 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SY2oFW"&gt;There seems to be a preference for image- and video-based platforms among the teenagers polled: X and Reddit were also much less popular, with 17 percent and 14 percent of teens saying they use them, respectively. And teens’ X usage has declined significantly over the past decade: a decade ago, when it was still called Twitter, 33 percent of US teens used it. But teens’ use of some image-based apps — including Snapchat — is on the decline as well. In fact, the only app that has experienced a rise in popularity is WhatsApp, which is now used by 23 percent of teenagers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s Recall AI is creepy, clever, and compelling</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A timeline with buttons for yesterday, today, and now, with apps like Teams and Excel at the bottom." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2nz6iLE-Am7OFQ8Oiu9INg0NDeM=/144x0:1698x1036/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73782941/Gen_AI_feature3_VP5_1842x1036.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JZbVCt"&gt;I honestly thought I’d hate Microsoft’s controversial Recall feature and immediately disable it, but after using it for the past couple of weeks, I’ve been both creeped out and impressed with what it’s capable of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9QAfHB"&gt;Recall, a Windows 11 feature that takes snapshots of mostly everything you see on your screen, quickly became a controversy earlier this year after Microsoft announced it. Privacy advocates immediately started warning about potential issues with Recall without even using it, and security researchers found big holes in a prerelease version of the feature. Microsoft delayed Recall multiple times to give the company more time to address the security issues, and it’s now in testing for Windows Insiders ahead of a broader rollout next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2AXcyS"&gt;The first thing I noticed about Recall is that the initial setup experience is very clunky and feels unfinished. You launch the app, and it redirects you to Windows Update, where AI models will start downloading and installing. Once you’ve installed a trio of these, it looks like the install process is complete — but then Windows Update will find another component of Recall to install. After fiddling around for 10 minutes, Recall will...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple gets into AI: all the news on iOS 18, macOS Sequoia, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Image of the Apple logo surrounded by gray, pink, and green outlines" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KfWeKom2KbBmYe3DQryTNPfWG-Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73590176/VRG_Illo_N_Barclay_5_apple.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Nick Barclay / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;iOS 18 introduces more customization and the first rollout of Apple Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="V3Bqbg"&gt;Apple has released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/16/24246090/ios-18-iphone-launch-rcs-homepage-customization-features"&gt;iOS 18&lt;/a&gt; — plus iPadOS 18, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/16/24246290/apple-macos-sequoia-launch-availability"&gt;macOS Sequoia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/16/24246171/apple-watchos-11-watch-sleep-apnea-smartwatch-launch"&gt;watchOS 11&lt;/a&gt;, and other new updates — bringing several key updates to how the company’s devices operate and setting the stage for generative AI features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J6LPbj"&gt;The most discussed feature of iOS 18 is the Apple Intelligence suite. With the release of iOS 18.2 on December 11th, features &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24318840/ios-18-2-apple-intelligence-chatgpt-genmoji-image-playground"&gt;that are available now&lt;/a&gt; include generating images in Image Playground, creating custom “Genmoji” emoji, and ChatGPT integration. Other features of Apple Intelligence, including writing tools such as the ability to rewrite your text in different styles, trickled out to customers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/28/24272995/apple-intelligence-now-available-ios-18-1-mac-ipad"&gt;starting in October.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VSBHSc"&gt;There are major non-AI changes to consider too, like the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/23/24277926/apple-iphone-default-messaging-apps-ios-18-2"&gt;change your default apps&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24275178/apple-airpods-pro-hearing-aid-test-protection-preview"&gt;test your hearing with AirPods&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DhFXOH"&gt;Meanwhille, iPadOS 18 now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/10/24140821/apple-ipados-18-features-updates-apps-wwdc-2024"&gt;has a calculator app&lt;/a&gt; and can solve math equations in notes, watchOS is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/16/24246150/apple-watch-sleep-apnea-detection-fda-approval"&gt;keeping an eye out for sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt;, and now your iPhone can even message Androids with RCS.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Supernote’s new E Ink tablet is upgradeable and repairable</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A person holding the Supernote A5 X2 Manta writes on the screen using a stylus." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X-0WAR8-KLmUyNYlJNlcCqJ3ohM=/0x0:1080x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73782879/supernote1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Supernote A5 X2 Manta is more expensive than the Remarkable 2, but will potentially last longer with upgradeable components.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Supernote&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u25Drw"&gt;Supernote has announced its new &lt;a href="https://supernote.com/pages/supernote-manta?"&gt;A5 X2 Manta E Ink tablet&lt;/a&gt; that could be a potential alternative to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21403489/remarkable-2-e-ink-paper-tablet-review"&gt;reMarkable 2&lt;/a&gt; for those wanting a larger screen and a device that can be easily upgraded and repaired. It’s &lt;a href="https://supernote.com/products/supernote-a5-x2-manta?variant=45959389348076"&gt;available now for $459&lt;/a&gt;, something of a jump from the $379 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21403489/remarkable-2-e-ink-paper-tablet-review"&gt;reMarkable 2&lt;/a&gt;. The latter also includes a stylus, while the Supernote A5 X2 requires you to provide your own — or &lt;a href="https://supernote.com/collections/pens"&gt;spend at least another $59&lt;/a&gt; to buy one of the company’s pens (which, according to Supernote, don’t need charging and are fitted with ceramic tips that won’t wear down).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2uNbtI"&gt;On the other hand, the new tablet is very fixable. A panel on the back of the Supernote A5 X2 can be removed without tools, giving quick access to some of the tablet’s internal components. This includes its 3,600mAh battery, which can be replaced when it loses capacity or stops charging, and the A5 X2’s motherboard, potentially allowing for performance improvements or new features down the road without having to replace the entire device. There’s also a microSD slot that can use a memory card to expand the A5 X2’s storage from 32GB up to 2TB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Supernote A5 X2 Manta atop a couple of paper notebooks with its rear panel removed." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9_iGE-YL4AWVaNF76H9AhHjJmek=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25787018/supernote3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Supernote&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You don’t even need to reach for a screwdriver to open the A5 X2’s back panel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wYQCWh"&gt;The 10.7-inch 300 ppi E Ink screen on the Supernote A5 X2 is larger and has more resolution than the reMarkable 2’s 10.3-inch 266 ppi panel, but like the four-year-old reMarkable, the A5 X2 skips screen lighting for what the company calls an improved writing experience and a “true paper look in natural light.” That could be a tough sell when alternatives like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24271627/amazon-kindle-scribe-2024-notebook-specs"&gt;Amazon Kindle Scribe&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23769068/best-ebook-readers"&gt;Kobo Elipsa 2E&lt;/a&gt; can be easily used in the dark. Even reMarkable &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24234815/the-remarkable-paper-pro-is-as-outrageous-as-it-is-luxurious"&gt;now offers an E Ink tablet&lt;/a&gt; with an illuminated screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v3a1pt"&gt;Powered by a 1.8GHz RK3566 quad-core processor, the Supernote A5 X2 runs a custom Android 11-based OS called Chauvet that supports features like two-finger gestures and offline handwriting recognition that can convert your notes to editable text. The tablet also has Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, allowing documents to be synced through cloud-based services like Dropbox or Google Drive, or to be transferred directly to other devices wirelessly using an accompanying mobile app. For extra security, you can even plug a flash drive into the A5 X2’s USB-C charging port and transfer files manually.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JDV8Ic"&gt;Epic Games’ annual holiday sale is now live, and like previous years, the company is also going to be offering a bunch of free games you can claim during the sale. Over the course of this sale, the store will have 16 free games, &lt;a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/epic-games-store-holiday-sale-2024-buyers-guide"&gt;according to a blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v08E28"&gt;Epic isn’t spilling the beans about &lt;em&gt;which&lt;/em&gt; games will be on offer, teasing only that you’ll be able to claim “some absolutely amazing titles.” But in pervious years, Epic has given away big games like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/13/23999921/epic-games-store-holiday-sale-2023-free-games"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Destiny 2: Legacy Collection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/26/22854581/control-free-epic-games-store"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so fingers crossed that Epic has some good holiday surprises up its sleeve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="biAjtT"&gt;For paid deals, there are some good games to sift through, like 35 percent off &lt;a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/dragon-age-the-veilguard"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dragon Age: The Veilguard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Outlaws&lt;/em&gt;. During the holiday sale, Epic is also giving users 10 percent back on their purchases as part of the Epic Rewards program, which is a boost from the usual 5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SS5Dte"&gt;&lt;a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/"&gt;The sale&lt;/a&gt; ends at 11AM ET on January 9th, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden administration raises tariffs on solar materials from China </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A worker wearing a mask, a white garb and gloves grasps a slab of material in a factory." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BG-xKa_FQhySW6vbNj-WNnR_PYg=/0x3:3373x2252/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73782734/2161788194.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A worker handles wafers at the GCL Technology production plant in Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, China, on Tuesday, July 2, 2024. GCL Technology is one of the world’s largest makers of polysilicon, a key material in solar panels. | Photo: Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PyRUpE"&gt;Tariffs on solar wafers, polysilicon, and certain tungsten products from China are going to rise dramatically come January 1st, 2025, the Biden administration announced Wednesday. That means higher price tags on key materials needed to make solar panels at a time when solar is the &lt;a href="https://emp.lbl.gov/sites/default/files/2024-04/Queued%20Up%202024%20Edition_1.pdf"&gt;fastest growing source&lt;/a&gt; of electricity in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iz3Jsh"&gt;Polysilicon is used to make solar wafers, which are the semiconductors in solar panels. Tungsten — the same material in old-school incandescent lightbulbs — has many uses in electronics because of its high melting point. The metal is also part of supply chains for the aerospace, automotive, defense, medical, and oil and gas industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WMMSN2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;That means higher price tags on key materials needed to make solar panels at a time when solar is the fastest growing source of electricity in the US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4aXLjy"&gt;It’s the latest instance of the Biden administration hiking up tariffs on goods from China — which dominates solar manufacturing — as part of its plan to build up domestic supply chains for clean energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uKwvsm"&gt;Solar products from the Xinjiang region in particular also face &lt;a href="https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/china-solar-companies-linked-to-forced-labour-allegations/"&gt;accusations of forced labor and human rights abuses&lt;/a&gt;. The Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) also said that the decision to raise tariffs follows an investigation into &lt;a href="https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/05.14.2024%20Four%20Year%20Review%20of%20China%20Tech%20Transfer%20Section%20301%20(Final).pdf"&gt;cyber theft and economic espionage&lt;/a&gt; by China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X0rmDV"&gt;“The tariff increases announced today will further blunt the harmful policies and practices by the People’s Republic of China,” ambassador Katherine Tai said in a &lt;a href="https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2024/december/ustr-increases-tariffs-under-section-301-tungsten-products-wafers-and-polysilicon-concluding"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “These actions will complement the domestic investments made under the Biden-Harris Administration to promote a clean energy economy, while increasing the resilience of critical supply chains.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zziJ1A"&gt;Starting next year, tariffs on polysilicon and solar wafers will &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-us-tariffs-tungsten-solar-a9653d4b14051d78314c2bd8111510e7"&gt;double&lt;/a&gt; from 25 to 50 percent. Tariffs on certain tungsten products will go &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-us-tariffs-tungsten-solar-a9653d4b14051d78314c2bd8111510e7"&gt;from zero&lt;/a&gt; to 25 percent. Chinese companies &lt;a href="https://cen.acs.org/energy/solar-power/US-solar-polysilicon-supply-problem/100/i33"&gt;produce more than 75 percent of the world’s polysilicon&lt;/a&gt;. Considering all the &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/solar-pv-global-supply-chains/executive-summary"&gt;manufacturing stages for solar panels&lt;/a&gt;, which includes polysilicon and wafers, China holds &lt;a href="https://www.woodmac.com/press-releases/china-dominance-on-global-solar-supply-chain/"&gt;more than 80 percent&lt;/a&gt; of global capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m7plug"&gt;American manufacturers welcomed the changes. “These trade measures will begin to counter the pervasive Chinese government subsidies in solar manufacturing. It is a step in the right direction,” Mike Carr, executive director of the Solar Energy Manufacturers for America (SEMA) Coalition, said in an emailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="LdhoQk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"What does Trump’s election mean for EVs, Tesla, and Elon Musk? ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289494/trump-election-electric-vehicle-tax-credit-tesla-elon-musk"},{"title":"What a second Trump presidency means for tech ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/8/24291333/second-trump-tech-policy-antitrust-ai-crypto"},{"title":"US to raise tariffs on EVs, batteries, solar cells, and computer chips from China ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/14/24156249/us-biden-china-tariffs-ev-solar-battery-semiconductor-critical-minerals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KyVtcs"&gt;To be sure, Chinese policies aimed at boosting solar manufacturing have led to economies of scale that have &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/solar-pv-global-supply-chains/executive-summary"&gt;allowed prices for solar panels to plummet around the world&lt;/a&gt;. Chinese companies also make much &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/10/24153830/biden-china-ev-tariff-quadruple-trade"&gt;more affordable electric vehicles&lt;/a&gt; than US manufacturers. EVs from China have been similarly subject to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/14/24156249/us-biden-china-tariffs-ev-solar-battery-semiconductor-critical-minerals"&gt;soaring tariffs during the Biden administration&lt;/a&gt; to 100 percent from 25 percent this year. In May, Biden also &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/05/14/fact-sheet-president-biden-takes-action-to-protect-american-workers-and-businesses-from-chinas-unfair-trade-practices/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that tariffs on battery parts and lithium-ion batteries would rise to 25 percent from 7.5 percent. In addition, he increased the tarifff rate on solar cells from 25 percent to 50 percent. And by 2025, the rate on semiconductors from China will double to 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7JBWEY"&gt;President-elect Donald Trump has said he plans to &lt;a href="https://nrf.com/research/estimated-impacts-proposed-tariffs-imports-apparel-toys-furniture-household-appliances"&gt;hike tariffs&lt;/a&gt; on imported goods from China even more than his predecessor, which is expected to increase prices on everything from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289494/trump-election-electric-vehicle-tax-credit-tesla-elon-musk"&gt;cars&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/8/24291333/second-trump-tech-policy-antitrust-ai-crypto"&gt;electronics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube quietly made some of its web embeds worse, including ours</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The YouTube logo on a black background" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dxW-vEA6eR6CRvRhLNSmNnbu2Ek=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73782716/acastro_180322_1777_youtube_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PCh2X3"&gt;For about a year, I’ve gotten notes from readers asking why our YouTube embeds are broken in one very specific way: you can no longer click the title to open the video on YouTube.com or in the YouTube app. This used to work just fine, but now you can’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uq47lY"&gt;This bothers us, too, and it’s doubly frustrating because everyone assumes that &lt;em&gt;we’ve&lt;/em&gt; chosen to disable links, which makes a certain kind of sense — after all, why on earth wouldn’t YouTube want people to click over to its app?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N24Sv2"&gt;The short answer is money. Somewhat straightforwardly, YouTube has chosen to degrade the user experience of the embedded player publishers like Vox Media use, and the only way to get that link back is by using a slightly different player that pays us less and YouTube more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pppz32"&gt;I know this because I’ve spent months chasing down the mystery of the broken links, and after tons of back and forth between Vox Media’s teams and YouTube, and even me pushing this up to YouTube CEO Neal Mohan, they’re not going to change it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MR6JxW"&gt;Here’s the really long version: like everyone, we publish our videos on YouTube. But YouTube isn’t the same for everyone. Publishers like Vox Media can use something called the YouTube Player for Publishers, or PfP, which &lt;a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/google-news-initiative/digital-news-initiative-introducing/"&gt;has been around since 2016&lt;/a&gt; and basically competes with the wacky custom video players you see on so many other sites. It allows publishers to sell their own ads at higher rates while still having the videos live in the YouTube ecosystem, which is a nice win-win and not something anyone had to think about until earlier this year. (I didn’t even really know about it until this links kerfuffle — if you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/10/24317808/future-of-media-verge-subscription-podcasts-vergecast"&gt;listen to &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this week, you know our newsroom is firewalled from the business side of our company.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GWtjLm"&gt;But around the beginning of this year, YouTube decided to change PfP and remove all of its branding from the publisher player. And “branding,” according to YouTube, includes that title link back to YouTube. If publishers want that link back to YouTube, they have to use the standard YouTube player — and give up their ad revenue and control to YouTube. That’s why so many YouTube players around the web — not just ours — don’t have links that work, even though they otherwise look and behave just like YouTube’s standard player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R3VQVP"&gt;Here’s what YouTube spokesperson Mariana De Felice told me about it: “News publishers can choose between the standard YouTube embedded player or a version designed specifically for them, which gives greater control over the ads experience, but removes YouTube branding and links back to YouTube. This version provides publishers greater control over the ads running on their videos, but YouTube doesn’t have visibility into which ads are served. In order to protect our advertisers and partners, we’ve removed our branding and links back to YouTube from the player.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TjbT8F"&gt;I am a real brat and have complained about this for months now — it had all worked fine since 2016! — but that’s the situation. Our choices are basically leaving things alone, making less money to have the link work, or switching to some other player on the site in protest, which would also not have a link back to YouTube but would at least let us pretend there’s market competition in video players. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GZzu6Y"&gt;Ultimately our business side will make the call, but that’s why the link is broken — a tiny example of the modern platform internet that tells a huge story about how everything else works.&lt;/p&gt;

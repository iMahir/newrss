    <title>Donald Trump picks billionaire Jared Isaacman to lead NASA</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A photo showing Jared Isaacman" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8cUK99aLoQ6t3Bkbc6rGymD_WbU=/0x0:4898x3265/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73766373/1230932870.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PltkzB"&gt;President-Elect Donald Trump has nominated billionaire Jared Isaacman to head up NASA, he &lt;a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113595378122687080"&gt;announced on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. Isaacman funded and partook in the Polaris Dawn mission, in which he and SpaceX engineer Sarah Gillis &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24242730/spacex-polaris-dawn-first-private-spacewalk-jared-isaacman"&gt;performed the first commercial spacewalk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PM2zmo"&gt;Isaacman is set to replace former Florida Senator Bill Nelson as NASA Administrator, who President Joe Biden tapped to lead the agency when voted into office. Aside from Polaris Dawn, Isaacman &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22667339/spacex-inspiration4-first-all-civilian-crew-dragon"&gt;also funded Inspiration 4&lt;/a&gt;, a mission that took him and three other non-professional astronauts to space atop SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RLz70X"&gt;Most of Isaacman’s fortune comes from Shift4, the payment-processing business he founded when he was 16. He still serves as CEO of the company, which recently acquired the Canadian &lt;a href="https://investors.shift4.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/231/shift4-to-acquire-givex-corp-global-provider-of-gift-card-loyalty-point-of-sale-solutions"&gt;gift card platform Givex&lt;/a&gt; and struck a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2021%2F11%2F10%2Fshift4-stock-surges-after-spacex-starlink-payments-deal.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F12%2F4%2F24313160%2Fdonald-trump-nasa-billionaire-jared-isaacman" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;payments deal with Elon Musk’s Starlink&lt;/a&gt; in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="5s57Uc"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" align="center"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I am honored to receive President Trump’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@realDonaldTrump&lt;/a&gt; nomination to serve as the next Administrator of NASA.  Having been fortunate to see our amazing planet from space, I am passionate about America leading the most incredible adventure in human history.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On my last mission…&lt;/p&gt;— Jared Isaacman (@rookisaacman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rookisaacman/status/1864346915183157636?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 4, 2024&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sseY1N"&gt;“With the support of President Trump, I can promise you this: We will never again lose our ability to journey to the stars and never settle for second place,” Isaacman wrote on X. “Americans will walk on the Moon and Mars and in doing so, we will make life better here on Earth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TF1Cyb"&gt;Isaacman joins the other group of unconventional nominees Trump has chosen to head up various government agencies and advisory committees, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301975/elon-musk-vivek-ramaswamy-doge-plan"&gt;including the new &lt;/a&gt;“Department of Government Efficiency“ led by Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can try Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s excellent character creator for free</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A screenshot from Dragon Age: The Veilguard" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Yze3ftIsqxNzjTcPH4DPr4bPmIs=/0x0:3240x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73766347/ss_94c6e6f26435702105b83e76804cd27710543fcc.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: EA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kgVmm5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dragon Age: The Veilguard&lt;/em&gt; has an incredible character creator, and starting today, you can mess around with it without having to buy the full game. EA will be releasing a free, standalone version of the character creator for all platforms the game is available on (PS5, Xbox Series X / S, and PC), and you’ll be able to bring the character you make in the free creator over to the full game if you decide to buy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Q7NwzY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Dragon Age: The Veilguard has fantastic hair tech thanks to FIFA and Madden","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24294829/dragon-age-the-veilguard-hair-technology-frostbite-bioware"},{"title":"Dragon Age: The Veilguard has more magic, color, and customizations","url":"https://www.theverge.com/24176102/dragon-age-the-veilguard-preview-summer-game-fest-bioware"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QO498B"&gt;If you have any interest at all in &lt;em&gt;The Veilguard&lt;/em&gt;, I really recommend checking out the free character creator when it’s available and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24176102/dragon-age-the-veilguard-preview-summer-game-fest-bioware"&gt;seeing all of the options&lt;/a&gt;. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24294829/dragon-age-the-veilguard-hair-technology-frostbite-bioware"&gt;Hair looks particularly good&lt;/a&gt;.) And if you end up making a character, transfer them to the game, and want to make some tweaks, you’ll be able to do so early on in your adventure, so don’t sweat your decisions too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q4RWhZ"&gt;EA is also releasing &lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/patch-4-release-notes"&gt;a fourth patch for the game&lt;/a&gt;, which adds a mission that will reward you with in-game items themed around the &lt;em&gt;Dragon Age II&lt;/em&gt; protagonist, Hawke. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon secretly excluded neighborhoods from Prime delivery, DC AG alleges</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Illustration showing Amazon’s logo on a black, orange, and tan background, formed by outlines of the letter “A.”" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ktjx1fxxO7nDIyjlMn8G2Y_PzGY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73766281/acastro_STK103__04.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2XLHlw"&gt;Amazon quietly carved out two Washington, DC zip codes from being serviced by its fastest Prime delivery service with its own branded trucks, outsourcing deliveries to slower services like UPS and the Postal Service, &lt;a href="https://oag.dc.gov/release/attorney-general-schwalb-sues-amazon-secretly"&gt;DC Attorney General Brian Schwalb alleges&lt;/a&gt; in a new lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HLMfuV"&gt;The alleged decision led to about 48,000 Prime members living in two zip codes east of the Anacostia River receiving fewer benefits than they were actually paying for (at $14.99 a month or $139 a year), according to Schwalb. The neighborhoods that were allegedly affected include majority-Black and low-income areas. But even when customers noticed and complained about the slower delivery times, the AG alleges, Amazon “misled the consumers to believe it was a coincidence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rmf1Sd"&gt;Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in a statement that Amazon changed how it serviced the zip codes cited in the lawsuit due to “specific and targeted acts against drivers delivering Amazon packages” in those areas. “We made the deliberate choice to adjust our operations, including delivery routes and times, for the sole reason of protecting the safety of drivers.” Nantel calls the AG’s claims “categorically false” and says Amazon is “always transparent with customers during the shopping journey and checkout process about when, exactly, they can expect their orders to arrive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MYiKox"&gt;But while Amazon has the right to protect its workers through these changes, Schwalb says it can’t deceive customers while doing so. “Amazon is charging tens of thousands of hard-working Ward 7 and 8 residents for an expedited delivery service it promises but does not provide. While Amazon has every right to make operational changes, it cannot covertly decide that a dollar in one ZIP code is worth less than a dollar in another,” he says in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kmqBVw"&gt;Schwalb is suing under DC’s consumer protection law. He’s seeking to stop Amazon from continuing its allegedly deceptive behavior and collect an unspecified amount of civil penalties, restitution, and damages.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Meta turns to nuclear energy for its AI ambitions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vector illustration of the Meta logo." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cP8Yh7b--qO34GfjzlarvPDTC2M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73766202/STK043_META_CVIRGINIA_C.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Cath Virginia / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nJ6hPE"&gt;Meta is turning to nuclear energy to power its AI ambitions with the release a request for proposals to partner with nuclear energy developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cM6FSt"&gt;It’s the latest &lt;a href="https://sustainability.atmeta.com/blog/2024/12/03/accelerating-the-next-wave-of-nuclear-to-power-ai-innovation/"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; in a string of recent deals Big Tech companies have made to secure nuclear energy for their data centers. Developing new AI tools is an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/24/24049047/data-center-ai-crypto-bitcoin-mining-electricity-report-iea"&gt;energy-intensive endeavor&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/28/24230481/meta-sustainability-report-carbon-footprint-renewable-energy-climate-change"&gt;risks&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/2/24190874/google-ai-climate-change-carbon-emissions-rise"&gt;derailing Silicon Valley’s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/20/24249770/microsoft-three-mile-island-nuclear-power-plant-deal-ai-data-centers"&gt;sustainability goals&lt;/a&gt; unless it can find less polluting sources of electricity. Meta now joins &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/5/24261405/google-microsoft-amazon-tech-data-center-nuclear-energy"&gt;Amazon, Microsoft, and Google&lt;/a&gt; in efforts to get more nuclear reactors up and running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="CDAhp4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Meta now joins Amazon, Microsoft, and Google in efforts to get more nuclear reactors up and running&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aotQqq"&gt;That’s much easier said than done. The first all-new nuclear reactor to be built in the US in decades &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/georgia-power-nuclear-reactor-vogtle-9555e3f9169f2d58161056feaa81a425"&gt;started running in 2023&lt;/a&gt; — seven years overdue and $17 billion over budget. Developers are now designing next-generation technology called small modular reactors (SMRs) that are supposed to make it easier to build and site a project, ostensibly cutting down costs. Those advanced reactors aren’t expected to become commercially viable until the 2030s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lrOdgR"&gt;Meta says it’s interested in both &lt;a href="https://sustainability.atmeta.com/nuclear-energy-rfp-qualification-intake/"&gt;SMRs and larger reactors&lt;/a&gt;, and is searching for partners...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The new Gundam anime looks great and sounds like it was named by a cat on a keyboard</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A large humanoid robot standing in a massive hangar. Next to the robot is a floating human girl in a pink, form fitting bodysuit." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fVFuAYvBLgvqeRv2FJqb1azotBc=/137x0:2315x1452/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73766187/Screenshot_2024_12_04_at_10.48.23_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Sunrise/Khara&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a9mXca"&gt;There’s a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527983/netflix-geeked-week-anime-trailers-mobile-suit-gundam-godzilla"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mobile Suit Gundam&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;show right around the corner, and while Bandai hasn’t revealed much about its story, its production studio and creative team bode very good things for the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uT50WR"&gt;Sunrise has collaborated with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/7/24173930/the-anime-studio-that-made-neon-genesis-evangelion-has-filed-for-bankruptcy"&gt;Khara&lt;/a&gt;, the Hideaki Anno-founded studio behind the &lt;em&gt;Rebuild of Evangelion &lt;/em&gt;films, to produce &lt;a href="https://en.gundam.info/about-gundam/series-pages/gquuuuuux/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a new series co-written by Anno and Yōji Enokido, and directed by Kazyua Tsurumaki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UZHDft"&gt;Set in a reality where humanity has taken to living in massive space colonies, &lt;em&gt;GQuuuuuuX&lt;/em&gt; follows as highschooler Yuzuriha “Machu” Amate (Tomoyo Kurosaw) and courier Nyaan (Yui Ishikawa) are drawn into the world of underground mech fights called Clan Battles. A new trailer for the series teases how, after meeting Gundam pilot Shuji Ito (Shimba Tsuchiya), Machu learns to co-pilot the gMS-Ω GQuuuuuuX. Designer Take’s (best known for her work on the &lt;em&gt;Pokémon &lt;/em&gt;franchise) distinctive style shines through in the trailer’s shots of the show’s human characters, and mechanical designer Ikuto Yamashita’s take on the classic Gundam aesthetic feels fresh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VAyaKg"&gt;Though &lt;em&gt;Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX&lt;/em&gt; is set to air on Nippon Television in the new year, the series does not yet have a concrete premiere date. But ahead of its TV debut, a theatrical cut of some of its episodes will screen in Japanese theaters on January 17th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ChatGPT now has over 300 million weekly users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vector illustration of the ChatGPT logo." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D-f6pON-ehIWhIFt4U05PIiI50E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73766159/STK155_OPEN_AI_CVirginia_C.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LlKBcb"&gt;ChatGPT now has over 300 million people using the AI chatbot each week. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed the milestone during &lt;em&gt;The New York Times’ &lt;/em&gt;DealBook Summit on Wednesday, which comes just months after ChatGPT &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/29/24231685/openai-chatgpt-200-million-weekly-users"&gt;hit 200 million weekly users in August&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Or1IC1"&gt;“Our product has scaled ... now we have more than 300 million weekly active users,” Altman said. “We have users sending more than 1 billion messages per day to ChatGPT.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mr5ScK"&gt;ChatGPT has grown rapidly since its launch in 2022 as OpenAI continues to add more capabilities, such as its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24283906/openai-chatgpt-live-web-search-searchgpt"&gt;AI search engine&lt;/a&gt; that surfaces and summarizes results from across the web (though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24312016/chatgpt-search-results-review-inaccurate-unpredictable"&gt;they may not always be accurate&lt;/a&gt;), and a new “Canvas” interface that lets &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24261895/openai-chatgpt-canvas-text-code-editing-interface"&gt;users more easily adjust code&lt;/a&gt; written by the chatbot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4TA4tk"&gt;Apple is also building ChatGPT directly into Siri as part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/25/24278716/siri-chat-gpt-ios-18-2-developer-beta-apple-intelligence"&gt;iOS 18.2&lt;/a&gt;, which is now available in beta and is poised to help the chatbot reach even more users.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Misinformation researcher admits ChatGPT added fake details to his court filing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Illustration of a robot brain." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_q7tvwzXjd0IuLmbWNUFx-4cF0o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73766113/STK_414_AI_A.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ttLQG8"&gt;A misinformation expert &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/21/24301955/minnesota-deepfake-bill-lawsuit-affidavit-ai"&gt;accused of using AI to generate a legal document&lt;/a&gt; admitted he used ChatGPT to help him organize his citations, leading to “hallucinations” that critics said called the entire filing into question. Jeff Hancock, the founder of the Stanford Social Media Lab who wrote the document, says the errors don’t change the “substantive points in the declaration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P1IovQ"&gt;Hancock submitted the affidavit in support of Minnesota’s “Use of Deep Fake Technology to Influence an Election” law, which is being challenged in federal court by Christopher Khols — a conservative YouTuber who posts under the name Mr Reagan — and Minnesota state Rep. Mary Franson. After discovering that Hancock’s filing seemed to contain citations that didn’t exist, attorneys for Khols and Franson said it was “unreliable” and asked that it be excluded from consideration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fxXQK6"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mnd.220348/gov.uscourts.mnd.220348.39.0.pdf"&gt;subsequent declaration&lt;/a&gt; filed late last week, Hancock acknowledged that he used ChatGPT to draft the declaration but denies he used it to &lt;em&gt;write &lt;/em&gt;anything. “I wrote and reviewed the substance of the declaration, and I stand firmly behind each of the claims made in it, all of which are supported by the most recent scholarly research in the field and reflect my opinion as an expert regarding the impact of AI technology on misinformation and its societal effects,” Hancock wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h7e4hC"&gt;As for the citation errors, Hancock explained that he used Google Scholar and GPT-4o “to identify articles that were likely to be relevant to the declaration so that I could merge that which I knew already with new scholarship.” Hancock says he used GPT-4o to create a citation list, not to write the document, and didn’t realize the tool generated “two citation errors, popularly referred to as ‘hallucinations’” and added incorrect authors to another citation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HqIRcL"&gt;“I did not intend to mislead the Court or counsel,” Hancock wrote in his most recent filing. “I express my sincere regret for any confusion this may have caused. That said, I stand firmly behind all the substantive points in the declaration.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="lhlAuw"&gt;In 2024, you couldn’t escape hearing about AI. From &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24145141/ai-gadgets-smartphones-meta-rabbit"&gt;smartphones&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/3/24148513/meta-rayban-smart-glasses-ai-wearable-race"&gt;wearables&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24043060/smart-home-interface-map-view-samsung-lg-amazon-ces-2024"&gt;smart home&lt;/a&gt;, it seemed every tech company wanted to pitch their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24278413/ai-manifesto-anthropic-dario-amodei-agi-digital-god-openai-sam-altman-decoder-podcast"&gt;next great AI innovation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5tfJvS"&gt;The year was filled with impressive technological leaps and useful new tools, endless hype and frequent misfires, and implications for the future that range from truly exciting to unpredictable. This is the year we got a sense of what AI might actually do — and just how unprepared we still are to grapple with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X0LyiC"&gt;Here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, we thought a lot about AI’s impacts on the industries and people we cover. From strikes across industries like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/5/24213808/video-game-voice-actor-strike-sag-aftra"&gt;gaming&lt;/a&gt; to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24211177/ai-climate-crisis-energy-use-microsoft-openai-chatgpt-google-gemini-decoder-podcast"&gt;impact on our climate&lt;/a&gt; to the desire for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/24/24253439/california-sb-1047-newsom-hollywood-sag-aftra-ai-safety"&gt;policy protections for Hollywood&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/12/24197058/eu-ai-act-regulations-bans-deadline"&gt;AI Act&lt;/a&gt;, AI is already reshaping nearly every area of our lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cIZgup"&gt;So let’s take a look back at some of the biggest, boldest, weirdest AI stories from the last year — and look ahead to what could be in store for 2025. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM and EVgo now have over 2,000 EV charging stalls and counting </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Picture of an EV truck in a parking lot, plugged into an EVgo / GM Energy fast charger." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VWrnyXVCq3uUnacPOKi4Np62mFo=/6x0:1275x846/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73765988/GM_EVgo_fast_charging.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of the co-branded GM Energy / EVgo fast chargers.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: General Motors&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FeE7Mk"&gt;General Motors and EV charging company EVgo &lt;a href="https://news.gm.com/home.detail.html/Pages/topic/us/en/2024/dec/1204-evgo.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that they’ve installed their 2,000th public EV charging stall, in Murrieta, California. With that, GM has met a deadline it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24242068/gm-energy-evgo-ev-dc-fast-charging-network-flagship-locations"&gt;set in September&lt;/a&gt; to have the bulk of its planned 2,850 DC fast-charging stalls set up by the end of this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LVCUuR"&gt;GM says the new station, which is near Interstate 215 in Riverside County, serves five 350kW fast chargers for as many as 10 EVs simultaneously. It doesn’t mention whether these are strictly CCS chargers or if they include Tesla’s NACS ports, which have emerged as the de facto standard over the last year and a half. We’ve asked GM for more information and will update if it responds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="poCLfb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"GM offers free nighttime charging to Chevy EV owners in Texas ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/13/24295809/gm-chevy-ev-reliant-free-nighttime-charging"},{"title":"An analysis of 20,000 EV stations concludes that charging is still a massive bummer","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/6/24214581/electric-vehicle-charging-reliability-study-chargehelp"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9kkmcB"&gt;EVgo president Dennis Kish said that its relationship with GM has helped his company “bring public charging to communities in more than 30 states across the US,” and that the company is working toward deploying its “first flagship destinations next year.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aTKQqc"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24242068/gm-energy-evgo-ev-dc-fast-charging-network-flagship-locations"&gt;GM said back in September&lt;/a&gt; that this network, which is distinct from another planned 2,000-strong network of DC fast chargers at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/5/23988171/gm-ev-charging-station-progress-pilot-evgo"&gt;Flying J and Pilot truck stops&lt;/a&gt;, will include 400 “flagship” gas station-style charging locations. Those will be built out in major metropolitan areas of states like Florida, California, Texas, and Michigan, the company said today. That’s all in addition to &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; EV charging network consortium &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24176160/ionna-ev-charging-dc-fast-headquarters-network"&gt;called Ionna&lt;/a&gt; that GM is participating in along with car companies like Hyundai, Kia, BMW, and Stellantis.&lt;/p&gt;

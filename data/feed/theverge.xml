    <title>The only thing better than Astro Bot is more Astro Bot... for free</title>

Now the game will continue its well-earned victory lap with the news that it’s getting DLC...&lt;em&gt;for free&lt;/em&gt;...&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;this year&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Astro Bot &lt;/em&gt;director and Team Asobi studio head Nicolas Doucet confirmed the news &lt;a href="https://questdaily.com.au/interviews/free-astro-bot-dlc-confirmed-by-game-director-for-2024/"&gt;in an interview with Australian outlet &lt;em&gt;Quest Daily&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="XhySd1"&gt;The DLC update will add new maps geared toward speedrunning challenges, leaderboards, and of course, new PlayStation-themed bots to rescue. However, don’t expect something the size of &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring’s&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Erdtree —&lt;/em&gt; Doucet says the DLC “isn’t going to be that huge.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DiWu1o"&gt;The DLC’s additional challenge levels should definitely appeal to players who...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s Visual Intelligence is a built-in take on Google Lens</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Finding out what kind of dog this is with Visual Intelligence.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RvVddc"&gt;Apple has announced a new feature called Visual Intelligence that will be part of iOS 18’s Apple Intelligence suite of AI features “later this year.” The feature works much like similar features offered by other multimodal AI systems from Google or OpenAI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUFyIy"&gt;Visual Intelligence lets you “instantly learn about everything you see,” Apple’s Craig Federighi said during the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/9/24237601/apple-iphone-16-event-announcements-products"&gt;September event today&lt;/a&gt;. Federighi said the feature is “enabled by Camera Control,” which is the company’s name for a new capacitive camera button that’s now on the side of the iPhone 16 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/9/24230103/iphone-16-pro-specs-features-price-release-date-apple?showComments=1"&gt;16 Pro phones&lt;/a&gt;. To trigger it, users will need to click and hold the button, then point the phone’s camera at whatever they’re curious about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4kneVZ"&gt;iPhones use a “combination of...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The AirPods Pro 2 will soon double as hearing aids</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Apple AirPods Pro 2 showing its new hearing aid feature" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/95RcDkvnECDrfebzWzlKC5vey5M=/74x0:1400x884/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73574539/Apple_Airpods_pro_hearing_aid.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AirPods Pro 2 are also getting a five-minute hearing test feature.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KZx167"&gt;Apple has announced a batch of hearing health updates coming to the AirPods Pro 2, including a new “clinical grade” hearing aid feature. The iPhone maker says the hearing aid functionality is still awaiting FDA clearance, but it expects the agency’s approval alongside other regulatory bodies “soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="75PWEi"&gt;When enabled, the hearing aid feature will boost specific sounds in real time, such as speech and other environmental noises. A new clinically validated hearing test feature will also be included in this update that can help to detect hearing loss. Apple says the test requires both the AirPods Pro and a connected iPhone and can be taken in under five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="znAdhm"&gt;Apple announced the iPhone 16 Pro lineup at Monday’s product event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jnzcui"&gt;The company’s new flagship smartphones have slightly bigger screens across both models: 6.3 inches on the iPhone 16 Pro and 6.9 inches on the iPhone 16 Pro Max (up from 6.1 inches and 6.7 inches, respectively, on the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max). The bodies of the phones are once again made from titanium. It comes in four colors: black, white, natural, and a new “desert titanium.” Apple also claims that the iPhone 16 Pro Max has “the best iPhone battery life ever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iCxx8t"&gt;The iPhone 16 Pro lineup comes with the A18 Pro chip, with a 16-core Neural Engine that it says will offer “amazing performance” for Apple Intelligence features, including 15 percent faster performance than...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="XySj4q"&gt;Apple has announced the iPhone 16, the latest edition of its mainline smartphone. The iPhone 16 comes in a variety of slightly refreshed colors that are more vivid compared to previous years. Also refreshed is the updated dual-camera arrangement on its rear, once again set up vertically, as last seen on the iPhone 12 from 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q0lpLY"&gt;The iPhone 16 has a variety of new hardware refinements and features, like a new A18 chip with 3nm process that’s 30 percent faster than the iPhone 15’s CPU, increased battery life, water and dust resistance, an Action Button that debuted on last year’s Pro models, satellite messaging (starting in the US and Canada), improved thermal design for gaming with hardware-accelerated ray tracing, and a new physical...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The titanium Apple Watch Series 10 is carbon neutral</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration: The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7GVK8I"&gt;The titanium Apple Watch Series 10 is carbon neutral, Apple announced during the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/9/24236176/apple-iphone-16-liveblog-apple-watch-x-airpods-keynote"&gt;“It’s Glowtime” event&lt;/a&gt;. Any Apple Watch in any finish can be carbon neutral this year, Apple says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q8QEvE"&gt;To reduce emissions, the titanium watch is made with 95 percent recycled titanium, Apple’s chief operating officer Jeff Williams said. Apple also makes enough renewable energy purchases to match the electricity used to manufacture the watch. It also says it’s prioritizing “non-air shipping” to limit pollution from transportation.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s AirPods 4.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HuRPWN"&gt;Apple is launching &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/09/apple-introduces-airpods-4-and-a-hearing-health-experience-with-airpods-pro-2/"&gt;a new version of AirPods called the AirPods 4&lt;/a&gt;, with a refined new shape that Apple says is its “most comfortable AirPods ever.” It keeps an open-air design, has a “massive improvement” in audio quality, and includes support for personalized spatial audio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K84Vq8"&gt;The earbuds will be available in two models: an entry-level model, known as the AirPods 4, and a higher-end model with noise cancellation, known as the AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), a first for the standard AirPods line. The standard set costs $129, and the higher-end ANC one is $179. Both are available on September 20th and can be preordered today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j8TUQ7"&gt;Apple is also adding improved Find My features for the AirPods, including the previously Pro-only...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sfjBwZ"&gt;After almost four years without a hardware update, a new version of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt; has been announced by Apple today, with the primary upgrade being a switch from Apple’s proprietary Lightning port to USB-C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sOqIal"&gt;As Apple has slowly transitioned away from the Lightning port it introduced 12 years ago, the AirPods have been one of the last product lines from the company to say goodbye to the proprietary connector. Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/12/23860305/airpods-pro-usb-c-cases-apple-announced"&gt;introduced a USB-C charging case&lt;/a&gt; for the AirPods Pro 2 last year as an affordable way to upgrade the charging port without replacing the earbuds, but AirPods Max users are going to have to completely replace their headphones to get USB-C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jfdfPO"&gt;The new AirPods Max can be preordered today in several new color options that include...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sleep apnea detection is coming to the Apple Watch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Event slide showing the warning notification from Apple’s “possible sleep apnea” detection from the Apple Watch." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XKvdVTCaD0_Gnakb5YWAzJd8x3o=/0x51:997x716/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73574344/lcimg_bf067d6e_79ae_4512_94ec_4cd461543748.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b0cez5"&gt;Apple is adding sleep apnea detection to the Apple Watch. The new feature is coming to the Apple Watch Series 9, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/9/24236801/apple-watch-series-10-price-specs-features-release-date"&gt;just-announced Series 10&lt;/a&gt;, and the Apple Watch Ultra 2, Apple announced at its product event on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xsqTsd"&gt;Sleep apnea is &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sleep-apnea/symptoms-causes/syc-20377631"&gt;a disorder&lt;/a&gt; that causes you to stop breathing as you sleep. Sleep apnea is a feature that wearables makers have been working on for some time, with Samsung getting cleared by the FDA for sleep apnea tracking with the Galaxy Watch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/9/24067819/samsung-galaxy-watch-sleep-apnea-tracker-fda-de-novo-authorization"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. Apple says it’s using the accelerometer on its watches to monitor a new metric that it calls “breathing disturbances.” You’ll be able to see your nightly breathing disturbance values in the Health app.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="7gEGfC"&gt;Apple has refreshed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170798/could-the-quest-3s-arrive-in-september"&gt;Apple Watch Ultra 2&lt;/a&gt; with a new “satin black” color option and sleep apnea detection feature, the company announced at its September event today. It’s the first time Apple has offered the Watch Ultra in more than one color since it launched two years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MNT6Gk"&gt;Apple says its sleep apnea feature uses the watch’s accelerometer to analyze “breathing disturbance data” every 30 days and will “notify you if it shows consistent signs of moderate to severe sleep apnea.” The feature is coming to the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/9/24236801/apple-watch-series-10-price-specs-features-release-date"&gt;Apple Watch Series 10&lt;/a&gt; as well as the Series 9. Apple also announced a new titanium Milanese Loop. It’s $799 and available for preorder today ahead of a September 20th release.&lt;/p&gt;

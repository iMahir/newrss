    <title>Google says its breakthrough quantum chip can’t break modern cryptography</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An image showing Google’s quantum computing chip" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4COpc39QVHmImHdvqYfPcqdbSeA=/255x0:2313x1372/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73783370/google_willow_chip.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sLOk7p"&gt;Experts believe that one day, quantum computers could make today’s systems of encryption utterly obsolete. But Google tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24317382/google-willow-quantum-computing-chip-breakthrough"&gt;its new “breakthrough” Willow chip&lt;/a&gt; is nowhere near ready for that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jzERDh"&gt;“The Willow chip is not capable of breaking modern cryptography,” Google Quantum AI director and COO Charina Chou tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3tjqg7"&gt;A so-called “cryptanalytically relevant quantum computer,” or CRQC, could “jeopardize civilian and military communications, undermine supervisory and control systems for critical infrastructure, and defeat security protocols for most Internet-based financial transactions,” the White House &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/04/national-security-memorandum-on-promoting-united-states-leadership-in-quantum-computing-while-mitigating-risks-to-vulnerable-cryptographic-systems/"&gt;warned in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, ordering that US agencies must transition to new systems to mitigate that risk by 2035.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ohvVkZ"&gt;But Willow is not a CRQC, according to Google. While the company does claim it can solve a computing challenge in five minutes that would take the world’s fastest supercomputer ten septillion years, Google has only produced 105 physical qubits worth of that computing power and suggests it would need millions to literally crack the codes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mIc3sD"&gt;“Estimates are we’re at least 10 years out from breaking RSA, and that around 4 million physical qubits would be required to do this,” Chou writes. She says Willow doesn’t change the timeline at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="7V4uLT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google is working to safeguard Chrome from quantum computers","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/7/12120280/google-chrome-canary-quantum-computing-encryption-new-hope"},{"title":"Apple is already defending iMessage against tomorrow’s quantum computing attacks","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/21/24079081/apple-imessage-pq3-post-quantum-cryptography"},{"title":"After NSA leaks, businesses seek security in quantum physics","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/15/4839072/after-nsa-leaks-businesses-seek-security-in-quantum-physics"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vEApDY"&gt;And though Chinese researchers have &lt;a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/experts-play-down-chinese-quantum/"&gt;repeatedly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/arthurherman/2023/01/10/did-china-break-the-quantum-barrier/"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; to discover new ways to break RSA encryption with a much smaller quantum computers, ones with just a few hundreds or thousands of qubits, security experts have &lt;a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2023/01/breaking-rsa-with-a-quantum-computer.html"&gt;repeatedly&lt;/a&gt; been &lt;a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/experts-play-down-chinese-quantum/"&gt;skeptical&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PfAyEL"&gt;Google is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/7/12120280/google-chrome-canary-quantum-computing-encryption-new-hope"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; of the many companies preparing to defend against the potential threat of broken encryption with post-quantum cryptography, or PQC, ever since the Edward Snowden leaks revealed that spy agencies like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/2/5267430/nsa-reportedly-secretly-funding-code-breaking-quantum-computer-research"&gt;NSA were quietly funding code-breaking quantum computer research&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z84wW0"&gt;A few years back, we wrote about how the National Institute of Standards and Technology &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523067/nist-challenge-quantum-safe-cryptography-computer-lattice"&gt;created a competition to develop quantum-safe cryptography standards&lt;/a&gt; back in 2016. This August, &lt;a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2024/08/nist-releases-first-3-finalized-post-quantum-encryption-standards"&gt;NIST released three finalized algorithms&lt;/a&gt; and its standards for integrating them into products and systems, and plans to select one or two more by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QZUK0n"&gt;The RAND Corporation, a think tank famous for advising on US national security in the past, &lt;a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2023/09/when-a-quantum-computer-is-able-to-break-our-encryption.html"&gt;suggested in a 2023 editorial&lt;/a&gt; that the moment an RSA-breaking quantum computer exists, it’ll trigger a worldwide rush to defend against it: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lRJCqT"&gt;“As soon as the existence of the CRQC becomes public knowledge — or is even considered plausible — and the threat becomes concrete, most vulnerable organizations will immediately move to upgrade all their communications systems to post-quantum cryptography.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Adobe now has a tool to get rid of ugly window reflections in photos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A photo of a dog through a window with a bright reflection next to a version of the tool with the reflection removed." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tOkjUca4gxoomxm_s_LU9hjBMnE=/1x0:1000x666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73783324/reflection_removal_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adobe’s Reflection Removal tool is now available as a technology preview inside Camera Raw.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Adobe&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lIFa5U"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/11/23912614/adobe-max-sneaks-generative-ai-audio-3d-tech-preview"&gt;Adobe’s Project See Through&lt;/a&gt;, a tool that is capable of eliminating distracting reflections in photos taken through windows, is now available as a technology preview and is now called &lt;a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2024/12/12/removing-window-reflections-adobe-camera-raw"&gt;the Reflection Removal tool&lt;/a&gt;. Originally revealed as a “Sneak” during the Adobe’s annual Max conference last year, you can use the tool through Adobe Camera Raw in preview with a Lightroom release “coming soon,” according to Adobe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sKwdM9"&gt;The best way to ensure a photo isn’t marred with reflections is to avoid shooting through a window, but Adobe’s new tool will increase the chances that the beautiful mountain vista you captured during a flight will actually be worth sharing. The tool works by distinguishing the two scenes that make up an image with a reflection, which are often distinguished by different content, white balances (indoor scenes tend to look warmer than outdoor ones), and their sharpness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Three photos that were used as training data for the Reflection Removal AI model." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5A0CMznbpDnfWAyLu2_79tt87qI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25787552/reflection_removal_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Adobe&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of the artificial reflections Adobe created for training data by merging thousands of photos together.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZvsxvU"&gt;The AI model the Reflection Removal tool uses was trained on a database of thousands of photographs without reflections that were paired and merged to create millions of images with simulated reflections. Through a reinforcement process, the model learned how to extract the original photos from a single combined image, which are both available in the new tool. The results are often impressive, but Adobe points out that “if a reflection is so strong or complex that a person looking at the photograph struggles to figure out what is what, then our model might struggle as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYmR5Y"&gt;To access the new tool, which currently only works with RAW images (support for JPEGs and HEICs is planned) you need to open the Camera Raw tool and then the Technology Previews section of its Preferences Panel where you can enable the New AI Settings and Features Panel before restarting Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An example of the output from Adobe’s new Reflection Removal tool." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lNwFQlxmQVORVcv6jxISuYFWMtM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25787566/reflection_removal_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Adobe&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The original photo (left) next to a version with reflections removed (center) and the reflected image itself isolated (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QKRrf8"&gt;With a RAW file imported, you’ll find a Reflections option in the Distraction Removal section of the Remove panel. After a few seconds of processing a reflection-free version of the image will be presented (hopefully!) along with a slider set to 100. Dragging the slider down to zero will restore the reflections, while dragging it to -100 will reveal only the reflected image.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon is using 5G network slicing to offer better video calling — for a price</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="5G logo on an illustrated blue and green background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2RftwgfmAI2YLCoiYPF-lHCs6J8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73783250/STK142_5G.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Remember your old friend 5G? | Image: The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6PHIRi"&gt;Verizon is making good on one of the many unfulfilled promises of 5G with &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/about/news/enhanced-video-calling" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a new service called Enhanced Video Calling&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a7Gg4E"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/support/enhanced-video-calling-metro-areas/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the company’s website&lt;/a&gt;, it delivers “optimized video and sound quality on calling apps,” even in times of congestion. That may not sound exciting on its own. But under the hood, Verizon is using network slicing to boost video call performance, which is a new technology only possible on a standalone 5G network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kfIULU"&gt;Unlike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/28/23846049/banana-surgery-5g-video-viral"&gt;remote robot banana surgery&lt;/a&gt;, network slicing is a real benefit of 5G technology that we can reasonably expect to see in more places in the next few years. Slicing lets network operators provide the right resources for certain kinds of demanding activities where a strong connection is critical. Right now, that means boosting performance for video calls, but in the future it could mean being able to prioritize the data needed to safely guide an autonomous vehicle through an intersection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="nmhW9R"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The race to 5G is over — now it’s time to pay the bill","url":"https://www.theverge.com/23991136/5g-network-att-verizon-tmobile-cost-competition"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eoXrsz"&gt;The catch is that you need a standalone 5G network to pull this off, and much of the US’ 5G networks still operate on 4G cores. T-Mobile has been able to move quicker on this thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/26/6646158/t-mobile-sprint-merger-justice-department-approves-26-billion-fcc"&gt;its Sprint acquisition&lt;/a&gt;, and it rolled out its first feature based on slicing this fall with a service that &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fbusiness%2Ft-priority-network-slice-for-first-responders&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F12%2F12%2F24319785%2Fverizon-5g-sa-network-slicing-enhanced-video-calling" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;gives priority to first responders&lt;/a&gt;. Verizon has been testing slicing &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-major-step-network-slicing-capabilities" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for the past year or so&lt;/a&gt;, but this is its first rollout of a consumer feature based on the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TSsFQo"&gt;In order to try Enhanced Video Calling out for yourself, you have to meet a specific set of requirements. It’s available in &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/support/enhanced-video-calling-metro-areas/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;“more than 150 metro areas” right now&lt;/a&gt;, with more to be added in 2025. But you also need to be on Verizon’s priciest plan, Unlimited Ultimate, which costs $90 per month for one line with autopay. And you’ll need an iPhone 14 or newer running iOS 18.2. Samsung Galaxy S23 and newer and Pixel 9 phones will be compatible too, but support for Android video calling apps on Android is arriving in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qeuJot"&gt;If you meet the above prerequisites, you should see a setting in iOS that reads “Enhance 5G” if you go to &lt;strong&gt;Settings &amp;gt; Cellular&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/deployment/support-for-5g-network-slicing-dep0f666c6f9/web"&gt;according to Apple’s documentation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Toyota’s next EV is this small Urban Cruiser SUV for Europe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="white compact suv on a yellow platform" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rwdbe8_CfW6AMM8aOfxTl8HCyvw=/0x0:6446x4297/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73783226/urbancruiserhero_4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toyota’s Urban Cruiser is a compact electric SUV coming to Europe.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Toyota&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="B4aH4l"&gt;Toyota &lt;a href="https://media.toyota.co.uk/world-premiere-of-the-all-new-toyota-urban-cruiser/"&gt;revealed its latest all-electric vehicle today&lt;/a&gt; as the Urban Cruiser compact SUV. The EV, which will be fully revealed at the Brussels Motor Show next month, is intended for the European market, first coming to the UK in the third quarter of 2025. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xPrnOI"&gt;Toyota says the wheelbase is only about 5 inches longer than the European-only Yaris Cross, making it another fun-sized electric EV slated for the continent like the recently revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24312042/ford-puma-gen-e-europe-ev-specs-range"&gt;Ford Puma Gen-E&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/27/24187409/hyundai-inster-small-ev-compact-price-specs-us"&gt;Hyundai Inster&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ylhPK"&gt;The Urban Cruiser has clear design inspiration from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/5/23988111/toyota-ev-concept-urban-suv-sport-crossover"&gt;last year's Urban SUV concept&lt;/a&gt;. It also shares its new EV platform built in conjunction with Suzuki, which announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24289169/suzuki-e-vitara-ev-electric-suv-toyota-launch"&gt;its made-in-India E Vitara SUV last month&lt;/a&gt;. Toyota’s other EV, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23180408/toyota-bz4x-electric-suv-review-specs-price"&gt;the bZ4X&lt;/a&gt;, also shares its EV platform with another automaker, Subaru, which has the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/26/23042924/subaru-solterra-pricing-starting-ev-tax-incentives"&gt;Solterra EV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="urban cruiser interior with CarPlay on the screen" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bUf8ppQpMT2AAl4jSabeSN9QuzA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25787499/urbancruiserint_004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Toyota&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toyota Urban Cruiser features a side-by-side 10.25-inch cluster screen and a 10.1-inch infotainment system.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8DUJ2y"&gt;Toyota’s Urban Cruiser has nearly match-for-match specs as the E Vitara, including a relatively small 49 kWh battery with an FWD drivetrain and a 61 kWh battery with an option for AWD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JR45LX"&gt;Toyota says power output can get as high as 135kW in the AWD version (with 40kW on the rear axel for “stable and secure performance on loose and slippery surfaces”) and up to 300 Nm of torque. While the official range is not announced, it’ll likely match the E Vitara’s expected 248 miles on a single charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CEZ4HY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:12505170"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hAXHLP"&gt;Additionally, the Urban Cruiser has downhill assist and trail modes for added control, and the FWD model includes a snow mode. All models come with a heat pump and include the ability to manually start preconditioning the battery to prepare for a DC fast charging session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mIFvJM"&gt;Toyota has been slower in building and adopting EVs than other legacy manufacturers. The automaker has been focused on its outstanding hybrid technology as well as hydrogen vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yoROb4"&gt;But the automaker isn’t done with EVs — it’s planning to have 15 EVs, including six models on a next-gen shared platform by 2026, and it just invested &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24319893/toyota-sinks-more-money-into-its-kentucky-plant-where-its-making-a-new-three-row-ev"&gt;nearly another $1 billion in Kentucky&lt;/a&gt; for a paint facility to prepare for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/7/24063943/toyota-ev-investment-kentucky-factory-three-row-suv"&gt;a three-row electric SUV&lt;/a&gt; for the US.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Prime Video pushes ‘AI Topics’ instead of the old algorithms</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A photo showing AI topics on Prime Video" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7Ky-uvBHL7Cc-CSicRb58DKASPY=/103x0:1218x743/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73783220/amazon_ai_topics.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wHY76K"&gt;Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/prime-video-what-to-watch-artificial-intelligence-topics"&gt;testing a new Prime Video feature&lt;/a&gt; that recommends groups of content using AI rather than traditional algorithms. If you’re part of the test, you’ll see new “AI Topics” tailored to your interests, like “mind-bending sci-fi,” “fantasy quests,” or “thrilling character journeys.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iNlNdZ"&gt;Each category will have shows, movies, and linear channels that match these AI-generated labels. You can also continue refining recommendations further by selecting topics related to the category you’re looking at, which Amazon says allows you to “discover more content without hitting a dead end.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1HztGh"&gt;Streaming services like Netflix have long used machine learning algorithms to spit out recommendations based on viewing history. But with this announcement, it seems like Prime Video is putting an extra AI spin on things — which isn’t very surprising given the hype surrounding the tech and Amazon’s own efforts to portray itself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/3/23819442/amazon-generative-ai-ceo"&gt;as an AI leader&lt;/a&gt;. For now, Amazon says AI Topics are rolling out to “select” living room devices in the US, such as the Fire TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VZ7pVp"&gt;Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/4/24287955/amazon-prime-video-ai-x-ray-recaps"&gt;Prime Video also rolled out AI recaps&lt;/a&gt; you can use to summarize TV seasons, entire episodes, and even portions of episodes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Meta makes $1 million donation to Trump’s inauguration</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Photo collage of Mark Zuckerberg." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BxqNpCLCR3HPrjpb6PXktfwiALk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73783081/STK169_Zuckerberg_C_CVirginia.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8kOeNE"&gt;Meta has donated $1 million to president-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration fund, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/mark-zuckerbergs-meta-donates-1-million-to-trumps-inaugural-fund-32a999c1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. Zuckerberg’s team reportedly told Trump’s inaugural committee about Meta’s planned donation before Zuckerberg and Trump &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/27/24307943/mark-zuckerberg-donald-trump-dinner-mar-a-lago"&gt;dined together at Mar-a-Lago in November&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yBuvXA"&gt;Before the dinner, Zuckerberg showed off Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses and gifted a pair to Trump, according to the Journal. Zuckerberg’s advisers also met with incoming White House officials, including incoming White House chief of staff Susie Wiles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="38TLYB"&gt;The donation marks a significant shift for Zuckerberg, who has until recently shied away from politics. Zuckerberg &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289649/big-tech-leaders-donald-trump-presidential-election"&gt;called Trump to congratulate him&lt;/a&gt; on his election victory. But he didn’t publicly endorse a candidate in 2020 — and as Meta spokespeople have repeatedly emphasized, he also didn’t endorse anyone in 2024, despite Trump’s claims that Zuckerberg called him to say there’s “no way” he could vote for a Democrat after the attempt on Trump’s life at a Pennsylvania rally. (Zuckerberg also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/19/24201879/mark-zuckerberg-trump-rally-shooting-fist-pump-badass"&gt;called Trump’s reaction to the shooting “badass.”&lt;/a&gt;) Still, Zuckerberg has made increasingly unsubtle overtures to Trump, who has threatened the Facebook founder over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DULchD"&gt;The dinner — and the donation — are signs that the notoriously rocky relationship between Zuckerberg and Trump is starting to soften. Trump has had it out for Zuckerberg since Facebook banned his account in the wake of the January 6th riots, and at one point &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/28/trump-zuckerberg-election-book-00176639"&gt;said Zuckerberg should be jailed&lt;/a&gt; due to Facebook’s alleged interference in the 2020 election.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscriptions are up to 50 percent off right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Illustration of Xbox logos on phones and tablets" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1OCDs08s1GF806uUoYnHDqq-5v0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73783068/acastro_210429_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aXeVgq"&gt;If you’ve been contemplating signing up for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate so you can play &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24314376/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-bethesda-machinegames-xbox"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Indiana Jones and the Great Circle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you might want to head on over to Woot. Now until 1:59AM ET on December 13th, the retailer is offering a three-month subscription to &lt;strong&gt;Xbox Game Pass Ultimate&lt;/strong&gt; for &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fxbox-game-pass-ultimate-digital-code-2%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F12%2F12%2F24319164%2Fxbox-game-pass-ultimate-elgato-stream-deck-neo-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$28.99 (about $31 off)&lt;/a&gt; with promo code &lt;strong&gt;GAMEPASS&lt;/strong&gt;. Only customers making their first purchase on Woot are eligible, though; everyone else will have to pay $33.99 to redeem the digital code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="n1KrGT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Microsoft&amp;amp;nbsp;wants to make the&amp;amp;nbsp;Xbox&amp;amp;nbsp;app the home of PC gaming","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24318799/microsoft-xbox-app-new-games-homescreen"},{"title":"The Verge’s 2024 holiday gift guide","url":"https://www.theverge.com/24224043/holiday-gift-guide-2024-best-ideas-unique-tech-gadgets"},{"title":"Xbox tests streaming your Xbox games to your Xbox","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24318876/xbox-tests-streaming-games-console"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xOOEbm"&gt;Woot’s current promo is a terrific deal considering a month of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate will normally run you $19.99. After you finish playing the new &lt;em&gt;Indiana Jones &lt;/em&gt;game, you can play dozens of other downloadable titles for both Xbox and PC, including new releases like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24284080/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-had-a-big-weekend"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Black Ops 6&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and older titles like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23697355/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review-ps5-xbox-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars Jedi: Survivor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23852390/starfield-review-xbox-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Starfield&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23747068/diablo-iv-review-blizzard-class-customization"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820011/halo-infinite-campaign-review-xbox-series-x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23589879/hi-fi-rush-making-of-interview-xbox"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hi-Fi Rush&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Subscribers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24300547/xbox-cloud-gaming-game-library-streaming"&gt;can even stream select non-Game Pass titles&lt;/a&gt; they own via their TV, smartphone, tablet, and PC through a web browser. This includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/17/23834516/baldurs-gate-3-choices-narrative-perfectionism"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Baldur’s Gate 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Hogwarts Legacy, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Balatro&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rDFmln"&gt;In addition to granting access to a wide range of games — including EA Play titles — an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription lets you take advantage of exclusive deals, online multiplayer, and other perks, some of which aren’t available on the cheaper Game Pass tiers.&lt;/p&gt;

The wired Pro is one of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22954554/best-video-doorbell-camera"&gt;our favorite video doorbells&lt;/a&gt;, one that works with Amazon Alexa and integrates well with Ring Alarm and other Ring cameras. It offers top-notch video quality and a square aspect ratio, though many features — including person alerts and the ability to save and share clips — require a premium Ring subscription plan. The Chime Pro, meanwhile, doubles as a speaker for notifications and a Wi-Fi extender, so the doorbell receives a strong signal.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Threads follows Bluesky’s starter packs with curated collections of people to follow</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An image showing the Threads logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bcl9lG1nOnNvPMIIUTG7qq-1Nbg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73783060/STK156_Instagram_threads_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration: The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TwQkRY"&gt;Meta’s Threads is getting another feature seemingly inspired by Bluesky: curated groups of accounts that you can follow all at once. They basically sound like Meta’s take on Bluesky’s handy starter packs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5UW7D7"&gt;Instagram boss Adam Mosseri &lt;a href="https://www.threads.net/@mosseri/post/DDfPItEv7T8?xmt=AQGz-j7922-ea6JlhP7H_IlfXAyrA2UZXYsWYbM3ENBBxw"&gt;announced Thursday&lt;/a&gt; that Meta is starting to test the feature, and he said that you’ll see the collections “when signing up for Threads and within the For You feed.” A “handful” of “Threads community leaders” curated and shared the current collections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CLPG9N"&gt;People will be able to find collections built around topics like “basketball, style and fashion, food, books, pop culture, and more,” Meta spokesperson Alec Booker tells The Verge. “We’ll iterate on this feature based on learnings from the test, and hope to expand the functionality to more people soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshots showing Threads’ new curated collections of accounts to follow." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K7IRebsqf0VPYZGgDhn1UqIE8Kw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25787335/Suggested_Profiles_For_You.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Meta&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshots showing Threads’ new curated collections of accounts to follow." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u0lFDwrDvy5sNM77gd0f70ixGlw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25787340/Suggested_Profiles_Sign_Up.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Meta&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mRtEhL"&gt;Meta has upped the pace of Threads feature updates after users really started flocking to Bluesky last month — Threads introduced its own take on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301587/threads-custom-feeds-rolling-out"&gt;custom feeds&lt;/a&gt; just five days after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/15/24297313/threads-custom-feeds-test"&gt;announcing the feature in testing&lt;/a&gt;, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oLw1Ar"&gt;While I personally think Bluesky is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/23/24303502/bluesky-next-twitter-threads-x"&gt;heir apparent to Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, Threads is still significantly larger. Meta saw 35 million Threads signups &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/26/24306591/threads-35-million-signups-november-growth"&gt;in November&lt;/a&gt;, but Bluesky user growth has seemingly slowed to a crawl: as I write this, Bluesky is &lt;a href="https://bsky-users.theo.io"&gt;on the cusp&lt;/a&gt; of surpassing 25 million users, a five million user jump from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/19/24301008/bluesky-now-has-more-than-20-million-users"&gt;nearly a month ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mike Flanagan is writing a Clayface movie for DC Studios</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A humanoid man made of dripping clay looking lovingly at his severed lower half, which is also made of dripping clay and has a face." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C3OI0L4-D_w_bdrl0m69L2qI3v4=/244x0:2637x1595/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73783006/Screenshot_2024_12_12_at_1.08.03_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Max&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dkWzpo"&gt;The DC Comics character Clayface has been getting plenty of play on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24318912/harley-quinn-is-moving-to-metropolis"&gt;Max’s &lt;em&gt;Harley Quinn &lt;/em&gt;series&lt;/a&gt;, where he’s voiced by Alan Tudyk. But it’s looking like the shape-shifting villain’s next act will take him to the big screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iYKrYe"&gt;&lt;a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/clayface-movie-dc-studios-mike-flanagan-1236246625/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports that &lt;em&gt;The Haunting of Hill House &lt;/em&gt;creator Mike Flanagan has signed on to write a new Clayface feature for DC Studios that will be produced by Matt Reeves and Lynn Harris’ company 6th &amp;amp; Idaho. Currently, there are no details about who will direct the project, but Warner Bros. Discovery reportedly intends for it to begin filming some time next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PmifUr"&gt;WBD fast-tracking a movie about one of Batman’s goopier rogues might sound odd at first blush, but it makes quite a bit of sense coming after DC Studios co-CEO James Gunn’s reveal of his plan to build a new cinematic universe. Gunn explained last year that DC Studios is “going to have characters move into animation [and] out of animation; usually having the same actor play their voice as who plays them in live-action.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wHdMcv"&gt;We’ve already seen a bit of that borne out in &lt;em&gt;Creature Commandos&lt;/em&gt; where Viola Davis has reprised her role as Amanda Waller and Frank Grillo is voicing Rick Flagg Sr. ahead of portraying the same role in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/11/24293526/and-just-like-that-hbo-is-ready-to-send-in-the-clown"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peacemaker&lt;/em&gt;’s upcoming second season&lt;/a&gt;. Though Clayface hasn’t appeared in &lt;em&gt;Creature Commandos &lt;/em&gt;just yet, the character (who will once again by voiced by Tudyk) is set to become part of the show some time some time this season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qCcCzy"&gt;Because Tudyk also voices &lt;em&gt;Creature Commandos&lt;/em&gt;’ Doctor Phosphorous and Will Magnus, it’s not clear yet whether WBD intends for him to portray Clayface is the new feature. But that might not wind up being an issue given how &lt;em&gt;Creature Commandos &lt;/em&gt;kinda feels like a show designed to kill off and cycle through DC’s weirder characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MQCIRs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SE1i8p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="b1ZKPc"&gt;Gemini’s integration into Google Drive is getting a little more useful. In addition to summarizing documents or answering questions about a project, the AI assistant can now &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/06/gemini-in-side-panel-of-google-docs-sheets-slides-drive.html"&gt;generate summaries of everything inside a folder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DH0e8Z"&gt;With the feature, you can open a folder and select the new “Summarize this folder” button at the top of the page. Gemini will then give you a breakdown of the folder’s contents. As noted by Google, you can use Gemini to find specific files inside a folder, or ask questions about it, like “What is the theme of this folder?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a4cNU8"&gt;You can also drag and drop a folder into the Gemini sidebar, as well as right-click on a folder and choose “Ask Gemini.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="sVZpeT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google launched Gemini 2.0, its new AI model for practically everything","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24318444/google-gemini-2-0-flash-ai-model"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F9IKgr"&gt;For now, Google says Gemini can only provide information about text documents, PDFs, spreadsheets, and presentations. However, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2024/12/12/gemini-summarizes-entire-folders-google-drive/"&gt;when &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; tested the tool&lt;/a&gt;, it found that Gemini could identify images in a folder, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ngpRKl"&gt;Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/14/24155310/google-gemini-ai-sidebar-gmail-docs-slides-io"&gt;first brought Gemini&lt;/a&gt; to the sidebar in Drive, Docs, Sheets, and Slides &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/06/gemini-in-side-panel-of-google-docs-sheets-slides-drive.html"&gt;in June&lt;/a&gt;. Gemini’s folder summary feature is rolling out now to Google One AI Premium subscribers, along with Gemini Business, Enterprise, Education, and Education Premium users.&lt;/p&gt;

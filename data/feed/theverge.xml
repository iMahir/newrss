    <title>Volkswagen’s electric ID Buzz van will start at $59,995 in the US</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Volkswagen&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZamnkQ"&gt;Volkswagen has taken one of the final steps toward delivering the ID Buzz in the US by &lt;a href="https://media.vw.com/en-us/releases/1812"&gt;announcing pricing, battery range, and initial options&lt;/a&gt; available at launch later this year. The ID Buzz will start at $59,995 for a Pro S model that comes standard with RWD and, crucially, seven seats, as it’s the bigger, long-wheelbase version &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/13/24155355/vw-id-buzz-us-trim-powertrain-details-launch-first-edition"&gt;previously confirmed&lt;/a&gt; for the American market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LfTBTM"&gt;The 2025 ID Buzz now has a finalized EPA-estimated range of 234 miles for RWD models and 231 miles on the 4Motion AWD ones — well under some expected guesses of 300 or so miles on a single charge for a vehicle that has a sizable 91kWh battery.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tpZHnA"&gt;The next model up is the Pro S Plus, which starts at $63,495 for RWD with bench seating standard and $67,995...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lucid CEO calls EV market softness ‘a temporary blip’ and says hybrids are a dead end</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Lucid CEO Peter Rawlinson sitting in the Gravity SUV’s frunk" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xxd-qsLc4vFqY2EEPJ0vEOw7Wuc=/0x167:4000x2834/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73534468/Peter_Rawlinson.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lucid Motors CEO Peter Rawlinson demonstrating the Gravity SUV’s front trunk seating. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Tim Stevens&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r9tbXg"&gt;Different brands do different things under the hoods of their EVs. Some fill that space with inverters and high-voltage cabling. Others carve out a cubby of extra storage, the frunk that many EV aficionados demand but few actually use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9fFvd2"&gt;With the Gravity SUV, Lucid is taking the frunk option a step further, creating a space that can be used as a seat. I confess, I thought it was a gimmick, but sitting in that frunk is surprisingly comfortable. It’s a bit cozy for two adults, as I found when Lucid CEO Peter Rawlinson joined me, but we fit just fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="I9AMNT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Gravity is no longer a concept&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="egF3cI"&gt;Rawlinson was representing Lucid at the Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance, where the Gravity was situated on the so-called “Concept Lawn,” just a few feet...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s new Odyssey monitor lets you play games in glasses-free 3D</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A lifestyle image of the new Samsung Odyssey 3D gaming monitor with a truck emerging from the display." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cX5WQDHD7eoDEO9WIDMATjxpKb8=/78x0:923x563/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73534432/Samsung_TVs_and_Displays_Odyssey_3D_Gamescom_2024_main1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D6rXBh"&gt;Samsung has announced a new Odyssey gaming monitor lineup at gamescom that uses eye-tracking technology to convert 2D visuals into glasses-free 3D. The Odyssey 3D is set for a global release “within this year” &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-unveils-groundbreaking-glasses-free-odyssey-3d-gaming-monitor-at-gamescom-2024"&gt;according to Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, and will allow users to “seamlessly switch between 2D and 3D modes” based on preference — which may tempt folks who are curious about 3D gaming, but apprehensive to commit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ndI7Sl"&gt;The Odyssey 3D is Samsung’s first 3D gaming monitor, having first &lt;a href="https://www.ces.tech/innovation-awards/honorees/2024/best-of/s/samsung-light-field-display.aspx"&gt;teased a concept display at CES&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. It’ll be available in 27- or 37-inch sizes and features a 4K QLED panel with a 165Hz refresh rate, alongside a 1-millisecond response time and support for AMD FreeSync. Both monitors also include a single DisplayPort 1.4 and...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The FTC’s noncompete agreements ban has been struck down</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Photo collage of a photo of the US Capitol building with an image of the Constitution behind it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CyWXhFBGdUB5DogOYK0CqasdCcg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73534295/STK481_STK432_CONGRESS_GOVERNMENT_CIVRGINIA_C.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Cath Virginia / The Verge; Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZVT8G5"&gt;A federal judge has blocked the Federal Trade Commission’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/23/24138559/ftc-noncompete-agreement-ban"&gt;ban on noncompete agreements&lt;/a&gt; that make it difficult for workers to join their employers’ rivals or launch competing businesses. The ruling prevents the FTC’s ban on noncompete agreements from taking effect on September 4th, though the agency could still appeal the decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eqgvb6"&gt;On Tuesday, US District Judge Ada Brown in Dallas, Texas &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txnd.389064/gov.uscourts.txnd.389064.212.0_1.pdf"&gt;ruled that&lt;/a&gt; the antitrust agency exceeded its statutory authority to ban practices related to unfair methods of competition, saying the noncompete agreements ban is “unreasonably overbroad without a reasonable explanation,” and would “cause irreparable harm.” Brown’s decision now stops the FTC from blocking noncompetes nationwide after initially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/3/24191946/ftc-noncompete-ban-judge-preliminary-injunction"&gt;delaying...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s latest security update has ruined dual-boot Windows and Linux PCs</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YMtiY9"&gt;Microsoft’s latest monthly security update is wreaking havoc on dual-boot Windows and Linux systems. The software giant issued a security patch last week to fix a two-year-old vulnerability in the GRUB open-source boot loader used by lots of Linux devices. Microsoft’s patch wasn’t supposed to hit dual-boot devices, but many have found it has and it’s now stopping their Linux installs from booting properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sf1Vr8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/08/a-patch-microsoft-spent-2-years-preparing-is-making-a-mess-for-some-linux-users/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that multiple Linux dual-boot users are seeing “security policy violation” messages, along with “something has gone seriously wrong” errors. There are reports of issues across &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/1euuiwv/please_help_error_verifying_shim_sbat_data_failed/"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/1523353/windows-aug-13-update-broke-my-ubuntu-system"&gt;Ubuntu forums&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?t=427297&amp;amp;sid=dab5f35699069b1d030e710a1eb3c793"&gt;elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>JBL made its charging case touchscreen more useful with a size boost</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A user removing an earbud from the JBL Tour Pro 3’s charging case." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/72OHFUPCZDSYMIEPo6CJOYUzeHU=/1x0:2896x1930/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73534267/jbl_tour_pro3_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The touchscreen on the JBL Tour Pro 3’s charging case is now 30 percent larger.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: JBL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vhyTej"&gt;JBL has announced an upgraded version of its first wireless earbuds with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/30/23328582/jbl-touchscreen-tour-pro-2-charging-case-one-m2-features"&gt;touchscreen charging case&lt;/a&gt;. The new JBL Tour Pro 3’s case features a larger screen and now works as a transmitter, broadcasting audio to the earbuds from a wired source such as a plane’s in-flight entertainment system. However, that larger screen also comes with a steeper price tag. They’ll sell for $299, which is nearly $50 more than the JBL Tour Pro 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y7ZzvF"&gt;The 1.57-inch touchscreen on the JBL Tour Pro 3’s charging case is 30 percent larger than the screen on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23712032/jbl-tour-pro-2-earbuds-smart-case-review"&gt;Tour Pro 2’s&lt;/a&gt;, giving it enough room to fit additional info like the name of the song currently playing. That will potentially make it even more useful as an alternative to reaching for your smartphone if you...&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration: The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ERezbG"&gt;Google is upgrading its Gemini writing tools in Gmail to help you polish drafts that you’ve already written. Now, among other Gemini-powered “Help me write” options like Formalize and Elaborate, you can tap “Polish” to refine your emails, &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/08/refine-emails-faster-with-help-me-write-gmail.html"&gt;Google says in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. The company has also added shortcuts that appear in the body of your emails on Android and iOS, making it more obvious that there are AI writing tools to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BsCijc"&gt;The tools are available to people who pay for Google One AI Premium accounts or who have paid for Google’s Gemini add-on for Workspace. If that’s you, when you open an empty draft, you’ll see a “Help me write” shortcut appear that you can tap to have Gemini draft text for you. Once you have 12 or more words in a draft —...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EbAjKX"&gt;Google will have to face a class action lawsuit that accuses it of collecting users’ data through Chrome without their consent. In &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25052548-google-chrome-class-action-appeal?responsive=1&amp;amp;title=1"&gt;a decision on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, a federal appeals court reversed &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/17386347/935/calhoun-v-google-llc/"&gt;a December 2022 ruling&lt;/a&gt; that dismissed the case, saying the lower court should’ve reviewed Google’s disclosures and determined “whether a reasonable user reading them would think that he or she was consenting to the data collection.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JNf3yu"&gt;The class action lawsuit, &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.363198/gov.uscourts.cand.363198.1.0.pdf"&gt;first filed in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, alleged that Google collected data from Chrome users — regardless of whether they enabled Chrome sync. This feature saves bookmarks, passwords, open tabs, and other data to your Google account, giving you easy access to this information when signed into Chrome on multiple...&lt;/p&gt;

But I guess you have to go big when the lawsuit against &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; accuses you of using &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/14/24001274/temu-shein-lawsuit-ecommerce-merchant-intimidation-copyright-infringement-dmca"&gt;“Mafia-style” intimidation tactics.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

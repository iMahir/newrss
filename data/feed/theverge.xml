    <title>YouTube’s missing hits will come back now that it has a deal with SESAC</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r5W9s0"&gt;YouTube has reached a deal with the music licensing organization SESAC that will bring back songs that were removed over the weekend. Many hit songs from artists such as Adele, Nirvana, and others disappeared, which YouTube blamed on the lack of an agreement to renew its existing deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aGzLH6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sesac.com/"&gt;SESAC&lt;/a&gt; stands for the Society of European Stage Authors and Composers, and its website says that it “currently licenses the public performance of more than 1.5 million songs on behalf of its 15,000+ affiliated songwriters, composers, and music publishers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OHr62Y"&gt;As of 4:25PM ET, removed songs like &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQHsXMglC9A"&gt;Adele’s &lt;em&gt;Hello&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8JflBNovLE"&gt;Kanye West’s &lt;em&gt;Power&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are still not playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wb947E"&gt;“We’re pleased that SESAC reconsidered our offer. We’ve reached a deal and content will come back up...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Echo Hub smart home controller is down to a new all-time low price </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A small touchscreen tablet on a counter next to some flowers." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VCRYTkY87zbkdrQZrYCeFQIEyS8=/0x0:2700x1800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73622178/247023_Echo_Hub_JTuohy_0018.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="71oZoM"&gt;Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24248182/amazon-october-prime-day-best-early-deals-echo-speakers-displays-fire-tablets-sale"&gt;offered some pretty good deals&lt;/a&gt; ahead of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/17/24244180/amazon-october-prime-day-big-deal-days-fall-dates-2024"&gt;Prime Big Deal Days sale&lt;/a&gt; last week and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays"&gt;continues to do so&lt;/a&gt;, but admittedly, we’ve seen most of these discounted prices before. Today’s deal on the &lt;strong&gt;Echo Hub &lt;/strong&gt;is the exception, though, as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Hub/dp/B0BCR7M9KX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is now selling it at a new all-time low price of $124.99 ($55 off). That’s a deal available only to Prime members, but other retailers like &lt;a href="https://howl.me/cncBpGz6Kbz"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/2161451/2092?subId1=verge093024&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-hub-8-34-smart-home-control-panel-with-alexa-white%2F-%2FA-90004553" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; are also matching this deal in case you’re not signed up for Prime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="QwHyk6"&gt;As a refresher, the Echo Hub is a smart home controller housed in a small, Fire tablet-like device you can choose to mount up on the wall. It makes controlling a smart home incredibly simple; all you need to do is tap its eight-inch touchscreen, and you can adjust smart...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leaked Google Pixel 9A renders reveal a visor-free look</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Flat-edged smartphone with two cameras on rear and a hole punch camera on front" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8p4fEmkVAyLoLEXuwRy2EeU2Oco=/0x0:4168x2779/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73621897/Pixel_9a_5K2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 9A looks a lot like the Pixel 9, only with its sunglasses removed.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: OnLeaks / Android Headlines&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GIK0kO"&gt;Google’s first leak of the fall is here, with new renders of its upcoming Pixel 9A posted online for the world to see. As with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/26/24141503/google-pixel-8a-leaked-specs-security-updates"&gt;Pixel 8A leak&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-9a"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Headlines&lt;/em&gt; has yet again&lt;/a&gt; acquired images of Google’s next budget A-series release, this time by way of &lt;em&gt;OnLeaks&lt;/em&gt;, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/23/24048246/pixel-9-pro-leak-specs-google"&gt;responsible&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/25/24205904/google-pixel-9-leak-marketing-materials"&gt;for spoiling&lt;/a&gt; the recent Pixel 9 lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TkzjrB"&gt;The big change coming on the Pixel 9A, according to the leak, is that it won’t feature Google’s now-signature visor look for its camera housing. Instead, it seems like there are two cameras in a pill-shaped module that sits almost flush with the rear of the phone. A camera flash is set to the right, making it look like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/a/apple-iphone-7-review-vs-iphone-7-plus"&gt;the rear of an iPhone 7 Plus&lt;/a&gt; but magnified. The rest of the body looks similar to...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This smart front door can go from clear to opaque with a voice command</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5VeKyM2BuvEt041gWH8FxBubhJs=/0x0:1000x667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73621884/Feather_River_Door_4.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Home Depot’s newest smart door features smart glass that can turn from opaque to clear with the press of a button or a smart home command.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: The Home Depot&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HlqsHE"&gt;Glass front doors are great for letting light in during the day but not so great when you want privacy at night. The Home Depot has a smart solution for this problem — a glass front door that can switch from clear to opaque on a schedule, with a voice command, or by pressing a button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZr0GF"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://homedepot.sjv.io/c/482924/456723/8154?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.homedepot.com%2Fp%2FFeather-River-Doors-Smart-Glass-36-in-W-x-80-in-Right-Hand-Inswing-3-4-Lite-Smooth-Unfinished-Fiberglass-Prehung-Front-Door-FH5FSP210T1%2F330797847&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;smart glass Feather River door&lt;/a&gt; is a prehung fiberglass front door with built-in smart glass. A button on the door lets you change the glass from clear to opaque, and it works with &lt;a href="https://homedepot.sjv.io/c/482924/456723/8154?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.homedepot.com%2Fb%2FSmart-Home%2FHubspace%2FN-5yc1vZc1jwZ1z1pr0w&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The Home Depot’s Hubspace smart home app&lt;/a&gt; to control it from your phone. You can also set the glass on a schedule and have it be clear during the day and opaque at night. The door costs $798 for a three-quarters lite, $899 for a half lite, and $998 for a full lite, similar to...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cruise hit with $1.5 million fine for failing to report robotaxi crash involving pedestrian</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Regulators To Vote On San Francisco Robotaxi Expansion" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h_L1QFN3PAp-fg3jifglOrST8mE=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73621868/1590512040.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GbWqk1"&gt;Cruise’s failure to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/24/23930629/california-dmv-suspends-cruise-robotaxi-permit-safety"&gt;disclose the fact that a pedestrian was seriously injured&lt;/a&gt; by one of its driverless vehicles in San Francisco last year has now resulted in a $1.5 million fine to the federal government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qKe96C"&gt;Last October, a Cruise vehicle hit a pedestrian and then dragged her 20 feet after she was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/3/23901233/cruise-crash-hit-run-pedestrian-injury-sf-robotaxi"&gt;initially struck by a human driver in a hit-and-run incident&lt;/a&gt;. In the aftermath, Cruise disclosed that its vehicle had struck a pedestrian but omitted details about the victim being dragged.  As a result, the California Department of Motor Vehicles pulled the GM-backed company’s permit to operate self-driving cars in the state, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration launched an investigation into the incident. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PrjeHu"&gt;Today, NHTSA...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hurricane Helene barreled through a crucial chip mining area in North Carolina </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oCxX05"&gt;Hurricane Helene brought historic rainfall and flooding to western North Carolina last week, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-north-carolina-asheville-f02869c7d01e68f2d7f0553abb82252f"&gt;leaving dozens dead and catastrophic damage&lt;/a&gt; stretching across the state’s mountain towns. The devastation also reached the small town of Spruce Pine, which is home to the purest quartz on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q8dWKr"&gt;Spruce Pine’s high-quality quartz is an essential ingredient in the chipmaking process, as &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/bespoke/made-on-earth/how-the-chip-changed-everything/"&gt;it’s the only naturally occurring source&lt;/a&gt; of the ultrapure mineral. The quartz mined from this area is used as a crucible to melt polysilicon, which is then used to produce silicon wafers — the base of a semiconductor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="26gUVI"&gt;Even though it’s possible to produce pure silicon from the quartz found in abundance elsewhere in the world, it takes a considerable amount of time...&lt;/p&gt;

The governor signed one and vetoed two others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iTgKjp"&gt;For the second time in two years, Newsom vetoed legislation (AB 2286) that would have banned autonomous trucks from operating on public roads. He also vetoed another (AB 3061) that would set up new data reporting requirements for AV companies. And he signed a third bill into law (AB 1777) that would create guidelines for when an autonomous vehicle gets in a crash or encounters first responders. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reddit is making sitewide protests basically impossible</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An image showing the Reddit logo on a red and white background" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oLis6xIvYqPUW5Eg6Fe04N2niU4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73621714/STK115_Reddit_04.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration: The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ujn79V"&gt;Reddit is giving its staff a lot more power over the communities on its platform. Starting today, Reddit moderators will not be able to change if their subreddit is public or private without first submitting a request to a Reddit admin. The policy applies to adjusting all &lt;a href="https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/15484546290068-Community-settings#h_01H15ATSVVNG35T5X4Y0G3JNKJ"&gt;community types&lt;/a&gt;, meaning moderators will have to request to make a switch from safe for work to not safe for work, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZfGDFU"&gt;By requiring admin approval for the changes, Reddit is taking away a lever many communities used to protest the company’s API pricing changes last year. By going private, the community becomes inaccessible to the public, making the platform less usable for the average visitor. And that’s part of the reason behind the change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZEmot2"&gt;“The ability to instantly...&lt;/p&gt;

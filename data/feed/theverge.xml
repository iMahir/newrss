    <title>OpenAI is partnering with defense tech company Anduril</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Illustration of the OpenAI logo on an orange background with purple lines" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kqlud2FxMFbOWJIW-Op48YUPb1A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73767020/STK149_AI_01.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GK7Bsd"&gt;OpenAI, the AI model maker that &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/02/17/844721/ai-openai-moonshot-elon-musk-sam-altman-greg-brockman-messy-secretive-reality/"&gt;used to describe its mission as saving the world&lt;/a&gt;, is partnering with Anduril, a military contractor, the two companies announced Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oDIPHe"&gt;As part of the partnership, OpenAI will integrate its software into Anduril’s counterdrone systems, which detect and take down drones. It’s OpenAI’s first partnership with a defense contractor — and a significant reversal of its earlier stance towards the military. OpenAI’s terms of service once banned “military and warfare” use of its technology, but it softened its position on military use earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/12/24036397/openai-is-softening-its-stance-on-military-use"&gt;changing its terms of service&lt;/a&gt; in January to remove the proscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cQLPRj"&gt;“OpenAI builds AI to benefit as many people as possible, and supports U.S.-led efforts to ensure the technology upholds democratic values,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a &lt;a href="https://www.anduril.com/article/anduril-partners-with-openai-to-advance-u-s-artificial-intelligence-leadership-and-protect-u-s/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “Our partnership with Anduril will help ensure OpenAI technology protects U.S. military personnel, and will help the national security community understand and responsibly use this technology to keep our citizens safe and free.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4O2e1B"&gt;As the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; notes, Anduril — currently valued at $14 billion — has a $200 million counterdrone systems contract with the Marine Corps. But OpenAI won’t just benefit financially from its Anduril partnership; it also stands to gain political clout. Anduril co-founder Palmer Luckey was an early supporter of president-elect Donald Trump, and also has ties to Elon Musk, one of the heads of the still-nebulous (and still nonexistent) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/22/24302735/elon-musk-doge-vivek-ramaswamy-rage-curtis-yarvin"&gt;Department of Government Efficiency&lt;/a&gt;. And the America First Policy Institute, a right-wing think-tank working closely with the Trump transition team, has proposed that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24282719/tech-leaders-trump-jeff-bezos-zuckerberg-pichai"&gt;Trump embrace AI&lt;/a&gt; to create a new “Manhattan Project” for defense.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon is once again raising its fees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vector illustration of the Verizon logo." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J-FZKygOrVHwkO1iWhpi9e1uvi8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73766998/STK066_VERIZON_A.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The fee creep is back. | Image: Cath Virginia / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6hRiwy"&gt;Verizon customers will soon see yet another fee increase on their next bill, a game that wireless carriers love to play. As &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/verizons-hidden-fee-just-went-up-without-anyone-noticing/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Verizon customers &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/verizon/comments/1h5evtu/verizon_fee_is_going_up_again/"&gt;on reddit&lt;/a&gt; noticed the small fee bump — just 20 cents extra per line. But it comes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/16/23075448/verizon-phone-bill-increase-administrative-fee"&gt;only a couple of years after a bigger increase&lt;/a&gt; to the “Administrative and Telco Recovery Charge” the company tacks onto monthly bills, and Verizon’s claim that it’s just the cost of doing business seems dubious at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FqQ8tG"&gt;Verizon spokesperson George Koroneos confirmed the fee hike to &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;saying that “Starting December 18, the monthly Verizon wireless Administrative and Telco Recovery Charge will increase by $0.20 per line for mobile voice (basic phones, Second Number, smartphones, etc.) and data-only (hotspots, tablets, etc.) products. Verizon Home Internet services are not affected.” That takes the fee from $3.30 to $3.50 for each voice line on a plan and $1.40 up to $1.60 per data line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="title-cardPromo-5930d7b37f"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/support/surcharges/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a Verizon support page&lt;/a&gt;, the fee “helps defray and recover certain direct and indirect costs we or our agents incur,” including network operating and maintenance costs. AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile have slightly different names for the same fee, and all make basically the same claim about offsetting the costs of running a wireless network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNdSbP"&gt;A more cynical perspective is that these wireless companies separate this fee from their monthly rate plan charges so they can raise rates without saying they’re raising rates. That was the basis for a class-action lawsuit against AT&amp;amp;T in 2022, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/12/23069156/att-vianu-lawsuit-class-action-administrative-fee"&gt;that company agreed to settle&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UBEN6I"&gt;It may just be 20 cents now, but that small increase adds up to a lot when you multiply it across millions of users. After all, Verizon &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-delivers-strong-third-quarter-results-customer-growth-mobility-extending-industry" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;only made $3.4 billion&lt;/a&gt; in net income the third quarter this year, down from $4.9 billion in the same quarter last year. And while the fee creep is nothing new, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/27/23810590/verizon-att-unlimited-elite-legacy-plan-rate-adjustment-5g-start"&gt;yet another&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/13/24243817/verizon-halved-my-10-autopay-discount-out-of-the-blue-just-because-it-can"&gt;reminder of of the levers&lt;/a&gt; these companies can pull in order to pad out their bottom line. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peloton’s new audio-based app is like an invisible strength coach</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A stock image featuring the Peloton logo." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p9UCzeaLc1fQLIJ39-CXtuVSbOM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73766856/acastro_STK119_Peleton_03.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Strength Plus app isn’t Peloton’s first attempt at capitalizing on strength training. | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pQdko9"&gt;Peloton &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.onepeloton.com%2Fpress%2Farticles%2Fstrength-app-dedicated-to-strength-training-launches-out-of-beta&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F12%2F4%2F24313321%2Fpeloton-strength-plus-app-strength-training" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the launch of Strength Plus, a new standalone, audio-based strength training app. The app was introduced in a limited beta program earlier in September, but is now officially available.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b7D40D"&gt;The Strength Plus app allows users to generate custom workouts by choosing&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;workout length, equipment, experience level, and which muscle groups they want to focus on. It also includes multi-week&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;programs curated by Peloton’s strength coaches, though workouts can be done at a user’s own pace. Strength Plus includes audio cues and tips from instructors, as well as a library of instructional videos demonstrating exercises and equipment setup. It’s more like a strength training playlist than Peloton’s typical classes, which have you follow an instructor as they do the workout in real time.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;It works with the Apple Watch and users can log weights and reps within the app. And, instead of being stuck with instructor-curated workout music, users can listen to their own music, audio books, or podcasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="E2UbAg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Peloton Guide review: a webcam that watches you squat ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/23009893/peloton-guide-review-fitness"},{"title":"Peloton’s&amp;amp;nbsp;bumpy ride","url":"https://www.theverge.com/c/24105625/peloton-bike-tread-plus-business-valuation-history"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DMkqRh"&gt;This move isn’t surprising. Over the years, Peloton has repeatedly mentioned that strength training is its second most popular exercise type, though the company has had mixed success in capitalizing on it. In 2022, Peloton launched its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23009893/peloton-guide-review-fitness"&gt;Guide&lt;/a&gt; strength training hardware, but it hasn’t taken off like its treadmills or bikes. When it revamped the Peloton app, it also added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/23/23734329/peloton-app-subscription-tiers-fitness"&gt;Peloton Gym workouts&lt;/a&gt; that catered to gym-goers with written workouts and video demos, though that wasn’t its own app, didn’t let you log reps, and didn’t include multi-week programming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Renders of Peloton Strength Plus app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iP8OODg0V4Wa6YwgNGbXGQhlhQ4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25773648/Strength__PR_Imagery_Screens.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Peloton&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peloton really wants to make strength training work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fZvPm9"&gt;On paper, Strength Plus looks similar to other apps, most notably &lt;a href="https://www.joinladder.com/"&gt;Ladder&lt;/a&gt;. (So much so, that Ladder has already clapped back with &lt;a href="https://www.joinladder.com/flattered"&gt;an entire Mac vs PC-style ad campaign&lt;/a&gt;.) The main difference is that Strength Plus leverages Peloton’s more widely known instructors. More broadly, this could be seen as an attempt to expand Peloton’s appeal outside the home — something the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/24105625/peloton-bike-tread-plus-business-valuation-history"&gt;has struggled to do&lt;/a&gt; after many people began returning to in-person gyms and classes once covid-19 lockdowns were lifted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7f1hOh"&gt;Existing Peloton All Access, Guide, and App Plus members can access the Strength Plus app for free. For everyone else, Peloton is offering a limited $1 monthly promotional subscription for the first six months, and then $9.99 monthly after. For now, the app will also be iOS only. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; asked Peloton whether it plans to expand further to Android, but didn’t immediately receive a response. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple now lets you sync your passwords with Firefox, but not on Windows</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Firefox logo on a black background" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/INr9nQgetuCAxzgvGWbzvgRbzfU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73766786/acastro_200207_3900_firefox_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S7EoCn"&gt;If you keep your passwords stored on Apple’s iCloud, you can access those passwords on Firefox through an &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/icloud-passwords/"&gt;official iCloud Passwords extension&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/04/apple-icloud-passwords-firefox-add-on/"&gt;as spotted by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. However, the extension only supports macOS Sonoma or later, so you won’t be able to use it with Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pn2Fj3"&gt;If you do need to access your iCloud passwords on Windows, you can access them by downloading iCloud for Windows and the iCloud Passwords extension for Chrome or Edge instead. We’ve asked Apple if it plans to add support for Windows to its Firefox extension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Tq9qB"&gt;Another developer originally made the Firefox extension, but Apple has taken it over, according to &lt;a href="https://github.com/au2001/icloud-passwords-firefox?tab=readme-ov-file#update-2024-12-04"&gt;a notice on the extension’s GitHub page&lt;/a&gt;. Apple is “now the sole owners in charge of maintaining their own official iCloud Passwords extension,” the developer says. The extension’s repository and source code aren’t linked to it anymore except for “historical reasons.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kpuGUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nissan needs a little something extra to connect the Ariya to Tesla’s Superchargers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="a Tesla NACS adapter with a plastic tab next to it" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ke55j6tqO4YlqXbOdh0TiZlybKo=/0x0:4258x2839/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73766761/Screenshot_2024_12_04_at_2.04.54_PM.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m sorry, I put that thing in what?&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nissan&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rgjpwg"&gt;Nissan put out &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G17dX4-ss3w"&gt;a tutorial video for Ariya owners today&lt;/a&gt; that shows how to use a Tesla NACS adapter with the vehicle, and it includes a step completely out of left field: shove a small piece of plastic into your car’s CCS port before you connect the adapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4kKCAg"&gt;The Ariya is Nissan’s first EV with a CCS port, and the automaker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/15/24270716/nissan-energy-charge-network-mynissan-app-ariya-tesla-adapter"&gt;just activated&lt;/a&gt; the vehicle’s ability to connect to Tesla’s vast Supercharger network in October. Other manufacturers have also adopted Tesla’s NACS standard, with companies like Ford and Rivian already shipping adapters to current EV owners. But none of those EVs need you to take a confusing extra step to make the adapter work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OulLWG"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G17dX4-ss3w?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h5MnIA"&gt;As explained in the video, the NACS adapter available through Nissan includes a “plug adapter” that must be installed into the hourglass-shaped cavity between the two DC pins at the bottom before charging at NACS-capable fast charging stations. Nissan assures the viewer that its “simple” and requires no tools. However, you will need to use the adapter it provides or from a US dealership, which may mean other third-party options like the Lectron adapter might not work. (Probably for the best, considering the Lectron adapter was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24284413/ford-made-nacs-css-tesla-complementary-adapter-launch"&gt;recently recalled&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nsaUfI"&gt;What’s odd about the Ariya’s charge port is that despite being a standard that works at many CCS-capable fast charging stations, there is some negative hollow space between the two direct current pins at the bottom that isn’t present on most other EVs. The plastic piece that Nissan wants you to stuff into the opening fills in the gap to look more like other CCS ports. We asked Nissan what the purpose of the opening is and why the insert is needed, but have not heard back at time of publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ljOG3i"&gt;Nissan’s other EV model is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/4/23290517/nissan-leaf-ev-discontinued-electric-car-legacy"&gt;pioneering Leaf&lt;/a&gt;, which uses the all-but-obsolete CHAdeMO standard and probably won’t get some magic adapter to connect to Tesla’s Supercharger network (although there are some &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wydql2N_F-k"&gt;CHAdeMO to CCS adapters&lt;/a&gt; now).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gdVQx3"&gt;EV ownership is already rife with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23797527/ev-charging-ccs-nacs-tesla-adapter-guide"&gt;competing standards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/17/23308612/ev-charging-broken-unreliable-survey-jd-power"&gt;janky software&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/2/24260316/juicebox-ev-chargers-enel-x-way-closing-discontinued-app"&gt;fragmented confusion&lt;/a&gt;. Somehow, Nissan managed to add another step that leaves customers juggling multiple pieces of plastic just to get their $40,000 electric SUV to operate properly.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trump picks two nominees who could decide the fate of Big Tech and crypto</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An image showing Donald Trump on a red and green background" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IHKsW9eTLpJkgB8kSnNYCX-Rhoc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73766632/VRG_Illo_STK175_L_Normand_DonaldTrump_Negative.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Laura Normand / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pRinkk"&gt;President-elect Donald Trump made two nominations Wednesday that will shape significant parts of his administration’s tech enforcement, if confirmed by the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GhEit8"&gt;Former Republican Securities and Exchange Commissioner Paul Atkins &lt;a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113595807734621827"&gt;is Trump’s pick&lt;/a&gt; to lead the agency, replacing Biden-appointed chair and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24280387/gary-gensler-sec-chair-presidential-election-2024"&gt;crypto foil Gary Gensler&lt;/a&gt;. The selection of Atkins, who co-chairs the Token Alliance at the Digital Chamber, a group dedicated to the use of digital assets, suggests a sharp divergence from Biden-era crypto policy. In his announcement, Trump says Atkins “recognizes that digital assets &amp;amp; other innovations are crucial to Making America Greater than Ever Before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MniJVn"&gt;Trump &lt;a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113595703893773894"&gt;also selected Gail Slater&lt;/a&gt; to lead the Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division, which is currently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/27/24302415/doj-google-search-antitrust-remedies-chrome-android"&gt;litigating two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/25/24305748/google-doj-ad-tech-monopoly-closing-arguments"&gt;anti-monopoly suits&lt;/a&gt; against Google, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301660/apple-doj-motion-dismiss-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;third against Apple&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-03/nvidia-gets-doj-subpoena-in-escalating-antitrust-investigation"&gt;reportedly probing AI-chipmaker Nvidia&lt;/a&gt;. Slater has previously worked at the Federal Trade Commission, in Trump’s National Economic Counsel, and most recently as Vice President-elect JD Vance’s economic policy advisor in his Senate office. She’s also worked at Fox, Roku, and the now-defunct Internet Association, whose member included several Big Tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Lp1kQl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Trump is borrowing a favorite term of Marc Andreessen’s in with his reference to “Little Tech”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GbB7fA"&gt;In his announcement on Truth Social, Trump writes that, “Big Tech has run wild for years, stifling competition in our most innovative sector and, as we all know, using its market power to crack down on the rights of so many Americans, as well as those of Little Tech!” Trump is borrowing a favorite term of Marc Andreessen’s in with his reference to “Little Tech.” Andreessen — a venture capitalist and crypto supporter who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/24/24204706/marc-andreessen-ben-horowitz-a16z-trump-donations"&gt;publicly backed Trump in the election&lt;/a&gt; — has pushed for the recognition of a &lt;a href="https://a16z.com/the-little-tech-agenda/"&gt;contrast between policies that benefit startups&lt;/a&gt; versus the largest tech players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ALxK2N"&gt;Slater has historically worked across the aisle, having served as an attorney advisor to former Democratic FTC Commissioner Julie Brill (who now works as Microsoft’s chief privacy officer). Her history working for Vance — who has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24199314/jd-vance-donald-trump-vp-antitrust-big-tech-ftc-lina-khan-elizabeth-warren-google"&gt;publicly praised Biden’s FTC Chair Lina Khan&lt;/a&gt; for her aggressive approach toward tech — suggests Big Tech is likely to remain a key target of antitrust scrutiny in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sam Altman lowers the bar for AGI</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Photo collage of Sam Altman in front of the OpenAI logo." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xeYc3ErUBT4G5h8ax0Bdka2n7s4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73766628/STK201_SAM_ALTMAN_CVIRGINIA_D.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Cath Virginia / The Verge; Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XHGpOs"&gt;Nearly two years ago, OpenAI &lt;a href="https://openai.com/index/planning-for-agi-and-beyond/"&gt;said that&lt;/a&gt; artificial general intelligence, or AGI — the thing the company was created to build — could “elevate humanity” and “give everyone incredible new capabilities.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cU6aN8"&gt;Now, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is trying to lower expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7g2CI9"&gt;“My guess is we will hit AGI sooner than most people in the world think and it will matter much less,” he said during an interview with Andrew Ross Sorkin at &lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;DealBook Summit on Wednesday. “And a lot of the safety concerns that we and others expressed actually don’t come at the AGI moment. AGI can get built, the world mostly goes on in mostly the same way, things grow faster, but then there is a long continuation from what we call AGI to what we call superintelligence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VKgXCO"&gt;This isn’t the first time Altman has downplayed the now seemingly imminent arrival of AGI, which OpenAI’s charter &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI9ziIAjO6E"&gt;once said&lt;/a&gt; will be able to “automate the great majority of intellectual labor.” He has &lt;a href="https://x.com/tsarnick/status/1854988648745517297"&gt;recently teased&lt;/a&gt; that it could arrive as soon as 2025 and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1ggixzy/comment/luq8i5s/"&gt;will be achievable&lt;/a&gt; on existing hardware. We at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24278999/openai-plans-orion-ai-model-release-december"&gt;have heard&lt;/a&gt; that OpenAI intends to weave together its large language models and declare that to be AGI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="HoQT1l"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Departing OpenAI leader says no company is ready for AGI","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24278694/openai-agi-readiness-miles-brundage-ai-safety"},{"title":"Here’s how OpenAI will determine how powerful its AI systems are","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/11/24196746/heres-how-openai-will-determine-how-powerful-its-ai-systems-are"},{"title":"Anthropic’s CEO thinks AI will lead to a utopia — he just needs a few billion dollars first","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24268209/anthropic-ai-dario-amodei-agi-funding-blog"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Threads takes an important baby step toward true fediverse integration</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An image showing the Threads logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rFVG8Su2gCZSoJwvJOp8fCsDKXw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73766546/STK156_Instagram_threads_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration: The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XBrKYb"&gt;You can now follow fediverse accounts on Threads, &lt;a href="https://www.threads.net/@zuck/post/DDKf6uTPWSg?xmt=AQGzH_KYvkU3Q-rcEm1AkiaGtQBYblDR1xLXpXp9R15yNA"&gt;Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has announced&lt;/a&gt;. Threads rolled out fediverse users’ likes and replies in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185226/meta-threads-fediverse-likes-replies"&gt;very limited way at first&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s the same here — fediverse posts won’t appear in your feeds, and you can only follow those accounts if they’ve interacted with a post on Threads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gwVH6g"&gt;While fediverse posts won’t show in feeds, Instagram head Adam Mosseri says their profile and posts do &lt;em&gt;appear&lt;/em&gt; on Threads, and you have the option to get notifications when they publish. That’s something, at least. Mosseri posted a video of what the process looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oCjDGq"&gt;
&lt;div class="iframely-embed"&gt;&lt;div class="iframely-responsive" style="padding-bottom: 177.5%;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.threads.net/@mosseri/post/DDKjIdtv0OR" data-iframely-url="https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.threads.net%2F%40mosseri%2Fpost%2FDDKjIdtv0OR%3Fxmt%3DAQGzB2lnTuZCERRIrJzbM5bFAQAiXwybdG_Xtgz1O6fUfg&amp;amp;key=9ef4a209439e42bc59783ba959d50197"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://cdn.iframe.ly/embed.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="etPKUN"&gt;Zuckerberg says you can follow fediverse accounts when you see they’ve “liked, followed, or replied” to a federated Threads profile, but there’s one other way you might find them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kaw39P"&gt;“On web and android today (and iOS soon), we’ll start linkifying Fediverse usernames in posts,” &lt;a href="https://www.threads.net/@pcottle/post/DDKj4Doxj6e?xmt=AQGzB2lnTuZCERRIrJzbM5bFAQAiXwybdG_Xtgz1O6fUfg"&gt;wrote Threads developer Peter Cottle&lt;/a&gt; among a &lt;a href="https://www.threads.net/@pcottle/post/DDKj2mdxwU4?xmt=AQGzB2lnTuZCERRIrJzbM5bFAQAiXwybdG_Xtgz1O6fUfg"&gt;series of posts&lt;/a&gt; about the new integration. Cottle added that your account will need to be federated and that the fediverse account must be “eligible to be followed.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dRU2sw"&gt;Cottle also demonstrated that you can tag fediverse accounts, linking to &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; actor and activist George Takei’s Mastodon account: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9V08X3"&gt;
&lt;div class="iframely-embed"&gt;&lt;div class="iframely-responsive" style="padding-bottom: 100%;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.threads.net/@pcottle/post/DDKj4lpxUaf" data-iframely-url="https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.threads.net%2F%40pcottle%2Fpost%2FDDKj4lpxUaf%3Fxmt%3DAQGzB2lnTuZCERRIrJzbM5bFAQAiXwybdG_Xtgz1O6fUfg&amp;amp;key=9ef4a209439e42bc59783ba959d50197"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://cdn.iframe.ly/embed.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oxxaKn"&gt;Meta’s Seine Kim tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email that the platform’s “goal remains to grow the fediverse responsibly, prioritizing the success of a safe, diverse, content-rich, and interoperable community.” Kim added that the change is another step in Threads’ plan to become fully interoperable with the fediverse in time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FNx83e"&gt;Notably though, new Threads features have picked up the pace in recent weeks. Maybe that’s got something to do with all the attention Bluesky’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/23/24303502/bluesky-next-twitter-threads-x"&gt;been getting lately&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9rbbg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nokia’s classic Snake game is now a Nothing widget</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A widget version of the classic game Snake being played on a Nothing smartphone." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mhcg7mipr-SaOGsxx-r4C8QDegY=/0x0:1080x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73766450/nothing1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new Nothing Community Widgets app has launched with a Snake game as its first offering.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nothing&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tigukp"&gt;Nothing has released a new Android app called &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nothing.communitywidgets"&gt;Nothing Community Widgets&lt;/a&gt; that will highlight home screen tools and games co-created by its users. The first widget it includes is a recreation of &lt;em&gt;Snake &lt;/em&gt;which was the most memorable of the three games pre-installed on the Nokia 6110 when it launched 26 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WxARs6"&gt;Although the original game was played by pressing buttons as cellphones lacked touchscreens, the snake in Nothing’s version is steered using directional screen swipes, while a double tap pauses the action, &lt;a href="https://retrododo.com/nothing-adds-retro-snake-game-to-their-smartphones-widgets/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Retro Dodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But the gameplay is the same, with players scoring points by eating red dots while trying to avoid colliding with themselves as the snake grows longer and longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2cgwnu"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" align="center"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;10/10!  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I learned a lot from this project and enjoyed every minute of it✨&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note: These are just concepts, The idea of this project was to explore the possibilities, bringing them to life is an incredibly hard job.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks everyone for the support❤️&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Project files below ) &lt;a href="https://t.co/JGEV9YIp1N"&gt;pic.twitter.com/JGEV9YIp1N&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Rahul Janardhanan (@raonehere) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/raonehere/status/1749069277960057048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 21, 2024&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rmD6xY"&gt;The inspiration for the new widget came from &lt;a href="https://bento.me/rahuljanardhanan"&gt;Rahul Janardhanan&lt;/a&gt;, an artist who earlier this year &lt;a href="https://x.com/raonehere/status/1749069277960057048"&gt;designed and shared a collection of 10 concepts&lt;/a&gt; for potential Nothing OS widgets. Janardhanan’s work &lt;a href="https://nothing.community/d/20998-community-widgets-snake-game"&gt;caught the eye of the company&lt;/a&gt; and Nothing’s software team worked with a community developer to create the widget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9MjynI"&gt;The new &lt;em&gt;Snake&lt;/em&gt; game widget, and Nothing’s new widgets app, follow a similar initiative by Nothing to work with its community of users. In October, the company announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24282844/nothing-phone-2a-plus-community-edition-glowing"&gt;Nothing Phone 2A Plus Community Edition&lt;/a&gt; featuring an updated glow-in-the-dark design, new wallpapers, and even packaging that was created by the company’s “most talented followers.”&lt;/p&gt;

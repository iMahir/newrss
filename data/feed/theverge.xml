    <title>Trump’s pick for FTC chair promises to go after ‘censorship’ from tech companies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A photograph of Andrew Ferguson." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Eo6mhJ_rVhIPbqXbol_Gxd1XnzE=/0x115:3149x2214/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73779473/commissioner_andrew_n_ferguson_res.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: FTC&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q79QdD"&gt;President-elect Donald Trump has selected Andrew Ferguson to be the next chair of the Federal Trade Commission. Ferguson will take over for Lina Khan, who has earned praise &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24199314/jd-vance-donald-trump-vp-antitrust-big-tech-ftc-lina-khan-elizabeth-warren-google"&gt;from Vice President-elect J.D. Vance&lt;/a&gt; for her efforts to fight big tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NG1OFh"&gt;“Andrew has a proven record of standing up to Big Tech censorship, and protecting Freedom of Speech in our Great Country,” Trump says in &lt;a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113631003888738065"&gt;a post on Truth Social&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CNEIdv"&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://punchbowl.news/article/tech/ftc-commissioner-artificial-intelligence-trans-care/"&gt;document obtained by &lt;em&gt;Punchbowl News&lt;/em&gt;’ Ben Brody&lt;/a&gt;, Ferguson’s pitch for the job included intentions to “reverse Lina Khan’s anti-business agenda,” “hold big tech accountable and stop censorship,” and “protect freedom of speech and fight wokeness.” The document also said Ferguson would “fight back against the trans agenda.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDD9ry"&gt;Ferguson was first sworn in as an FTC commissioner in April, but Trump says that Ferguson will begin his role as chair on “day one” of his administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="gAhHdF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Trump names Brendan Carr as his FCC leader","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/17/24299207/brendan-carr-fcc-chairman-trump"},{"title":"David Sacks is Trump’s AI and crypto ‘czar’","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24314514/trump-david-sacks-white-house-ai-crypto-czar"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i7WfMH"&gt;“At the FTC, we will end Big Tech’s vendetta against competition and free speech,” Ferguson &lt;a href="https://x.com/AFergusonFTC/status/1866641731892154546"&gt;writes in a post on X&lt;/a&gt;. “We will make sure that America is the world’s technological leader and the best place for innovators to bring new ideas to life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5O48vr"&gt;Trump &lt;a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113631103871440926"&gt;also announced&lt;/a&gt; that he is nominating Mark Meador, currently a partner at an antitrust law firm, to be an FTC commissioner.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WordPress parent company must stop blocking WP Engine, judge rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vector illustration of the WordPress logo." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NGD3-0zn3n-HyN_aD_Jfv5kbkeQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73779405/STK302_WORDPRESS_C.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Cath Virginia / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dfxvb8"&gt;WP Engine just won a preliminary injunction against WordPress.com parent company Automattic. On Tuesday, a California District Court &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25451524-wp-engine-v-wordpress-injunction/"&gt;judge ordered Automattic to stop blocking&lt;/a&gt; WP Engine’s access to WordPress.org resources and interfering with its plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OQI8Ki"&gt;The preliminary injunction comes after WP Engine, a third-party WordPress hosting service, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/3/24261016/wordpress-wp-engine-lawsuit-automattic-matt-mullenweg"&gt;filed a lawsuit that accused&lt;/a&gt; Automattic and its CEO, Matt Mullenweg, of “multiple forms of immediate irreparable harm.” It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/18/24273448/wp-engine-injunction-matt-mullenweg-wordpress-resources"&gt;later asked the court to stop Mullenweg&lt;/a&gt; from restricting WP Engine’s access to &lt;a href="http://WordPress.org"&gt;WordPress.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ALqxdX"&gt;Mullenweg &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/27/24256361/wordpress-wp-engine-drama-explained-matt-mullenweg"&gt;waged a public campaign against&lt;/a&gt; WP Engine in September, accusing the service of misusing the WordPress trademark and not contributing enough to the WordPress community. After blocking WP Engine from WordPress.org’s servers, Automattic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/12/24268637/wordpress-org-matt-mullenweg-acf-fork-secure-custom-fields-wp-engine"&gt;took control of WP Engine’s ACF Plugin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lSl9XB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"WordPress cofounder asks court to dismiss WP Engine’s lawsuit","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24284537/wordpress-court-dismiss-wp-engine-lawsuit"},{"title":"Matt Mullenweg: ‘WordPress.org just belongs to me’ ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24262232/matt-mullenweg-wordpress-org-wp-engine"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NSsSNm"&gt;Judge Araceli Martínez-Olguín found merit in WP Engine’s claims that Automattic’s actions harmed business relationships, saying Mullenweg’s “conduct is designed to induce breach or disruption.” As for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/23/24277666/wordpress-org-is-not-wordpress"&gt;Automattic’s argument that blamed WP Engine&lt;/a&gt; for relying on WordPress.org to power its business, Judge Martínez-Olguín didn’t find it very compelling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FY8A8q"&gt;“While Defendants characterize WPEngine’s harm as self-imposed because it built its business around a website ‘that it had no contractual right to use...’ Defendants’ role in helping that harm materialize through their recent targeted actions toward WPEngine, and no other competitor, cannot be ignored,” the ruling states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VSSRzU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" align="center"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We are grateful that the court has granted our motion for a preliminary injunction that restores access to and functionality of wordpressdotorg for WP Engine, its customers and its users. &lt;br&gt;This ruling provides much-needed stability for the WordPress ecosystem. We deeply…&lt;/p&gt;— WP Engine (@wpengine) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wpengine/status/1866691174599131634?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 11, 2024&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P0hHKC"&gt;The ruling found the WP Engine showed it will suffer irreparable harm without injunctive relief, while also impacting members of the WordPress community. Under the preliminary injunction, Automattic will have to take down the list of companies it displayed on a site it created to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/7/24290394/wordpress-coms-owner-launched-a-tracker-for-sites-leaving-wp-engine"&gt;track outgoing WP Engine customers&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24266426/the-latest-volley-in-the-wordpress-beef"&gt;remove the checkbox&lt;/a&gt; that asks WordPress users to verify they’re not affiliated with WP Engine when logging in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZEK2R"&gt;WP Engine responded to the &lt;a href="https://x.com/wpengine/status/1866691174599131634?"&gt;ruling in a post on X&lt;/a&gt;, saying “We are grateful that the court has granted our motion for a preliminary injunction that restores access to and functionality of wordpressdotorg for WP Engine, its customers and its users.” Meanwhile, Automattic spokesperson Megan Fox tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; the company looks “forward to prevailing at trial:”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="bJIAyY"&gt;Today’s ruling is a preliminary order designed to maintain the status quo. It was made without the benefit of discovery, our motion to dismiss or the counterclaims we will be filing against WP Engine shortly. We look forward to prevailing at trial as we continue to protect the open source ecosystem during full-fact discovery and a full review of the merits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="qIUDHk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, December 11th: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statements from Automattic and WP Engine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Valve is now selling refurbished Steam Deck OLEDs starting at $439</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A portable handheld gaming PC faces us, colorful screen pointed our way" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pK83kIpOe0hzGVgdkoqSFGbdAJo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73779322/DSCF9137.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kLfLzO"&gt;The Steam Deck OLED, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review"&gt;the best version of Valve’s gaming handheld&lt;/a&gt; with additional battery life, a slight increase to performance, and an eye-popping screen, can now be purchased refurbished for $110 less than it costs brand-new. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="VqyV0D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Steam Deck OLED review: better, not faster","url":"https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5UC3FY"&gt;Valve has just begun &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steamdeckrefurbished/"&gt;selling certified refurbished Steam Deck OLED models&lt;/a&gt; starting at $439 in the US, UK, Canada, and EU. That buys you the 512GB model with a glossy screen, while the 1TB anti-glare model can be had for $519 — less than the $549 you’d pay to get even the 512GB model brand-new. (The 1TB model normally costs $649.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nMZA40"&gt;Like my colleague Jay Peters just told me in Verge Slack, “$439 is a steal for the OLED.” Valve doesn’t currently have stock of refurbished LCD models, though they can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/19/24135233/value-steam-deck-deal-sale"&gt;be as cheap as $279&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RuTQNY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="bluesky-embed" data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:k73nnk2pzsgsj7ehkfuxougu/app.bsky.feed.post/3lcydvixtyc2y" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreidaenuubmh4azd4uo7i23ajt4j6cfoancaqrywtcnok5hmo7kbcdy"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en"&gt;Happy Tuesday! We've officially added Steam Deck OLED to our Valve Certified Refurbished program today, and refurbished Steam Deck OLED units are now available for sale in the US, Canada, UK, and EU. 

Learn more here: store.steampowered.com/sale/steamde...&lt;/p&gt;— &lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:k73nnk2pzsgsj7ehkfuxougu?ref_src=embed"&gt;Steam Deck (@steamdeck.com)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:k73nnk2pzsgsj7ehkfuxougu/post/3lcydvixtyc2y?ref_src=embed"&gt;2024-12-10T23:01:42.824Z&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://embed.bsky.app/static/embed.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UgUJLK"&gt;Like Valve’s refurbished versions of the original LCD model, which has a slightly smaller and slower screen, Valve says it gives each unit “an extensive examination involving over 100 tests at one of Valve’s facilities,” including a battery health check, and Valve says they’ll “meet or even exceed the performance standards” of brand-new units. They each come with a carrying case, refurbished power supply, and one-year warranty — but they may have “minor cosmetic blemishes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bck42X"&gt;Valve introduced the Steam Deck OLED in November 2023, and a year later, it’s still one of the very best ways to play PC games on the go. No other handheld has surpassed its ease of use, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc"&gt;the Asus ROG Ally X&lt;/a&gt; did finally meet or beat it in battery life while offering better performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WCJgYV"&gt;While lots of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22579493/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc"&gt;other Windows handhelds&lt;/a&gt; are on the way, and maybe even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24315098/valve-steam-machines-steamos-steam-deck-vr"&gt;some other intriguing hardware from Valve&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s been pretty clear it won’t release a new Steam Deck soon — not till newer chips let it offer a big leap in performance without sacrificing battery life. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube’s AI-powered dubbing is now available to many more creators </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Illustration of a YouTube logo with geometric background" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m7FnufI4KCL9MPr3ADkiRWxdFTU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73779277/acastro_STK092_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QWcFdv"&gt;YouTube &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/auto-dubbing-on-youtube/"&gt;says it has expanded&lt;/a&gt; its AI-powered auto-dubbing to “hundreds of thousands of channels” in the YouTube Partner Program that are “focused on knowledge and information.” YouTube says it will bring the feature to “other types of content soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U6qm4o"&gt;What the dubs consist of depends on the language used in the original video. If it was in English to start, it’ll be translated into French, German, Hindi, Italian, Spanish, Indonesian, Japanese, and Portuguese. If the starting video was made in one of those languages, YouTube will only produce an English dub. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t8q245"&gt;For channels that have it, AI-dubbed videos are created automatically when the original video is uploaded, but creators can opt to preview them before they’re published. YouTube also provides options to unpublish or delete dubs, according to a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/15569972"&gt;support document for the feature&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HXONqm"&gt;The dubs aren’t very natural-sounding now, but YouTube promises they’ll get better at emulating “tone, emotion, and even the ambiance of the surroundings” with later updates. Here’s an English dub example of a French video about making potatoes au gratin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PgBwhs"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SNUvDiCAEkY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZsNRH9"&gt;However, YouTube cautions that “this technology is still pretty new, and it won’t always be perfect.” The company says it’s “working hard to make it as accurate as possible, but there might be times when the translation isn’t quite right or the dubbed voice doesn’t accurately represent the original speaker.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EEoube"&gt;YouTube initially announced its tests of auto-dubbing with “hundreds” of creators in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/22/23769881/youtube-ai-dubbing-aloud"&gt;June 2023&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="x86eeQ"&gt;The YouTube Kids mobile app &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtubekids/thread/312565999/updates-to-youtube-kids-on-mobile"&gt;is getting a redesign&lt;/a&gt; that both makes it look and behave more like the standard YouTube app and lets kids browse through videos in portrait mode for the first time. It’s rolling out over the next few weeks on iOS and Android, while the web and smart TV experiences stay the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyemBh"&gt;YouTube Kids launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/19/8073273/youtube-kids-android-app-for-children"&gt;nearly a decade ago&lt;/a&gt;, and its look hasn’t changed much since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/2/16599990/youtube-kids-new-design-kid-profiles-update"&gt;its last major redesign in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. As the company &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-new-features-2023/#:~:text=such%20as%20the-,YouTube%20Kids%20app,-."&gt;said last year&lt;/a&gt;, this is a hefty visual and functional refresh that looks less toy-like, with elements from the r&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/17/23920088/youtube-like-subscribe-button-animations"&gt;ecent design changes&lt;/a&gt; in the main YouTube app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The YouTube Kids update looks a bit more like the main YouTube app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PnIkV2"&gt;At the top, you’ll notice a newly designed carousel for familiar content filters. They’re clearly labeled by topic, whether you’re looking for gaming, shows, music, or the educationally inclined “Explore” tab. Those buttons will occupy less horizontal space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s how the YouTube Kids app looks now, before the new update rolls out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aOWxXo"&gt;Some of the other shortcuts that used to live at the top — such as Home, Search, and Profile — will be moved to a new navigation bar at the bottom. A new “Your Stuff” page will also live in that bar and serve as a dedicated portal to find content that you’ve downloaded, shared, or previously watched. Parental controls and other settings will remain in dedicated views, with shortcuts for those always accessible in the upper right corner, next to the Cast button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UVHSQw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s future data centers will be built next to solar and wind farms     </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google logo with colorful shapes" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZZY5y3q3Lw7qG8iOoq4xg09TRE8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73779094/STK093_Google_04.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ciJaHt"&gt;In what it’s calling a “first-of-its-kind partnership,” Google will collaborate with developers to build data centers powered by renewable energy generated on-site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Li4hRx"&gt;It’s &lt;a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/infrastructure/new-approach-to-data-center-and-clean-energy-growth/"&gt;partnering&lt;/a&gt; with energy company Intersect Power and investment firm TPG Rise Climate on a $20 billion initiative to develop an unspecified number of “industrial parks” across the US this decade. The first one is supposed to be partially operational by 2026 and completed by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="egzMFR"&gt;If successful, it would be a big change to how data centers are typically built and operated. Google and its competitors are racing to find clean sources of electricity for energy-hungry AI data centers. But the US electricity mix is still &lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&amp;amp;t=3"&gt;dominated by fossil fuels&lt;/a&gt;; connecting new data centers to the power grid leads to more pollution as a result. With this new partnership, Google can bypass that problem by connecting directly to solar and wind farms and batteries for renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="GRWk5T"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The scale of AI presents an opportunity to completely rethink data center development.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GT3BDK"&gt;“To realize AI’s potential, the growth in electricity demand must be met with new, clean power sources. The scale of AI presents an opportunity to completely rethink...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is giving Copilot a new taskbar UI and keyboard shortcut on Windows</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vector illustration of the Microsoft Copilot logo." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1e7XfaJV3b1MBBs9dqkmZEicP2M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73779092/STK259_MICROSOFT_COPILOT_2__B.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mw78BB"&gt;Microsoft is changing up how Copilot works on Windows yet again. After demoting Copilot to a Progressive Web App (PWA) earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/12/10/update-for-copilot-for-windows-begins-rolling-out-to-windows-insiders/"&gt;Microsoft is now rolling out&lt;/a&gt; an update to Windows testers that replaces the PWA version of Copilot with a “native” experience that includes a new keyboard shortcut and quick view UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WfMiLI"&gt;The new quick view for Copilot floats above the taskbar, much like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/19/24300605/microsoft-365-companions-windows-taskbar-files-people-calendar"&gt;Microsoft’s new Companion apps&lt;/a&gt; that it’s currently testing for files, contacts, and calendar entries. The quick view can be triggered using a new Alt + Space keyboard shortcut, or through the system tray. The quick view doesn’t do anything special here, but it does float above all your other apps and remains always on top until you dismiss Copilot to the taskbar or trigger the Alt + Space shortcut again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gk-L3hbCM75ADNXULM4TWslj-hA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25784180/copilot_app_quick_view_systray.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Copilot quick view.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="07MsWJ"&gt;The new keyboard shortcut here could get a little complicated though, depending on what apps you use. Other apps already use the Alt + Space shortcut, and it sounds like they’re going to be fighting Copilot for control here. “For any apps installed on your PC that might utilize this keyboard shortcut, Windows will register whichever app is launched first on your PC and running in the background as the app that is invoked when using Alt + Space,” says Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lIv3Jc"&gt;I am not sure why Microsoft made the choice to move Copilot to this Alt + Space shortcut when it previously reused the Windows key + C shortcut from Cortana with Windows Copilot before downgrading the experience to a web app and giving up on the keyboard shortcut in favor of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/4/24023809/microsoft-copilot-key-keyboard-windows-laptops-pcs"&gt;dedicated Copilot key&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft even says “Copilot will continue to explore options related to the keyboard shortcuts for the app,” which sure reads like the AI assistant is suddenly calling the shots over at Microsoft now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SUWVKF"&gt;This new keyboard shortcut and Copilot quick view will also be available on Windows 10 as well as Windows 11 PCs, despite Microsoft’s insistence that Windows 10 end of support really is happening in October 2025. Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/5/24171895/microsoft-windows-10-beta-testing-new-features"&gt;reopened beta testing&lt;/a&gt; for new Windows 10 features earlier this year as a way “to make sure everyone can get the maximum value from their current Windows PC.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XxHqD3"&gt;Copilot originally started off life as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/23/23732454/microsoft-ai-windows-11-copilot-build"&gt;Windows Copilot in Windows 11&lt;/a&gt; last year, integrated into the operating system as a side bar that could appear across all apps. Microsoft then made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/21/24182979/microsoft-copilot-key-keyboard-shortcut-pwa"&gt;Copilot less useful with its new Copilot Plus PCs&lt;/a&gt;, cutting the app back to a basic web app. Microsoft says this latest iteration is “a native version,” but it’s still just a web view of Copilot wrapped in a slightly more native implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cruise’s robotaxi service will likely shut down as GM pulls its funding </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cruise Car" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pMg3QQct6aTL7nNN5JgCSLU1qdE=/0x0:5196x3464/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73779080/1756346473.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PWF4zT"&gt;General Motors&lt;a href="https://news.gm.com/home.detail.html/Pages/news/us/en/2024/dec/1210-gm.html"&gt; said it would no longer fund&lt;/a&gt; its Cruise robotaxi service as it seeks to focus its spending on autonomous vehicle development specifically for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22867455/gm-sell-autonomous-vehicles-personally-owned-timeline"&gt;personally owned vehicles&lt;/a&gt;. Now Cruise employees will be combined with GM’s internal teams working on advanced driver assist systems, like Super Cruise, as well as its project to develop autonomous vehicles to sell to customers for personal use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qYGHgC"&gt;Ultimately, the project became too expensive for GM to justify &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24276670/cruise-gm-loss-q3-2024-driverless-robotaxi"&gt;the huge amounts of money spent to prop it up&lt;/a&gt;. And the automaker found it increasingly difficult to convince its shareholders that the money-losing operation would eventually pay off. The robotaxi subsidiary lost a staggering $3.48 billion in 2023 and has been seen by some as an albatross for the automaker, sucking up cash and lacking a clear path to profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="MWrbE4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Dude, where’s my self-driving car?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/24065447/self-driving-car-autonomous-tesla-gm-baidu"},{"title":"For self-driving cars, the free ride is over","url":"https://www.theverge.com/24157228/robotaxi-nhtsa-investigations-waymo-tesla-zoox"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GPGVtX"&gt;“Given the considerable time and expense required to scale a robotaxi business in an increasingly competitive market, combining forces would be more efficient and therefore consistent with our capital allocation priorities,” GM CEO Mary Barra said in a call with investors Tuesday evening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2iUp6O"&gt;It’s likely that GM’s move will result in layoffs at Cruise, though none are being announced right now. What is clear is that Cruise’s testing in Arizona and Texas will pause as the company decides its next move. GM will need to repurchase its remaining shares of Cruise (the automaker owns 90 percent of the company), and then Cruise’s board will determine the next steps, which include restructuring, layoffs, or simply shutting down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LsECFx"&gt;The shutdown of Cruise’s robotaxi service comes amid a turbulent time for autonomous vehicles. Tesla has said it plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/10/24265530/tesla-robotaxi-elon-musk-features-range-price-release-date"&gt;launch its own robotaxi service in 2025&lt;/a&gt;, though questions remain about the company’s approach to the technology. While Alphabet’s Waymo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24313346/waymo-miami-robotaxi-moove-2026"&gt;continues to eye new markets&lt;/a&gt;, other ventures have faltered. The most notable was Argo AI, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/26/23423998/argo-ai-shut-down-ford-vw-av-self-driving"&gt;which shut down in 2022&lt;/a&gt; after Ford and Volkswagen pulled funding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="NUDZXc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s likely that GM’s move will result in layoffs at Cruise&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R0Zfgk"&gt;GM’s decision to scrap its robotaxi business comes after years of profligate spending in the hopes of creating a new mobility division that could bring in new revenues for the company. The automaker has invested approximately $10 billion in Cruise since first acquiring it in 2016, Barra said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8p4Dvg"&gt;“You’ve got to really understand: the cost of running a robotaxi fleet, which is is fairly significant, [is] not our core business,” she added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J1uwoM"&gt;Cruise’s commercial robotaxi service has been on hiatus since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/27/23934595/cruise-robotaxi-autonomous-vehicle-pause-operations-us-nationwide"&gt;October 2023&lt;/a&gt;, when one of its driverless vehicles in San Francisco &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/3/23901233/cruise-crash-hit-run-pedestrian-injury-sf-robotaxi"&gt;struck and then dragged a pedestrian over 20 feet&lt;/a&gt;, severely injuring her. The company has since resumed autonomous testing with safety drivers in Arizona and Texas and had planned to relaunch in California as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qN6Xu3"&gt;But even as other automakers cut their losses, Barra doubled down. In 2022, she took the stage at the annual Consumer Electronics Show and boldly declared that GM would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22867455/gm-sell-autonomous-vehicles-personally-owned-timeline"&gt;sell fully autonomous vehicles to regular people&lt;/a&gt; by the middle of the decade. (It seems unlikely the company will meet that deadline.) And while investors have encouraged GM to cut their losses with Cruise, she has stuck by the project. This past year, Barra has directed a reorganization at Cruise, ousting its founders and replacing them with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24186003/cruises-new-ceo-comes-from-the-world-of-gaming-and-tvs"&gt;auto and tech industry veterans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BMkvNf"&gt;When it finishes acquiring the remaining shares, GM anticipates achieving cost savings of $1 billion annually, GM chief financial officer Paul Jacobson said. &lt;/p&gt;

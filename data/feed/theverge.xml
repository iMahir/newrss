  &lt;p id="dfHJvR"&gt;On a scorching 100-degree day, I find Henry Dorado’s booth at the Brooklyn Flea Market. Above, trains rattle loudly on the Manhattan Bridge. The outdoor market is a small but trendy event that fills this corner every weekend, rain or oppressive shine. Among the typical antique market wares — racks of thrifted clothes, watches behind glass, bins of art — Dorado’s booth stands out. People slow down, sometimes chuckle, take photos, and summon friends over to look at all this. A crowd surrounds the modest shop, just a few fold-out tables covered in pink tablecloths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dU3jFg"&gt;Dozens of point-and-shoot cameras line the tables in rows, face up and laid flat; the circular lenses on each make it feel like you’re browsing whole fish at a seafood market....&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A24’s The Legend of Ochi looks like an adorable fantasy adventure in first trailer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A still image from the A24 film The Legend of Ochi." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FA5HLLJcQfXDfxPOm_TcK3j6oog=/0x0:1686x1124/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73657191/Screen_Shot_2024_10_16_at_9.10.16_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: A24&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UEYPaD"&gt;The next big release from A24 might also be its cutest to date. The studio just released the first trailer for &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Ochi&lt;/em&gt;, a fantasy adventure that also happens to star a cute-as-hell creature to rival Grogu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jm2Dk7"&gt;While it looks like a somewhat familiar “kid befriends mysterious creature” story, the film does have some interesting aspects, including not only the titular critter, but also what appears to be some kind of post-apocalyptic fantasy setting. Here’s the official description:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="OwLjIu"&gt;In a remote northern village, a young girl, Yuri, is raised to never go outside after dark and to fear the reclusive forest creatures known as the ochi. When a baby ochi is left behind by its pack, she embarks on the adventure of a lifetime to reunite it...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;

    <title>Amazon finally has a color Kindle, and it looks pretty good</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A photo of a Kindle Colorsoft, showing the library." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lx7FWSUpAJZvwGsgXwf__M7g0Ro=/0x224:5354x3793/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73657118/Colorsoft.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;What’s a color screen for? Color book previews!&lt;/em&gt; | Image: David Pierce / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lngVPy"&gt;For years, Kindle users have asked Amazon to make a color version of its e-reader. Now, the company is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24271603/kindle-2024-colorsoft-scribe-paperwhite-specs-price-date"&gt;finally delivering&lt;/a&gt;: it’s &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/new-kindle-color-scribe-paperwhite-entry"&gt;launching&lt;/a&gt; the new Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition, a device that has a lot in common &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/24035238"&gt;with the new Paperwhite&lt;/a&gt;, except instead of black and white it’s color all over. The Colorsoft &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CN3XR57P?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costs $279.99 and is available for preorder today&lt;/a&gt;, with shipments starting October 30th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8o6Wk3"&gt;Making the Colorsoft happen, Amazon executives said at a launch event on Tuesday in New York City, required a lot more than just swapping in a new display. “Frankly, the technology just wasn’t ready” before now, says Kevin Keith, who runs Kindle products for Amazon. “And we now think the tech is ready.” (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/4/24158251/kobo-libra-clara-colour-e-reader-review"&gt;Kobo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24234815/the-remarkable-paper-pro-is-as-outrageous-as-it-is-luxurious"&gt;Remarkable&lt;/a&gt;, and others might...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s new Kindle Scribe takes another step toward pen and paper</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A person on a couch reading on a Kindle Scribe." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3Yv6Y5QWaJ19hZq9Gd708JypVlM=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73657089/Active_Canvas.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Scribe is as much a writing device as a reading one. | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cCJgjz"&gt;Ever since Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23484927/amazon-kindle-scribe-e-reader-notetaking-pen-review"&gt;launched the Kindle Scribe in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, the company has been noticing some unusual ways people are using the device. Scribe users read more nonfiction than normal Kindle owners; a full 60 percent of Scribe buyers use the device at work. That’s maybe not shocking, given that the Scribe is the largest Kindle and the one with an included stylus for taking notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VI4NQo"&gt;But still: this is maybe the first Kindle ever to not be &lt;em&gt;mostly &lt;/em&gt;a reading device, but rather equal parts book and notebook. With the new Scribe, which the company &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/new-kindle-color-scribe-paperwhite-entry#:~:text=The%20new%20Kindle%20Scribe%2C%20with%20in%2Dbook%20writing%20and%20an%20AI%2Dpowered%20notebook"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday (and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24271603/kindle-2024-colorsoft-scribe-paperwhite-specs-price-date"&gt;leaked on Tuesday night&lt;/a&gt;), Amazon is leaning into the notebook side of things in a big way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FWBTxQ"&gt;The new Scribe, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZ9VFQ2P?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;which will cost $399.99&lt;/a&gt; for a 16GB version (a 32GB is $419.99, while the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s new seven-inch Kindle Paperwhite is bigger and faster than ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;The new Kindle Paperwhite is probably going to be the best-selling Kindle. | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JDOVhK"&gt;Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/new-kindle-color-scribe-paperwhite-entry"&gt;introduced&lt;/a&gt; updated versions of the Kindle and Kindle Paperwhite on Wednesday, only a few hours after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24271603/kindle-2024-colorsoft-scribe-paperwhite-specs-price-date"&gt;inadvertently leaking them&lt;/a&gt; both. The Paperwhite is getting one of its biggest design refreshes ever, with a larger screen that’s completely flush with the bezels of the device, while the entry-level model is getting updated with a pop of color and some speed improvements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hG4XiB"&gt;We got to try both at Amazon’s launch event in New York City and came away impressed. Neither is a reinvention of the whole Kindle format, but both are nice devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BkjWB7"&gt;Of the two e-readers, the Kindle Paperwhite is receiving more significant changes. The e-reader is now bigger, with a seven-inch screen, while boasting the highest contrast ratio of any Kindle. It’s...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IR6wwc"&gt;A lot has been said about TV in 2004. That it was the &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/jamiejones/why-2004-was-the-greatest-year-in-television-history"&gt;best year of television&lt;/a&gt; of all time, the peak of the Golden Age of television. Or maybe that it was the year reality &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/24/business/media-business-advertising-fall-tv-season-s-new-offerings-tend-toward-escapist.html"&gt;television became too much&lt;/a&gt;, suddenly showing up on every channel as we flipped the switch. But as famed Hollywood producer and UFO enthusiast Bryce Zabel wrote for the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt; in 2004, it was the &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2004-sep-19-tm-blur38-story.html"&gt;end of television as we knew it&lt;/a&gt;. He chalked it up to the prevalence of TiVo and DVR in American households and predicted an upheaval so severe the whole advertising business would crumble — and he didn’t even know about streaming yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jscazG"&gt;The shift was one that a lot of people felt in real time. For many, it was through the show &lt;em&gt;Lost&lt;/em&gt;, which debuted in 2004 and created a...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="k4sGcx"&gt;By the time &lt;em&gt;MGM v. Grokster&lt;/em&gt; hit the Supreme Court, the file-sharing industry had been roiling with lawsuits for years. The record labels had sued Napster in December 1999, baptizing the oughties with a spree of copyright litigation. But the public’s appetite for piracy didn’t go away, and for every Napster that was sued into oblivion, three more sprung up in its place. Their names are now commemorated only in the court decisions that eventually destroyed them: Aimster, StreamCast, and of course, Grokster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Ay3FX"&gt;The Supreme Court agreed to hear the &lt;em&gt;Grokster&lt;/em&gt; case in December 2004, and &lt;a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2004/04-480"&gt;oral arguments&lt;/a&gt; took place in March of the following year. The copyright wars had finally arrived before the justices. The court heard first from Don Verrilli, the...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Nintendo DS introduced touchscreens to a generation of gamers</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="56mdMV"&gt;Decades before we got married and started a family, my partner and I connected over a little Boxer pup named Charlie. We tossed a ball around, scrubbed him down when he got dirty, and took him for daily walks. It was a bonding experience — mediated entirely through the original Nintendo DS’s touchscreen. The tactile experience turned an otherwise simple game like &lt;em&gt;Nintendogs,&lt;/em&gt; where the goal is to take care of virtual pets, into something that created a deep emotional connection. And years before smartphones were in everyone’s pockets, it helped show a generation of gamers just what’s possible with a touchscreen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F5DOo9"&gt;Now, we mostly take them for granted, but prior to the arrival of the first DS in 2004, the idea of a touchscreen was, for many...&lt;/p&gt;

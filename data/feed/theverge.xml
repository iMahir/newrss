    <title>What happened to Intel?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z1XlV2n7d93dWThBFbSL9FjOpRM=/374x0:2714x1560/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73763981/Intel_Innovation_Day1_Keynote_15.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger holds up an early Intel 18A wafer in late 2023.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Intel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CqWL8E"&gt;On Monday, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger abruptly decided to retire after less than four years on the job. That was the &lt;em&gt;official&lt;/em&gt; story, anyhow. Within hours, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger-retire-2024-12-02/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-02/intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger-retires-amid-chipmaker-s-turnaround-plan"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/technology/intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger.html"&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; had a different one: the board of directors pushed him out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8OVAOL"&gt;Three and a half years ago, Gelsinger announced an ambitious plan to turn around the troubled chipmaker within four years — now, he’s reportedly been kicked out of the company before he could see it through. It happened so abruptly that Intel doesn’t have a planned successor in mind, and so completely that Gelsinger won’t even stick around as an adviser. He’s gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OMqDqd"&gt;Intel has been in a tailspin for years. It missed the smartphone revolution, has been plagued by quality control issues with its chips, lost customers like Apple to alternative processors, and now is at risk of missing out on AI, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Wp05EO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This isn’t just about stock price and golden parachutes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8PMtut"&gt;If Intel is falling apart, this isn’t just a business story. The United States government has called it a national security story, too. Intel isn’t just the world’s former leading maker of computer chips; it’s one of the last companies to both design and manufacture them itself...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24311594/intel-under-pat-gelsinger"&gt;Read the full story at The Verge.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon announces its own set of Nova AI models</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Illustration of the Amazon logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/10PBVjVjTZ7Ok-Ka7i8gSgFSN-U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73763973/acastro_STK103__02.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WUqwjv"&gt;Amazon has announced a series of new AI foundation models under a new “Nova” branding that will be available as part of the Amazon Bedrock model library in AWS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8fdLEx"&gt;There are three “understanding” models available now, &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-amazon-nova-frontier-intelligence-and-industry-leading-price-performance/"&gt;Amazon says in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="8WwQlp"&gt;Amazon Nova Micro, a text model that’s “optimized for speed and cost.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pXK4xv"&gt;Amazon Nova Lite, a “very low-cost” multimodal model that can take in images, video, and text to generate text.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dA3jGa"&gt;Amazon Nova Pro, a “highly capable” multimodal model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="0geArR"&gt;The company is also training a model called Amazon Nova Premier, which it says will be “our most capable multimodal model for complex reasoning tasks.” Amazon aims to make Nova Premier available in “early 2025.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iJXn71"&gt;Amazon is releasing content generation models, too: Amazon Nova Canvas, an image generation model, and Amazon Nova Reel, a video generation model. The company says that these models have “watermarking capabilities” to “promote responsible AI use.” As an example of what’s possible with Nova Reel, Amazon has shared &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g87NaWcszq0"&gt;this mock ad for a fake pasta brand&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aA8OKF"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g87NaWcszq0?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ni12ix"&gt;Later in 2025, Amazon plans to release a speech-to-speech model and “a native multimodal-to-multimodal” model, &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/amazon-nova-artificial-intelligence-bedrock-aws"&gt;according to a blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JEcA5p"&gt;Amazon announced these new models at its AWS re:Invent conference, which is happening now in Las Vegas. At the show, the company also said that it’s building a huge AI compute cluster that relies on its Trainium 2 chips in partnership with Anthropic (which it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/22/24303185/amazon-anthropic-investment-ai-alexa"&gt;has invested $8 billion in&lt;/a&gt;). “When completed, it is expected to be the world’s largest AI compute cluster reported to date available for Anthropic to build and deploy its future models on,” &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/aws-reinvent-2024-keynote-live-news-updates?p=aws-trainium2-instances-now-generally-available"&gt;according to Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="gifUtN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon scrambles for its place in the AI race","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/29/24116056/amazon-ai-race-anthropic-olympus-claude"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ec5SoT"&gt;The company, like many other big tech players, is racing to release new AI products and features to stay ahead of newer companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-sales-chief-sees-paradigm-shift-in-corporate-ai-spending?rc=v4bmzs"&gt;OpenAI&lt;/a&gt;. Where Amazon could have an advantage is how much internet infrastructure is already powered by AWS — large enterprises may be more willing to use Amazon’s AI offerings because the company has already a trusted reputation. An Apple exec even &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2024%2F12%2F03%2Fapple-says-it-uses-amazons-custom-ai-chips-.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F12%2F3%2F24312260%2Famazon-nova-foundation-ai-models-anthropic" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;appeared onstage today at re:Invent&lt;/a&gt; to talk about how the company relies on Amazon’s custom AI chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R3KR8x"&gt;Amazon is also working on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/20/23880764/amazon-ai-alexa-generative-llm-smart-home"&gt;a revamped, AI-powered Alexa&lt;/a&gt;, but while voice assistant was reportedly set to launch this fall, the launch has apparently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24284772/amazon-new-alexa-llm-voice-assistant-delayed-2025"&gt;slipped into next year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Eve’s new app unlocks more smart features for Android users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aRgw_eqE3B22HTMxt-IfDCa7c-c=/25x0:840x543/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73763944/eve.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eve’s Android app has finally arrived, but it only supports the Eve Thermo at launch.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Eve Systems&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2ut8np"&gt;Eve Systems has finally launched its first Android app — over two years after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/1/23331803/eve-homekit-android-app-smart-light-switch-matter"&gt;announcing it was working on one&lt;/a&gt;. This week, the once Apple-only smart home device maker launched the &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.evehome.eve"&gt;Eve for Matter app&lt;/a&gt; on the Google Play Store. The app will allow Android users to access the custom features of Eve’s devices that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23568091/matter-compatible-devices-accessories-apple-amazon-google-samsung#:~:text=Feature%20support%20for,is%20still%20spotty."&gt;Matter doesn't support&lt;/a&gt;, something previously only accessible to iOS users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m06jYb"&gt;However, at launch, the new app will &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; work with Google Home and &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; with one Eve device, the new &lt;a href="https://www.evehome.com/en-us/eve-thermo"&gt;Eve Thermo&lt;/a&gt; (79.99 Euros) — a Matter-over-Thread smart radiator valve designed for European homes. While the earlier version of the Eve Thermo can be upgraded to support Matter and Thread, the new version has them pre-installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dlx53HiNeGK_SF3cPfGvylhWTdE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25771660/eve_thermo_eve_door_window_window_detection_eu.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Eve Systems&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The newest version of Eve’s smart radiator valve — the Eve Thermo — comes with Matter-over-Thread on board.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5f5QGm"&gt;“The plan is to continuously expand support for other Eve devices and platforms and turn the app into a comprehensive tool,” Lars Felber, director of PR at Eve Systems, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Nevertheless, we wanted to make the app available to our Eve Thermo customers with Android and Google Home as early as possible in the heating season, hence the initial exclusive release for this hardware,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XITB0J"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"All the&amp;amp;nbsp;smart home&amp;amp;nbsp;news, reviews, and gadgets you need to know","url":"https://www.theverge.com/24190824/smart-home-news-reviews-guides-gadgets"},{"title":"Google opens up its smart home to everyone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/15/24157154/google-home-api-matter-smart-home-chromecast-google-tv"},{"title":"Smart home&amp;amp;nbsp;company Eve plans to use Matter to move beyond Apple’s&amp;amp;nbsp;HomeKit ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22827727/eve-matter-thread-upgrade-smart-shades-release-date"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="b2AoRS"&gt;There hasn’t been an Android app for Eve products before because the &lt;a href="https://www.evehome.com/en/privacy"&gt;company’s commitment to privacy&lt;/a&gt;, along with eschewing cloud-to-cloud connections or requiring users to sign up for an account, meant it focused all its development efforts on Apple Home. However, the advent of &lt;a href="https://www.evehome.com/en/matter"&gt;the Matter smart home standard&lt;/a&gt; and its option for local control has allowed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22827727/eve-matter-thread-upgrade-smart-shades-release-date"&gt;company to branch out&lt;/a&gt; and work with the other platforms while maintaining its core values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GNW3G9"&gt;The new Eve app lets you add the Eve Thermo to Google Home through Matter and control it on that platform, as well as share it with any other Matter-compatible platform. But it also simultaneously adds it to the Eve app, where you can access additional features, such as creating and managing autonomous on-device schedules. Without the Eve app, you only get basic controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="isq2cp"&gt;Currently, Android users can add any of Eve’s other Matter devices — such as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23899810/best-smart-plugs#:~:text=Eve%20Energy%20Smart%20Plug%20(Matter)"&gt;Eve Energy smart plug&lt;/a&gt; and Eve Motion blinds — to compatible platforms, including Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Samsung SmartThings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qyqcPL"&gt;But, until Eve adds support for more devices, Android users will be limited to those devices' capabilities in Matter. In contrast, Apple Home users can access all of Eve’s innovative features, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/23899810/best-smart-plugs#:~:text=The%20Eve%20app%20gives,in%20the%20Eve%20app."&gt;in-depth energy data&lt;/a&gt; for smart plugs and &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/meeteve_adaptive-shading-activity-7176243207276531712-h_jI/"&gt;adaptive shading&lt;/a&gt; for smart shades, through the &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/eve-for-matter-homekit/id917695792"&gt;Eve for Matter &amp;amp; HomeKit iOS app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xR1vpT"&gt;The Android app only works with Google Home as it was built on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/15/24157154/google-home-api-matter-smart-home-chromecast-google-tv"&gt;Google Home APIs&lt;/a&gt; released earlier this year. Eve CEO Jerome Gackel said that these enabled the company to “turbo-charge the development of Eve for Android.” Felber said support for additional platforms, including Amazon Alexa and Samsung SmartThings, is coming in future versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="ui5InV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:11562460"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0feFzf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VAmUZx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stellantis and Samsung to get $7.54 billion federal loan for two EV battery factories</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Stellantis EV battery factory Indiana" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nW_UOjSTd1lnv4YCfdcEs0Gbm50=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73763873/1245570016.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UFgWlD"&gt;The Department of Energy preliminarily &lt;a href="https://www.energy.gov/lpo/articles/lpo-announces-conditional-commitment-starplus-energy-construct-lithium-ion-battery"&gt;approved another loan&lt;/a&gt; to help fund the construction of electric vehicle battery factories in the US. This time, a joint venture between Stellantis and Samsung SDI will receive $7.54 billion to build two EV battery plants in Kokomo, Indiana. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wt3egH"&gt;The project is expected to create 3,200 jobs, as well as 2,800 operations jobs at the plants and hundreds more at a nearby supplier park. The conditional loan commitment will provide $7.54 billion — $6.85 billion in principal and $688 million in capitalized interest — to StarPlus Energy LLC, which is jointly owned by Stellantis and Samsung SDI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s7SrBF"&gt;The loan will come from the DOE’s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) program, which was resurrected by President Joe Biden in 2022 to help fund the developing EV manufacturing industry in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="9aUvnY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The project is expected to create 3,200 jobs, as well as 2,800 operations jobs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9dQYNz"&gt;Much like the $6.6 billion loan &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/26/24306402/rivian-doe-atvm-loan-georgia-ev-factory-trump"&gt;conditionally approved for Rivian&lt;/a&gt; last month, the new loan to StarPlus Energy will need to beat the clock if it's going to finalize its approval before Donald Trump takes over the White House. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iohwcP"&gt;Trump has promised to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289494/trump-election-electric-vehicle-tax-credit-tesla-elon-musk"&gt;reverse or cancel much of the spending by Biden on EVs&lt;/a&gt; once he assumes office. He has said he will kill the $7,500 tax credit for new EV purchases, as well as wipe out the rest of the spending from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Assumedly, that will include the ATVM loan program as well — even though it predates the IRA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GnDmB5"&gt;The loan program attained almost mythical status in the EV startup world thanks to its timely $465 million loan to Tesla in 2009, which is credited with helping save the company from an early death. But the program went fallow during the first Trump administration with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22358355/aptera-ev-three-wheeled-doe-atvm-loan-program"&gt;a number&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21302966/lordstown-motors-electric-pickup-truck-ev-endurance-unveiling-pence"&gt;of cash-strapped&lt;/a&gt; EV startups getting no response to requests for funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e0JZUQ"&gt;Biden brought the program back in 2022 with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/25/23277838/doe-atvm-loan-gm-lg-battery-joint-venture"&gt;$2.5 billion loan to a joint venture of General Motors and LG Energy Solution&lt;/a&gt; to help fund the construction of a new lithium-ion battery manufacturing facility. Since then, the program has made other commitments, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/22/23769966/ford-doe-loan-ev-battery-factory-sk-avtm"&gt;$9.2 billion to a joint venture between Ford and SK Innovation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/9/23591326/redwood-materials-doe-loan-ev-battery-recycling"&gt;$2 billion to Redwood Materials&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MQL1y9"&gt;The Stellantis-Samsung plants are the latest beneficiaries of the program. According to DOE, the StarPlus project will produce about 67 GWh of batteries, enough to supply approximately 670,000 vehicles annually when it's operating at full capacity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rP4HIh"&gt;Stellantis, which owns brands like Jeep, Dodge, Chrysler, and Ram, and international brands like Peugeot and Fiat, is going through some corporate upheaval that could determine its ability to meet the program's demands. The company’s CEO, Carlos Tavares, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/2/24310921/stellantis-ceo-carlos-tavares-resigns-effective-immediately"&gt;recently announced that he would step down&lt;/a&gt; amid a sharp decline in sales in the US and abroad. And Stellantis is &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/stellantis-ceo-slow-ev-transition-big-trap-automakers-2024-10"&gt;struggling to keep pace&lt;/a&gt; with its competitors in the shift to electric- and software-defined vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="ecB3Fq"&gt;Based on &lt;a href="https://github.com/TowCenter/search-gpt/"&gt;testing done by Columbia’s Tow Center for Digital Journalism researchers&lt;/a&gt;, OpenAI’s ChatGPT search tool has some issues when it comes to responding with the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XmOtak"&gt;OpenAI &lt;a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-search/"&gt;launched the tool&lt;/a&gt; for subscribers in October, saying it could give “fast, timely answers with links to relevant web sources.” Instead, &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/chatgpt-butchering-reporting-news-partners"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Futurism&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.cjr.org/tow_center/how-chatgpt-misrepresents-publisher-content.php"&gt;the researchers said ChatGPT search struggled&lt;/a&gt; to correctly identify quotes from articles, even when they came from publishers with arrangements to share data with OpenAI&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hZLrLR"&gt;The authors asked ChatGPT to identify the source of “two hundred quotes from twenty publications.” Forty of those quotes were taken from publishers who’d disallowed OpenAI’s search crawler from accessing their site. Yet, the chatbot confidently replied with false information anyway, rarely admitting it was unsure about the details it gave:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Dk670b"&gt;In total, ChatGPT returned partially or entirely incorrect responses on a hundred and fifty-three occasions, though it only acknowledged an inability to accurately respond to a query seven times. Only in those seven outputs did the chatbot use qualifying words and phrases like “appears,” “it’s possible,” or “might,” or statements like “I couldn’t locate the exact article.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A chart showing how often ChatGPT answered confidently or was unsure, with a breakdown of how often its confident replies were “Wrong,” (89) “Partially Correct,” (57) and “Correct” (47)." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VKbE9BYdjzQAik56leSOG7KbDIs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25771393/image_4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;em&gt;Columbia Journalism Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;ChatGPT was fully or partially wrong more than right, but almost always confidently so.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="COcL1y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OpenAI’s search engine is now live in ChatGPT","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24283906/openai-chatgpt-live-web-search-searchgpt"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qt4bgv"&gt;The Tow Center test’s authors documented ChatGPT search results that misattributed a letter-to-the-editor quote from the &lt;em&gt;Orlando Sentinel&lt;/em&gt; to a story published in &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt;. In another example, when asked to identify the source of a quote from a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/26/climate/north-atlantic-right-whale-population.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; about endangered whales, it returned a link to a different website that had wholly plagiarized the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M6JJ20"&gt;“Misattribution is hard to address without the data and methodology that the Tow Center withheld,” OpenAI told the &lt;a href="https://www.cjr.org/tow_center/how-chatgpt-misrepresents-publisher-content.php"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Columbia Journalism Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, “&lt;/em&gt;and the study represents an atypical test of our product.” The company went on to promise to “keep enhancing search results.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9LZOy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ByAxt5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp is much better without microtransactions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A screenshot from the mobile game Animal Crossing: New Horizons Complete." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sculZCV6AdQE1Ocdq2oaHGi8nY4=/0x199:1123x948/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73763766/img_8181.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lU6MTb"&gt;Though it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/22/16691618/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-review-iphone-android-nintendo"&gt;started out pretty chill&lt;/a&gt;, over the years, &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp&lt;/em&gt; steadily became bloated with monetization. There were all kinds of things to spend real money on, including loot boxes for unlocking rare items. When I logged in to the game last week after months away, my screen was dominated by notifications vying for my attention, most of them involving spending some kind of cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b22oLn"&gt;That’s what makes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/2/24310972/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-complete-paid-launch-iphone-android"&gt;the new paid version of the app&lt;/a&gt; so intriguing. The original &lt;em&gt;Pocket Camp&lt;/em&gt; has technically shut down, replaced by &lt;em&gt;Pocket Camp Complete&lt;/em&gt;, which gets rid of all the in-app purchases in exchange for a one-time fee. (It’s $9.99 at launch on both &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-c/id6547834967"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nintendo.zasa"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;, which will jump to $19.99 in January.) And without the looming specter of having to spend real money, this version of &lt;em&gt;Pocket Camp&lt;/em&gt; is a whole lot more relaxing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y60Pt5"&gt;Fundamentally, the game is the same. You’re tasked with running a campground for a bunch of friendly animals, which involves designing various spots for them to hang out, while also doing traditional &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; activities like fishing and catching bugs. The game allows existing &lt;em&gt;Pocket Camp&lt;/em&gt; players to transfer their saves — all you need to do is link a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford’s new electric Puma Gen-E looks like a mini-Mustang Mach-E</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Ford Puma Gen-E EV" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BfMP24e4cko2GBLUCLWyxc5RLzk=/867x1014:4287x3294/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73763674/FORD_2024_PUMA_GEN_E_10.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Ford&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GASRUs"&gt;Ford continues to exhibit a dedication to diversifying its EV lineup in Europe — a dedication that, frankly, I wish &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/21/24225177/ford-electric-vehicle-cancellations-delays-suv-t3-pickup"&gt;could also be applied here at home&lt;/a&gt; — with the reveal of &lt;a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2024/12/03/New-Puma-Gen-E.html"&gt;the new all-electric Puma Gen-E&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qzbDu6"&gt;The Puma is a familiar nameplate in Europe, as the automaker’s bestselling vehicle there since it surpassed the Fiesta in sales in 2021. Now, it’s getting a fully electric powertrain to complement the hybrid EcoBoost options that were added four years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XnMlJq"&gt;The small, sporty &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24275797/ford-mustang-mache-2025-heat-pump-bluecruise-design"&gt;Mustang Mach-E-&lt;/a&gt;looking subcompact crossover will get 376km (233 miles) on a full charge, can charge from 10 to 80 percent in 23 minutes when hooked up to a 100kW DC fast charger, and will accelerate from zero to 100km/h in a not-totally-disappointing eight seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="McH7bh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:12497021"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PTuKRc"&gt;Storage is a key selling point for the Puma Gen-E, with Ford promising extra space in the extremely compact trunk thanks to something the company is calling the “GigaBox.” It’s basically an extra storage space underneath the floor of the trunk for additional items, a feature found in most EVs today but of added relevance to the Puma thanks to its small stature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xoUOpi"&gt;Ford says the GigaBox can hold 145 liters (five cubic feet) of storage, which is a bit more than what most vehicles offer and certainly bigger than the 2.8 cubic feet of space offered by the gas-powered Puma’s understorage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jDEPQZ"&gt;How small are we talking for this subcompact? The Puma Gen-E is 4,214 millimeters (165.9 inches) long, 1,930mm (75.9 inches) wide, and 1,555mm (61.2 inches) tall. That’s smaller than the 2023 Chevy Bolt EV and by far the smallest vehicle in Ford’s lineup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="UcfDd1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Storage is a key selling point for the Puma Gen-E&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wQQRt9"&gt;To compensate, Ford is giving its electric Puma a facelift in a variety of ways, including a very literal facelift with a new Mustang Mach-E-inspired shield design replacing the traditional grille. It’s also getting “unique alloy” wheels for an added “electric vibe” that come in two sizes: 17 inches for the standard trim or 18 inches for the Premium version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Ford Puma with the trunk open showing it full of items to demonstrate how much it can carry" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t5Oj64S6pR8mtE3zybAcGWxU6Pk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25771461/FORD_2024_PUMA_GEN_E_18.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ford&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="10ZJr4"&gt;Inside, a 12.8-inch center display will run on Ford’s Sync 4 operating system (no &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/21/24229743/lincoln-nautilus-ford-digital-experience-infotainment-review"&gt;Android-based Digital Experience&lt;/a&gt; in Europe yet) and supports wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jUkDyp"&gt;Ford is clearly hoping that the small, sporty &lt;a href="https://michaelbaystransformers.fandom.com/wiki/Bumblebee"&gt;Bumblebee&lt;/a&gt; yellow Puma Gen-E can lift its sagging fortunes in Europe after the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301507/ford-retracts-in-europe-with-layoffs-and-lower-ev-production"&gt;was forced to idle the plant in Cologne where it makes the electric Explorer and Capri&lt;/a&gt;. The company also recently laid off 14 percent of its workers in Europe, with most of the cuts affecting operations in Germany and the UK. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g6wLkI"&gt;Ford says the Puma Gen-E will go into production at its assembly plant in Craiova, Romania, using electric drive units built in Halewood, England. The new EV is available to order today and will begin to make deliveries in spring 2025. Pricing has not been announced yet. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Internal Google documents reveal concerns about its cloud contract with Israel</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of the Google logo." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xikJXdXPudw_xjuNJ4uaRhcUdMM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73763539/STK093_Google_02.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration: The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FvadzO"&gt;Google officials had concerns about potential human rights violations that might be linked to its $1.2 billion contract with the Israeli government before ever even signing the deal, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/technology/google-israel-contract-project-nimbus.html"&gt;documents first reported on by &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mrlNzJ"&gt;“Google Cloud services could be used for, or linked to, the facilitation of human rights violations, including Israeli activity in the West Bank,” Google lawyers, members of the company’s policy team, and outside consultants wrote in the documents prepared for executives and reviewed by the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;. The documents date to several months before Google announced the deal in May 2021 and show that the company was worried about whether the contract might be bad for its reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="z6JZ9U"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Google Cloud services could be used for, or linked to, the facilitation of human rights violations”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sjEdNP"&gt;The company has staunchly defended the deal since inking it in 2021, going so far as to fire dozens of employees who protested the contract they believed might involve them in violence against Palestinians. Now, it seems Google was weighing those risks, too — but ultimately decided to move forward with the deal anyway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lTQs6c"&gt;Dubbed Project Nimbus, the contract gives the Israeli government access to cloud services from Google and Amazon. Project Nimbus enabled the use of AI tools to analyze and identify objects in images and videos, according to the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;. It also included videoconferencing and “services to store and analyze large amounts of data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Th1X2j"&gt;The most profitable part of the deal was $525 million from Israel’s Ministry of Defense expected between 2021 and 2028, the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; reports. That’s not a huge sum for Google, which reportedly made $258 billion in sales in 2021. But it was enough to give the company some clout with other potential military and intelligence customers.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1sq27k"&gt;Google didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. But in April, it said in an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/17/24133056/google-protests-project-nimbus-no-tech-for-apartheid"&gt;emailed statement&lt;/a&gt; that “the Nimbus contract is for workloads running on our commercial cloud by Israeli government ministries, who agree to comply with our Terms of Service and Acceptable Use Policy. This work is not directed at highly sensitive, classified, or military workloads relevant to weapons or intelligence services.” A Google spokesperson provided a similar statement to the &lt;em&gt;Times.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A9Qbcl"&gt;However, separate Israeli government contract documents recently &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2024/12/02/google-project-nimbus-ai-israel/"&gt;reported on by&lt;em&gt; The Intercept &lt;/em&gt;suggest&lt;/a&gt; that Project Nimbus is subject to “adjusted” terms of service rather than Google’s general terms of service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="i9Ulei"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google fired a software engineer over an anti-war demonstration — he says he wasn’t even protesting ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/30/24145680/google-workers-fired-project-nimbus-protest-nlrb-complaint"},{"title":"Google fires 28 employees after sit-in protest over Israel cloud contract ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/17/24133700/google-fires-28-employees-protest-israel-cloud-contract"},{"title":"Nine Google employees arrested after eight-hour sit-in protest ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/17/24133056/google-protests-project-nimbus-no-tech-for-apartheid"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="20s864"&gt;In the months leading up to the contract in 2021, Google reportedly sought input from consultants including the firm Business for Social Responsibility (BSR). Consultants apparently recommended that the contract bar the sale and use of its AI tools to the Israeli military “and other sensitive customers,” the report says. BSR reportedly recommended “due diligence” on Google’s part to make sure its services weren’t being misused and that Google add its AI principles that prohibit surveillance or weapons to the contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i1NWq0"&gt;Ultimately, the contract reportedly didn’t reflect those recommendations. The contract did, however, include a right to suspend customers for breaching Google’s &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://cloud.google.com/terms" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;terms of service&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://cloud.google.com/terms/aup?hl=en" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;acceptable use policy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9e8Mla"&gt;Before signing the deal, the &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;says, Google had additional concerns about the company itself potentially running into legal quandaries because of the contract: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="EEp5qd"&gt;The company also worried that it would be forced to accept “onerous” risks, such as the possibility that it could run into conflicts with foreign or international authorities if they sought Israeli data and that it might have to “breach international legal orders” under the deal terms, according to the documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="dOsdGA"&gt;Project Nimbus has become an even bigger flashpoint within the company since the Israel-Hamas war, which has killed more than &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-iran-news-11-20-2024-5da3ce43df8662fe9eeab4ad804bdc0f"&gt;44,000 people in Gaza&lt;/a&gt;. Google has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/17/24133700/google-fires-28-employees-protest-israel-cloud-contract"&gt;fired&lt;/a&gt; roughly 50 employees for their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/30/24145680/google-workers-fired-project-nimbus-protest-nlrb-complaint"&gt;alleged involvement&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/17/24133056/google-protests-project-nimbus-no-tech-for-apartheid"&gt;protests&lt;/a&gt; against Project Nimbus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ktmoP"&gt;“We did not come to Google to work on technology that kills. By engaging in this contract leadership has betrayed our trust, our AI Principles, and our humanity,” Billy Van Der Laar, a Google software engineer, said in an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/17/24133056/google-protests-project-nimbus-no-tech-for-apartheid"&gt;emailed statement following protests&lt;/a&gt; in April that called on Google to exit Project Nimbus. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to get The Verge’s new print magazine</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9gLDmSIUa0t9392bwmU3I69XAR0=/0x0:2700x1800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73763537/247261_Goblin_zine_promo_AKrales_t2_1021.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p class="p-large-text" id="C4qRjz"&gt;Last year, we published a series about what Google had done to the web, capped off by a feature about search engine optimization titled “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/features/23931789/seo-search-engine-optimization-experts-google-results"&gt;The People Who Ruined the Internet&lt;/a&gt;.” It made more than a few SEO experts upset (which was tremendously fun for me because I love watching people yell at Nilay on various social platforms).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cc62M0"&gt;But a year has passed, and we’ve had a change of heart. Maybe search engine optimization is actually a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; thing. Maybe appeasing the search algorithm is not only a sustainable strategy for building a loyal audience, but also a strategic way to plan and produce content. What are journalists, if not content creators?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QNrgsx"&gt;Anyway, SEO community, consider this our apology. And what better way to say “our bad, your industry is not a cesspool of AI slop but a brilliant vision of what a useful internet could look like” than collecting all the things we’ve learned in one handy print magazine? Which is why I’m proud to introduce &lt;em&gt;The Verge Guide to Search Engine Optimization: All the Tips, Tricks, Hints, Schemes, and Techniques for Promoting High-Quality Content!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>Here we go: The Verge now has a subscription</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/btNE0K8lhOw3v1VlcjPAqLPwPlQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73763535/VERGE_PREMIUM_CHORUS_LEDE_2040x1360_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UXlzRF"&gt;Okay, we’re doing this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7OGi7s"&gt;Today we’re launching a &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/subscribe"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; subscription&lt;/a&gt; that lets you get rid of a bunch of ads, gets you unlimited access to our top-notch reporting and analysis across the site and our killer premium newsletters, and generally lets you support independent tech journalism in a world of sponsored influencer content. It’ll cost $7 / month or $50 / year — and for a limited time, if you sign up for the annual plan, we’ll send you an absolutely stunning print edition of our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/24071581"&gt;CONTENT GOBLINS&lt;/a&gt; series, with very fun new photography and design. (Our art team is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/25/23571101/homeland-anthology-magazine-preorder-buy"&gt;delightfully good at print&lt;/a&gt;; we’ve even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/press-room/2023/2/24/23613507/the-verge-wins-the-2023-asme-award-for-design-receives-two-national-magazine-award-nominations"&gt;won a major magazine award&lt;/a&gt; for it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QYFZTT"&gt;A surprising number of you have asked us to launch something like this, and we’re happy to deliver. If you don’t want to pay, rest assured that big chunks of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; will remain free — we’re thinking about subscriptions a lot differently than everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kcX5U4"&gt;Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="022fkP"&gt;If you’re a &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; reader, you know we’ve been covering massive, fundamental changes to how the internet works for years now. Most major social media platforms are openly hostile to links, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/14/24155321/google-search-ai-results-page-gemini-overview"&gt;huge changes to search&lt;/a&gt; have led to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/24167865/google-zero-search-crash-housefresh-ai-overviews-traffic-data-audience"&gt;the death of small websites&lt;/a&gt;, and everything is...&lt;/p&gt;

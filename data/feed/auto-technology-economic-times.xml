<title>What industry wants for H2ICE adoption; govt seeks stronger representation for tech roadmap</title>
<link>https://auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/auto-technology/what-industry-wants-for-h2ice-adoption-govt-seeks-stronger-representation-for-tech-roadmap/115731692</link>
<description>Hydrogen technology is pegged to be a potential game changer in India's journey to achieve carbon neutrality by 2070. However, there are hurdles for Hydrogen adoption. Key among them are cost, and a favourable ecosystem. The Government official also says that &amp;quot;mission-mode efforts&amp;quot; are required from the automotive industry. He advocated for a need to break the silos, and also said that there aren't enough pressure groups from the industry. Stakeholders are encouraged to make more representations, backed by facts and figures, for new technology support.</description>

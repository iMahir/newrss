<title>Alternative fuels key to making India self-reliant: Nitin Gadkari</title>
<link>https://auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/auto-technology/alternative-fuels-key-to-making-india-self-reliant-nitin-gadkari/115827675</link>
<description>Minister Nitin Gadkari emphasizes the importance of switching to biofuels and electric vehicles for sustainable development. India's transport sector heavily contributes to air pollution, and significant fossil fuels are imported annually. Initiatives like bio-CNG projects and municipal waste-to-bio-CNG projects are promoting a green economy, creating jobs, boosting exports, and making India self-reliant.</description>

<title>Why OTA updates feature is becoming essential for modern vehicles</title>
<link>https://auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/auto-technology/why-ota-updates-feature-is-becoming-essential-for-modern-vehicles/115768632</link>
<description>The OTA system leverages secure connectivity—be it Wi-Fi, LTE, or 5G—to push updates from a centralised cloud server to individual vehicles. These updates are typically downloaded and stored until the vehicle is idle, at which point they are installed, ensuring minimal disruption and robust security. Currently, OTA updates mainly address infotainment systems, navigation, telematics, diagnostics, performance tuning, and driver assistance systems (ADAS), paving the way for a seamless and efficient user experience.</description>

<description>Hydrogen technology is pegged to be a potential game changer in India's journey to achieve carbon neutrality by 2070. However, there are hurdles for Hydrogen adoption. Key among them are cost, and a favourable ecosystem. The Government official also says that &amp;quot;mission-mode efforts&amp;quot; are required from the automotive industry. He advocated for a need to break the silos, and also said that there aren't enough pressure groups from the industry. Stakeholders are encouraged to make more representations, backed by facts and figures, for new technology support.</description>

<link>https://auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/auto-technology/how-software-defined-vehicles-are-revolutionising-commercial-vehicles-and-why-you-should-care/115586264</link>
<description>For fleet operators, SDVs offer much more than the buzz of innovation. Think of reduced operational costs, improved efficiency, and even new revenue streams. However, making this a reality requires a practical, ROI-driven approach, especially in cost-sensitive regions like India. Over the next decade, SDVs are expected to transition from emerging technologies to standard practices, equipping the commercial vehicle industry with crucial digital connectivity and data-driven capabilities.</description>

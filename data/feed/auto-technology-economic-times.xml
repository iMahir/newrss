<title>Big truckmakers bet on hydrogen to extend combustion engine life</title>
<link>https://auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/auto-technology/big-truckmakers-bet-on-hydrogen-to-extend-combustion-engine-life/112211180</link>
<description>The global truck making industry faces a complex balancing act to get to zero emissions. Electric batteries are too heavy for long-haul freight operations and take long to charge. Using hydrogen fuel cells to generate electricity reduces the weight and extends the range of trucks, but switching to this technology is expensive as companies need to design new truck systems.</description>

<title>Sodium-ion batteries are set to spark a renewable energy revolution - and Australia must be ready</title>

<description>Energy storage collects excess energy generated by renewables, stores it then releases it on demand, to help ensure a reliable supply. Such facilities provide either short or long-term (more than 100 hours) storage. At present, lithium-ion batteries are the primary storage technology but are best for short-term storage. Sodium-ion batteries are now almost ready to fill the long-term storage gap.</description>

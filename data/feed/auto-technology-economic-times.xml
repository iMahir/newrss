<title>What would you prefer a car like, a laptop/mobile, or a DVD player</title>
<link>https://auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/auto-technology/what-would-you-prefer-a-car-like-a-laptop/mobile-or-a-dvd-player/114587189</link>
<description>&amp;quot;Open cars&amp;quot; will be like &amp;quot;information technology systems on wheels,&amp;quot; continuously receiving software updates that enhance both the driving experience and on-the-go functionality. This approach offers car owners greater freedom to upgrade their vehicle's features over time, much like how we upgrade our smartphones. On the other hand, &amp;quot;closed cars&amp;quot; resemble fixed systems, akin to DVD players with region controls, limiting flexibility and locking users into predefined settings. </description>

<title>'Decarbonisation remains the commercial vehicle industry's top challenge'</title>
<link>https://auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/auto-technology/decarbonisation-remains-the-commercial-vehicle-industrys-top-challenge/116154570</link>
<description>The company which is aiming to transform a mechanical piece (CV) into a software-defined vehicle believes in clean mobility fuel solutions for the CV industry. However, DTICI believes decarbonisation is a goal that is yet to be fulfilled by the commercial vehicle industry. This shift will follow a fast momentum through the adoption of alternative fuels such as hydrogen, biofuels, and renewable energy, along with innovations in fuel cell technology for abiding by strict emission standards while ensuring high performance.</description>

<title>ADAS in commercial vehicles: The future of safer, smarter and more profitable transportation</title>
<link>https://auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/auto-technology/adas-in-commercial-vehicles-the-future-of-safer-smarter-and-more-profitable-transportation/116154449</link>
<description>The most obvious argument of all. ADAS provides drivers with an extra set of eyes, alerting them to potential dangers and assisting in emergencies. Features like collision warnings, lane-keeping assistance, and blind-spot monitoring reduce risks, particularly in challenging road conditions. Moreover, night driving, which accounted for 20.4% of all accidents in 2022, becomes safer with Night Vision Assistance (NVA), available even with level 1 ADAS, by improving visibility and helping drivers maintain control in low-visibility conditions</description>

<title>Alternative fuels key to making India self-reliant: Nitin Gadkari</title>
<link>https://auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/auto-technology/alternative-fuels-key-to-making-india-self-reliant-nitin-gadkari/115827675</link>
<description>Minister Nitin Gadkari emphasizes the importance of switching to biofuels and electric vehicles for sustainable development. India's transport sector heavily contributes to air pollution, and significant fossil fuels are imported annually. Initiatives like bio-CNG projects and municipal waste-to-bio-CNG projects are promoting a green economy, creating jobs, boosting exports, and making India self-reliant.</description>

<title>Why OTA updates feature is becoming essential for modern vehicles</title>
<link>https://auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/auto-technology/why-ota-updates-feature-is-becoming-essential-for-modern-vehicles/115768632</link>
<description>The OTA system leverages secure connectivity—be it Wi-Fi, LTE, or 5G—to push updates from a centralised cloud server to individual vehicles. These updates are typically downloaded and stored until the vehicle is idle, at which point they are installed, ensuring minimal disruption and robust security. Currently, OTA updates mainly address infotainment systems, navigation, telematics, diagnostics, performance tuning, and driver assistance systems (ADAS), paving the way for a seamless and efficient user experience.</description>

<description>Hydrogen technology is pegged to be a potential game changer in India's journey to achieve carbon neutrality by 2070. However, there are hurdles for Hydrogen adoption. Key among them are cost, and a favourable ecosystem. The Government official also says that &amp;quot;mission-mode efforts&amp;quot; are required from the automotive industry. He advocated for a need to break the silos, and also said that there aren't enough pressure groups from the industry. Stakeholders are encouraged to make more representations, backed by facts and figures, for new technology support.</description>

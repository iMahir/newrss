<title>It's easy to criticize, hard to create; my motto is never give up, says Henrik Fisker</title>
<link>https://auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/auto-technology/its-easy-to-criticize-hard-to-create-my-motto-is-never-give-up-says-henrik-fisker/111648162</link>
<description>Fisker admitted that while the auto industry might be the hardest to succeed, the nascent EV industry is even more difficult. But he is personally “excited about doing great work in this industry and bringing new innovative EVs to the world”. Charging infrastructure is in the early stages of becoming as reliable as gas fueling systems. Other challenges on the manufacturing front, development cost, government policies also exist.</description>

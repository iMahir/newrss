<title>Sodium-ion batteries are set to spark a renewable energy revolution - and Australia must be ready</title>
<link>https://auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/auto-technology/sodium-ion-batteries-are-set-to-spark-a-renewable-energy-revolution-and-australia-must-be-ready/111947754</link>
<description>Energy storage collects excess energy generated by renewables, stores it then releases it on demand, to help ensure a reliable supply. Such facilities provide either short or long-term (more than 100 hours) storage. At present, lithium-ion batteries are the primary storage technology but are best for short-term storage. Sodium-ion batteries are now almost ready to fill the long-term storage gap.</description>

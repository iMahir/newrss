<title>Zero Emission Trucks also need demand incentives, says govt scientific advisory</title>
<link>https://auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/auto-technology/zero-emission-trucks-also-need-demand-incentives-says-govt-scientific-advisory/112703274</link>
<description>Indian scientists suggest that the government should offer demand incentives for zero emission trucks (ZETs) to help meet emission goals.“Zero Emission Trucks (ZETs) come with a substantial upfront cost, often 2.5-3.5 times higher than their internal combustion engine (ICE) counterparts. This cost disparity presents a significant hurdle for potential buyers and fleet operators looking to adopt ZETs,” the India Zero Emission Trucking Policy Advisory has said in its report.</description>

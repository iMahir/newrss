<title>'Decarbonisation remains the commercial vehicle industry's top challenge'</title>
<link>https://auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/auto-technology/decarbonisation-remains-the-commercial-vehicle-industrys-top-challenge/116154570</link>
<description>The company which is aiming to transform a mechanical piece (CV) into a software-defined vehicle believes in clean mobility fuel solutions for the CV industry. However, DTICI believes decarbonisation is a goal that is yet to be fulfilled by the commercial vehicle industry. This shift will follow a fast momentum through the adoption of alternative fuels such as hydrogen, biofuels, and renewable energy, along with innovations in fuel cell technology for abiding by strict emission standards while ensuring high performance.</description>

<title>ADAS in commercial vehicles: The future of safer, smarter and more profitable transportation</title>
<link>https://auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/auto-technology/adas-in-commercial-vehicles-the-future-of-safer-smarter-and-more-profitable-transportation/116154449</link>
<description>The most obvious argument of all. ADAS provides drivers with an extra set of eyes, alerting them to potential dangers and assisting in emergencies. Features like collision warnings, lane-keeping assistance, and blind-spot monitoring reduce risks, particularly in challenging road conditions. Moreover, night driving, which accounted for 20.4% of all accidents in 2022, becomes safer with Night Vision Assistance (NVA), available even with level 1 ADAS, by improving visibility and helping drivers maintain control in low-visibility conditions</description>

<title>Cyborgs &amp;amp; hyperloops: The wait continues</title>
<link>https://auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/auto-technology/cyborgs-hyperloops-the-wait-continues/114877322</link>
<description>The first flying car was approved by regulators in 1956, but here we are, still stuck on the road.

<title>What would you prefer a car like, a laptop/mobile, or a DVD player</title>
<link>https://auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/auto-technology/what-would-you-prefer-a-car-like-a-laptop/mobile-or-a-dvd-player/114587189</link>
<description>&amp;quot;Open cars&amp;quot; will be like &amp;quot;information technology systems on wheels,&amp;quot; continuously receiving software updates that enhance both the driving experience and on-the-go functionality. This approach offers car owners greater freedom to upgrade their vehicle's features over time, much like how we upgrade our smartphones. On the other hand, &amp;quot;closed cars&amp;quot; resemble fixed systems, akin to DVD players with region controls, limiting flexibility and locking users into predefined settings. </description>

<title>Hydrogen: The missing piece in India’s clean mobility revolution</title>
<link>https://auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/auto-technology/hydrogen-the-missing-piece-in-indias-clean-mobility-revolution/114547079</link>
<description>In his address at the conference, Minister Hardeep Singh Puri emphasised the transformative potential of hydrogen for India’s energy landscape. “Green hydrogen requires local demand and local consumption... it will be successful in India.

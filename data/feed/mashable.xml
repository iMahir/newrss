<p>Our mid-year favorites are songs we can't stop listening to and love to love, from rising boy groups like BABYMONSTER and BOYNEXTDOOR to established sirens like aespa and IVE.</p><h2>"&#54644;&#50556; (HEYA)," IVE</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-07EzMbVH3QE"></div>
</div>


<p>IVE are wild cats stalking their prey in this playful anthem and modern ode to South Korea, a country once known as the "<a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/story/the-korean-tiger-icon-of-myth-and-culture-national-museum-of-korea/yAUB_exZf_u-JA?hl=en" target="_blank"><u>land of tigers.</u></a>" In the chorus, IVE promise that "the moment you're enchanted... In a snap, I&rsquo;ll catch you!" and the song delivers, sweeping listeners up into a plucky, punchy pop confection. Nestled within the instrumentals are group calls, airy chants, and howls that evoke the thrill of a hunt. The music video depicts the sextet prowling through traditional South Korean art and folklore reimagined in candied greens, purples, and pinks. &mdash; <em>Elizabeth de Luna</em></p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>"Magnetic," ILLIT</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-Vk5-c_v4gMU"></div>
</div>


<p>This debut from girl group ILLIT (pronounced like "eyelet") is a percolating pop hit about the irresistible pull of undeniable attraction. The production fizzes with bubbly arpeggios and crisp hi-hats, while the lyrics are both sweet ("<em>My heart feels like a giant magnet, everything about you sticks to [it]</em>") and fresh ("<em>I'll make it a green light, girls gotta have guts!</em>"). A reference to a South Korean cultural obsession, the Meyers-Briggs types ("<em>You're J and I'm so P, S and N &mdash; polar opposites!</em>"), feels uniquely of-the-moment, but will likely ripen in years ahead into a nostalgic nod to the 2020s. &mdash; <em>E.D.L. </em></p><h2>"Supernova," aespa&nbsp;</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-phuiiNCxRMg"></div>
</div>


<p>A song so powerful that even <a href="https://mashable.com/article/aespa-supernova-lyrics-meaning" target="_self"><u>NASA issued a response</u></a>, "Supernova" lives up to its name. The track has exploded in South Korea, where it now holds the record for most weeks at No. 1 for an SM Entertainment act, surpassing "Gee" by Girls' Generation. For all its bombastic luster, "Supernova" fits soundly in aespa's eclectic sonic palette. Sampling Afrika Bambaataa's 1982 classic "Planet Rock," the propulsive pop track bursts with a bouncy, electro beat and a highly addictive hook spurred by a punchy chorus of "oh, ayy." Aespa have never been afraid to zig when everyone else zags, a risk that continues to pay off as "Supernova" makes a big bang on the charts. &mdash;<em> Crystal Bell</em></p><h2>"DASH," NMIXX </h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-7UecFm_bSTU"></div>
</div>


<p>Since making their polarizing debut in 2022, NMIXX have charted a dynamic path in an industry that relies heavily on fleeting trends. "DASH" implements the very best of the group's "MIXX-pop" gimmick, fusing elements of funk, R&amp;B, and hip-hop with lush vocal harmonies and a groovy rhythm that goes from "zero to a hunnid." While the production stands out for its richness, "DASH" lets the girls' excellent voices shine, allowing Lily to flex her powerhouse pipes and Bae to demonstrate her distinct vocal elasticity. "DASH" isn't just a catchy song; it's a bold statement that NMIXX are here to redefine the rules. &mdash; <em>C.B. </em></p><h2>"Earth, Wind &amp; Fire," BOYNEXTDOOR</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-u9nP3qXQA4o"></div>
</div>


<p>Deeply dorky and unbridled, "Earth, Wind &amp; Fire" is a stellar single for the nascent sextet BOYNEXTDOOR. On this track, produced by mentor and South Korean megastar ZICO, the young band bounces between emotions like errant pinballs. "You&rsquo;re my earth, wind, and fire," they sing in the throes of anxiety, jealousy, and devotion, "I think I love you more than I love my life." The track&rsquo;s highlight is the pre-chorus gush "Baby, boo, my sweetie darling, think I love you more," which is delivered at a speed and pitch that mimics a nervous confession to a crush. The song&rsquo;s choreography is just as charming, combining explosive jumps and glitching repetition to capture the fitful nature of falling in love. &mdash; <em>E.D.L.</em></p><h2>"Tap," Taeyong&nbsp;</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-vjGIY_GyAz4"></div>
</div>


<p>It's typical for male idols to release a project before their mandatory enlistment period, leaving fans with something to get them through the next 18 months. Taeyong, the de facto leader of NCT known for his striking magnetism and lethal stage presence, dropped his second EP just weeks before enlisting. And its lead single, "Tap," encapsulates everything that makes the rapper captivating. It's playful without seeming irreverent, a multifaceted effort that taps into his distinctive vision. The real gag is now we're left wanting more. &mdash;<em> C.B.&nbsp;</em></p><h2>"SHEESH," BABYMONSTER&nbsp;</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-2wA_b6YHjqQ"></div>
</div>


<p>It's never easy to stand in someone's shadow, especially if that someone is one of the biggest pop acts in the world. As the first girl group to debut under YG Entertainment since BLACKPINK burst onto the scene like a missle seven years ago, all eyes were on BABYMONSTER when they dropped "SHEESH," a braggadociously loud introduction to YG's next generation. Love it or hate it, you can't deny that "SHEESH" made an impact, thanks in large part to the group's seven members, who impressed viewers with their live vocals and onstage charisma while promoting the song on weekly music shows. In doing so, "SHEESH" climbed the charts, becoming more of a prophetic proclamation of the song's staying power. BABYMONSTER said, "Tell a friend," and people listened. &mdash; <em>C.B.</em>&nbsp;</p><h2>"Virtual Angel," ARTMS</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-qCodzDc61oc"></div>
</div>


<p>Ethereal and warm, "Virtual Angel" is the kind of melody you hope to hear as you approach the pearly gates. The song is a promising debut for ARTMS (pronounced "Artemis"), a septet made up of former members of the much-beloved but now-defunct girl group LOONA. In "Virtual Angel," ARTMS are seraphs heralding the arrival of first love. "In my frozen heart, new flowers begin to bloom," they coo brightly to a new flame. "Once I met you, I found my instincts." &mdash;<em> E.D.L. </em></p><h2>"Siren," RIIZE</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-tZYsvAoSNxQ"></div>
</div>


<p>RIIZE dropped their first single in September 2023 and have since tried on a proverbial wardrobe of genres for size. In a beguiling feat of musicality, the group has convincingly shapeshifted between house ("Impossible"), funk ("Boom Boom Bass") and pop R&amp;B (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH7xjaEA-94&amp;ab_channel=RIIZE" target="_blank"><u>"Honestly</u></a>") with ease. Their latest single, "Siren," is yet another impressive offering, pairing hip-hop with exhilarating, exhausting choreography from Josh Price. &mdash; <em>E.D.L. </em></p><h2>"Deja Vu," Tomorrow X Together&nbsp;</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-DiHUEWBRQEI"></div>
</div>


<p>When TXT experimented with pop-punk in 2021, it struck a chord with fans and critics alike. The sonic direction suited the boyband's penchant for expressing volatile coming-of-age emotions over catchy melodies. While the group has strayed from its emo phase, "Deja Vu" packs an emotional gut punch, serving mature melodrama with a serrated edge. &mdash; <em>C.B.&nbsp;</em></p><h2>"Girls Never Die," tripleS</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-2tda_TCjz8w"></div>
</div>


<p>While most pop songs portray girlhood with a rose-colored sheen, "Girls Never Die" brings together all 24 members of tripleS to convey the reality of young adulthood. "I don't like the weak me / Don't wanna show this part of me / Why I use strong makeup / Why I use strong filters," they sing. For a song with 24 voices, "Girls Never Die" never sounds disjointed or convoluted. Instead, they double down on the dreamlike vibes of past releases, creating a moody anthem with a modern message: "Girls never die, girls never cry." &mdash; <em>C.B.</em>&nbsp;</p><h2>"Fatal Trouble," ENHYPEN</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-RQEvHFti5p8"></div>
</div>


<p>In "Fatal Trouble," ENHYPEN sink their teeth into delicious theatrics, delivering brooding pop saturated by elements of rock and R&amp;B. The song is one of six tracks on a special album that commits wholeheartedly to the premise of ENHYPEN' webcomic "Dark Moon." In it, the seven bandmates are vampire schoolmates grappling with immortality and a shared love interest. On "Fatal Trouble" they tell her "Your memory, it&rsquo;s falling apart... my heart, long-held trust, they&rsquo;re coming undone." It&rsquo;s drama, done right. &mdash; <em>E.D.L.</em></p><h2>"How Sweet," NewJeans</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-Q3K0TOvTOno"></div>
</div>


<p>Leave it to NewJeans to drop the sweetest kiss-off of the summer. &ldquo;Yeah, don&rsquo;t you know how sweet it tastes? / Now that I&rsquo;m without you,&rdquo; they taunt a toxic lover over airy electroclash synth-washes and laser beams. "How Sweet" evokes the same relaxed sound and innate cool that catapulted NewJeans to the top of the charts and the front of everyone's minds; it's nostalgic and easy to listen without being overly simple, an effortless blend of playful lyrics and sophisticated production, And the sweetest thing about it? The way the group's vocals glide over the track with breezy confidence. &mdash; <em>C.B.&nbsp;</em></p><h2>"Shooting Star," Kep1er</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-VjOHYXzlZcM"></div>
</div>


<p>In May, WakeOne Entertainment announced that Kep1er, a nine-member girl group formed on the survival series <em>Girls Planet 999</em>, would continue as seven, extending the terms of their initial project contract without members Yeseo and Mashiro. "Shooting Star" is their final release as a complete unit, and it also happens to be their best. Sparkling synths, ethereal vocals, and vocoder harmonies make this an addictive listen. The song captures the essence of Kep1er's journey; it's bittersweet with a hopeful look towards the future. &mdash; <em>C.B.&nbsp;</em></p><h2>"Chk Chk Boom," Stray Kids</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-0P0aQreFs8w"></div>
</div>


<p>Leading up to the release of "Chk Chk Boom" in July, Stray Kids teased the track, calling it something they'd never done before. Perhaps they were referring to the song's Latin influences, which include a few Spanish words and Changbin rolling his "R's" for good measure. It's a fun twist on the group's signature dynamic intensity, reflective of their willingness to continuously explore and innovate across genres. In some ways, it sounds like the easy-listening version of their breakout single "God's Menu" &mdash; fiery rap verses, pre-chorus melodies, and an explosive hook that cranks up the energy. In true Stray Kids fashion, "Chk Chk Boom" ends with a party, bringing everyone together to celebrate <em>la vida loca</em>. &mdash; <em>C.B.&nbsp;</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>Hugh Hammer is Vermithor's new rider</h2><p>Blacksmith Hugh Hammer has been on a rough ride in Season 2, but things are looking slightly better for him now that he's claimed second-largest-dragon-after-Vhagar and certified bastard chomper Vermithor.</p><p>Hugh has popped up in a few episodes in Season 2, but he finally reveals his ancestry to his wife Kat (Ellora Torchia) in episode 7, when preparing to set out to Dragonstone after hearing Rhaenyra is searching for potential dragonriders. Hugh says he never knew his father, but that his mother worked in a pleasure house.</p><p>"She was granted more freedom than most 'cuz of who she was," he says. "She used to tell me I was no different to her brother's boys: Viserys and Daemon."</p><p>If we take a look at the old <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-targaryen-family-tree" target="_self">Targaryen family tree</a>, this means that Hugh's mother was the sister of Baelon Targaryen. King Viserys (Paddy Considine) and Daemon (Matt Smith) are his cousins.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2>Ulf the White is Silverwing's new rider</h2><p>Ulf is slightly more reluctant to head to Dragonstone, but he's pretty much forced into it by his friends, who he's spent years telling about his own Targaryen ancestry over many a wine.</p><p>"I'm the son of Baelon the Brave," Ulf whispers in a tavern to his mates back in episode 3. "Bastard brother to Prince Daemon and the late King Viserys. Uncle to the one, true queen, Rhaenyra Targaryen. The blood of the dragon runs through these veins and yes, men would take my head for it."</p><p>Ulf isn't exactly keen to put this heritage to the test, but makes the journey to Rhaenyra&rsquo;s keep anyway for the trial. Fortunately, Silverwing &ndash; when Ulf bumps into them while fleeing Vermithor &ndash; seems more than happy to confirm his Targaryen blood, even if Ulf stepped on a precious dragon egg in the process.</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/el4jA?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3B%3Btemplate=article&amp%3B%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3B%3Belement=offer&amp%3B%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3B%3Belement_label=New%20episodes%20of%20House%20of%20the%20Dragon%20air%20Sundays%20at%209%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20HBO%20and%20Max.&amp%3B%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3B%3Bobject_uuid=03jg0PhZrarqGYLH6vmYtlc&amp%3B%3Bshort_url=el4jA&amp%3B%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Fhouse-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-5-who-will-be-the-next-dragonriders&amp%3Btemplate=article&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=New%20episodes%20of%20House%20of%20the%20Dragon%20air%20Sundays%20at%209%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20HBO%20and%20Max.&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=03V5PwCtaXC5HLKjmgAasL1&amp%3Bshort_url=el4jA&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Fhouse-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-6-seasmoke-new-rider-addam-velaryon&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=New%20episodes%20of%20House%20of%20the%20Dragon%20air%20Sundays%20at%209%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20HBO%20and%20Max.&object_type=article&object_uuid=03yW3dOwoto3yupo0H84Bmy&short_url=el4jA&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">New episodes of <em>House of the Dragon </em>air Sundays at 9 p.m. ET on HBO and Max.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[Apple's AI features will arrive later than anticipated, according to a new report.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/07D8rlTThvPVxIhJr48YkDv/hero-image.jpg" alt="Apple AI"><p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-intelligence-ai-siri-wwdc-2024" target="_self">Apple Intelligence</a> will probably not go live when the new iPhones launch this September. </p><p>This is according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-28/apple-intelligence-to-miss-initial-release-of-upcoming-ios-18-ipados-overhauls?embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank">Bloomberg's Mark Gurman</a>, who claims that Apple now plans to launch its AI features as software updates "by October," citing people with knowledge of the matter. The reason is what you might expect: Apple needs more time to fix bugs and make sure that it has support from third party developers. </p><p>Apple announced its AI features <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-intelligence-ai-siri-wwdc-2024" target="_self">in June, during WWDC</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/hr/newsroom/2024/06/introducing-apple-intelligence-for-iphone-ipad-and-mac/" target="_blank">saying</a> they're "deeply integrated" into <a href="https://mashable.com/article/when-does-ios-18-come-out" target="_self">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ipados-18-announced-apple-wwdc-keynote-2024" target="_self">iPadOS 18</a>, and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/macos-sequoia-public-beta-5-new-features" target="_self">macOS Sequoia</a>. But pretty much all of the new features, which include a smarter Siri, an AI-powered text editing feature called Rewrite, and AI-generated images called Genmoji, were missing when the iOS 18 and other new operating systems launched as beta in July.</p><p>To be fair, Apple never specifically said it would release AI in September; the company said Apple Intelligence was <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-intelligence/" target="_blank">coming in beta this fall</a>, with some features coming "over the course of the next year." Still, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-16/when-is-apple-intelligence-coming-some-ai-features-won-t-arrive-until-2025-lxhjh86w" target="_blank">reports</a> said that the company planned to make at least some of the features available alongside the launch of new iPhones, which typically happens in the first half of September. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

    </div>
<p>The way it looks right now, Apple will launch iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia in September, and then introduce the AI features with a later update. Similarly, it's possible that the first iPhone 16 models will lack the AI features when they start shipping to consumers.</p><p>The report does claims that Apple will make Apple Intelligence available in its developer betas, namely iOS 18.1, and iPadOS 18.1, as soon as this week. </p><p>While all this is unofficial and yet to be confirmed, there's a very real and official delay to Apple's AI features in Europe. In June, the company said it will <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-delays-ai-features-europe-dma-regulation" target="_self">not launch Apple Intelligence in Europe</a> (likely until 2025) due to regulatory concerns. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The game is all about finding the "common threads between words." And just like <em>Wordle</em>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-20-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> resets after midnight and each new set of words gets trickier and trickier&mdash;so we've served up some hints and tips to get you over the hurdle.</p><p>If you just want to be told today's puzzle, you can jump to the end of this article for July 29's <em>Connections</em> solution. But if you'd rather solve it yourself, keep reading for some clues, tips, and strategies to assist you.</p><h2><strong>What is <em>Connections</em>?</strong></h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. Like <em>Wordle, </em>you can share the results with your friends on social media.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p><a href="https://mashable.com/category/house-of-the-dragon" target="_self"><em>House of the Dragon</em></a>'s dragon-riding scenes are shot with actors riding on a device known as a buck, whose mechanical bull-like moments mimic those of the show's dragons. The buck is also surrounded by LED screens, which display animated backgrounds and light the actors. But even with all of this expensive, high-technology equipment in play, a simple piece of gym equipment proved crucial in bringing the dragon-riding scenes to life.</p><p>For Season 2, the show's four cinematographers &mdash; <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-6-cinematographer-vanja-cernjul-interview" target="_self">Vanja &#268;ernjul</a>, P.J. Dillon, Catherine Goldschmidt, and Alejandro Mart&iacute;nez &mdash; decided to go even further when it came to crafting the dragon-riding experience on screen. "Our goal was to make the scenes feel more subjective, as if the camera operator was riding on the dragon alongside the actor," &#268;ernjul, who served as cinematographer for episodes 6 and 7, told Mashable. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>&#268;ernjul headed up initial testing of the new approach to dragon-riding, which he explained involved "integrating handheld camera movements into a motion control system that synchronized with the mechanical buck." These movements were based on the previsualisation animations of the dragons, so the actors' motion on the buck would match with the VFX team's work.</p><p>For filming, a remote camera was placed on the buck itself. The camera operator stood separate from the buck, with a Libra console mounted on moose bars on their shoulder. "This setup allowed the remote head with the camera to react to handheld operation from the ground," &#268;ernjul explained. "The challenge was making it look like the camera operator was reacting to the buck's, or dragon's, movement. The problem was the camera operator on the ground was too stable, and we didn't want to fake the handheld movement."</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

        </a>
    </div>
<p>Then, inspiration struck in the unlikeliest of places. "I had a silly idea that ended up working," &#268;ernjul said. "I asked for a half-balance ball from a nearby gym and had the operator stand on it while operating. This made the camera operator a little off-balance, simulating the movement we needed. Our amazing camera operators were game to try anything, and this approach worked."</p><p>With the game-changing half-balance ball now in play, &#268;ernjul used a 32 mm prime lens to shoot dragon-riding scenes in his episodes, including Ulf the White's (Tom Bennett) first ride on Silverwing. "It was immersive, close enough to the actors for subjectivity, and long enough to convey movement," he said. He flagged his approach to <em>House of the Dragon</em>'s other DPs and directors, who adapted it as they saw fit.</p><p>"Our innovative setup made the dragon-riding scenes more realistic, and I'm proud of the results," &#268;ernjul said.</p><p>So, next time you're using a half-balance ball, don't just think of it as exercising. Think of it as preparing to shoot a dragon-riding scene &mdash; or, better yet, as preparing to ride a dragon yourself.</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/el4jA?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3B%3B%3Btemplate=article&amp%3B%3B%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3B%3B%3Belement=offer&amp%3B%3B%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3B%3B%3Belement_label=New%20episodes%20of%20House%20of%20the%20Dragon%20air%20Sundays%20at%209%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20HBO%20and%20Max.&amp%3B%3B%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3B%3B%3Bobject_uuid=00imlCa1Zf2bZssHTCnPdle&amp%3B%3B%3Bshort_url=el4jA&amp%3B%3B%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Fhouse-of-the-dragon-season-2-book-vs-show&amp%3B%3Btemplate=article&amp%3B%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3B%3Belement=offer&amp%3B%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3B%3Belement_label=New%20episodes%20of%20House%20of%20the%20Dragon%20air%20Sundays%20at%209%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20HBO%20and%20Max.&amp%3B%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3B%3Bobject_uuid=06mFehsZTcyFy1Ia3OrbNNP&amp%3B%3Bshort_url=el4jA&amp%3B%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Fhouse-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-6-the-shepherd-riots&amp%3Btemplate=article&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=The%20finale%20of%20House%20of%20the%20Dragon%20airs%20Aug.%204%20at%209%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20HBO%20and%20Max.&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=05Psh6IhgJkyVccvEBF5RyH&amp%3Bshort_url=el4jA&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fhelios-preview.mashable.com%2Farticle%2Fhouse-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-7-alicent-hightower-lake-scene&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=The%20finale%20of%20House%20of%20the%20Dragon%20Season%202%20airs%20Aug.%204%20at%209%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20HBO%20and%20Max.&object_type=article&object_uuid=01DpLDegoSK8srlibarO5mr&short_url=el4jA&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">The finale of <em>House of the Dragon </em>Season 2 airs Aug. 4 at 9 p.m. ET on HBO and Max.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In <a href="https://mashable.com/category/house-of-the-dragon" target="_self"><em>House of the Dragon</em></a><em> </em>Season 2, episode 7, the cumulative weight of these events finally proves too much to bear for Alicent, and she decides to take a trip to the Kingswood. This excursion marks the first time we've seen Alicent leave King's Landing since Viserys' hunt in <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-white-hart-episode-three" target="_self">Season 1, episode 3</a>. Here, though, there is no great retinue tending to the Dowager Queen. By her request, she's only accompanied by Ser Rickard Thorne (Vincent Regan), and she even rejects his company after a time.</p><p>Alicent's solo wandering through the Kingswood brings her to a lake. She wades in and floats in the water for an extended period of time. It's a rare moment of peace for Alicent &mdash; and for <em>House of the Dragon </em>in general &mdash; and it could hint at a huge change ahead for her.</p><h2>What does Alicent's lake scene mean?</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Before leaving King's Landing in episode 7, Alicent laments, "Nothing is clean here." The water of the lake, then, offers an opportunity for cleansing &mdash; and for rebirth. As she floats, she's washed clean of all the pain she bears. You can almost see that worry and anguish from her time in the Red Keep seep from her face the longer she stays in the lake.</p><p>But Alicent's time in the water isn't the only aspect of the lake scene that creates a sense of rebirth. In her walk down to the lake, she sheds her green cloak and dress until she's wearing only a simple white shift. Just like this is Alicent's first time out of King's Landing in over a season, this is also the first time we see her wearing a color other than green since she <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-alicent-hightower-green-dress-meaning" target="_self">adopted it in Season 1, episode 5</a>. The effect is destabilizing: This is Alicent without any of the iconography we associate her with. No green gowns, no symbols of the Faith of the Seven on her person, no members of the Kingsguard shadowing her. It's as if we're seeing Alicent in her simplest, purest state, an idea elevated by the white dress, which calls to mind a blank canvas, a new start.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

    </div>
<p>The loss of Alicent's green clothing is also notable in the context of the show. By this point, Aemond has booted Alicent from the Small Council. She has lost any of the power she fought so hard to gain and maintain. Every sacrifice she made, every time she stuck steadfastly to her duty &mdash; was it all for nothing?</p><p>Alicent certainly seems to think so, telling Grand Maester Orwyle (Kurt Egyiawan), "All my life I have endeavored to serve both my house and the realm, and somehow none of it matters. We are cast aside. Or hated." Now that she's been cast aside by her own son, and now that she knows Aegon's claim to the Iron Throne is all based on lies, what is tethering her to their cause anymore?</p><p>With this in mind, Alicent leaving her green clothing behind suggests a loss of allegiance to <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-green-black-rhaenyra-alicent" target="_self">Team Green</a>. Even the colors of the Kingswood point to Alicent ditching her family. She abandons the lush greenery of the forest in favor of the water. She may still be surrounded by green on all sides, but in the lake, she is far apart from it. </p><p>The sense of freedom from the Greens persists during Alicent's time in the lake. We see her stare up at a bird wheeling alone through the sky. In the water, she is its mirror image, flapping her arms just enough to keep her afloat. Perhaps, for the first time, she feels as if she really could be free as a bird and escape the systems of power that have held her down for so long. When she turns and keeps swimming away from the shore, there's a real possibility that she won't be coming back to Ser Rickard, that she plans to run as far from King's Landing as she can.</p><p>So does this scene mean that Alicent will immediately pledge herself to Rhaenyra in the Season 2 finale? Not completely. Aside from being a huge change from <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-book-vs-show" target="_self">George R.R. Martin's </a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-book-vs-show" target="_self"><em>Fire &amp; Blood</em></a>, an immediate alliance might not ring true after years of infighting and the deaths of family members. There remains so much to reconcile between the two of them, and even though their <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-3-rhaenyra-and-alicent-meeting" target="_self">brief reunion in episode 3</a> proves they have love for each other, the road to forgiveness and trust may be long and winding &mdash; thought not impossible.</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/el4jA?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3B%3Btemplate=article&amp%3B%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3B%3Belement=offer&amp%3B%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3B%3Belement_label=New%20episodes%20of%20House%20of%20the%20Dragon%20air%20Sundays%20at%209%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20HBO%20and%20Max.&amp%3B%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3B%3Bobject_uuid=00imlCa1Zf2bZssHTCnPdle&amp%3B%3Bshort_url=el4jA&amp%3B%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Fhouse-of-the-dragon-season-2-book-vs-show&amp%3Btemplate=article&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=New%20episodes%20of%20House%20of%20the%20Dragon%20air%20Sundays%20at%209%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20HBO%20and%20Max.&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=06mFehsZTcyFy1Ia3OrbNNP&amp%3Bshort_url=el4jA&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Fhouse-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-6-the-shepherd-riots&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=The%20finale%20of%20House%20of%20the%20Dragon%20Season%202%20airs%20Aug.%204%20at%209%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20HBO%20and%20Max.&object_type=article&object_uuid=05Psh6IhgJkyVccvEBF5RyH&short_url=el4jA&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">The finale of <em>House of the Dragon </em>Season 2 airs Aug. 4 at 9 p.m. ET on HBO and Max.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Now, Salim tackles a very different kind of father-son relationship in <a href="https://mashable.com/category/house-of-the-dragon" target="_self"><em>House of the Dragon</em></a>. He plays <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-4-who-is-alyn" target="_self">Alyn of Hull</a>, bastard child of Corlys Velaryon (Steve Toussaint) and brother to <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-6-seasmoke-new-rider-addam-velaryon" target="_self">newly minted dragonrider Addam</a> (Clinton Liberty). At the start of Season 2, Corlys and Alyn's relationship is distant, more that between a boss and an employee. But since Alyn saved Corlys' life offscreen during the events of Season 1, Corlys has begun paying more attention to him. In episode 6, he makes Alyn his first mate. In episode 7, he tasks him with recruiting bastard Targaryens in King's Landing to be <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-5-who-will-be-the-next-dragonriders" target="_self">new dragonriders for Rhaenyra</a> (Emma D'Arcy). Ever so slowly, Corlys is bringing Alyn into the light &mdash; but is it too little, too late?</p><p>In an interview with Mashable, Salim discussed the similarities between <em>Zau </em>and <em>House of the Dragon</em>, Alyn's complicated relationship with Corlys, and the surprisingly complicated shaving scene from episode 6.</p><p><em>The following interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</em></p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p><strong>Mashable: To start, I saw you <a href="https://x.com/Abzybabzy/status/1815672078915277193" target="_blank">tweet</a></strong><strong> that there was a line you liked so much in episode 6 that you "borrowed" it and put it in <em>Zau</em>. What was the line, and what was it about it that resonated with you enough that you brought it to your game?</strong></p><p>It was "You make an art of provoking me," [which Alyn says to Addam]. I remember reading it and being like, "Oh, that is the story of my life." It's almost like you're enjoying the fact that someone is provoking you, even though they are pushing your buttons. It was just a really powerful line that carries this element of, "I can respect it, but at the same time I'm really annoyed by it."</p><p><strong>You were directing <em>Zau </em>at the same time that you were shooting <em>House of the Dragon</em>. Both projects have interesting links to fatherhood. Did you ever find your work on one project influencing the other?</strong></p><p>Absolutely. Both deal with absent fathers, and they come in all kinds of forms. In <em>Zau</em>, you have a father who was loved dearly and passed away too soon. In <em>House of the Dragon</em>, you have a father who almost passed away without any sense of acknowledgment. But the ghost of them still haunts you. It was really interesting that I was directing this game about my relationship with my father to a degree, and also having a very different relationship with the father on set of <em>House of the Dragon</em>. They both really sung with one another.</p><p>I think that's why the line "You make an art of provoking me" really stuck with me. Because who else knows how better to annoy you than your own father, you know? I deliver the line to Addam, but it applies to all your kin.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p><strong>Tell me about building that family relationship with Alyn and Corlys and Addam.</strong></p><p>When Alyn looks at Corlys, there's a haunting element of, "No, his father is dead." His father doesn't exist in his eyes, but he's haunted by him. He just follows orders for his boss, who happens to also be his father. </p><p>I've read the books and did a lot of thinking about how Alyn is supposed to be 15. He's supposed to be young, boisterous &mdash; a different guy to the guy that I'm playing on-screen. That, to me, is interesting, because it means that he's had to live with all of this baggage for so many years. The whole relationship with Corlys is supposed to be transactional, but there is this deep yearning for love that, although it's buried deep, still exists. </p><p>Alyn puts that love and that kind of importance on Addam. He loves his brother dearly, cares for him, and doesn't want him to to be in any form of danger. Hell, now he's on a dragon. [<em>Laughs</em>] It's, like, the most dangerous thing.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p><strong>You mentioned the sense of baggage, and there's so much left unsaid between Alyn and Corlys. When you were first approaching the character of Alyn, how were you envisioning and developing his backstory?</strong></p><p>I saw him as always working at the shipyard before Addam was born, kind of keeping to himself. I think he was very much an Addam type of character, wanting and yearning for great, big things and thinking that his life would change. He probably never wanted to cut his hair, even though his mother probably forced him to do so, because the threat on your life is much bigger when you are a bastard. There's also a sense of waiting for his father to come back and take him and his mother away from the shitty life that they had. But that never happened, so he threw himself into work.</p><p>Then, once Addam came into play, that implies that Corlys came back, only to abandon them again. I think that was the killer. That's where his heart broke.</p><p>Funnily enough, there was a similar thing that happened to me when my father passed, the idea of being like, "Okay, I've got to be the man of the house now. I've got to make sure that everyone's fine; I've got to make the money, got to do everything, and keep everyone happy." That's essentially the role that Alyn took, and he was going to be the anchor of the space.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p><strong>What does it mean for him, after all that, hearing from Corlys that Addam is a dragonrider now?</strong></p><p>It's frightening, because it's such a change. It's the opposite of what he was prepared for. He's just heard of Princess Rhaenys' dragon Meleys dying, so there's the mentality that they are not gods, they're mortals. And if the Greens can do that to Rhaenys, what are they going to do to Addam?</p><p>So when Corlys tells Alyn, "Maybe you should have a look and give claiming a dragon a try," I think 15-year-old Alyn would have, whereas right now, Alyn couldn't think of anything worse.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p><strong>Rhaenys is a complicated figure in Alyn's life. How does Alyn feel about her passing?</strong></p><p>Death is always hard and saddening, but it's also just a part of life. With Rhaenys, it's almost like hearing of a neighbor passing, in a way. Even politically, I think Alyn thinks that the whole war is a bit silly and stupid, to be honest. He's very aware that it's not the lives of those higher up that are at stake. It's the lowborn people who are going to be sacrificing themselves for a petty family squabble. </p><p>Now that his brother's in the mix of it, it's even worse. It's even more frightening. That doesn't mean that Alyn doesn't want to engage in the war. He has a feeling of loyalty to Corlys, and to the sea, essentially. But he doesn't want his brother to be a part of that.</p><p><strong>In episode 7, we finally get the Sowing of the Seeds, and Alyn plays a bit of a role as the recruiter of the Targaryen bastards in King's Landing. What is going through his head when he gets this request from Corlys, as a bastard himself?</strong></p><p>He's just like, "Yeah, sure, I'll do it. Whatever. As long as you pay me, I'll do it." I don't think he cares much for it. He does what he's told to do... His most powerful yet weakest trait is his loyalty, which, if you've read <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-vs-fire-and-blood" target="_self"><em>Fire &amp; Blood</em></a><em> </em>&mdash; </p><p><strong>I was going to say, "Oh no!"</strong></p><p>[<em>Laughs</em>] Yeah. But with Corlys' request, his response comes from whatever will keep Addam safe. Think about it: If we get more dragons on our side, that means that Addam is less likely to die. Fantastic! He's always acting with the thought of, "How should I keep my brother safe and not involved in this madness as much as possible?"</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p><strong>And what was it like working with Steve Toussaint, as someone who is a veteran of the show already?</strong></p><p>I was frightened, man. You see him on-screen, you're like, "This guy's a force. Like an actual unit." But what's great is he's actually the most welcoming, grounded human being you will ever meet. He just does his thing. And working with Steve, I learned a hell of a lot. I learned to just enjoy the scene, enjoy the time. </p><p>There's always a fear as an actor of coming into a show when the whole team is there, because then you feel a bit like the outsider. But everyone has been so welcoming and made us feel as if we've been there from the get-go.</p><p><strong>You were also in <em>Raised by Wolves</em>, another big genre show. What was something you learned from that set that you brought to <em>House of the Dragon'</em>s?</strong></p><p>What I've taken from it is the passion and love from all departments on a project. We're all a team here, right? No one's special. You can really feel that.</p><p>On <em>Raised by Wolves</em>, you've got Ridley Scott, who's given me and Amanda [Collin] &mdash; I'm not necessarily saying that we're unknowns, but we weren't really known &mdash; a chance. But there was no sense of, "Why should we lead a show?" We were all just aiming for the same thing, which is telling a story. That reflects and resonates with <em>House of the Dragon</em> as well. We're not here to be stars or be special; we just want to enjoy and do our jobs. So I'd say carrying that mentality of not trying to take the limelight and being a team player has been a lovely tip. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p><strong>Did you and Amanda, who plays Jeyne Arryn on <em>House of the Dragon</em>, get a chance to reunite at all on the set?</strong></p><p>We definitely crossed paths, which was really lovely. We were really hoping for scenes together. It would have been so great, because she's so great to work opposite with. When I was watching the episodes and listening to her, the first thing I did was message her [to say], "Your accent is amazing!"</p><p><strong>I saw in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGaM07N3L_A" target="_blank">behind-the-scenes video for episode 6</a></strong><strong> that the scene where you shave your head was very technically demanding. When you're joining a show of this scale, did you ever think, "Shaving is going to be the toughest thing for me to deal with"?</strong></p><p>No, not at all! But to be honest, it's great. It's so funny, after <em>Raised by Wolves</em>, they can throw anything at me, and I love it. In that show, I had to have makeup, painted contacts, dyed ginger hair, and the silver bloody suit. So me putting glue on my head and shaving was like a dream. I was questioning how the hell they were going to pull off the shaving, but that's the power of an amazing crew: They will figure it out. </p><p>Any shot that you have my face in, I have glue on my head with sprinkles of the Velaryon blonde hair. I'd be shaving it, and the water would essentially wipe the glue off. But any close up with the actual sharp blade was someone else's head, and my barber's hands are cutting it. They brought in the barber I always go to, and he coached me on how to shave. He made it look like this is something that I do all the time.</p><p><strong>That's incredible. And finally, can you tease anything for what the Season 2 finale might hold for Alyn?</strong></p><p>You're definitely going to see something different.</p><p><strong>There's a shot of him in the trailer, where he's in armor and on a boat. And every week, I'm like, "Where is it?"</strong></p><p>I remember seeing that in the trailer and being like, "Guys, come on. Everyone's gonna be looking for that." You'll just have to wait and see, but it's one of my favorite scenes throughout the show.</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/el4jA?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3Btemplate=article&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=New%20episodes%20of%20House%20of%20the%20Dragon%20air%20Sundays%20at%209%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20HBO%20and%20Max.&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=06lZTSVicutMkerUHGnpIoB&amp%3Bshort_url=el4jA&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Fhouse-of-the-dragon-season-2-opening-credits-explained&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=The%20season%20finale%20of%20House%20of%20the%20Dragon%20airs%20Aug.%204%20at%209%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20HBO%20and%20Max.&object_type=article&object_uuid=03t3RIdXE3aJCl0VljohR9B&short_url=el4jA&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">The season finale of <em>House of the Dragon </em>airs Aug. 4 at 9 p.m. ET on HBO and Max.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>An example of that fleshing out is the relationship between Rhaenyra Targaryen (Emma D'Arcy) and Alicent Hightower (Olivia Cooke), whose fraught dynamic in the show benefits from the extra layers of seeing them grow up together before becoming bitter enemies. That strong adaptation choice is one of many that carries into Season 2, but there are plenty new deviations from <em>Fire &amp; Blood </em>on the way. Which ones work and add depth to the story of the Dance of the Dragons? Which ones are less successful?

<p><em>House of the Dragon </em>Season 2 opens with shots of snowy forests and the familiar sounds of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/game-of-thrones-theme-song-composter-interview" target="_self">Ramin Djawadi</a>'s Winterfell theme, which can only mean one thing for House Stark fans: We're so back.</p><p>After spending the first season mostly in and around Dragonstone and King's Landing, it's a delight to revisit the northernmost reaches of Westeros. Rhaenyra's eldest son Jacaerys (Harry Collett) flew up there in the Season 1 finale to treat with Lord Cregan Stark of Winterfell (Tom Taylor), and by the time we catch up with them at the beginning of Season 2, it seems like they've become good pals. They're taking a field trip up the Wall, bantering about the time Torrhen Stark bent the knee to Aegon the Conqueror, and discussing how the North can aid Rhaenyra in her war efforts.</p><div id="related-video" class="mx-auto mt-8 mb-12 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans md:mt-12 md:mb-16 text-primary-400">

<p><em>House of the Dragon </em>skips over quite a bit of material to get to Jace and Cregan's allyship. In classic <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em> fashion, there are several conflicting accounts of Jace's time in Winterfell in Martin's work. Of his many historical "sources," Grand Maester Munkun writes in his <em>True Telling</em> that the two became inseparable and swore a blood oath of brotherhood, while Septon Eustace claims that Jace badgered Cregan about converting to the Faith of the Seven. The most scandalous of all the accounts belongs, naturally, to court jester Mushroom, who says Jace fell in love with and married a bastard named Sara Snow, even though he was betrothed to his cousin Rhaena (Phoebe Campbell). </p><p>With only eight episodes in this season, <em>House of the Dragon </em>likely didn't have the time to get into all this potential Northern drama. We've got the Dance of the Dragons to kick off, people! Still, you can bet we haven't seen the last of Cregan Stark.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>In a move I didn't see coming (and that certainly isn't in <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>), Dowager Queen Alicent and Lord Commander of the Kingsguard Criston Cole (Fabien Frankel) are getting it on. Based on Alicent's assertion that they shouldn't hook up again (as if that's going to work), we can assume this affair has been going on for <em>a while</em>. So, when did this tryst begin? When did Cole come back around on the whole "breaking his Kingsguard oath of chastity" thing? When did Alicent decide, "Eh, screw it," and start doing exactly what she hated Rhaenyra for doing?</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Alicent and Criston's hypocrisy here doesn't bother me, as it's totally in keeping with their overly righteous characters. And it just makes sense that something would happen between these two. They're basically joined at the hip, and their joint animosity towards Rhaenyra adds a sweet psychosexual twist.

<p>In what is undoubtedly one of the darkest scenes ever featured in <em>House of the Dragon </em>and <em>Game of Thrones</em>, two assassins &mdash; known simply as Blood (Sam C. Wilson) and Cheese (Mark Stobbart) &mdash; sneak into the Red Keep and murder Aegon and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-helaena-rat-prophecy-blood-and-cheese" target="_self">Helaena's (Phia Saban)</a> infant son Jaehaerys.

<p>In the book, Blood and Cheese force Helaena to choose which of her sons she wants them to kill. When volunteering herself doesn't work, she chooses her youngest, Maelor, as Jaehaerys is heir to the Iron Throne. In a nasty twist, Blood and Cheese kill Jaehaerys instead &mdash; and tell Maelor that his mother wants him dead.</p><p>Things play out a little differently in <em>House of the Dragon</em>, although the final outcome is the same: Jaehaerys dies, and Helaena is traumatized for life. First off, Blood and Cheese's original target in the show is Aemond. That change already complicates the blame of Jaehaerys's death. It lets Daemon off the hook <em>a little </em>for bankrolling child murder, just as Vhagar's unauthorized chomping in the Season 1 finale means Aemond <em>technically </em>didn't murder Lucerys. But technicalities don't matter when children are dead.</p><p>Instead of finding Aemond, Blood and Cheese stumble upon Helaena and the twins Jaehaerys and Jaehaera. (Maelor is cut from the show entirely.) They make a snap judgment that one Targaryen son is as good as another and make Helaena tell them which of her children is Jaehaerys. She points him out, but there's a brief moment in which Blood thinks she's trying to double-cross them. After all, why would she give up the heir to the throne so easily? Surely she's actually pointing to Jaehaera. Cheese calls her bluff though and correctly surmises that she's actually singled out her son. With that, Jaehaerys becomes another victim in the Dance of the Dragons.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>This version of the Blood and Cheese scene nods a bit to the book version, with Helaena still having to make an impossible choice and there being trickery involved. However, there's an extra layer of tragedy here. Based on a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-helaena-rat-prophecy-blood-and-cheese" target="_self">rat-centric statement towards the beginning of the episode</a>, Helaena likely foresaw the arrival of Blood and Cheese in a prophetic dream. That means she's had quite a bit of time to think about this moment, and maybe even prepare for it. Her attempt to throw Blood and Cheese off of Jaehaerys's scent was her last-ditch effort to stop the inevitable. In failing, her action turns a horrifying scene into something even sadder.</p><h2><strong>Episode 2: The aftermath of Jaehaerys's death.</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Understandably, much of <em>House of the Dragon </em>Season 2's second episode deals with the fallout from Jaehaerys's murder at the hands of Blood and Cheese. Some elements from <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em> remain the same, such as Aegon's decision to murder all the ratcatchers. Other details are omitted. For example, the show's version of Alicent doesn't try to learn Blood's true name in order to "bathe in the blood of his wife and children." (Probably for the best.) Instead, her reaction is one of grief for Jaehaerys and especially Helaena.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Elsewhere, Hand of the King Otto Hightower (Rhys Ifans) views Jaehaerys's death as an opportunity to spread some good old-fashioned propaganda. He throws a funeral procession for Jaehaerys, with Helaena and Alicent riding with the young prince's corpse. Accompanying them is a crier telling onlookers to "behold the work of Rhaenyra the Cruel," weaponizing Jaehaerys's death against Rhaenyra. The scene is a show-only invention, yet one that's entirely in keeping with Otto's scheming persona. Plus, even though Alicent decries the procession as ghoulish, it seems like Otto's scheme actually works and wins sympathy points from the smallfolk. (At least, until Aegon hangs every ratcatcher in the vicinity.)</p><h2><strong>Episode 2: Rhaenyra and Daemon duke it out.</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>When Rhaenyra learns of Daemon's involvement in Jaehaerys's death, <em>House of the Dragon </em>treats us to a massive argument between the married couple (and uncle-niece pair). Rhaenyra worries that she can't trust Daemon, while Daemon claims Rhaenyra is as weak as her father. It's a brutal but deeply necessary fight, dredging up both characters' insecurities about their relationship, proximity to power, and different approaches to the brewing conflict with Aegon. And <em>none </em>of it is in <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>By this point in <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>, Daemon has already taken control of Harrenhal. He orchestrates the Blood and Cheese plot from afar, and we don't get enough of Rhaenyra's reaction to the murder to suggest that the two fall out over Daemon's actions. Instead, <em>House of the Dragon </em>fills in one of the emotional gaps of Martin's fictional history.

<p>Like much of <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-2-twins-erryk-arryk" target="_self">the duel between the Cargyll twins Arryk and Erryk</a> (Luke and Elliott Tittensor) is the subject of differing historical accounts. Munkun says their battle was epic, lasting for almost an hour and ending with the brothers dying in each other's arms. Mushroom, on the other hand, claims the fight was short-lived. Erryk (who fights for Rhaenyra) dealt Arryk (who fights for Aegon) a mortal blow fairly early on. He sustained a gut wound in the process, and succumbed to it after four painful days. Frankly, the latter seems more plausible, so we've got to give this round to Mushroom.</p><p>Also left ambiguous is the true goal of Arryk's mission to Dragonstone. Was he sent to kill Rhaenyra, or to murder her sons Jacaerys and Joffrey (Oscar Eskinazi)? <em>House of the Dragon </em>decides on the latter. It also moves the battle from "deep in the heart of Dragonstone" to Rhaenyra's chambers, putting her in more danger than in <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>. Here, she witnesses firsthand the kinslaying that will continue to take place should she and Aegon go to war outright. Will this prompt her to take swifter action, or will she stay her cautious course?</p><p>Perhaps the most interesting development in the Cargyll fight is the involvement of Mysaria (Sonoya Mizuno), who alerts Dragonstone to Arryk's presence. By this point in <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>, Mysaria and Rhaenyra haven't interacted much, although Mysaria does become Rhaenyra's unofficial mistress of whispers later on. However, Rhaenyra now owes Mysaria her life. Could this signal a greater (and earlier) partnership between the two, especially now that Daemon is gone?</p><h2><strong>Episode 3: The Battle of the Burning Mill and the Taking of Stone Hedge.</strong></h2><p>The first major battle of the Dance of the Dragons comes at the start of Season 2's third episode, when the long-feuding Blackwoods and Brackens take up arms against each other. The result is a slaughter, and while <em>House of the Dragon </em>doesn't show us the actual bloodshed, the field of corpses stretching as far as the eye can see is more than enough to get the job done. In <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>, the clash between the Blackwoods and Brackens becomes known as the Battle of the Burning Mill. The episode's opening shot of a turning mill (later seen burned to a crisp) is a solid nod to that. </p><p>However, <em>House of the Dragon </em>cuts the follow-up to the Battle of the Burning Mill. Martin's work sees what's left of the Bracken forces return to their seat at Stone Hedge, only to discover that Daemon, Caraxes, and several armies have taken it over in their absence. Getting rid of the Taking of Stone Hedge in the show isn't the greatest loss: Daemon has only just arrived in Harrenhal, meaning he hasn't had much time to assemble a host for Rhaenyra. Plus, the show appears to be saving up the first major dragon attack for a larger turning point, as Rhaenyra and Rhaenys (Eve Best) would rather opt for caution than unleashing a bloody war between dragons.</p><h2><strong>Episode 3: Daemon gets spooky visions at Harrenhal.</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

These visions are show-only additions, but they're rooted in book-specific lore. Harrenhal is basically Westeros' biggest haunted house, widely believed to be cursed since every House that runs it goes extinct. So how better to play up that cursed nature than with a series of strange nightmares that will force Daemon to confront his greatest mistakes and fears?</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Following the attempt on her life in episode 2, Rhaenyra makes the painful decision to send her youngest children away to the Vale (and hopefully later to Pentos). Rhaena (Phoebe Campbell) will accompany them, their hatchling dragons, and four unhatched dragon eggs. In <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>, it's Jacaerys who makes this call, as Rhaenyra is still grieving Lucerys. <em>House of the Dragon </em>brings Rhaenyra back into action much sooner, giving her the space to rule and make these decisions herself.</p><p>The most interesting change here involves the dragon eggs, three of which will look <em>very </em>familiar to <em>Game of Thrones </em>fans. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-3-daenerys-dragon-eggs" target="_self">Episode director Geeta Vasant Patel confirmed to Mashable</a> that the red, gold, and green eggs are the ones that will eventually find their way to Daenerys Targaryen. This confirmation marks a minor deviation from <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>, which heavily implies that Daenerys's eggs were stolen by a character named Elissa Farman during the reign of Jaehaerys I. Overall, though, the origin of Daenerys's eggs is left somewhat ambiguous, so their inclusion here is more of a fun (and literal) Easter egg. Plus, there's a sweetness to the fact that these eggs are the Targaryens' "hope for the future." From an audience standpoint, we know that they do find their way to the last Targaryen, centuries down the line.</p><h2><strong>Episode 3: Rhaenyra and Alicent reunite. </strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>In the biggest book-to-show change this season so far, Rhaenyra travels to King's Landing to speak directly to Alicent. The two don't interact until much later in the Dance in <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>, but given how much <em>House of the Dragon </em>has centered their relationship, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-3-rhaenyra-and-alicent-meeting" target="_self">their meeting here is necessary</a> &mdash; and electric.</p><p>On one level, this is Rhaenyra's last-ditch attempt to stop war from escalating. But on a deeper level, it's two friends trying to get through to one another, with Rhaenyra in particular trying to understand whether her father really changed his mind about having her as his successor. Alicent details how Viserys named Aegon as the Prince That Was Promised in his dying breath. Alarm bells immediately sound in Rhaenyra's head: This has all been a big misunderstanding about Aegon's dream of the Song of Ice and Fire! <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-green-black-rhaenyra-alicent" target="_self">Viserys never doubted Rhaenyra.</a></p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Back in Season 1, I found myself frustrated by the first mention of the Song of Ice and Fire, seeing it as cheap fan service for <em>Game of Thrones </em>fans. But with Viserys's last words, and with Rhaenyra's realization in her conversation with Alicent, <em>House of the Dragon </em>truly justifies its use of Aegon's dream. It's not just an attempt to connect to a series that came before. It's the point around which so much of this war revolves. (Also, just a cautionary tale about naming everyone in the family the same thing.)</p><p>Following Rhaenyra's revelation, a new question arises: How will Alicent act going forward, now that she knows she's made a grave error? </p><h2><strong>Episode 4: Alicent's abortion and her possible change of heart.</strong></h2><p>Season 2's fourth episode, "The Red Dragon and the Gold," sees Alicent undertaking two difficult tasks. First, she aborts a pregnancy from her affair with Criston using a specially brewed tea. Then, she scours historical texts looking for any sign of Aegon's dream. Since both her relationship with Criston and her <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-3-rhaenyra-and-alicent-meeting" target="_self">episode 3 discussion with Rhaenyra</a> are show-only additions, Alicent's story in "The Red Dragon and the Gold" is totally new.</p><p>Here, Alicent's research has the potential to set her on a new path from <em>Fire &amp; Blood </em>entirely. Now that she doubts Aegon II's claim and realizes how horribly she messed up, will she work to undermine the ruler she helped put on the Iron Throne? Based on her discussion with Larys Strong (Matthew Needham), that seems unlikely, as she's resigned to the fact that war is coming no matter what. However, since Larys knows about Alicent's doubts as well as her secret abortion, he's got some extra leverage against her should she choose to act against his interests.</p><h2><strong>Episode 4: Aegon and Aemond at Rook's Rest.</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>"The Red Dragon and the Gold" culminates in this season's first dragon battle: a massive set piece fought over the castle of Rook's Rest. The outcome here is the same as in the book &mdash; Rhaenys (Eve Best) and Meleys dead, and Aegon and Sunfyre fallen, all at the hands (or claws) of Vhagar. But as in much of <em>House of the Dragon</em>, the route the show takes to get there is a little different from how it plays out in <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>.</p><p>In the book, Aegon and Aemond attack Rhaenys together. But in the show, Aegon's arrival interferes with Criston and Aemond's original plan.

<p><em>House of the Dragon </em>has been building the hostility between Aemond and Aegon for a while now. In Season 1, we saw Aegon tormenting Aemond as a child for not having a dragon of his own. And in episode 3, Aegon teased Aemond mercilessly when he found him at the brothel. A lot may have changed in the realm between those points, but the bullying has certainly never stopped. Aegon may think his brother is loyal as a hound, but when Aemond opens fire on him and Rhaenys at Rook's Rest, there's no doubt about it: This is retribution. </p><h2><strong>Episode 5: Alicent pitches herself to rule.</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Following the game-changing events at <a href="https://mashable.com/video/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-4-battle-making-of" target="_self">Rook's Rest</a>, we learn that <a href="https://helios-preview.mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-4-is-aegon-dead" target="_self">Aegon did not die</a>. Instead, he's horribly injured, covered in burns, with some of his armor nearly fused to his body. He's in no state to rule, so while he recovers &mdash; if he even can! &mdash; his Small Council must choose a regent to rule in his stead.</p><p>In <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>, Criston simply chooses <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-episode-4-aegon-dies-who-becomes-king" target="_self">Aemond</a> to be Prince Regent and Protector of the Realm. (This results in a delightfully catty moment where Aemond wears Aegon's crown and declares, "It looks better on me than it ever did on him.") <em>House of the Dragon </em>adds a wrinkle to the mix: Alicent puts herself forward as an option, having ruled while Viserys was ill. The men of the Small Council, including her usual allies Larys and Criston, opt for Aemond instead. For them, Alicent's caution is no match for her son's experience in battle, which will prove useful in the war ahead. </p><p>The decision sends Alicent into a contained spiral, with the remainder of the scene emphasizing her upset breathing over the Small Council's proceedings. This entire meeting is yet another example of Alicent being undermined by those around her and deprived of any meaningful say in the rule of Westeros. For example, in the book, it's Alicent who orders that the gates of King's Landing be barred to prevent anyone from coming and going. In the show, that command goes to Aemond.</p><p>Between this slight, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-episode-4-aemond-killing-aegon" target="_self">Aemond's poorly hidden fratricide attempt</a>, and her <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-3-rhaenyra-and-alicent-meeting" target="_self">discussion with Rhaenyra</a> about the Song of Ice and Fire, it seems like Alicent's belief in the Greens' cause is weakening from episode to episode.

<p>While the Brackens' fall at the Taking of Stone Hedge doesn't appear in episode 3 along with the Battle of the Burning Mill, it <em>does </em>happen offscreen in episode 5. There are still some notable changes, though: First, Daemon and Caraxes are not directly involved. Second, Daemon encourages a violent assault against the innocent residents of Bracken land here, instead of simply taking the castle. Third, the Blackwoods' resulting aggression at Stone Hedge has alienated Daemon from the rest of the river lords. This marks a significant divergence from <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>, where the Taking of Stone Hedge involves "a strong host made up of Darrys, Rootes, Pipers, and Freys." </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>By this point in the book, Daemon has already amassed a considerable army and is not facing infighting. He's basically the perfect general for Team Black. However, <em>House of the Dragon </em>turns Harrenhal into a testing ground for Daemon, where emotional turmoil and self-doubt about his relationships materializes in the form of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-4-daemon-harrenhal-vision-explainer" target="_self">haunting visions</a>.

<p>Daemon's biggest problem in his stint at Harrenhal (besides the frequent hauntings) has been the fact that he's been unable to unite the Riverlords under one banner. The easiest way to do this would be getting Lord Grover Tully's full support. However, an illness has left Grover incapacitated, and his heirs dare not act without his word. As a result, Daemon finds himself in an impossible waiting game &mdash; although that didn't stop him from encouraging young Oscar Tully (Archie Barnes) to smother his grandpa in his sleep. Charming stuff!</p><p>The stalemate finally breaks in episode 6, when Grover succumbs to his illness. Not only does Grover's death come far earlier than in <em>Fire &amp; Blood </em>&mdash; it occurs differently, too. Here, <em>House of the Dragon </em>highly implies that Harrenhal's <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-4-daemon-harrenhal-vision-explainer" target="_self">resident witch Alys Rivers (Gayle Rankin)</a> had <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-alys-rivers-lord-tully" target="_self">something to do with Grover's death</a> after she volunteered to "tend" to him. When paired with Alys' pep talk to Daemon about the Tullys being the key to the Riverlands, it's pretty clear we're looking at murder here.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>But why did Alys kill in order to further Daemon's cause? The two have already interacted more in the show than they ever did in the book, as the show has expanded upon Daemon's time in Harrenhal (and made him suffer even more while there). Does she have some hidden, witchy agenda that Daemon is the key to? Is she trying to keep her own head while such a volatile man resides in her castle? Or is she just having a fun, witchy time?</p><h2><strong>Episode 6: Rhaenyra and Mysaria are an item now!</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Season 2 has seen Rhaenyra and Mysaria grow much closer than their book counterparts by this point in the Dance of the Dragons. Rhaenyra offered Mysaria her freedom, Mysaria saved Rhaenyra's life by alerting her Kingsguard to the attempted Arryk/Erryk plot, and for the past several episodes, the two have conspired on how best to take down the Greens. In a surprising (but not at all unwelcome) turn, their relationship blossoms into something more in episode 6, when the two share a passionate kiss.</p><p>This romance is entirely new to the show, but following Rhaenyra and Mysaria's charged prior interactions this season, as well as queer readings of Rhaenyra (and especially her relationship with Alicent), it feels more than earned. Plus, it's a solid nod to the many canonically queer women of <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>, including the recently introduced Jeyne Arryn (Amanda Collin). Some of these women, like Princess Rhaena Targaryen (not to be confused with <em>House of the Dragon</em>'s Rhaena) and her lover Elissa Farman, weren't alive during the <em>Dance of the Dragons</em>, so they wouldn't appear in the show. Others, like Alysanne Blackwood and Sabitha Frey, have yet to be introduced, but do play a part in the Dance.</p><h2><strong>Episode 6: Addam claims Seasmoke &mdash; but not on Dragonstone.</strong></h2><p>By the end of episode 5, Rhaenyra and Jace<strong> </strong>hatch a plan to <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-5-who-will-be-the-next-dragonriders" target="_self">recruit more dragonriders</a> to their cause. That plan comes to a screeching halt in episode 6, after Seasmoke barbecues Ser Steffon Darklyn (Anthony Flanagan) mid-dragon claiming attempt. </p><p>In <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>, one knight dying is not enough to make Rhaenyra and Jace give up their search. They seek out anyone who may be of Targaryen descent, including bastards &mdash; known as "dragonseeds" or simply "seeds." Many, many hopeful dragonriders perish in the bloody process, which becomes known as the Red Sowing or the Sowing of the Seeds. However, one of the very few success stories is that of Addam of Hull (Clinton Liberty), bastard son of Corlys Velaryon (Steve Toussaint) and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-6-seasmoke-new-rider-addam-velaryon" target="_self">Seasmoke's new rider</a>.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Addam's claiming of Seasmoke is a public affair in <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>, as is the rest of the Sowing. However, in <em>House of the Dragon</em>, it's almost an accident. Seasmoke clearly misses her bond with Laenor, but isn't willing to settle for someone like Steffon. Instead, she hunts down her own rider: Laenor's half-brother. We don't see the claiming onscreen, but we're able to infer that the new dragonrider Rhaenyra hears about at the end of the episode is none other than Addam.</p><p>So how will Rhaenyra react when she discovers Addam as the dragonrider? She'll likely restart the search for other dragonriders. But instead of just focusing on highborn candidates like Steffon, this new iteration of the Sowing will be open to bastards. And that could make all the difference.</p><h2><strong>Episode 7: Daemon executes Willem Blackwood.</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Daemon <em>finally </em>gets his army of Riverlords in episode 7. All it costs him is the head of Willem Blackwood (Jack Parry-Jones), one of his only allies in the Riverlands who actually liked him.</p><p>Just like most of Daemon's Harrenhal drama, Willem is a show-only invention. However, his death will surely spell disaster for Team Black's in-show relationship with House Blackwood, even though the Blackwoods are stalwart supporters of Rhaenyra in <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>. If the show ends up introducing characters like Benjicot and Alysanne Blackwood, how will they react to the execution of one of their family members? Will they still stand by Daemon and the other Riverlords? </p><h2><strong>Episode 7: It's time for the Sowing of the Seeds.</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Addam's claiming of Seasmoke in episode 6 plants a seed in Rhaenyra and Mysaria's minds &mdash; one might even call it a "dragonseed." The two extend the call for dragonriders to lowborn Targaryen bastards, and the Sowing of the Seeds begins in earnest.</p><p>In <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>, it's Jace who heads up the process of finding new dragonriders. However, the show's version of Jace is far less enthusiastic about reaching out to bastards. After all, he's been haunted all his life by the knowledge that he is a bastard. Having a dragon legitimizes his claim to the Iron Throne, but if other bastards claim dragons, will they also make claims of their own? </p><p>Strife between Jace and Rhaenyra isn't the only element of the Sowing that's different from <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>. The sequence in the book reads like a conveyor belt of hopeful dragonriders, each taking their turn mounting a dragon, only to suffer brutal injuries or deaths. Here, <em>House of the Dragon </em>simply unleashes Vermithor on all the prospective riders until he encounters Hugh Hammer (Kieran Bew). The sequence is chaotic and terrifying all at once, a reminder of the sheer power of dragons (and the madness of Rhaenyra's entire plan).</p><p>Meanwhile, Ulf the White (Tom Bennett) runs away and stumbles on Silverwing, instead of mounting her during the more formal Sowing of the book. Their encounter is a bit of levity following the disaster of the Sowing, and it offers us a look at a different kind of dragon bond. Seasmoke knew exactly what he wanted in a rider, leading him to hunt down Addam. Vermithor appeared drawn to Hugh's strength, as well as the selflessness he displayed when he distracted Vermithor so another bastard could escape. Silverwing, on the other hand, seems to see Ulf as a plaything she can nudge around with her snout. Clearly, there's more than one way to claim a dragon.</p><h2><strong>Episode 7: Where is Nettles?</strong></h2><p>Addam, Ulf, and Hugh aren't the only new dragonriders in <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>. Martin also introduces fan-favorite Nettles, a 16-year-old girl who tames the wild dragon Sheepstealer with her wits. She notably doesn't have any Valyrian blood that we know of, so her ability to ride a dragon is another strike against the idea that only the Targaryens can do so.</p><p>Nettles is completely missing from <em>House of the Dragon</em>, but Sheepstealer isn't. The wild dragon hunting in the Vale is almost certainly the show's version of this legendary dragon &mdash; and Rhaena's interest in finding and claiming it means that her storyline is getting merged with Nettles' role in the books.</p><p>On a plot level, the consolidation makes some sense. Cutting Nettles means <em>House of the Dragon </em>has one less character to wrangle, plus the show gets to give Rhaena more of an arc than just babysitting and hanging out in the Vale. (However, this will definitely interfere with her <em>Fire &amp; Blood </em>arc down the line.) That said, fans have <a href="https://x.com/blkcomictwit/status/1815210224615039486" target="_blank">expressed frustration</a> at Nettles being combined with Rhaena, as Nettles is the only canonically Black dragonrider in <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>.</p><p>We'll be updating this article as <em>House of the Dragon </em>Season 2 continues airing, so check back weekly for more differences between the show and <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>. </p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/el4jA?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=New%20episodes%20of%20House%20of%20the%20Dragon%20air%20Sundays%20at%209%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20HBO%20and%20Max.&object_type=article&object_uuid=00imlCa1Zf2bZssHTCnPdle&short_url=el4jA&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">New episodes of <em>House of the Dragon </em>air Sundays at 9 p.m. ET on HBO and Max.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The video, a "parody" created by right-wing YouTuber Mr. Reagan, is a re-edited version of Harris' "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHky_Xopyrw" target="_blank">We Choose Freedom</a>" campaign video. In this new version, the sitting VP is heard calling President Joe Biden "senile" and a "deep state puppet." On top of the DEI hire line, the video also posits that Harris believes she's above criticism because she's a woman and a person of color.</p><p>Mr. Reagan notes in his post that the video is a "parody," however when Musk reposted it, the CEO did not give such a disclaimer. At the time of this writing, the video has been seen over 166 million times, with Musk stating in his post, "This is amazing &#128514;."</p><p>Despite owning the platform, it seems Musk is willfully disregarding that the video violates <a href="https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/manipulated-media" target="_blank">X's terms of service</a>, which prohibit "synthetic, manipulated or out-of-context media that may deceive or confuse people and lead to harm." </p><p>Comment and quotes tweets of Musk's repost were quick to point out this fact.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

The game is all about finding the "common threads between words." And just like <em>Wordle</em>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-20-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> resets after midnight and each new set of words gets trickier and trickier&mdash;so we've served up some hints and tips to get you over the hurdle.</p><p>If you just want to be told today's puzzle, you can jump to the end of this article for July 28's <em>Connections</em> solution. But if you'd rather solve it yourself, keep reading for some clues, tips, and strategies to assist you.</p><h2><strong>What is <em>Connections</em>?</strong></h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <a class="text-gray-600" href="https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1679674590203723778?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(opens in a new window)">

</blockquote>
<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>
<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. Like <em>Wordle, </em>you can share the results with your friends on social media.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01XKRvz8QDZDHVf0n1RGoU7/hero-image.jpg" alt="SAG-AFTRA members on strike in 2023"><p>Video game voice and motion capture performers have gone on strike for the second time in a decade.</p><p>After a year and a half of negotiations between SAG-AFTRA and major video game companies like Activision, Electronic Arts, and Take-Two Interactive, the portion of the union's membership that works on video games has initiated a work stoppage that went into effect on Friday morning. In a statement on <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-members-who-work-video-games-go-strike" target="_blank">its website</a>, SAG-AFTRA said, with no uncertainty, that artificial intelligence protections are the "sticking point." </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse A.I. to the detriment of our members," union president Fran Drescher said in the statement. "Enough is enough. When these companies get serious about offering an agreement our members can live &mdash; and work &mdash; with, we will be here, ready to negotiate."</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>In a statement to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24206352/sag-aftra-video-game-performer-strike-ea-disney-activision" target="_blank">Polygon</a>, a spokesperson for the gaming companies' side Audrey Cooling claimed the AI terms that SAG-AFTRA did not agree to are "among the strongest in the entertainment industry." According to Cooling, the two sides have agreed to 24 of 25 contract proposals, leaving AI as the final nail to be hammered down.</p><p>While the exact contract language that both sides have been trying to agree to for the last 18 months is not public, the issue is familiar to anyone who has followed AI and the arts in recent years. Put simply, voice actors and motion capture performers are worried that, without proper labor protections, video game companies could use their work to train AI models that could then replace their labor. </p><p>As the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/25/artificial-intelligence-sagaftra-ai-video-games/d01249ae-4abc-11ef-9149-c75da5dd9201_story.html" target="_blank">Washington Post</a> also pointed out, the use of AI could negatively impact young performers who are trying to break into the industry. If the kinds of background, non-player character roles that usually go to those people were instead relegated to AI, it may be harder to break into the industry. </p><p>It's worth noting that SAG-AFTRA <a href="https://mashable.com/article/sag-aftra-ai-voiceover-agreement-video-games-ces-2024" target="_self">struck a side deal</a> with an AI company earlier this year, so the union has not been inherently opposed to AI up to this point.</p><p>This is not the first time SAG-AFTRA's gaming workers have gone on strike. In 2016, voice actors started a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/voice-actor-strike" target="_self">work stoppage</a> that lasted almost an entire year. That particular strike had more to do with "old" problems like bonuses, royalties, and worker safety than new, rapidly developing technology. In other words, it could theoretically be a while before these two sides come to an agreement.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This year's entry in this long-running annual show coincides with the warmest nights and early mornings of the year in the Northern Hemisphere, which will be a good one.&nbsp;</p><p>2024's display comes with impressive &mdash; possibly even blockbuster &mdash; viewing conditions.&nbsp;</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>Exactly what are the Perseids?</h2><p>The Perseid meteor shower is our planet's annual run-in with the trail of debris left behind by a comet called 109P/Swift-Tuttle, which, like us, is orbiting the sun, but on a different course that happens to intersect with ours. As the Earth orbits through this trail of tiny granules called meteoroids, they slam into our atmosphere at blistering speeds and ignite. The meteoroids become what we call meteors only for a moment, during their spectacular deaths.&nbsp;</p><p>This all happens about 60 miles above your head during your meteor-gazing session. For reference, the moon is roughly 24,000 miles away, and Mirfak, the brightest star in the constellation Perseus, is 510 light-years away. The meteors are very close, in other words &mdash; so close that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/13/us/meteor-salt-lake-city-boom.html" target="_blank">you can sometimes hear them.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle, with its 16-mile-wide nucleus, is colossal &mdash; the largest object known to repeatedly pass by our planet, which it won't do again until 2126. Will this giant ever smash into Earth? Not in 2126, and possibly not ever. But <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/360623a0.pdf" target="_blank">there's a tiny chance it could &mdash; catastrophically &mdash; at some indeterminate point in the distant future</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>When to catch the Perseids at their peak in 2024</h2><p>The show will crescendo, with 100 meteors per hour sometimes visible, in the pre-dawn hours of August 12.</p><p>For best results, stay up late the night of Sunday, August 11, and into the early hours of Monday, or look up when the sky is dark any time until the end of August. Viewing conditions depend on how dim the moon is, and in 2024 we're in luck: it will only be at 50 percent illumination at the peak. It's also set to dip below the horizon around midnight, meaning the wee hours of the morning will be essentially moonless for your meteor viewing pleasure.&nbsp;</p><p>As always, the moon's precise schedule differs depending on where you are, so <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/usa" target="_blank">check your local listings</a>.</p><p>It's worth noting that as one of the more drawn-out meteor displays, the Perseids linger for well over a month every year, meaning activity is visible from mid-July to late August. Peak activity is when you'll theoretically see the most meteors, assuming favorable moon and weather conditions, but any clear night during the shower's active period is a chance to see the Perseids. For instance, the new moon on August 4 will darken the skies, providing another possible opportunity for great off-peak viewing.&nbsp;</p><h2>How to spot the Perseids in 2024</h2><p>The Perseids get their name from the fact that they appear to radiate from the constellation Perseus. This can be a little deceptive, however, because you don't have to worry about finding Perseus; meteors seem to streak across the whole sky during a shower. Pointing out Perseus during your viewing session will make you the hand-raising, A+ student of your stargazing party &mdash; but it probably won't help anyone see more meteors.&nbsp;</p><p>For optimum viewing, get to a dark location away from city lights. Even suburban or exurban lights can pollute the precious darkness, so get to the deep wilderness if you can. Give your pupils about 30 minutes to widen, initiating your body's too-seldom-used night vision mode. Telescopes and binoculars are fun but unnecessary, or even counterproductive since they limit your peripheral vision.&nbsp;</p><p>But I'm making this too complicated. Is it your first time stargazing in a while? Just do what they do in movies: lie back on a blanket, relax, and stare up at the dang sky.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In the image below, you can see the novel Martian structures NASA scientists observed in this rock.

<p>NASA planetary scientists are certainly excited. </p><p>"As a rock geek/scientist and as the Director of @NASAJPL &mdash; this is the kind of discovery you hope for &mdash; where mind-bending observations make your heart beat just a little faster," NASA's Laurie Leshin <a href="https://x.com/LaurieofMars/status/1816572464421589010" target="_blank">posted online</a>. </p><p>"This is more than intriguing, it&rsquo;s really exciting!

<p>And, crucially, to move up the scale, the sample (from a rock named Cheyava Falls) must be closely analyzed in labs on Earth, with far more instruments than the distant, car-sized rover can carry. This can prove if non-biological factors actually formed the structures, confirm the presence of past life, rule out other hypotheses, and beyond. NASA's <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nasa-mars-sample-return-status" target="_self">Mars Sample Return</a> mission, however, is in jeopardy. It would cost around $11 billion, a price the <a href="https://mashable.com/category/space" target="_self">space</a> agency can't afford.

"Scientifically, Perseverance has nothing more to give. To fully understand what really happened in that Martian river valley at Jezero Crater billions of years ago, we'd want to bring the Cheyava Falls sample back to Earth, so it can be studied with the powerful instruments available in laboratories."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Some may live longer than 500 years. And biologists have identified an important reason for their impressive longevity. The sharks, an Arctic species dwelling thousands of feet underwater, do not age like other <a href="https://mashable.com/article/extinct-species-animals-2023" target="_self">animals</a>: Their metabolisms should slow as they grow older, resulting in cellular changes. But the researchers' analysis of differently aged Greenlands sharks show their metabolisms don't diminish. They are a biological curiosity.</p><p>"Every detail about this animal is fascinating and the more I find out about them, the further I am motivated to continue my work," Ewan Camplisson, a biologist pursuing a PhD at the University of Manchester, told Mashable.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Camplisson presented this new research at the Society for Experimental Biology Annual Conference in July. </p><p>The sharks don't just grow profoundly old. They're also the only shark species capable of living in the frigid Arctic year-round. And that's not all. "They are one of the slowest swimming fish when accounting for size, the females only become sexually reproductive at approximately 150 years old, they have tiny brains yet can seemingly hunt and navigate vast distances, the majority of the population live most of their lives with parasites in their eyes and their flesh is so full of toxins such as TMAO and urea that they are poisonous to eat for humans," Camplisson marveled.</p><p>Scientists have suspected the sharks' extremely slow movement and life in the cold may contribute to the species' unusual age &mdash; and these are likely important factors. But Camplisson noticed that other <a href="https://mashable.com/article/arctic-climate-change" target="_self">Arctic</a> fish species, such as the northern wolffish, also dwell in cold waters, are predatory, and move relatively little. But this fish only lives for some 20 years. Another deep sea species, the dominant <a href="https://mashable.com/article/sixgill-shark-tag-deep-ocean" target="_self">sixgill shark</a>, is predatory, slow-moving, lives in the cold deep sea (but found in oceans around the world), yet lives for 80 years &mdash; <em>not centuries</em>.</p><p>"Therefore we thought that there must be other factors also involved in the Greenland sharks' longevity," Camplisson said.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>So Camplisson and his team investigated the sharks' metabolism. They used preserved Greenland shark red muscle, from 23 sharks of different ages, to observe how metabolic enzymes would react when activated. The sharks ranged in age from around 60 to 200 years. As illustrated above, the muscle samples were suspended in a liquid that reacted to the enzyme's changes; the more activity, the more shift in color. A machine called a spectrophotometer, which assesses changes in light intensity, measured these changes. And as described earlier, sharks of all ages didn't show signs of any metabolic slowdown. </p><p>It's clear these Arctic <a href="https://mashable.com/article/sharks-chagos-archipelago-population-declines-human-impact" target="_self">sharks</a> live a long time. But it's unclear why. It's possible that gradually growing and maturing for over a century simply sets them up for adult success. </p><p>"My best guess would be that the deep waters of the Arctic can be a challenging environment to live in, where an animal such as the Greenland shark may not have consistent access to plenty of food and they may not frequently be in contact with other Greenland sharks," Camplisson explained, noting they swim slowly in a vast ocean environment. And, crucially, they have few predators. There's not much to stop them from thriving in the depths. "Therefore, as a species with low natural mortality rates, their optimal life strategy would be one of a slow growth and building reserves of energy, so that when they do interact with the opposite sex they are in a suitable condition to reproduce," he said.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Wielding such intriguing research results, Camplisson intends to further analyze these sharks' tissues, and their anti-aging metabolisms. It won't just satisfy deep sea biological curiosity. </p><p>"I believe that if we can work out how the Greenland shark lives so long and how they seem to be so resilient to age related diseases (such as cardiac disease), we may be able to improve the quality of life within the elderly human population," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2><strong>What is really killing U.S. birds</strong></h2><p>A host of human-caused factors kill <a href="https://mashable.com/article/extinct-animals-2023-bird" target="_self">birds</a>. The most damaging, by far, live among us.</p><p>"The worst of these are feral or outdoor pet cats, estimated to kill as many as <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms2380" target="_blank">4 billion birds per year</a>, including many of the backyard songbirds that people value and control our insects," Clark explained. (At minimum, cats probably kill well over 1 billion birds in the U.S. annually.)</p><p>This is why biologists urge people to keep their cats inside. "Just one person keeping their cat indoors can save hundreds, maybe thousands, of birds. That&rsquo;s a no-brainer," bird biologist Nico Arcilla previously told Mashable.</p><p>The next-highest bird killer in the U.S. are buildings (and their windows), estimated to <a href="https://bioone.org/journals/the-condor/volume-116/issue-1/CONDOR-13-090.1/Birdbuilding-collisions-in-the-United-States--Estimates-of-annual/10.1650/CONDOR-13-090.1.full" target="_blank">kill some 365 to 988 million birds</a> each year. "Those kills range from the tiniest hummingbirds to large owls," Clark said. (Here's <a href="https://www.birds.cornell.edu/home/seven-simple-actions-to-help-birds/" target="_blank">how to limit the number of birds</a> that crash into your windows.) And it's not just towering buildings. Any structures or objects in the path of bird flight &mdash; power lines, communication towers, and cars &mdash; contribute to the millions of avian deaths annually, Clark added. Cars kill an estimated 214 million birds each year.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>And then there are innumerable culprits that are difficult to count because they require collecting and assaying bird bodies for toxins. These include rodenticides, agricultural pesticides, water pollution, and beyond. </p><p>Wind turbines, however, are a relatively small player in bird mortality. "Research shows&nbsp;that wind projects rank near the bottom of the list of human-related bird mortalities, resulting in far fewer annual deaths than those caused by house cats, building collisions, or vehicle impacts," the Department of Energy explains. Turbines on land, with huge spinning blades, kill an estimated 234,012 birds annually, <a href="https://www.fws.gov/library/collections/threats-birds" target="_blank">according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</a>.</p><h2><strong>Wind farms limit bird deaths</strong></h2><p>Abundant wind energy, which supplies <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/wind/advantages-and-challenges-wind-energy" target="_blank">125,000 jobs in the U.S.</a> and <a href="https://climate.mit.edu/ask-mit/would-getting-all-our-electricity-wind-and-solar-power-raise-price-electricity" target="_blank">cheap energy</a>, is growing.</p><p>Fortunately, we can build or operate wind farms to curb avian deaths. "There are all sorts of ways that we can limit risks to birds," Jeff Buler, a wildlife ecologist at the University of Delaware, told Mashable.</p><p>This includes locating wind farms away from migratory passages, painting blades black (a visual aid that slashed bird deaths at a Norway wind farm by <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.6592" target="_blank">70 percent</a>), adding sound, and using fewer but larger turbines. Turbines can also be turned off on the handful of nights many birds are migrating through a specific region. Buler and other researchers found that by <a href="https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/conl.12887" target="_blank">observing radar data</a>, the migration of birds through corridors like the Great Lakes region can be well-predicted, allowing turbine operators the ability to temporarily shut down operations. "You can reduce collisions," Buler said.</p><q>
    "It's way easier to make false claims than back up claims with evidence."
    </q>
<p>While wind farms aren't free of environmental costs, they almost certainly kill far fewer birds than the <a href="https://mashable.com/feature/carbon-footprint-pr-campaign-sham" target="_self">fossil fuel sector</a>, which requires intensive mining and burning of fuels.</p><p>"Coal-, oil-, and natural gas-fired power plants induce avian deaths at various points throughout their fuel cycle: upstream during coal mining, onsite collision and electrocution with operating plant equipment, and downstream poisoning and death caused by acid rain, mercury pollution, and climate change," according to a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1943815X.2012.746993#d1e244" target="_blank">research article</a> in the <em>Journal of Integrative Environmental Sciences</em>. The study concludes that "fossil-fueled facilities are about 35 times more dangerous to birds on a per GWh basis than wind energy." (A GWh, or Gigawatt hour, is a measurement unit for the production or consumption of energy.)</p><p>In the coming months and beyond, you're likely to see more misleading claims about renewable energy and a host of other topics. Beware the soundbites and spurious talking points.</p><p>"It's way easier to make false claims than back up claims with evidence," Buler said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Over 30 movies and counting, the baddies have gotten badder and badder &mdash;&nbsp;in great ways. </p><p>To toast the unveiling of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/deadpool-and-wolverine-review" target="_self"><em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine,</em></a><em> </em>who officially bring the X-Men crew into the MCU, let's look back at all the villains who got us here. </p><p>How do Mr. Paradox and Cassandra Nova stack up to the likes of Loki, Thanos, and Killmonger?

<p>Literally who?<em>*</em> &mdash; <em>Angie Han, Deputy Entertainment Editor</em></p><h2><strong>44. Dormammu (<em>Doctor Strange</em>)</strong></h2><p>I still don't entirely understand what Dormammu is, and I don't care. And if you're about to launch into an explanation based on the comics, my point is that the movie doesn't do a good job of explaining what he is or why I should care.<em>*</em> &mdash; <em>A.H.</em></p><h2><strong>43. Ivan Vanko (<em>Iron Man 2</em>)</strong></h2><p>With his gold teeth, thick Russian accent, and pet cockatoo, Vanko is basically a latter-day Johnny Depp character &mdash; and as with most latter-day Johnny Depp characters, there doesn't seem to be anything like an actual person underneath all those tiresome affectations.<em>*</em> &mdash; <em>A.H.</em></p><h2><strong>42. The Dweller-in-Darkness (<em>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings</em>)</strong></h2><p>The Dweller-in-Darkness is the CGI manifestation of studio executives flipping through the screenplay of <em>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings</em> and realizing that there&rsquo;s nothing in there that would make a cool Lego set. It&rsquo;s not on the very bottom of the list because all it wants to do is eat snacks (relatable), and everyone after this entry is in Marvel&rsquo;s clown car of <em>really</em> bad villain ideas. &mdash; <em>Alexis Nedd, Senior Entertainment Reporter</em></p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2><strong>41. Aldrich Killian (<em>Iron Man 3</em>)</strong></h2><p>The reveal that the Mandarin was really a role being played by Ben Kingsley's Trevor Slattery was a jaw-dropper, but the truth about who was really pulling the strings was far more disappointing. Not even Killian's embittered-nerd backstory can make him a compelling foil to Tony Stark.<em>*</em> &mdash; <em>A.H.</em></p><h2><strong>40.

<p>Ronan gets more laughs than most of the other villains on this list, which could push him up a couple slots. But that's mostly because he's just in a funnier movie than most of the other villains on this list, not because he himself is all that funny. So he moves back down toward the bottom.<em>* </em> &mdash; <em>A.H.</em></p><h2><strong>39. Justin Hammer (<em>Iron Man 2</em>)</strong></h2><p>Justin Hammer is essentially another Tony Stark, only inferior in every possible way. Which shouldn't be that interesting, except that Sam Rockwell makes him kind of an odious oddball. It's fun to watch him try to take down Stark, and even more satisfying to watch him fail again and again.<em>*</em> &mdash; <em>A.H.</em></p><h2><strong>38. Abomination (<em>The Incredible Hulk</em>)</strong></h2><p>There's the germ of something interesting in Emil Blonsky, an aging soldier who agrees to undergo a painful experimental procedure in order to achieve Hulk-like power. Unfortunately, <em>The Incredible Hulk</em> never gets there, and by the end has reduced him to a mindless CGI monster.<em>*</em> &mdash; <em>A.H.</em></p><h2><strong>37. Ayesha (<em>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2</em>)</strong></h2><p>Ayesha is essentially just a superiority complex dipped in gold, but so much of the fun of her character comes from seeing her haughty grandeur rub up against the goofy, grimy world of the Guardians. Here's hoping she'll get more to do <a href="https://mashable.com/article/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-2-end-credits-scenes" target="_self">once Adam emerges</a>.* &mdash; <em>A.H.</em></p><h2><strong>36.

<p>She&rsquo;s got a cool warhammer (the universal weapon), some powerful jewelry (quantum band), and some tooth bling for extra flair. But this revenge-fueled wannabe savior of the Kree just feels like a retread of lesser cosmic villains who&rsquo;ve come before, like Malekith and Ronan. Angry, conquering, blah. Uncluttered by egregious prosthetic makeup, Zawe Ashton&rsquo;s performance isn&rsquo;t swallowed up like those of her predecessors. Still, there&rsquo;s not much there there.&nbsp;&mdash;<em> Kristy Puchko, Entertainment Editor</em></p><h2><strong>35.

<p>Carol Danvers' fragile masculine captor isn't particularly interesting, but not for the first time Marvel gets by on some inspired casting &mdash; and in this case, a few well-placed twists. When Carol is about to blast him to Kree-Kingdom-Come during their final showdown, Yon-Rogg encourages her to strike him, to defeat him. It's so hubristic and patronizing (what's the Kree word for "mansplain?") that Carol decides she'd rather just dip. &mdash; <em>Proma Khosla, Entertainment Reporter</em></p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2><strong>34. Obadiah Stane (<em>Iron Man</em>)</strong></h2><p>Obadiah Stane fits so many of the MCU villain tropes we've become familiar with: He's a greedy businessman and a false father figure, and he's vastly less interesting than the superhero he's out to get. What makes him first among equals is that he was literally the first, setting the mold for years to come.* &mdash; <em>A.H.</em></p><h2><strong>33. Goliath and Ghost (<em>Ant-Man and the Wasp</em>)</strong></h2><p>Sharing a spot on the list because they share so many villainous goals, the foes of <em>Ant-Man and the Wasp</em> are pretty textbook. Goliath, aka Bill Foster, has beef with Hank Pym (a man who specializes in beef) and wants revenge, while Ghost, aka Ava, just wants to stop phasing and not die. They team up to harness the energy of the Quantum Realm, which interferes with Hank and Hope's plan to rescue Janet, but by the end of the movie everyone realizes what a viewer probably caught early on: There's a version of this plan where everyone wins. &mdash; <em>P.K.</em></p><h2><strong>32.

<p>Now we're really getting down to the dregs. Kaecilius is yet another MCU antagonist who lusts after some abstract notion of power. However, he wins a couple points for <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/doctor-strange-kaecilius-makeup-tutorial--81275968256840638/" target="_blank">that flawless eye look</a> and hilarious who's-on-first routine. &mdash; <em>A.H.</em></p><h2><strong>31. Arishem the Judge (<em>Eternals</em>)</strong></h2><p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/eternals-review" target="_self">The Eternals'</a> Celestial space-robot daddy is one of the most powerful beings on this list, but fails to make a proportionate impression because he is in fact a CGI space robot with no face. Arishem is the reason the Eternals even <em>exist. </em>He makes villains of them and their Deviant foes by basically using everyone as chess pieces &mdash; if a game of chess ended with the Earth being destroyed to create a cosmic superbeing. Arishem isn't evil in the way of someone like Thanos; Celestials operate on ancient universal laws, while Thanos acted out of hubris &mdash; but what they all have in common is the view that most mortal life is unremarkable and therefore unessential.

<p>Don't get me wrong, Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) is a ton of fun. This golden battle mage swoops into <a href="https://mashable.com/article/guardian-of-the-galaxy-volume-3-review" target="_self"><em>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</em></a><em> </em>early on and basically pounds them into the dirt. After that, though, we see he's more of a childlike himbo than a supervillain. For the rest of the movie, he mostly screams "Mother!" (which, fair, when you're talking about Elizabeth Debicki as Ayesha) and hangs out with <a href="https://mashable.com/article/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-3-blurp" target="_self">furry cutie Blurp</a>. Good news, though: By the end of the film, he's become a new Guardian of the Galaxy, so we're in for more non-villainous Adam down the line. &mdash; <em>Belen Edwards, Entertainment Reporter</em></p><h2><strong>28. Dreykov (<em>Black Widow</em>)</strong></h2><p>While far from the most charismatic or memorable villain on this list, Dreykov is pretty damn sinister when you think about what he's done. He kidnapped orphans to turn them into soldiers, and he made a point to pick children with uteruses so he could forcibly sterilize them. He turned his own daughter into a barely-sentient killing machine and seemed pleased as punch &mdash; incidentally, Natasha (and the rest of us) really want to punch him. Eff this guy. &mdash; <em>P.K.</em> </p><h2><strong>27. Yellowjacket (<em>Ant-Man</em>)</strong></h2><p>He's essentially Obadiah Stane Redux, minus the shock of realizing that, holy shit, it's <em>Jeff Bridges</em> under that chrome dome. Yellowjacket was just one too many wounded male egos plotting against the MCU's heroes, which perhaps mercifully led to the new era that followed. Sorry, Corey Stoll. We love you, just not this role for you.<em>* </em>&mdash; <em>A.H.</em></p><h2><strong>26. M.O.D.O.K. (<em>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania</em>)</strong></h2><p>Darren Cross/Yellowjacket gets an upgrade after being banished to the Quantum Realm, where he is remade by Kang the Conqueror (more on him later) to be a Mechanized Organism Designed Only for Killing. M.O.D.O.K. is mostly a gag villain thanks to his teeny little arms and legs and frankly massive head &mdash; apologies should be in order for nightmarishly stretching Corey Stoll's face like this. But M.O.D.O.K also has some of the funniest lines in <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-marvel-review" target="_self">an otherwise meh movie</a>, and Stoll is clearly having a blast. At least he died an Avenger, right? Right? &mdash; <em>B.E.</em> </p><h2><strong>25. Trevor/The Mandarin (<em>Iron Man 3</em>)</strong></h2><p>To this day, the reveal of the Mandarin's true identity is one of the most shocking twists that the MCU has ever pulled off &mdash; and Ben Kingsley plays both sides beautifully. He's chilling as the Mandarin but delightfully daft as Trevor, the party-bro actor who has no idea what's really going on.* &mdash; <em>A.H.</em></p><h2><strong>24. Taskmaster (<em>Black Widow</em>)</strong></h2><p>Taskmaster is <em>Black Widow&rsquo;</em>s main antagonist for most of the movie, and while they don&rsquo;t do much beyond showing up and kicking ass, that ass-kicking is some of the best in the MCU. Tasky&rsquo;s fight scenes are a highlight reel of every Avenger&rsquo;s coolest moves, and half the fun of watching Black Widow is seeing how Natasha would actually fare if she squared up against Captain America, Bucky (again), Black Panther, and herself. Also, points awarded for having a cool third act reveal. Best wishes to you, Taskmaster. &mdash; <em>A.N.</em></p><h2><strong>23. Alexander Pierce (<em>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</em>)</strong></h2><p>Like Vulture and Zemo, Alexander Pierce is a relatively understated villain. But he's got gravitas, because he's played by Robert Freakin' Redford, and he raises some genuinely complicated questions about security versus freedom. Well, at least until it's revealed that he's been a Hydra agent all along, and therefore unambiguously evil. Oh, well.* &mdash; <em>A.H.</em></p><h2><strong>22. Red Skull (<em>Captain America: The First Avenger</em>)</strong></h2><p>Red Skull is a really good representation of another annoying MCU villain trend: squandered promise. He's played by Hugo Weaving and based on a popular comic book character, so he seems like he <em>should</em> be amazing. But onscreen, he comes across as just another generic nemesis.* &mdash; <em>A.H.</em></p><h2><strong>21. Ulysses Klaue (<em>Avengers: Age of Ultron</em>, <em>Black Panther</em>)</strong></h2><p>Ulysses Klaue is a villain who died before he really got to live. Mostly in the sense that it would've been wild to see Andy Serkis' take on the comics, but Klaue served his purpose in the MCU's ongoing story. It's Klaue who smuggled vibranium out of Wakanda, a singular act that directly leads to Killmonger's plot to establish Wakanda as a fearsome ruling superpower. Without that vibranium, where would Ultron's consciousness end up after he escaped Tony's computer system? It's impossible to know what the MCU would look like without Klaue's impact, and that's what makes him one of the saga's essential villains. &mdash; <em>Adam Rosenberg, Senior Entertainment Reporter &amp; Weekend Editor</em></p><h2><strong>20. Ego (<em>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2</em>)</strong></h2><p>Talk about villains grounded in painful reality. Kurt Russell is perfect as Ego, the personification of every dashing deadbeat who's ever refused to let minor details like "a child" stand in the way of his grand ambitions. It's just that his grand ambitions involve remaking the entire galaxy.* &mdash; <em>A.H.</em></p><h2><strong>19.

<p>Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors) is one of Marvel Comics' biggest villains, <em>and </em>he's been hyped up as the big bad of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/mcu-phases-5-6-timeline" target="_self">Phases 5 and 6 of the MCU</a>. So why was he such a letdown? Maybe it's the fact that his <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-marvel-review" target="_self">introductory movie simply isn't very good</a>, or maybe it's that his power set isn't defined well beyond "shooting blue beams" and "blathering on and on about how he can see time." <em>Or </em>maybe it's that you need to have watched <a href="https://mashable.com/article/loki-season-1-finale-multiverse-whats-next" target="_self"><em>Loki </em></a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/loki-season-1-finale-multiverse-whats-next" target="_self">to have even the slightest understanding of who he is</a>.

<p>Bucky is only a true villain in <em>Winter Soldier</em>, and then just because he's been brainwashed by Hydra. Maybe that's a shame, because it turns out he's pretty good at being bad. He's all ruthless efficiency and controlled intensity, but his real secret weapon as a supervillain is his tragic backstory.* &mdash; <em>A.H.</em></p><h2><strong>17. Ultron (<em>Avengers: Age of Ultron</em>)</strong></h2><p>A sort of sentient robot son to Tony Stark, Ultron sounds cooler in theory than he actually is in execution. But he<em> is </em>voiced by James Spader in mustache-twirling villain mode, and he's the kind of unapologetic drama queen who insists on having his own throne. That's not nothing.* &mdash; <em>A.H.</em></p><h2><strong>16. Hela (<em>Thor: Ragnarok</em>)</strong></h2><p>Odin&rsquo;s firstborn and the goddess of death, Hela is a formidable foe for Thor. She breaks Mjolnir! She kills the Warriors Three with her knife-y powers! She&rsquo;s played by Cate Blanchett! Even though Hela is sidelined for much of <em>Thor: Ragnarok</em>, Blanchett imbues her with delightfully chilling villainy. Also, her outfit is among the best villain outfits in the MCU &mdash; talk about being dressed to kill. &mdash; <em>B.E.</em></p><h2><strong>15. Gorr the God Butcher (<em>Thor: Love and Thunder</em>)</strong></h2><p>Say what you will about <a href="https://mashable.com/article/thor-love-and-thunder-review" target="_self"><em>Thor: Love and Thunder</em></a>, there's no denying that Christian Bale makes for an amazing villain. Drape that man in a sinister cloak, put the Necrosword in his hand, and give him a tragic backstory, and you're looking at MCU villain gold. Gorr's grief-fueled quest to kill all gods in the universe is <em>Love and Thunder</em>'s most compelling storyline. While the film doesn't examine it quite as much as I wish it would, it still gives us Gorr being the world's most terrifying babysitter. Absolutely immaculate villain vibes. &mdash; <em>B.E.</em></p><h2><strong>14. Mysterio (<em>Spider-Man: Far From Home</em>)</strong></h2><p>On paper, Mysterio looks like a pedestrian amalgam of Vulture, Justin Hammer, and Aldrich Killian &mdash; but the formula doesn't account for Jake Gyllenhaal chewing the absolute heck out of this role. In Mysterio, Gyllenhaal finds layers of sincerity (with Peter), egomania (with his team), and outright unhinged madness that is nothing short of delightful to behold.

<p>Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum) may not be <em>Thor: Ragnarok</em>'s main villain, but the hedonistic leader of Sakaar more than steals the show.

<p>Some Marvel villains have been given mystical armies, unnerving prosthetic makeovers, and/or elaborate backstories sparked from petty grievances. Mr. Paradox doesn't need any of that to be a terrific villain. Sure, at first glance, he just seems like a British suit with a smug attitude. But props to <em>Succession</em>'s Matthew Macfadyen, who's made being a power-hungry weasel into an art. Paradox's plan is one of timeline annihilation, coldly killing off millions of beings because <em>he </em>thinks the timelines are tidier that way. That's deeply evil and unhinged. But what makes Paradox marvelous is Macfadyen's delivery. Whether he's providing a dense exposition dump, dressing down Deadpool for relying on the "Worst Wolverine," or squawking for help when his master plan goes kabluey, the theatrical energy and snarling self-satisfaction makes for a foe that's an absolute hoot to hate.<em> &mdash; K.P.</em></p><h2><strong>9. Vulture (<em>Spider-Man: Homecoming</em>)</strong></h2><p>Vulture is a basically normal dude grappling with the fact that he lives in a superpowered world &mdash; but unlike our heroes, Adrian Toomes isn't inspired by example to become one of the good guys. He channels that rage into a successful black-market enterprise selling alien weaponry, but what's fascinating about Adrian is there's much more to him than supervillainy. He doesn't seem to be playing a role in the way that, say, Obadiah Stane was only pretending to be Tony's friend so he could stab him in the back later. Adrian really is a family man, and he really is an illegal arms dealer. He contains multitudes, and <em>Homecoming</em> doesn't shy away from it.* &mdash; <em>A.H.</em></p><h2><strong>8. Namor (<em>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever)</em></strong></h2><p>With his winged ankles, green hot pants, and strength to rival the Hulk's, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/black-panther-wakanda-forever-shuri-review" target="_self"><em>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever's</em></a> Namor (Tenoch Huerta) bursts onto the scene with a tremendous amount of flair. But Namor is so much more than his appearance. A backstory involving his Yucatec-Mayan people fleeing from European colonizers sets the stage for his compelling motivations: wanting to keep his people and their home of Talokan safe. Like <em>Black Panther</em>'s Killmonger, his reasoning makes sense and initially positions him more as an antihero. Also like Killmonger, his violent methods quickly plunge him into villainy, making for a layered Marvel antagonist who is also a blast to watch. &mdash; <em>B.E.</em></p><h2><strong>7.

<p>She's the evil twin of X-Men leader Charles Xavier, which means Cassandra Nova (Emma Corrin) shares his skills for telepathy and telekinesis. But you know, without all those pesky moral codes weighing her down. Content to rule over the temporal wastelands, Cassandra developed a creepy crew of X-men villains while building a fort in the rotted-out suit of a lost Giant Man. But once she meets Deadpool and Logan, her ambition grows from dystopian tyrant to eradicator of all existence. And if that goal alone isn't enough to commend her as a top-tier MCU villain, consider how her superpower involves stretching her fingers deep into her victims' brains. Watching Paradox's eyes wiggle as she treats his skull like a bowling ball is one of the creepiest things the MCU has offered yet. &mdash; <em>K.P. </em></p><h2><strong>6.

<p>We can discuss at length how Wanda Maximoff deserved better throughout her time in the MCU, but we can also give her major props for being an exceptional villain in <a href="https://mashable.com/article/doctor-strange-multiverse-of-madness-spoiler-free-review" target="_self"><em>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</em></a>. Elizabeth Olsen is clearly having the time of her life as the film's big bad, channeling horror film legends like Samara from <em>The Ring </em>and Carrie White from <em>Carrie</em>. She also <a href="https://mashable.com/article/doctor-strange-multiverse-of-madness-fan-service" target="_self">annihilates years' worth of fan service</a> in the film's most diabolical sequence. On top of all that, Wanda's villainy comes after several movies and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/wandavision-finale" target="_self">an entire TV show</a>'s worth of character development. So, our attachment makes her turn to the dark side both engrossing and painful to watch. Hats off to Olsen for a killer performance, and here's hoping Wanda is having a better time somewhere else in the multiverse. &mdash; <em>B.E.</em>  </p><h2><strong>5. Green Goblin (<em>Spider-Man: No Way Home</em>)</strong></h2><p><em>No Way Home</em> may have brought back every notable Spider-Man villain since 2002 (sorry, Hobgoblin), but Willem Dafoe&rsquo;s Green Goblin is a magnificent standout as he urges them all to go rogue. This character once laid the groundwork for the misguided-scientist-who-turns-into-a-bad-experiment that every Spidey villain followed until Vulture, and his performance is as unhinged and spectacular as it was 20 years ago. Sliding back into Goblin&rsquo;s armor, madness, and signature cackle, Dafoe reminds us that he all but invented the modern comic book movie villain, that everyone else here is in the house that Goblin built. It&rsquo;s a hell of a legacy to leave behind in the first place, and even mightier to live up to it yourself. &mdash; <em>P.K.</em></p><h2><strong>4. Loki (<em>Thor</em>, <em>The Avengers</em>)</strong></h2><p>There's a reason Loki is the rare baddie to stick around for more than one movie (<a href="https://mashable.com/article/loki-review-marvel-disney" target="_self">and a whole TV show</a>). He's the only MCU supervillain who's as fully developed as the MCU superheroes &mdash; and with his sad tale of familial angst, he's almost as sympathetic. Plus, Tom Hiddleston gives Loki a slippery, smirky charisma that's hard to resist. You listen to one of his faux-Shakespearean monologues and tell me you're not tempted to cross over to the dark side.* &mdash; <em>A.H.</em></p><h2><strong>3. Wenwu (<em>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings</em>)</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">
    <div class="flex justify-center">

<p>Leave it to Hong Kong cinema icon Tony Leung to show up 25 movies into the MCU and proceed to wipe the floor with almost every other villain the franchise has come up with. Wenwu is a fascinating villain because he&rsquo;s a bad guy who isn&rsquo;t always a bad <em>person</em>, and the real tragedy of <em>Shang-Chi</em> is knowing Wenwu is mourning more than the loss of his wife &mdash; he&rsquo;s mourning the lost possibility of his own redemption. Also, he&rsquo;s a Marvel villain who keeps another Marvel villain as a human pet. That&rsquo;s god-tier villainy right there. &mdash; <em>A.N.</em></p><h2><strong>2. Eric Killmonger (<em>Black Panther</em>)</strong></h2><p>Hot off the heels of Vulture revolutionizing MCU villainy came Michael B. Jordan's legendary turn in <em>Black Panther</em>. Eric is everything T'Challa isn't: vengeful, embittered, and deeply isolated. His methods might be villainous, but his message is compelling. Growing up in Oakland, far from the promise of Wakanda, he mourns generations of injustice that Black people have experienced around the world, seething with envy at T'Challa and his supposedly charmed life. Killmonger's pain stays with us long after the credits roll on <em>Black Panther</em>, as does his chilling final line. &mdash; <em>P.K.</em></p><h2><strong>1.

<p>Here we go. The big bad. The <em>biggest</em>&nbsp;bad. In one *snap,* Thanos erased half of the known universe from existence &mdash; but it's more than that. The build-up to Thanos pretty much defined the entire pace of the MCU's first truly sprawling story arc, from <em>Iron Man</em> to <em>Endgame</em>. Marvel spent 10 entire years teasing and setting up this massive villain before 2018's <em>Avengers: Infinity War</em>&nbsp;gave him an outwardly significant role to play. It was a hell of a trick, and it wouldn't have worked without the decade of buildup making it clear that a larger, more malevolent puppet-master was always pulling the strings just out of view. There are more exciting villains in the MCU, but Thanos is, as ever, inevitable. &mdash; <em>A.R.</em></p><p><em>*This blurb appeared on a previous list.</em></p><p class="mx-auto">

The game is all about finding the "common threads between words." And just like <em>Wordle</em>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-20-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> resets after midnight and each new set of words gets trickier and trickier&mdash;so we've served up some hints and tips to get you over the hurdle.</p><p>If you just want to be told today's puzzle, you can jump to the end of this article for July 26's <em>Connections</em> solution. But if you'd rather solve it yourself, keep reading for some clues, tips, and strategies to assist you.</p><h2><strong>What is <em>Connections</em>?</strong></h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. Like <em>Wordle, </em>you can share the results with your friends on social media.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

Many were adorned in embroidered Palestinian outfits &mdash; Flag bearer Waseem Abu Sal, who will compete as the first Palestinian Olympic boxer, donned a white shirt emblazoned with the image of a plane dropping ammunition on a child innocently playing soccer under a sunny sky. The outfit of Valerie Tarazi, Olympic swimmer and Palestine's second flag bearer, represented her Gazan family. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>With the sun setting over Paris, and French President Emmanuel Macron officially opened the 2024 games, Dion was yet to be seen. Still, the ceremony continued with a spectacular laser light show illuminating the Eiffel Tower. Glitter sparkled across the glowing Olympic rings, and a speedboat brought in even more Olympic icons, including Serena Williams.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The option refers to X's AI chatbot Grok, which the company <a href="https://mashable.com/article/x-twitter-elon-musk-grok-upcoming-features-discovered" target="_self"><u>continues to integrate throughout the platform</u></a>.</p><p>The fine print under the Settings option text goes on to say that the data is used to "continuously improve your experience" on X, but that the user's data will also be shared with Musk's AI company, xAI, which powers Grok.</p><p>It's good that X informs users of how it uses their data. It's also positive that X provides users with a choice on whether they want to share their data with xAI and X for AI training.</p><p>It's bad, however, that X <em>opts users in by default</em>. It's also not great that users had to seemingly discover these opt-in and opt-out options on their own.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

Click on the checkmark to deselect and opt out.</p></li></ol><p>Under that setting, there's also an option to delete any conversation history that you have with the X's Grok AI chatbot.</p><p>Musk has big plans for his AI company.

<h2>Celine Dion...finally...brings the house down</h2><p>After a <em>very </em>long opening ceremony &mdash; nearly four hours in length &mdash; Celine Dion finally, as rumored, came out and performed. People were upset it took so long. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

      <description><![CDATA[When it comes to "Mothers' Instinct," not every movie needs to be ART. Review.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/05V22iiZbeeC3aduuXGIvXC/hero-image.jpg" alt="Jessica Chastain puts a pearl necklace on Anne Hathaway in "Mothers' Instinct.""><p>Somewhere between <em>What Ever Happened to Baby Jane</em>? and <em>Carol</em> lies <em>Mothers' Instinct. </em>Set vaguely in the early 1960s, this psychological thriller thrusts two of America's most thrilling actresses at each other in a queer-coded battle of wills and mental illness.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://mashable.com/video/the-idea-of-you-anne-hathaway-michael-showalter" target="_self">Anne Hathaway</a> and Jessica Chastain star as a pair of (mostly) happy homemakers who live side by side in charming suburbia. Established cinematographer Beno&icirc;t Delhomme makes his directorial debut here, draping the film in a dreamy pastel palette that cools as the plot kicks in. An untimely death throws these very, very close friends into a spiral of suspicion that threatens to not only end their bond but maybe even several lives along the way.&nbsp;</p><p>Steeped in tension and twisted possibilities, <em>Mothers' Instinct </em>is a deliciously deranged drama that's destined to find an audience that appreciates its brand of camp.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Mothers' Instinct </em>delivers a tale of motherhood and jealousy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-4ltU9ooQ8x0"></div>
</div>


<p>Hathaway stars as Celine, an unflappably chic housewife who is as beloved by her dashing husband Damian (Josh Charles) and chipper son Max as she is by the local PTA. But no one loves her as much as Alice does. Played by Chastain, the next-door neighbor/best friend looks at Celine with a yawning awe, not only for all Celine's capable of but also how easy she makes it look.&nbsp;</p><p>While Celine is utterly content with her picture-perfect domesticity, Alice pines to return to work, hungry to be "more" than a wife and mother. Their differences fester when a tragic accident robs Celine of her only child, leaving her bereft and staring at the greener grass on her neighbor's lawn &mdash;&nbsp;where a little boy still frolics.&nbsp;</p><p>Celine's attitude chills so sharply toward Alice that she begins to wonder if her friend resents her. Desperate to reconnect, Alice gives all she can to her grief-stricken bosom buddy. But before long, she begins to wonder if Celine is scheming to take something more from her... maybe even revenge.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Mothers' Instinct </em>has a Lifetime movie plot with a queer undercurrent.&nbsp;</h2><p>Based on Barbara Abel's 2012 novel <em>Behind the Hatred, Mothers' Instinct </em>plunges unapologetically into domestic terror, pitting two young mothers against each other in a war of emotion and manipulation. Because Alice has a history of mental illness,&nbsp;Celine's hesitant to confess her suspicions to her husband, Simon (Anders Danielsen Lie). Which is probably for the best, as Simon is an insensitive oaf, ever ready to ignore his wife's inconvenient feelings.&nbsp;</p><p>However, as bodies begin to pile up around the ballet flats of lovely Celine, Alice won't be <em>ignored</em>. But how can she hit back at the woman she loves, even if that woman is turning homicidal?</p><p>A queer undercurrent brings a juicy layer to this plot line. The menfolk bop about the lawns and dining rooms, chortling and considering themselves kings of their castles, intentionally two-dimensional. They are nowhere near as real or alive to their wives as their wives are to each other. A sex scene between Alice and her husband is cut short when he declares he wants to impregnate her, a turn-off to a woman who dreams of passion, not more dirty diapers. Meanwhile, simple scenes where Alice and Celine dance together or console each other throb with intimacy and even (potentially one-sided) desire. Combined with Delhomme's romantic palette, <em>Mothers' Instinct </em>feels more Todd Haynes than Alfred Hitchcock. And it's easy to imagine if circumstances were a little different, Alice might take Celine to lunch and declare her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyhHil49kHA" target="_blank">"flung out of space."</a>&nbsp;</p><h2>Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain are <em>Mothers' Instinct</em> biggest asset and its greatest obstacle.&nbsp;</h2><p>Both actresses ably hip-swivel through the dastardly dance that is the movie's most vicious turns. Hathaway offering a chilliness that is enticingly enigmatic, while Chastain is often on the brink of tears, eyes on fire. Together, they play a battle of love and hatred that is so twisted, intense, and entertaining that it recalls Robert Aldrich's iconic psycho-biddy thriller <em>What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? </em>Hathaway and Chastain don't go as theatrical as Bette Davis and Joan Crawford once did, but rightfully so; their at-war heroines are not decades into their festered bond. Still, their performances shimmy knowingly into camp.&nbsp;</p><p>But this might be the problem. Not the performances themselves, which are divinely committed and juicy, but the simple fact that Hathaway and Chastain are so respected and so damn famous. When Davis and Crawford went off the rails in that hagsploitation classic, they were aging leading ladies using their fading status to fuel the subtext of the showbiz horror gem. Watching them go feral was a bold and educated choice. (And it paid off, earning Davis a Best Actress Oscar nomination ten years after her last, plus a slew of other horror roles.)</p><p>Hathaway and Chastain are far from fading; they are still undeniable headliners and Oscar winners. So when they join forces for a movie, audiences might not expect something as willfully tawdry as <em>Mothers' Instinct</em>. This is not a sophisticated thriller on par with <em>Vertigo </em>or even <em>Dial M for Murder</em>,<em> </em>but neither does it need to be to satisfy.&nbsp;</p><p>Hathaway is too interesting an actress to be relegated only to prestige pics. Recently, she elated critics in the flirty rom-com <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-idea-of-you-movie-review" target="_self"><em>The Idea of You</em></a> and the gnarly thriller <a href="https://mashable.com/article/eileen-review-hathaway" target="_self"><em>Eileen</em></a>. But personally, I most love her big swings, like when she played a toxic femme fatale in the psycho-sexual thriller <a href="https://mashable.com/article/serenity-bad-movie" target="_self"><em>Serenity</em></a> or an alcoholic who accidentally manifests a rampaging kaiju in <a href="https://www.pajiba.com/think_pieces/lets-talk-the-surprise-twist-of-anne-hathaways-colossal.php" target="_blank"><em>Colossal.</em></a><em> </em>Meanwhile, Chastain has mixed it up, leaping genres from the superhero flick <em>X-Men: Dark Phoenix </em>to the horror movie <a href="https://mashable.com/article/it-chapter-two-movie-review" target="_self"><em>IT Chapter Two,</em></a><em> </em>to the utterly forgettable espionage thriller <em>Ava</em>. But after her <a href="https://mashable.com/article/jessica-chastain-oscars-speech-2022" target="_self">Oscar win </a>for her <a href="https://mashable.com/video/eyes-of-tammy-faye-trailer" target="_self">transformative performance in </a><a href="https://mashable.com/video/eyes-of-tammy-faye-trailer" target="_self"><em>The Eyes of Tammy Faye</em></a><em>, </em>it's about time she gets to cut loose with some trashy thrills. And she does just that in <em>Mothers' Instinct.&nbsp;</em></p><p>All this is to say, <em>Mothers' Instinct </em>doesn't reach the glorious heights of Hitchcock, or Haynes, or even Aldrich. Rather, Delhomme builds his domestic thriller in a valley in between. His heroines don't reach the delicious camp hysteria of Davis or Crawford. They don't pose in the elegant and openly queer yearning of Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara. They might be formed in the mold of Hitchcock's femme fatales, but to their credit, Hathaway and Chastain make these roles their own.&nbsp;</p><p>In the end, <em>Mothers' Instinct </em>might not be great cinema, but it is great fun. Spiked with twisted turns, explosive emotions, and a feud that's frightening and fun to behold, it's a thriller well worth its gnashed teeth and salty tears.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/ZRPvg?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Mothers%27%20Instinct%20opens%20in%20select%20theaters%20July%2026%20and%20on%20digital%20Aug.%2013.&object_type=article&object_uuid=05V22iiZbeeC3aduuXGIvXC&short_url=ZRPvg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><em>Mothers' Instinct </em>opens in select theaters July 26 and on digital Aug. 13.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2><strong>ChatGPT Voice Mode update: 3 new features</strong></h2><p>The new update for ChatGPT Voice Mode will purportedly allow users to have realistically paced voice conversations with ChatGPT, thanks to newly reduced response times. There are also some other neat utility features it can do now. According to <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/ai/chatgpt/openai-to-make-gpt-4o-advanced-voice-available-by-the-end-of-the-month-to-select-group-of-users" target="_blank">Tom's Guide</a>, the Voice Mode update will add at least three new features to ChatGPT:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Live translate between languages</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Create sound effects while telling stories</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Do custom character voices</strong></p></li></ul><p>It's been a big week for ChatGPT, which announced the imminent rollout of its <a href="https://mashable.com/article/openai-searchgpt-chatgpt-announcement" target="_self">SearchGPT</a> search engine just days ago.

It's more than capable of running multiple programs at once, or if you're a heavy internet user, several tabs that might normally sap another laptop of memory. Bending it backwards is the real attraction here as it can also be used as a "normal" laptop, but being able to fold it like a tent or use it as a tablet is a major plus when it comes to portability. This hybrid laptop makes for a great back to school buy. This configuration is just $699.99, down from its normal price of $1,049.99 at Best Buy. </p><h3>Our pick</h3><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h2><strong>How to get Deadpool to appear on your phone</strong></h2><p>First things first, this feature is only available on Android devices. This is because the easter egg relies on a new-ish feature called <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-announcement-circle-to-search-ai-feature-pixel-8-pro-samsung-s24" target="_self">Circle to Search</a>, which lets you draw circles around anything on your phone, like a puppy for example, to spark a quick Google search (e.g., you can look up the breed of that puppy in a flash).</p><p>Google's new Circle to Search feature made its debut on Samsung Galaxy S24 devices in January and rolled out to the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/google-pixel-8-and-pixel-8-pro" target="_self">Google Pixel 8 series</a>, too.</p><p>That being said, here's how to get Deadpool to come out of its hiding place.</p><p><strong>Step one:</strong> Find the words "Deadpool and Wolverine" on <a href="https://mashable.com/article/deadpool-and-wolverine-review" target="_self">Mashable's review</a> of the film.</p><p><strong>Step two: </strong>Press and hold the circular button on the bottom taskbar.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Before the Mashable Shopping team shares a deal with our readers, we check to make sure it's <em>actually </em>a good deal. Major retailers (we're looking at you, Amazon), sometimes use the word "deal" a bit liberally. We find a lot of always-on discounts when hunting for deals, and we typically skip over these in favor of new and notable discounts. But we're making an exception today for this adorable Lego building set.</p><p>Right now, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/DdP8g?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Lego%20Disney%20and%20Pixar%20Up%20House&object_type=article&object_uuid=01uY4v7Um2QmpXIwzeMJF8u&short_url=DdP8g&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Lego Disney and Pixar <em>Up </em>House</a> building set is discounted 20% to a sale price of $47.99. Technically, that <em>is</em> a deal compared to the MSRP of $59.99, but Amazon almost always sells the Lego <em>Up </em>House at this discounted <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0BLJ2ZB3H" target="_blank">price</a>. </p><p>While this sale doesn't meet our normal deals standards, we couldn't resist sharing this set. Anyone who shed a few tears (or bawled) during <em>that </em>scene in <em>Up</em> will understand. Plus, it's still a genuine bargain compared to the full price of $59.99 listed on the <a href="https://zdcs.link/norBy?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Lego%20site&object_type=article&object_uuid=01uY4v7Um2QmpXIwzeMJF8u&short_url=norBy&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Lego site</a>. </p><p>The Lego Disney and Pixar Up House is a colorful display of Carl Fredricksen's iconic home, complete with balloons anchored to the chimney. Ready to fly off to Paradise Falls, the set also comes with Carl, his dog Dug, and his new pal Russell. With 598 pieces, the set is designed for Lego fans ages nine and up. The house measures about 10.5 inches tall, 6 inches wide, and 4 inches deep, so it's compact enough to display on a bookshelf once you're done building. Let the adventure and imagination of <em>Up</em> live on in your home. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Well before Marvel's multiple realities grabbed a hold of pop culture, the X-Men movies had their own messy continuity, including an ostensible multiverse before this was really a fad. After kicking off with a trilogy set more or less in the modern day, followed by a Wolverine spin-off, the story moved firmly into prequel territory. It soon brought its older and younger casts together through a time travel story, all but erasing its original timeline and starting afresh. However, the desire to retread and retool the film series while also maintaining the appearance of a single, continuous franchise has led to, shall we say, <em>complications</em>.</p><p>For instance: How is the diamond-skinned telepath Emma Frost both a teenager in the 1980s, in <em>X-Men Origins: Wolverine</em> (2009) and an adult in the 1962-set prequel movie <em>X-Men: First Class</em>, released just two years later? Series producer Lauren Shuler Donner <a href="https://archive.ph/20141130075156/http:/emmafrostfiles.com/misc/faq/how-is-emma-in-both-x-men-origins-wolverine-and-x-men-first-class/" target="_blank"><u>claims</u></a> the two characters are only coincidentally named Emma and happen to share the same powers &mdash; okay, <em>sure</em> &mdash; but the real answer is that two different filmmakers simply opted to use the character in different contexts, continuity be damned.</p><p>These discrepancies haven't always mattered to general audiences. But in light of Marvel's new rules about character "variants" and the emergence of timeline "branches," the fourteenth X-Men entry can't help but recontextualize these creative decisions. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/deadpool-and-wolverine-review" target="_self"><em><u>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</u></em></a> also features Marvel's Time Variance Authority, or the TVA &mdash; keepers of continuity introduced in the streaming series <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHd4duyCFHk" target="_blank"><em><u>Loki</u></em></a> &mdash; so it only makes sense to dive in and unpack what exactly is going on with the winding X-Men timeline. After all, the much-awaited team-up between Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool and Hugh Jackman's Wolverine is actually the second time these actors and characters have crossed paths on-screen, but those were also different versions of each character who have long since died. So, how exactly did we get here?</p><p><strong>To see the full timeline grapgic, scroll to the bottom, where slight spoilers for <em>Deadpool and Wolverine</em> lie. </strong></p><h2><strong><em>X-Men</em>, <em>X2, </em>and <em>X-Men: The Last Stand </em>: 2000 to 2006<em>&nbsp;</em></strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p><strong>Established canon</strong>: Released in 2000 and set in "the near future," Bryan Singer's <em>X-Men</em> introduced a sprawling ensemble of X-Men, under the guidance of telepathic, wheelchair-using headmaster Professor X/Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart). When the film series begins, our heroes have been locked in a quiet battle for recognition and rights with both the U.S. government and the antagonistic Mutant Brotherhood, led by metal-bending radical Magneto/Erik Lehnsherr (Ian McKellen), a survivor of the Holocaust. This premise runs through nearly all the mainline X-Men movies.</p><p>The first film is also where we meet Jackman's Wolverine, a loner with no memory of his origins who soon joins up with the X-Men, a shifting roster that expands with every entry. The mainstays include Professor X, his telekinetic protege Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), the weather witch Storm/Ororo Munroe (Halle Berry) and the laser-eyed Cyclops/Scott Summers (James Marsden). Later entries saw the addition of the metal-skinned Colossus (Daniel Cudmore) in <em>X2: X-Men United</em> (2003), followed by the wall-phasing Kitty Pryde (Elliot Page), the animalistic yet erudite Beast/Hank McCoy (Kelsey Grammer), and the burdened, winged Angel (Ben Foster) in <em>X-Men: The Last Stand</em> (2006).&nbsp;</p><p>The X-Men are teachers and students, but they're also a paramilitary force with their own stealth jets and black leather uniforms. This comes in handy when they fight villains like the feral Sabretooth (Tyler Mane), the shape-shifting Mystique (Rebecca Romijn), the rampaging Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones) and the ruthless Col. William Stryker (Brian Cox), an old man tied to Logan's mysterious origins.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p><strong>Retcons</strong>: Continuity is largely linear for these first three films. Characters recur without much fuss, or disappear between entries &mdash; like teleporting circus attraction Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) &mdash;and no one is the wiser. The film series' minor Easter eggs pose only the tiniest of problems. For instance, Beast cameos on a TV screen in human form in <em>X2</em> (played by Steve Bacic), but by the time Grammer plays him in the third movie, he appears in all his blue and furry glory, and he seems to have been that way for some time.</p><p>Deaths and major events, however, all seem to be built with wiggle room, just in case they need to be undone. <em>X2'</em>s ending, in which Jean sacrifices her life to save the X-Men, dovetails into <em>Last Stand</em>, where she's resurrected under the ''Phoenix'' moniker &mdash; a powerful cosmic force in the comics, reimagined as an alternate persona. And as the third entry wraps up, it drops hints that its radically altered status quo might not be permanent. &nbsp; Magneto, who's been de-powered by a mutant "cure," appears to move a metal chess piece with his mind in the trilogy's closing frames. Even Xavier's violent death is poised to be rewritten in a post-credit scene, when a long-comatose body speaks to Dr. Moira MacTaggert (Olivia Williams) in Stewart's distinct tenor.</p><p>Without a fourth linear X-Men film on the horizon, these were little more than wishes destined to remain unfulfilled, though they would eventually come into play a few entries down the line. In the meantime, the franchise was all set to venture into the past, with a string of origin stories based on specific characters.</p><h2><strong>The X-Men prequels and spin-offs: 2009 to 2013&nbsp;</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p><strong>Established canon</strong>: In 2009, <em>X-Men Origins: Wolverine</em> was the test case for mutant spin-offs. Director Gavin Hood's poorly received action prequel attempts not only to fill the gaps in Logan's memory, but also to recast and reimagine several existing characters.&nbsp;</p><p>After detailing Wolverine's childhood in 1845,<em> X-Men Origins</em> is set largely in the mid-1980s, and turns hints of flashbacks from previous films into their own narrative centerpieces. These explain how Wolverine lost his memory, and how he had the indestructible metal adamantium grafted onto his bones, creating his signature<strong> </strong>claws, by a middle-aged Stryker (Danny Huston), leader of the Weapon X program. <em>Origins</em> was also the movie that introduced a teenage Emma Frost (Tahyna MacManus), as well as the sword-wielding mercenary Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds), albeit as a mute, mind-controlled villain largely ignored by the character's more comedic entries.&nbsp;</p><p>The plan, at the time, was to follow Wolverine's solo film with a similar "Origins" story about Magneto. But this idea was eventually folded into Matthew Vaughn's 1962-set ensemble prequel, <em>X-Men: First Class </em>(2011). While a more colorful film than its predecessors,<em> First Class</em> made distinct overtures towards being deeply entwined with the original X-Men trilogy, beginning with its opening scene of a young Erik in a Nazi concentration camp &mdash; practically a shot-for-shot recreation of the first film's prologue &mdash; before focusing, once more, on the ideological rift between Xavier (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender). Shortly thereafter, <em>The Wolverine</em> (2013), Logan's second solo spin-off, would take the character to Japan long after the events of the original trilogy. There, he loses himself in mourning over a long-dead Jean Grey, and subsequently has his adamantium claws hacked off by a giant robot samurai.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p><strong>Retcons</strong>: Perhaps the biggest liberty taken by <em>X-Men Origins</em> is its reimagining of Sabretooth &mdash; now played by Liev Schreiber &mdash; as Wolverine's half-brother, and his comrade during every American war. That Wolverine has no memory of this in previous entries makes sense, thanks to his amnesia. The fact that Mane's version of Sabretooth (in 2000's <em>X-Men</em>) doesn't acknowledge this either is a gap in continuity that, while irksome, is ultimately forgivable, since it led to Schreiber's delightfully evil performance.&nbsp;</p><p><em>X-Men: First Class</em> similarly reimagines Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) as Xavier's adopted sister; this is another sibling relationship that isn't acknowledged in films set decades later, and the first of many instances in which the prequel plays fast and loose with continuity. Some of its narrative liberties, like MacTaggert (Rose Byrne) showing up as a CIA agent rather than a doctor, or Emma Frost (January Jones) being an adult character 20-plus years before appearing as a teenager in <em>X-Men: Origins</em>, don't matter quite as much. However, they start to become noticeable if you're paying close attention. Some changes to the timeline even <em>fix</em> inconsistencies elsewhere: Hank McCoy (Nicholas Hoult) transforms into his furry, blue form, aligning <em>First Class</em> with Grammer's later appearance while ignoring the character's minor human cameo in <em>X2</em>. Other changes, however, have a more adverse impact: while <em>Origins</em> and <em>The Last Stand</em> feature scenes of Xavier walking around in the '80s and '90s, <em>First Class</em> ends with him being paralyzed from the waist down for dramatic effect, several decades prior.</p><p>Xavier and McCoy's continuity, however, becomes even more fluid thanks to a future entry &mdash; the time-travel crossover <em>X-Men: Days of Future Past</em> &mdash; first teased in the post-credit scene of <em>The Wolverine</em>. Logan's solo sequel is isolated enough from the rest of the series, both narratively and geographically, that it doesn't impact continuity, but its credit tag promises monumental changes when the character is visited by not only a re-powered Magneto (McKellan), but also a mysteriously resurrected Professor X (Stewart), who warn him of oncoming dangers.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>The alternate X-Men timeline: 2014 to 2017</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p><strong>Established canon</strong>: Singer, who helmed the first two X-Men movies, returned to the director's chair for <em>X-Men: Days of Future Past</em>, and brought with him his signature black leather outfits. In his grim future timeline &mdash; a dystopian 2023, about a decade after <em>The Wolverine</em> is set &mdash; mutants are hunted and killed, thanks to the domino effects of Mystique assassinating a weapons developer in the 1970s.&nbsp;</p><p>The aged Magneto (McKellan) and Xavier (Stewart) have teamed up once more, and their survival depends on Kitty Pryde using her inexplicable time-travel powers. Logan, who somehow has his adamantium claws back &mdash; another unexplained return to status quo &mdash; has his consciousness psychically transported by Pryde into his younger body in the 1970s. Here, he meets up with a younger Xavier and McCoy (played by prequel actors McAvoy and Hoult), who have figured out how to suppress their powers. Xavier can also temporarily walk again, while McCoy retains his human appearance, ensuring that any future discrepancies on this front can be easily hand-waved.</p><p>The film, in essence, resets the entire X-Men timeline as we know it, erasing the past continuity before our eyes and yielding the '80s- and '90s-set sequels <em>X-Men: Apocalypse</em> (2016)<em> </em>and<em> Dark Phoenix</em> (2019). These films, while they don't feature Wolverine except in a cameo capacity, see the re-introduction of trilogy mainstays, now played by younger characters: Storm (Alexandra Shipp), Jean Grey (Sophie Turner), Cyclops (Tye Sheridan), and Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee).&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p><strong>Retcons</strong>: Despite starting afresh, and having the ability to pull from any corners of the vast comic catalog, this ostensibly new X-Men series retreads characters and concepts already seen. However, the changes it makes along the way don't always add up. The point of divergence between the two timelines (in <em>X-Men: Days of Future Past</em>) is 1973, which should only affect the future, at least in theory. However, the 1980s-set <em>X-Men: Apocalypse</em> happens to feature a version of Angel (Ben Hardy) as a young adult, around the age he already appeared in <em>The Last Stand</em> in the 2000s. He would have already had to have been born by <em>Days of Future Past </em>for this to happen, which kind of implies that the team's time-travel antics didn't just impact the future, but the past as well (cue Michael Keaton's kooky spaghetti monologue from <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-flash-movie-review" target="_self"><em>The Flash</em></a>).</p><p>The new film series does gesture towards a brand new story in some ways, like the ending of <em>X-Men: Days of Future Past</em>, which sees Wolverine waking up in an alternate 2023 where Jean, Scott, and the other X-Men are still alive, though he remembers the original timeline in which they died. The ripple effects of his time travel also mean it's no longer a young Stryker (Josh Helman) who captured him but Mystique in disguise. Therefore, it ought to follow that Wolverine doesn't become a subject of Weapon X, but he's seen right back in its clutches &mdash; memory wipe and all &mdash; in <em>Apocalypse</em>, the very next entry. The more things change in the X-Men film series, the more they seem to stay the same.</p><h2><strong><em>Deadpool</em>, <em>Logan</em>, and the TV shows you forgot</strong>: <strong>2016 to 2020</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>A similar approach is taken in the somber Wolverine spin-off <em>Logan</em> &mdash; the question of when and where it takes place could have multiple explanations &mdash; albeit with a more story-centric reason in mind. On one hand, since the events of the original trilogy (and the dystopia of <em>X-Men:</em> <em>Days of Future Past</em>)<em> </em>have been deleted from continuity, this rules <em>Logan</em> out as a direct sequel to them. It's more likely that the spin-off<em> </em>emanates from the alternate future glimpsed at the end of <em>Days of Future Past</em>. But since that version of Wolverine seemed to remember the original timeline, <em>Logan</em> works as a character-centric sequel to those films as well. It's a neat way for the series to have its cake and eat it too, thus creating an all-encompassing sequel that draws on the audience's general familiarity with the X-Men movies, whether they've been "erased" or not.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Retcons</strong>: At the end of the day, trying to decipher a linear approach to <em>Logan</em>'s continuity runs counter to the film's own themes. Its take on the X-Men canon becomes all but explicit in a key exchange between Wolverine and his clone/adopted daughter Laura (Dafne Keen), when she presents him with a series of vibrant X-Men comics. "You do know they're all bullshit, right?" he tells her. "Maybe a quarter of it happened, and not like this."&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The movie's neo-Western lens frames Wolverine as an aged gunman at the end of his life, a man about whom legends have been whispered around campfires over the years. While the events of all the previous movies "happened" in some fashion, whether literally or just in the character's memory, <em>Logan</em> all but instructs the audience not to get bogged down by these details. The emotional truths therein are what matter most, i.e. that Logan was once an X-Man who went on grand, whiz-bang adventures, but ended up partially (if not wholly) responsible for the deaths of his colorful comrades.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>The New Mutants </em>(2020) features fleeting archival footage of Laura, thus setting it in the same continuity as <em>Logan</em>, but chances are you didn't remember that movie exists until just now.</p><p>The past, in the X-Men movies, is entirely fluid. This has long been the case in superhero comics, where writers being selective about decades of continuity is practically a given, if anyone's going to even attempt a new story. This pliability is a perfect fit for a film like <em>Logan</em>, which captures Wolverine through a mythic lens and treats the X-Men tales as folklore. However, this is remarkably (if unintentionally) similar to how the Deadpool<em> </em>movies treat continuity too, as parodies that don't bother taking canon too seriously.&nbsp;</p><p>When exactly are Tim Miller's <em>Deadpool</em> (2016) and David Leitch's <em>Deadpool 2</em> (2018) set in relation to the X-Men films? The answer, as with <em>Logan</em>, is "it doesn't really matter," since the series is too busy poking fun at superheroes to figure that out. But if you really want to do the math, it isn't hard. </p><p>By process of elimination, they definitively <em>do not</em> take place in the same continuity as <em>X-Men Origins: Wolverine </em>(and thus, the original trilogy), given their more comic-accurate Deadpool and a supporting roster that features much more cartoonish versions of characters seen in other films, like Colossus (Stefan Kapi&#269;i&#263;) and Juggernaut (Reynolds). And since the main cast of <em>X-Men: Apocalypse</em> makes a brief cameo in <em>Deadpool 2</em> &mdash; albeit as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wfxn7OBLAs" target="_blank"><u>a fleeting gag</u></a> about how the production can't afford them &mdash; it's safe to assume the two movies are at least nominally connected, even though it makes no real sense for characters from the 1980s to show up in present day. This places the Deadpool films in the new timeline created by <em>Days of Future Past</em>. Voila!</p><p>However, the story of the X-Men movies' doesn't end there. As it turns out, <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em> does actually provide a definitive answer about where the Deadpool movies fit in, where one really wasn't clear before, or even really needed.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong><em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em> (2024)&nbsp;</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>In <a href="https://mashable.com/article/deadpool-2-queer-representation" target="_self"><em>Deadpool 2</em></a>, Wade uses a time-travel device to save his girlfriend Vanessa (<a href="https://mashable.com/video/deadpool-2-morena-baccarin-love" target="_self">Morena Baccarin</a>), which theoretically creates another branched reality in which she doesn't die. In <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em>, the TVA agent. Paradox (Matthew Macfadyen) clearly establishes that the Deadpool<em> </em>movies take place in the same universe as <em>Logan</em>, since the Wolverine of Wade's reality is dead and buried in a shallow grave.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, <em>Logan</em> theoretically takes place in the new reality where Deadpool's time-travel antics caused a further shift in continuity, though the Deadpool movies' timeline fudging do shift around some existing specifics. According to on-screen text in <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em>, the film is set in 2024, but dialogue in <em>Logan </em>sets that film in 2029. So, when did Wolverine die, exactly? Well, in keeping with <em>Logan</em>, it depends on who you ask &mdash; or in this case, which movie studio you ask, since this appears to be a definitive retcon under Disney.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>However, the Wolverine in the yellow suit seen in all the trailers is from<em> another</em> different timeline, which seems to be unconnected to the X-Men movies altogether. However, this "Worst Wolverine" &ndash; as Paradox declares him &mdash;&nbsp;harbors the same rage and self-doubt as the Logan we've seen before.</p><p>This is a must, if Jackman's return is to have any emotional resonance for the audience. For better or worse, the nitty-gritties of the X-Men timeline may actually be important for once, if only to make sense of Wade and Logan's MCU debuts.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>Why we like it</h2><p>Logitech makes some of the best webcams on the market, and this 4K Pro model proves it. With this cam, you'll get up to four times the resolution of a standard HD webcam, up to 90 frames per second, and multiple field of view presets. In addition, the webcam comes with a nifty privacy shade, automatic lighting adjustment tech, and a built-in noise-cancelling microphone. At $50 off, this is a fantastic deal for streamers and WFH professionals.</p><h2>More 4K webcam deals</h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/W0P6m?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=AnkerWork%20C310%204K%20webcam&object_type=article&object_uuid=05B6ExnfUisWtzuyCjxxnA4&short_url=W0P6m&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">AnkerWork C310 4K webcam</a> &mdash; <strong>$84.99</strong> <s>$99.99</s> (save $15 with on-page coupon)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/ZRPAR?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Insta360%20Link%20PTZ%204K%20webcam&object_type=article&object_uuid=05B6ExnfUisWtzuyCjxxnA4&short_url=ZRPAR&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Insta360 Link PTZ 4K webcam</a> &mdash; <strong>$224.99</strong> <s>$299.99</s> (save $75)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/dM28p?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Lumina%204K%20webcam&object_type=article&object_uuid=05B6ExnfUisWtzuyCjxxnA4&short_url=dM28p&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Lumina 4K webcam</a> &mdash; <strong>$175</strong> <s>$250</s> (save $75)</p></li></ul><h2>HD webcam deals</h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/MVPKO?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Razer%20Kiyo%20Pro%20HD%20webcam&object_type=article&object_uuid=05B6ExnfUisWtzuyCjxxnA4&short_url=MVPKO&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Razer Kiyo Pro HD webcam</a> &mdash; <strong>$119.99</strong> <s>$199.99</s> (save $80)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/kn01Y?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Logitech%20HD%20Pro%20webcam&object_type=article&object_uuid=05B6ExnfUisWtzuyCjxxnA4&short_url=kn01Y&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Logitech HD Pro webcam</a> &mdash; <strong>$59.99</strong> <s>$99.99</s> (save $40)</p></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Want to whip up your own batches of sparkling water at home? The SodaStream Art bundle includes everything you need to get started: the sparkling water maker, two 60L Co2 cylinders, two dishwasher-safe bottles, and two 40 ml bubly drops flavors. The Art features a retro design with a unique carbonating lever and a slim profile, so it slides conveniently into small openings on your countertop. No need to haul cases of La Croix home from the grocery store anymore &mdash;&nbsp;just make your own. It's usually $199.99 for the bundle, but it's on sale for just $110.99 as of July 26. That's 45% in savings and just a few bucks away from its <a href="https://mashable.com/article/prime-day-deals-better-than-black-friday" target="_self">record-low</a>.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>As our friends at PCMag (which is owned by Mashable's publisher, Ziff Davis) noted in their <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/jbl-tune-230nc" target="_blank">review</a>, "Only a handful of affordable noise-cancelling true wireless earphones are worth your attention, but you can add JBL&rsquo;s Tune 230NC earbuds to that list." For budget earbuds, the JBL Tune 230NCs offer solid audio and active noise cancellation. Plus, they'll last you up to 40 hours with the charging case. At $47.95, they're over half off and just $3 away from their record-low price.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>The Series 9, despite its bumpy start to the year, is still alive and well (aside from the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-watch-blood-oxygen" target="_self">removal of the blood oxygen sensor</a>). It saw its biggest discount to date on Prime Day, but if you missed out, you can still grab it for a great deal on July 26. The <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-watch-series-9" target="_self">Apple Watch Series 9</a> packs fancy new features like <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-watch-series-9-double-tap-launch" target="_self">Double Tap</a> and a 2,000-nit display, which makes it more readable in sunlight. The 41mm aluminum case with GPS only is usually $399, but you can save 25% and pick it up for just $299 instead.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

In May, they released "A Futurist View into the Future of Love, Sex, and Relationships: LELO Report on Trends in the Following Decade." The title is pretty long-winded, but the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14zqq-PICUj-SLkFac1yVxKZsZ8zgqM8k/view?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">15-page report</a> offers a glimpse into how technology is reshaping the way we connect, experience intimacy, and find pleasure both emotionally and physically.</p><h2>A futurist's sexy prediction approach </h2><p>To create this report, Cheesewright used "Scenario Planning" &mdash; a methodology where current trends are identified and projected into the future, typically over a long time horizon (in this case, 50 years). This establishes a "baseline scenario" where these trends continue, though not necessarily at the same pace or intensity.</p><p>He then "bent" this baseline into three directions to see how sex might look under each possible scenario: </p><ul><li><p><strong>Digital unbound: </strong>This imagines a world where we spend 10 hours a day in "mixed reality," where AI avatars are "near indistinguishable" from our friends and family. While this offers new ways to experience "connection," it raises concerns about loneliness, isolation, and the potential for extreme fantasy roleplay.</p></li><li><p><strong>Natural forces: </strong>This looks at a future in which a backlash against technology leads to a renewed focus on real-world, flesh-and-blood relationships &mdash; where empathy, authenticity, and personalized handmade goods are valued more highly. </p></li><li><p><strong>Resurgent traditionalism: </strong>This considers a future where societal anxieties and political shifts lead to a return to traditional gender roles and relationship structures. This could manifest as a "false nostalgia" for the past, with government incentives encouraging people to commit to long-term, monogamous relationships and start families.</p></li></ul><p>"I tried to imagine the answer to the questions posed to me by LELO under these [three] scenarios, then aggregated the answers to try to find some probabilities that were the most interesting to explore,&rdquo; Cheesewright explains.</p><h2>What does the future hold for sex and relationships? </h2><p>Before I go into the specifics, I want to note that I reached out to a few experts on my own to see if they had any thoughts to add to the conversation. It led to a thought-provoking discussion that one could argue is never-ending.</p><p>Here's what the LELO report envisions for the future of sex and relationships <em>and </em>what the experts I spoke with had to say:</p><h3>We'll have more partners, but not at the same age as the generations before us</h3><p>According to the report (page six), today's youngest sexually-active generation is <a href="https://mashable.com/article/decline-sexual-frequency-public-health" target="_self">having less sex</a> and fewer partners. But Cheesewright and LELO predict that we'll be more promiscuous in our 30s and beyond. </p><p>This shift is attributed to a trend of "extended adolescence," where milestones like marriage and parenthood are happening later in life. A combination of factors, including a more health-conscious younger generation, economic uncertainty (particularly the inability to buy homes and start families), and a low tolerance for risk, means many of us are waiting longer to settle down.</p><p>The report suggests that instead of "frantic coupling" and partnering in our youth, we're likely to experience more partners later in life as we gain confidence and grow into ourselves. This could happen in our late 20s and early 30s as we search for long-term partners or even older, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/mourning-lost-time-breakups-relationships" target="_self">after previous relationships end</a>.</p><h3>We'll have less sex with our current partners</h3><p>Thanks to<strong> </strong>never-ending distractions, work, and finding time to relax, the report states that sex with our partners might be getting pushed down our priority list. However, there's a potential upside: this could lead us to value sex more when it does happen.</p><p>That said, staff sexologist at sex toy shop Good Vibes, <a href="https://www.goodvibes.com/content/c/carol-queen" target="_blank">Carol Queen</a>, Ph.D., points out that this positive outcome is only possible if we are emotionally healthy and prioritize consent within our relationships.</p><p>"Some researchers think that social media impairs the kinds of emotional states and skills needed to make Cheesewright's POV a solid prediction, while others do not. If nothing else, it's pretty clear that some people conduct a lot of their social lives online now!" Queen tells Mashable. Queen also points out that this isn't the only factor that impacts how much sex we have and how much we value it; different people have different values, and likely will in the future too.</p><p>"To me this prediction is so full of caveats: the dangers that sex can bring, the frequency with which some people find sex to be just meh, and the fraught ways sex and emotional intimacy can be tangled up. And I may see those things from quite a different angle given my AFAB [assigned female at birth] history too," she continues.</p><h3>We'll have more virtual sex</h3><p>Instead of the oh-so-clich&eacute; nurse or fireman roleplay, the report predicts that as technology advances and integrates into our lives, a "mixed reality" could become the norm. Imagine avatars and artificial intelligence projected directly into our surroundings through smart glasses or lenses, creating a fully immersive experience with limitless possibilities for sexual content (so, aliens and elves).</p><p>This level of immersion opens up new and potentially "worrying" possibilities, allowing us to reshape our environments and even our partners. Cheesewright explains, "We can build characters around toys, robots, and AIs. There will be a lot of temptation."</p><h3>We'll continue to make friends with inanimate objects</h3><p>Although the report doesn't predict that robots will gain consciousness (page eight), they may be able to provide a convincing imitation of life. However, this raises ethical concerns about relationships with robots, as it risks reducing one to an "object" <a href="https://mashable.com/article/parasocial-relationships-definition-meaning" target="_self">rather than an equal partner</a>. </p><p>"The benefits are obvious," sex and intimacy coach <a href="https://www.leahcarey.com/" target="_blank">Leah Carey</a> tells Mashable. "Soothing touch hunger, giving people an outlet for both connection and sexual appetite&hellip;" But Carey also acknowledges complications, such as, "Does having an always-willing partner impair people's ability to negotiate consent?&rdquo; </p><p>Carey also notes that while <a href="https://mashable.com/article/cybrothel-fulfills-a-fantasy-but-may-have-risks" target="_self">robots could allow people to explore kinks</a> that might otherwise be inaccessible, the power dynamics in such scenarios become inherently imbalanced.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Beyond these ethical concerns, relationships with robots could also create (and encourage) unrealistic expectations. With customizable body shapes and appearances, robots might reinforce harmful ideals about human partners and allow people to act out "dangerously extreme fantasies," potentially necessitating regulation.</p><p>"The ability to construct your partner's perfect physique could reinforce cultural beauty standards to an extreme degree, but there's another possibility that concerns me more: removing options for fat people," Carey says. "In my work, I encounter a lot of people who prefer people in fat bodies, or who are agnostic about body size. But it's so stigmatized in culture, it's not unusual for them to have a fuck-buddy on the side who is large, while publicly dating people in more conventionally acceptable bodies in public," she adds. </p><p>"If the desire for a larger body can be filled by a life-like robot, those people get pushed even further out to the fringes. To be clear," Carey clarifies, "the fuck-buddy-in-the-dark phenomenon is hugely problematic on its own; this would just make it even worse."</p><h3>Sex toys will evolve</h3><p>It's not just robots; the report envisions <a href="https://mashable.com/article/sex-toys-vibration-sensations" target="_self">sex toys</a> that feel and move more naturally, respond to virtual fantasies, and become more integrated into partnered sex. As it is, people are already using <a href="https://mashable.com/article/bluetooth-sex-toys-vr-how-people-are-having-sex-in-virtual-reality" target="_self">bluetooth sex toys</a> to mimic real-life sensations in VR.</p><p>"Our understanding of the smallest molecules of matter is allowing us to create new materials with incredible properties &mdash; not just look and feel, but an ability to move, change shape, and store energy," Cheesewright writes. "This creates endless possibilities for future sex toys that take advantage of our growing understanding of human pleasure."</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

        </a>
    </div>
<p>The report also predicts that more people will embrace "unselfish" sexual behavior, overcoming any insecurities about <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-use-sex-toys-with-partner" target="_self">using toys in the bedroom</a>. However, Carey says this is entirely dependent on whether or not our culture can come to terms with the fact that <a href="https://mashable.com/article/instagram-shadowbanning-lgbtq-sex-educator-accounts" target="_self">sex education</a> needs to not only exist but be far more comprehensive than it currently is.</p><p>"If we want to decouple the idea that a toy isn't needed if you have an excellent lover, we need people to understand a lot of basics that many people don't currently have: how to ask for what they want in the bedroom; how to truly understand your partner's turn-ons; understanding the difference between giving touch and receiving touch and the purposes for both, etc."</p><h2>There's a lot this report covers, but it&rsquo;s missing a few important details</h2><p>LELO's report is undoubtedly extensive, but this subject is so<em> </em>much more nuanced and complex. There are pieces missing or glossed over that are worth digging into, mainly: </p><ul><li><p><strong>Reproductive rights: </strong>"I was surprised to see no mention of reproductive rights, abortion access, etc. since <em>Roe v. Wade</em> was struck down in 2022, and the fallout has been devastating for people with uteruses in the [U.S.]," Kate Sloan, sex journalist, author of <a href="https://zdcs.link/b151G?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=101%20Kinky%20Things%20Even%20You%20Can%20Do&object_type=article&object_uuid=02UyjlXXm1ieHG7EwnNNHcZ&short_url=b151G&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><em>101 Kinky Things Even You Can Do</em></a>, and host of the podcast miniseries<em> <a href="https://makingmagicseries.com/" target="_blank">Making Magic</a></em><em>, </em>tells Mashable.&nbsp;"Again, if there isn't sufficient pushback against and reversal of these legal changes in the coming years, life will continue to get much more dangerous and unsettling for anyone who's capable of getting pregnant." Sloan also mentions that if we're seeing women having less sex than before, it may very well be a result of having our reproductive rights taken away from us.</p></li><li><p><strong>The LGBTQ community: </strong>Sloan points out that the report entirely overlooks <a href="https://mashable.com/category/lgbtq" target="_self">LGBTQ</a> rights and identities. "More and more people are coming out as queer and trans over the years, as the general public learns more about what it means to be queer or trans," she says. "That being said, more visibility has not translated to more rights or more protections, and queer and trans people still face discrimination and exclusion every day...This will affect the future of sexuality insofar as unless we are all able to lead the sex lives we want, none of us are really free." </p></li><li><p><strong>Sex workers and sexual education: </strong>The report also fails to address the continued criminalization and stigmatization of sex work, which has far-reaching consequences on sexual rights and well-being. "I was surprised to see no mention in the report of laws like <a href="https://decriminalizesex.work/advocacy/sesta-fosta/what-is-sesta-fosta/" target="_blank">SESTA/FOSTA</a> that have harmed and targeted sex workers, the porn industry, etc., as these puritanical laws have already affected our sexual culture massively and will continue to do so,"  Sloan adds. "If there isn't sufficient pushback and reversal of these laws in the coming years, working and living conditions will get even more precarious for sex workers &mdash; and anyone who enjoys porn, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/uk-sex-education-politics" target="_self">sex education content</a>, informational kink resources, and so on will have less information and entertainment available to them as a result. It will be a less safe, less free, and less sexually-expressive world."</p></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

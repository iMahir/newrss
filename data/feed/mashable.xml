These notes are user-generated, usually including links to high-quality sources. Like Reddit posts they live or die on upvotes ("helpful") and downvotes ("not helpful") &mdash; enough of the latter and they disappear. Anyone can sign up to contribute, if they don't have strikes against their account. Contributors are the only ones who get to see or vote on proposed notes before they're officially stamped on tweets.</p><p>Musk will often tout Community Notes as a sign that he cares about the quality of information on a service that is crawling with deliberate disinformation. He's smart to do so: one study has found that <a href="https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/3/7/pgae217/7686087" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Community Notes increase trust in social media</a>, and so could help bring X's fleeing users back. But he doesn't even need to put his thumb on the scale of the X algorithm to avoid them himself. </p><p>With nearly 200 million people following him, if even a small percentage of his adoring fans are signed up to rate proposed Community Notes, they can swarm the system, intercept and rate any proposed note on Musk's account as "not helpful" before he gets another badge of fact-checking shame. As in this instance, where retweeting a false story about a bomb at a Trump rally was a step too far even for his fans (the original tweet Musk quotes was deleted; the Note remains). </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>This helps Musk significantly. Because as any study of his tweets confirms, the bomb story isn't too much of an outlier: <em>Musk is spreading misinformation constantly. </em>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/technology/elon-musk-x-posts.html" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>New York Times </em>looked at one weeks' worth in September</a>, and found one-third to be "false, misleading or missing vital context." </p><p>In July, the month Musk endorsed Trump, the Center for Countering Digital Hate <a href="https://counterhate.com/research/musk-misleading-election-claims-viewed-1-2bn-times-on-x-with-no-fact-checks/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">identified 50 Musk tweets that had been debunked</a> by independent fact-checkers.

Several accounts that he frequently replies to and retweets are ranked in the top 10. The top account has more than 800 notes &mdash; but at a rate of 50 falsehoods a month, Musk would easily have outpaced them if oversight was equal.</p><p>So what can we learn from the 70 fact-checks that <em>did</em> actually get added to Musk's account?

<p>A mere three of the 70 Community Notes on Musk tweets were before the date he brought that sink in to Twitter in October 2022. That doesn't tell us too much, since the Birdwatch service was soft-launched in January 2021 and only fully rolled out weeks before Musk arrived. </p><p>Still, we can see how minor the corrections were at first. In his first post with a Community Note, Musk claimed his Tesla Roadster was orbiting Mars; it's actually <a href="https://mashable.com/article/elon-musk-tesla-roadster-space-library" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">orbiting the sun somewhere out towards the asteroid belt</a> (which is still quite a flex). The other two pre-Twitter Notes concern EV tax credits and Hyperloop tunnels, which he claims can't flood. Concerning, to use one of Musk's favorite words, but not a huge deal.  </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>In Musk's first week at Twitter, he racked up four more Notes. But they're harmless, even helpful. A couple point out when Musk is joking, in case it isn't clear. He calls Community Notes "awesome"; a Note provides further information on how to join. </p><p>Then on Nov 4, 2022, Musk claimed advertisers are "trying to destroy free speech in America" by fleeing the service. Community Notes stepped in to point out that advertisers were concerned about Musk's lax approach to security and misinformation as he gutted those teams. And a new more adversarial kind of Musk note was born. </p><h2>There are more Community Notes on his tech posts than his political posts. </h2><p>In 2023, Musk would receive 31 Notes. It's still his most fact-checked year. May 2023 &mdash; when Musk launched Ron DeSantis' campaign on X, and incorrectly claimed DeSantis had set "an all time record for fundraising" &mdash; is still his most fact-checked month.  </p><p>But that doesn't mean he's getting fact-checked on his political statements. More Community Notes appear on his claims about the tech and media world, including a number of bizarre attacks on nonprofits (see notes on his tweets about the <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1651602599345373186" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Wikimedia Foundation</a>, the <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1651602599345373186" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Internet Archive</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1644638493883211779" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">NPR</a>). </p><h2>Musk is more vulnerable in the replies.</h2><p>Of the 70 Community Notes on Musk tweets, a clear majority &mdash; 40 &mdash; are on tweets where Musk is replying to someone. That makes sense. The X algorithm artificially boosts Musk's regular posts, making sure that he shows up in your "For You" tab even if you don't follow him. But the algorithm doesn't push his replies, so falsehoods there are more likely to receive upvotes from Community Note volunteers acting in good faith.</p><p>And what falsehoods they've been! In a reply to his mother, Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1611856501798215680" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">disavowed knowledge of his father's emerald mine</a>; Community Notes simply used his own words against him, digging up a quote acknowledging that his father co-owned the mine. In a reply to a former employee, Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1826407741101109419" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">claims there's no proof that plastics in the environment harm us</a>; turns out there is. "Why would we have your home address?" he asks a verified user concerned about X potentially doxxing him to the IDF; a Note points out that verification requires ID with an address.</p><p>And he can't let well enough alone. When one supportive account posts a screenshot proudly proving that X is fair because "even Elon Musk can be Community Noted," Musk replies that the Note in the screenshot "is incorrect and the community already voted it away." That earns him another Community Note: nope, it's still there. </p><h2>Musk loves Community Notes, except when he doesn't. </h2><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <a class="text-gray-600" href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1651602599345373186" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(opens in a new window)">

<p>On seven out of the 70 posts, Musk invited the fact-check himself. Invariably he tags @CommunityNotes on a tweet he wanted to quote, and clearly already believed. On the stark statement he's pushing, he'll add a fig leaf by asking "is this true" or "is this accurate?" Nearly every time, the note that results provides context that Musk has missed. </p><p>Yet Musk rarely responds to the fact-check he's invited. The one time he did, he dug in his heels. "Community Notes is failing here," <a href="https://mashable.com/article/elon-musk-arguing-community-notes" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Musk wrote in February</a> after claiming that it was impossible to sign into a Windows PC without a Microsoft account. No, the Note on this reply stated, you can do it &mdash; it just requires a workaround that "the average Andy" might not know about. </p><p>The implication: A tech billionaire who's been logging into Windows machines for decades is not the average Andy.</p><p>Nor does this particular tech billionaire get Community Noted like the Average Andy would, at least so far.

<p>Some of the videos are labeled as AI-generated videos with hashtags or captions, but it's easy to imagine how they could be shared and exploited by someone else. Karen Panetta, IEEE fellow and professor of electrical and computer engineering at Tufts University, describes how AI-generated content can be weaponized to incite panic and confusion. "Less than 30 percent of our adult public understands what AI can do. So you can put some misinformation out to the general population with a scary headline, you're going to get a lot of people panicking," said Panetta. </p><p>To be clear, the actual damage done by Hurricane Milton is devastatingly real. But when AI-generated content comes into play, it makes users question reality. That in turn can create mistrust and fertile ground for <a href="https://mashable.com/article/hurricane-milton-conspiracy-theories-debunk?test_uuid=&amp;test_variant=a" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">hurricane conspiracy theories</a>.

<p>But to add to the confusion, some satellite images claiming to be of Hurricane Milton were debunked by <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/hurricane-milton-from-space/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Snopes</a> as being mis-captioned or AI-generated.</p><h2>Beware of scams using AI-generated images</h2><p>Aside from misinformation and disinformation in the aftermath of Hurricane Milton, experts say to be vigilant about scams. The Federal Trade Commission <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/10/ftc-doj-cfpb-warn-consumers-about-potential-scams-price-gouging-wake-hurricanes-other-natural" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">issued</a> a press release the day before Milton made landfall warning consumers to look out for "those looking to take advantage of natural disasters by engaging in potential fraud or price gouging."</p><p>And according to Panetta, scams like fake charities can make themselves more persuasive by using generative AI. "In any disaster there's always something that goes on where [scammers] try to set up web pages for fundraising that aren't legitimate," said Panetta. "What's happening now is that because of the easy access to AI-generated imagery, it's being used to add credibility and say, 'Look, it's not just me asking for money. Look how horrible this is.'"</p><p>The viral AI-generated image of the little girl holding a puppy and crying in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene is a perfect example of how an image can pull on the heartstrings and evoke the desire to donate, even if it's fake. While savvy internet users might realize it's fake, <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/ai-girl-maga-hurricane-helene-1235125285/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">others may not know</a> and those people are easy targets for scams. </p><p>Some of the AI-generated images of Hurricane Milton might seem like innocuous instances of some kid eager to show off their generative AI skills. But that's not always the case. The false sense of innocence might be part of a way of getting people to let their guard down. "It's a whole strategy. How do I bait people in? And then once I have you convinced that I'm legitimate, there's an ask in there," said Panetta. </p><p>"There's always money at the end," she added.</p><p>While natural disasters like Hurricane Milton might make people exceptionally vulnerable, it's all the more vital to apply critical thinking and think twice before reacting to anything online. The FTC says scams will often insist on payment through wire transfer, gift card, payment app, cryptocurrency or in cash, and recommends looking at its <a href="https://consumer.ftc.gov/features/dealing-weather-emergencies" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">resources</a> on how to avoid scams after a weather emergency.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The lawsuits focus on several allegedly harmful aspects of the social media platform, including beauty filters, the For You Page (FYP), and TikTok Live. According to TikTok's own internal research, users only need to watch 260 videos before they could become addicted to the app. That same research found that "compulsive usage correlates with a slew of negative mental health effects like loss of analytical skills, memory formation, contextual thinking, conversational depth, empathy, and increased anxiety." It acknowledged that the algorithm had "better engagement" with young people. </p><p>Remedial measures, such as <a href="https://mashable.com/article/tiktok-time-limit?test_uuid=01iI2GpryXngy77uIpA3Y4B&amp;test_variant=b" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">screen time alerts and limits</a>, were implemented and promoted on the app despite internal research suggesting they would not have a measurable effect on users. The screen limit tool resulted in only a 1.5-minute drop in usage, according to the documents. </p><p>The app's negative impact on body image was well noted, too, with the platform allegedly prioritizing more conventionally attractive users in the FYP algorithm &mdash; executives ignored suggestions to add informative banners or awareness campaigns on popular videos and beauty filters. Executives were also aware that young users were often exposed to videos featuring suicidal ideation and eating disorder content as it slipped through moderation and into algorithm "bubbles." </p><p>In a statement to NPR, a TikTok spokesperson said, "Unfortunately, this complaint cherry-picks misleading quotes and takes outdated documents out of context to misrepresent our commitment to community safety. We have robust safeguards, which include proactively removing suspected underage users, and we have voluntarily launched safety features such as default screentime limits, family pairing, and privacy by default for minors under 16."</p><p>TikTok's internal memos mirror <a href="https://mashable.com/article/meta-mark-zuckerberg-teen-mental-health-lawsuit?test_uuid=01iI2GpryXngy77uIpA3Y4B&amp;test_variant=b" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">similar communications among Meta leaders</a>, including CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who passed on suggestions to address bullying and mental health.

<p>So far the most talked about song off the remix album is "Sympathy is a knife featuring Ariana Grande." Before it came out people joked that Grande would get on the track and sing, "issa knife." Fans were shocked and delighted to hear she actually did.

<p>Before the remix album came out, Charli XCX hosted an exclusive listening party...at 3 p.m. on a Thursday in upstate New York.

Straight to the point. </p><p>The user then posted a screenshot of the breakup text summary on X (formerly Twitter), followed by a tweet confirming that it is real.

<p>"With the new, enhanced ticket in Apple Wallet experience, fans are closer to the action from the moment they add their pass to their iPhone," said Ticketmaster President Mark Yovich in a statement.

<h2><strong>What's new to Apple Wallet tickets</strong></h2><p>If you've never added tickets to Apple Wallet before, here's how it basically works:</p><p>When an iPhone user buys an event ticket, the company can offer that customer an option to add the ticket to Apple Wallet. If selected, the tickets appear in the user's Apple Wallet for easy access. The user can pull up their Apple Wallet when entering a venue and get scanned in via the barcode on their phone screen.</p><p>With iOS 18, Apple brings way more functionality to tickets inside Apple Wallet.</p><p>Previously, tickets just provided the basic information one might find on a printed ticket like the start time. Now, with the upgrades in iOS 18, tickets in Apple Wallet will provide a map of the venue, parking details, local weather forecasts, related merchandise links, and recommended Apple Music playlists.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, tickets will have customized designs specific to each event. The new ticket experience also includes location sharing capabilities so users can meet up with friends who are also attending.</p><p>Venues and sports teams can also further add to the Apple Wallet ticket experience by linking to their own app or website.</p><p>According to Ticketmaster, the new Apple Wallet tickets will launch with Major League Soccer (MLS) on Oct. 19 for the Los Angeles Football Club's (LAFC) home game at BMO Stadium. After that, the new Apple Wallet ticket experience will be used for the Miami HEAT's games and continue to roll out throughout next year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Beats Solo 4 have seen quite a few discounts since their <a href="https://mashable.com/article/may-3-beats-solo-4-headphones" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">release earlier this year</a>, but none quite as big as the 50% price drop they got on Prime Day. The savings have stuck around following the shopping event, so you can still pick up a pair for their all-time low price of $99.99 at Amazon. The Solo 4s improve upon the previous generation with upgraded drivers, rebalanced acoustics, and an improved frequency response, which basically translates to more dynamic sound. They also have better battery life, clocking in at about 50 hours (10 extra hours compared to their predecessor). Their only downfall is that they lack noise-cancelling technology. Still, at under $100, we're willing to overlook it.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

That's a 25% discount (its biggest ever) post-Prime Day, but make note that it only includes the purple model. Quite literally the definition of portable, the Clip 5 can "clip" to any bag, belt loop, or keyring with its built-in carabiner, which has been redesigned with a wider opening. Don't write it off because of its size, either. It boasts up to 12 hours of battery life, a "Playtime Boost" mode that gives you an extra 3 hours of listening, an IP67 waterproof and dust-proof rating, and impressively loud and crisp sound.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

The Sonos Ray is our <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-tv-soundbars" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">favorite starter soundbar</a> and it's on sale at Amazon for its lowest price ever post-Prime Big Deal Days. Low-profile and budget friendly, the Ray "delivers on the bottom line requirement of any speaker: true, quality sound," according to Mashable reviewer Han Schneider. It may not have a ton of extra features (no Bluetooth connectivity, HDMI hookup, or smart home compatibility), but its ultra-low price tag certainly makes up for it. Regularly $279, it's just $169 as of Oct. 11.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

That's 38% off and the lowest price on record for the 32GB version. It's also one of the only Amazon device deals still hanging around after Prime Day. The Fire 7 isn't going to blow you away or anything. As Senior Shopping Reporter Haley Henschel put it, it's a "deeply average tablet." Still, it's hard to pass up at just $49.99.</p><p><em>None of these deals catching your eye?

<p>Anyone who's ever funded a Lego habit for themselves or someone else learns one thing very quick: those bricks don't come cheap. But, they are fun to build, and the Lego Botanicals collection make for unique (and weirdly practical) house decor. </p><p>While it may be tempting to put off thinking about the holidays as long as possible, the benefit is getting in early on any deals that pop up. For example: the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp64gR?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Lego%20Icons%20Dried%20Flower%20Centerpiece&object_type=article&object_uuid=05gHFbstgx50CPySi5b2fr3&short_url=Qp64gR&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Lego Icons Dried Flower Centerpiece</a> is on sale for just $27.99, down from $49.99, saving you $22 and actually bringing the Legos down to the realm of affordability.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Here's our hot take: If you're going to spend more than $500 on a Roomba, make it this one. That's a practical hard-stop budget when trying to decide <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-roombas" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">which Roomba model is best</a> for you. If you can spend a little extra coin, there's no reason to settle for the s9+ or j9+, which simply do a lot less than the Combo 10 Max. The AutoWash Dock's ability to deal with its own mopping pad after mopping, taking the burden off of its human to touch a soggy, mildewy pad and throw it in the washing machine. This, plus the self-emptying that we've seen on a ton of Roombas, finally creates the ultimate hands-off cleaning and maintenance experience that's becoming the standard for <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-robot-vacuum-and-mop-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">2-in-1 hybrid robot vacs</a>.</p><p>The Combo 10 Max also borrows some of iRobot's best features from the OG Roomba hybrid, the Combo j7+ that I <a href="https://mashable.com/review/irobot-roomba-combo-j7-plus" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">really liked when I first tested it</a>. These are the auto-lifting mop, which completely lifts itself over the vacuum to avoid getting carpet wet, and iRobot's PrecisionVision small obstacle avoidance, which detects and avoids small obstacles like cords, pet waste, and socks. iRobot performs both of these tasks more accurately than any other <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-robot-vacuums-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">robot vacuums I've tested</a>.</p><p>Cleaning-wise, the Combo 10 Max is also iRobot's best. It deploys a four-stage suction system compared to the three-stage approach that most cheaper Roombas use, has stronger sheer suction power and more intense scrubbing than any model but the Combo j9+ (which cleans identically), and has enhanced brainpower that pays more attention to dirtier areas.</p>]]></content:encoded>

BlueSky was more than happy to claim it does a better job at all that Threads gets wrong. </p><p>"heard people were talking about us ... so we created an account to share some more information!" the BlueSky account wrote on Threads, before getting into its content moderation policies and how its platform works. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>BlueSky pitched the idea that its moderation is largely left into the hands of users and that posts get engagement by...being actually engaging. It also noted in a different post that it wasn't owned by someone like Mark Zuckerberg. </p><p>It <a href="https://www.threads.net/@bluesky_social/post/DA82FsEvg7T" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">wrote</a>: "we're not like the other girls... we're not owned by a billionaire." </p><p>Threads, BlueSky, and others all popped up as Elon Musk reimagined Twitter into what we now see on X. There really hasn't <a href="https://mashable.com/article/social-media-platform-fatigue?test_uuid=&amp;test_variant=a" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">been a collective migration</a> to one site or another, but rather a gradual fracturing of the site Twitter once was. </p><p>Though for many, there really has been no alternative to Twitter &mdash; it takes time to build that user-base and familiarity &mdash; <a href="https://mashable.com/article/elon-musk-twitter-staying-not-leaving?test_uuid=&amp;test_variant=a" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">and they're sticking with the often-faulty X</a>, for better or worse. </p>]]></content:encoded>

"At any rate, the serotonin boost of one of life's most simple treasures &mdash; a fun little drink &mdash; is priceless," Stodart wrote.

Yvonne Strahovski and Scott Speedman star as Maggie and James Chenoweth, a married couple at odds who live on a rural farm with two kids and a pot-smoking grandma (Kathy Baker). Tensions are rising in the house before a gas-masked stranger turns up, warning them &mdash; and their visiting neighbors &mdash; that leaving the farm will have horrendous consequences.&nbsp;</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Produced by M.

Co-writers/directors Logan George and Celine Held carve out an original vision of grief and heroics by following two strangers, whose lives are changed forever by their separate searches for a missing 8-year-old girl.&nbsp;</p><p>On the surface, surly teen Ellie (Eliza Scanlen) and haunted twentysomething Paris (Dylan O'Brien) have a lot in common: Both live on the edge of a dense swamp, and lost a parent at an early age through unexplained disappearances. Could it be something in the swamp? When Ellie's stepsister goes missing, efforts to find her unlock secrets from the past and a shocking new reality.

<p>What if Mr. Rogers were magic and evil? That's basically the pitch for <em>Mr. Crocket</em>, a Hulu original about a kids' show host who takes his devotion to his fans way too far. Written by Carl Reid and Brandon Espy, <em>Mr. Crocket </em>introduces home-viewing audiences to an enchanted VHS tape called <em>Mr. Crocket's World</em>. Featuring fluffy puppets, jaunty songs, and a jovial host wearing a big smile and a bowtie, the kids' show seems the perfect escape for children enduring trouble at home. But if Mr. Crocket feels he'd be a better caretaker of a kid than the parents, he'll creep right out of that VCR for some home-invasion horror. When one recently widowed mom (Jerrika Hinton) realizes her son (Ayden Gavin) is at risk of being snatched by Mr. Crocket, she'll do whatever it takes to save him.&nbsp;</p><p>Full of lurid colors, grisly surprises, and a plotline that feels appropriate for <em>Are You Afraid of the Dark?</em>, <em>Mr. Crocket </em>seems designed for Gen X or millennials who remember the solace of <em>Mister Rogers' Neighborhood </em>and the horror of stranger-danger hysteria. The tone is broad, relishing in creepy practical effects and Freddy Krueger-style showmanship. All in all, a solid pastiche of throwback influences with some fresh kills and thrills.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Starring: </strong>Jerrkia Hinton, Elvis Nolasco, Ayden Gavin, Kristolyn Lloyd, and Alex Akpobome</p><p><strong>How to watch: </strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/QODgq8?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Mr.%20Crocket%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Hulu.&object_type=article&object_uuid=04Vv8SFlbFJdD8aQeD7827C&short_url=QODgq8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Mr. Crocket </em>is now streaming on Hulu. </a></p><h2>2. <em>The Last of the Sea Women</em></h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

</div>


<p>Produced by Malala Yousafzai, <em>The Last of the Sea Women </em>is an intriguing documentary about an extraordinary but dying tradition. On the coast of South Korea&rsquo;s Jeju Island, elderly women gather in diving suits to plunge into the depths and harvest seafood for sale. They are known as the haenyeo divers, often compared to mermaids for their ease in the water and their rejection of oxygen tanks. Director Sue Kim gets close to this compelling club, who share their stories, worries, and personalities with candor. Their ways are largely being lost, though Kim finds a pair of young haenyeo divers who have made their mark online by sharing videos of their dives. However, the greatest battle they have to fight is against the rampant pollution that risks their health and the lives of the sea creatures they hunt but cherish.</p><p>Gorgeously captured, <em>The Last of the Sea Women </em>easily bestows upon the viewer the majesty of the sea in which the haenyeo divers swim. Kim's curiosity invites us into this wondrous world of hard work and sisterhood. While the film has a clear and powerful message about preservation and the power of activism, it's also a heart-warming portrait of community and bold, charismatic women as enchanting as the sea life that is their calling. Beautiful and moving, <em>The Last of the Sea Women </em>is a trip across the world you can take from the comfort of your couch.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How to watch: </strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/a0X1WN?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=The%20Last%20of%20the%20Sea%20Women%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Apple%20TV%2B&object_type=article&object_uuid=04Vv8SFlbFJdD8aQeD7827C&short_url=a0X1WN&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>The Last of the Sea Women </em>is now streaming on Apple TV+</a></p><h2>1. <em>Disclaimer&nbsp;</em></h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

      <description><![CDATA[Steam now has a notice informing users that they are only licensing the games they've purchased.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/003PUgAeQ9ZJGbsJhPR6JQh/hero-image.jpg" alt="Steam logo on phone screen"><p>Steam is now admitting what was true all along: You don't own any of those games.</p><p>Valve's PC gaming digital marketplace has started including a notice on the shopping cart screen letting users know that purchasing a game on Steam grants them a license for it, per <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/steam-now-tells-gamers-up-front-that-theyre-buying-a-license-not-a-game-085106522.html" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Engadget</a>. That's a fairly benign message without any context, and you'd be forgiven for barely noticing it. After all, of <em>course</em> I have a license for the thing I bought, right?</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Well, it's a little more complicated than that. Thanks to a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/26/24254922/california-digital-purchase-disclosure-law-ab-2426" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">new California state law</a> signed by governor Gavin Newsom in September, digital storefronts that operate in the state have to add that disclosure before they're allowed to use words like "buy" or "purchase." It's a small thing, but important to note as we move further and further into an era where most people collect things digitally, not physically.</p><p>In other words, there will always remain a possibility that someday the licenses you paid for won't be worth anything. Steam might shut down eventually, in the distant future, and the games won't work anymore. The purpose of this law and Valve's new disclosure is to make sure you know that, even if there's not much you can do about it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>TCL is basically budget 4K TV royalty. Their TVs are super affordable without sacrificing quality, and this <a href="https://zdcs.link/91bK3w?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=55-inch%20Google%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=00jQThcwNWhb8LMAgeUOk7D&short_url=91bK3w&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">55-inch Google TV</a> is no exception. Highlights include 4K Ultra HD resolution, HDR support, a gaming mode, Dolby Atmos audio, and Google TV Smart OS with built-in Chromecast.

<p>The study showed that the vast majority &mdash; 77 percent &mdash; of high school students use social media at least several times a day, which the CDC defines as "frequent social media use." Female students use social media more &mdash; 81.8 percent &mdash; in comparison to male students' 72.9 percent. Heterosexual students reported using it more frequently than lesbian and gay students, 79.2 percent to 67.7 percent, but bisexual and questioning students reported using social media more frequently than students identifying with any other sexual orientation with 82.2 and 82.6 percent, respectively. </p><p>"Students who reported frequent social media use were more likely to be bullied at school and electronically bullied compared with less frequent social media users," the report reads.

<p>Such a steam world is thought to have thick water-rich air, with a surface devoid of ice or flowing water.

For comparison, the average surface temperature of Earth is 59 degrees Fahrenheit.

<p>This is the first confirmed case of an exoplanet atmosphere where hydrogen is not the dominant component, said Caroline Piaulet-Ghorayeb, a doctoral student at the University of Montr&eacute;al.

When these worlds cross in front of their host star, starlight gets filtered through their atmospheres. Molecules within the atmosphere absorb certain light wavelengths, or colors, so by splitting the light into its basic parts &mdash; like a rainbow &mdash; astronomers can detect what light segments are missing to discern the molecular makeup of an atmosphere.</p><p>Researchers used the new Webb data, coupled with Hubble Space Telescope observations conducted earlier this year, to confirm the steam composition. A common problem with such studies is the potential for variability in signals based on <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nasa-sun-sunspots-images" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>stellar activity</u></a> &mdash; like the spots that can form on the sun.

They work by resting just outside your ears rather than fitting inside the ear canal like standard designs. This positioning uses Bose&rsquo;s open-ear audio technology to direct sound precisely toward your ears, allowing you to hear music clearly without blocking external noise. This type of earbud is fantastic for running, walking, and any outdoor activity where it pays to stay aware of your surroundings. They're also water resistant so won't cause any issues on rainy days. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Vast does have the benefit of hiring a retired NASA astronaut, Andrew J.

"From communication and connectivity, to private space and interacting with others aboard, to advancing human progress on Earth and beyond, every detail has been designed with the astronaut experience at the core of our work."</p><p>The video and images below show conceptions of this design. In sharp contrast with the International Space Station &mdash; a cluttered space laboratory dominated by walls burgeoning with equipment and wiring &mdash; Haven-1 is minimalist and neat. Lots of equipment, it appears, is stored behind spartan wall panels. The capsule even includes "fire-resistant maple wood veneer slats, bringing natural warmth into what has traditionally been a sterile, necessity-driven interior," the <a href="https://www.vastspace.com/updates/vast-unveils-its-final-haven-1-space-station-design" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">company explained</a>.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

<p>An important factor that might contribute to the likelihood of Haven-1 launching is that it's a single, relatively small capsule (for reference, see the layout above.) In contrast, the International Space Station &mdash; which nations began building in the late 1980s &mdash; is the "largest humanmade object ever to orbit Earth," NASA explains.

<p>Taking creative cues from Ozploitation classics of the Australian New Wave like <em>Wake in Fright</em>, Finnegan simultaneously reveres and villainizes the Australian landscape, blurring the line between reality and surrealism while throwing everything he has at the Hollywood star. Cage delivers a characteristically unhinged performance, though he's at the risk of being upstaged by an exceptional Julian McMahon.</p><h2>What is <em>The Surfer</em> about?</h2><p>Equal parts tense survival thriller and coastal Western, <em>The Surfer</em> essentially takes place within one location: the confines of a beachside parking lot in the fictional suburb of Luna Bay, Western Australia. (It was filmed in Yallingup, located in Wadandi Country, the traditional land of the Wadandi people.)</p><p>Credited just as "The Surfer," Cage's character is a man bursting with nostalgia and idealism. Returning to the Australian town he grew up in after a life in California, he's anxious to finally buy his childhood home and reunite his family. He's a classic divorced dad, waxing lyrical about surfing as a metaphor for life in speeches aimed at his estranged teenage son (<em>Yellowstone</em>'s Finn Little). But his lofty quest to close the deal and secure a seaside utopia is disrupted by hostile locals, who won't have a bar of him.</p><p>When the Surfer attempts to go surfing with his son, he comes face to face with the Bay Boys, a gang of surfers determined to "keep the riffraff out" of their waves &mdash; i.e. non-locals. They're brilliantly described by a carpark-dwelling character crudely credited as "The Bum" (Nicholas Cassim) as a "bunch of fuckin' yuppies cosplaying at being surfers." Dedicated to their mustachioed gang leader Scottie "Scally" Callahan (a brilliant Julian McMahon), this hollering group of violent bleached blondes in tank tops humiliate and harass Cage's protagonist, stealing his surfboard and creating hell for him. As for the local police officer (Justin Rosniak), he's in Scally's pocket too.</p><p>As soon as he arrives at the Luna Bay break, the Surfer starts to lose. With dwindling personal effects, increasing dehydration, no allies, and a teetering grip on reality, the Surfer wages an uphill battle against his downhill enemies. Somehow, Finnegan and Martin manage to concoct a never-ending supply of misfortune for their protagonist, all while presenting the locals as deeply corrupt and self-serving. But there's more to this place than it initially appears for the long-suffering Surfer.</p><h2><em>The Surfer</em> traps Nicolas Cage in the parking lot from hell.</h2><p>The entirety of <em>The Surfer</em> is set within an asphalt arena, the beachside carpark overlooking the waves that Cage's character so desperately wants to surf again. That the Surfer himself is contained to this bitumen plain mirrors his denied access to the beach. However, this limitation doesn't mean the film is boring by any means, thanks to Cage's signature slow-burn unraveling.</p><p>Cage has been unpredictable in his film choices over the last few years, from his serial killer transformation in <a href="https://mashable.com/article/longlegs-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Longlegs</u></em></a> to playing an amped-up version of himself in <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-unbearable-weight-of-massive-talent-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent</u></em></a>. Here, he's tasked with carrying the whole film as a man just trying to get his stolen surfboard back and catch a wave, and Cage truly leans into gaslit delirium.</p><div id="related-video" class="mx-auto mt-8 mb-12 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans md:mt-12 md:mb-16 text-primary-400">

</div>
<p>Cage's character is pushed to the brink in the film, as his characters often are. But here he's drinking beer out of puddles, eating dead rats, and having his bare feet shredded by carpark broken glass, completely at the mercy of what is by no means a remote environment. As Cage's character stumbles through misfortune after misfortune, the film cleverly and organically becomes a kind of survival drama set within a relatively busy beachside suburb. At many points in <em>The Surfer</em>, you're basically yelling at the screen for this man to get a hotel room and call it a day &mdash; two things pretty much always available to him during his turmoil. But there's a deeper reason for the Surfer's determination.</p><p>What Finnegan's production team manages to create within one seaside battleground is nothing short of impressive. But probably the most stunning achievement of the film is using Australia's idyllic natural beauty and surfing culture to dive into the sinister realities of toxic masculinity.</p><h2><em>The Surfer</em> dives into a particularly Australian brand of aggressive male behavior.</h2><p><em>The Surfer</em> is, at its core, a rumination on the harmful effects of hypermasculinity. But it's a particularly Australian, and particularly violent form of it, with the country's tendency to dismiss male toxicity and violence as "larrikin" behaviour. "Boys will be boys," a character literally says aloud in this film.</p><p>Finnegan and Martin use surfing culture and the terrifying Bay Boys to sharpen their focus on misogyny and superiority complexes, as well as hammering home Australia's skewed sense of local identity. (The film's local surfer gang, the Bay Boys, seems a subtle nod to the real surf gang from Sydney's Maroubra Beach, the Bra Boys.) While the film doesn't address the hypocrisy of such localism in a country with a violent colonial past, it does go hard on the general messaging of keeping outsiders out, locals in. "Don't live here, don't surf here," the Surfer is violently told by the locals. "Locals only" signs adorn the beach.&nbsp;</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>It's the head of this predatory pack who threatens to upstage Cage in <em>The Surfer</em>: McMahon as the chilling Scally. Swanning about with a deep tan and a bright-red beach poncho, this character is so blatantly yet amiably menacing that he gets right under your skin (and that of Cage's character) with cold finesse. Running his "Sanctuary" for young surfers and their problematically younger teen girl visitors &mdash; no girl surfers here, no way &mdash; Scally's whole deal is that modern men have "gone soft" and "haven't had to suffer." He preaches this to his young followers, encouraging them to unleash their inner "animal" within their beach haven. Under Scally's tutelage, the Bay Boys' abrasive, territorial behaviour isn't just allowed by the rest of the community, it's encouraged, with Cage's Surfer encountering the same level of anti-outsider animosity by other non-surfer locals he comes across in the lot.</p><p>In fact, there are only two characters in the entire film who aren't total assholes to the Surfer: his son and a confoundingly underused Miranda Tapsell (<a href="https://mashable.com/article/top-end-wedding" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Top End Wedding</em></a>) as a friendly photographer who helps him out. It's overwhelming, this unrelenting hostility. And it's been used as a weapon in many an Australian film.</p><h2><em>The Surfer</em> stylistically rides the Australian New Wave.</h2><p><em>The Surfer </em>is by no means the first to make a nightmare of Australia's natural environment, amping up the heat, sunlight, and mysteries of the bush for psychological thrills. But Finnegan appears to pay tribute to such Australian New Wave thrillers of the '70s and '80s like Ted Kotcheff's <em>Wake in Fright</em>, Everett De Roche's <em>Razorback</em>, and Tony Williams' <em>Next of Kin</em>. <em>Wake in Fright</em> is the most overt reference here, as a film in which an outsider is also driven to madness by the locals &mdash; a psychological state only intensified by the harsh heat and dangerous dehydration.&nbsp;</p><p>Director of photography Radek Ladczuk, cinematographer for Jennifer Kent's brutal Tasmanian film <em>The Nightingale</em> as well as <a href="https://mashable.com/video/babadook-jennifer-kent-lgbtq-icon" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>The Babadook</em></a>, makes a Australian New Wave meal of <em>The Surfer</em>. Meticulously slow or audaciously fast zooms feel right out of the '70s, proving to be a hilariously kitsch but strangely authentic way to capture Cage's earnestness over his beloved waves. Lighting furthers <em>The Surfer</em>'s slightly surreal feeling; the entire film feels like it's been drenched in a golden sunlight filter, which moves from idyllic to dangerously searing. The carpark itself glows in green-lit darkness at times, while the lot's cursed toilet block glows an ominous orange. Ladczuk takes full advantage of the strange distortions reflected by metal mirrors typically found in Australian public toilet blocks.&nbsp;</p><p>Then there's that score by Fran&ccedil;ois T&eacute;taz and sound design by Aza Hand, resulting in a hypnotic, bonkers smorgasbord of operatic singing, chimes and harps, and blissful orchestral overtures uniquely combined with the sounds of Australian wildlife. Cicadas chirp loudly and relentlessly, a kookaburra's famous laugh becomes a cursed rhythm, and buzzing flies rise as the Surfer's hold on reality slips. It's this combination of whimsy, threat, beauty, and overwhelming powerlessness that makes <em>The Surfer </em>deeply effective.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Everything about <em>The Surfer</em>'s one-line pitch sounds ridiculous (Nicolas Cage versus mean Australian surfers), but the film itself is a haunting set piece about localism, repressed memory, and toxic masculinity, boasting the wild ride we've come to associate with Cage. It's as far from a wipeout as you can get.</p><p><em>The Surfer </em>was reviewed out of the BFI London Film Festival. The film will open in in cinemas early 2025.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>We finally get a clear view of the monster at the end of the movie, and it does indeed look like Isaac's father. But it's a nightmarish version of him, with the changing face mutated and twisted, the limbs distorted and spider-like. But although the thing looks like a bad dream, the film implies that it's not purely psychological; three different characters see the monster, and it's able to do real-world damage. In short, it's not purely in Isaac's mind.</p><p>But whether or not it's a <em>product</em> of Isaac's mind is a different question. The creature's appearance is the first clue. We know that Isaac is an imaginative child, as it's repeated throughout the film, and we know he likes to draw monsters as a hobby. But when Isaac visits his dying father in the hospital, James is covered head to toe in bandages. Isaac never sees the extent of James' injuries before his death, so Isaac's mind conjures up something terrible.</p><p>Although the movie leaves the monster's nature up to interpretation, our best guess is that the thing is a physical manifestation of Isaac's horror and grief at the sudden loss of his father. It's all of his too-big-to-process emotions &mdash; not just bereavement and shock, but also suspicion and mistrust of those around him &mdash; brought to life. It turns him against Laura, and it makes him want to lash out.</p><p>But, crucially, as we see at the movie's end, it can also be overcome.</p><h2>What's the deal with that skeleton?</h2><p>For all its horror, <em>Daddy's Head</em> has a happy ending.</p><p>After Laura has saved Isaac from the creature and stabbed it to death, we flash forward to an older Isaac (James Harper-Jones) going back to his childhood home. He goes into the woods outside his house and visits the weird little wooden structure that acted as the creature's nest when he was a child. Inside, he finds a picture of himself and his dad, and then he sees a skeleton on the ground with the skull split open down the middle. Older Isaac returns back to his new home and wakes up Laura, who he now calls "Mum."</p><p>This isn't made explicit, but our best guess is the skeleton belongs to the creature. Isaac finding its remains shows that the creature is indeed dead, and while the horrible emotions he experienced after his dad died are still there, they can no longer hurt him in the same way as they once did.</p><p>Perhaps Laura risking her own life to save Isaac from the monster was enough to prove to him that she loved him and he could trust her &mdash; and it was ultimately this realisation that killed the thing haunting him.</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/ak7KN6?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Daddy%27s%20Head%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Shudder.&object_type=article&object_uuid=020gKACIr7goXJUUG1C8dkf&short_url=ak7KN6&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Daddy's Head</em> is now streaming on Shudder.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>Why Indigenous languages matter</h2><p>Indigenous languages are often spoken by small, marginalized communities, making them more susceptible to the overwhelming dominance of global languages. As the world becomes more digitally connected, Indigenous languages face a higher risk of disappearing. If they fade, their rich cultural heritage and histories will be lost alongside any daily usage.</p><p>Preserving and reviving Indigenous languages is essential for the survival of the communities that speak them, and has benefits for society at large. It guarantees that all cultures are acknowledged and protected, which is an important first step in building a more accepting and understanding global community.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>How technology can help</h2><p>Published earlier this year alongside our partners at UNESCO, we co-authored the <a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000389391?posInSet=1&amp;queryId=N-ea5a8512-bb1a-47f0-a56a-75f6af749867" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Hello Indigenous</u></em></a> whitepaper to help forge a pathway to digitizing endangered languages and expanding the role technology can play in bridging an increasing digital divide. This was a proud moment for us and a significant milestone for Motorola and The Lenovo Foundation&rsquo;s Indigenous Language Support Initiative, launched back in 2021.</p><p>Since that time, and with over 90 languages incorporated in its smartphones, Motorola has supported the revitalization of languages including Kuvi, Kangri (India), Cherokee (North America), Nheengatu (Amazon region), Kaingang (South/Southeast of Brazil) and Maori (New Zealand). Notably, Motorola was the first phone manufacturer to provide Cherokee residents with a fully localised mobile phone user interface and full support for an Amazonian Indigenous language. Finally, most recently, Motorola added Ladin, one of Italy&rsquo;s twelve minority languages, spoken in the Dolomites region.</p><p>Technology provides a means to keep languages alive, but it also fosters digital inclusion by providing chances for these languages to be used in fresh and innovative ways through their incorporation with user interfaces. It becomes a part of users&rsquo; digital identity, especially younger generations, and gives them a closer connection to their heritage.</p><p>Beyond <a href="https://mashable.com/category/accessibility" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">accessibility</a>, these tech solutions offer hope for the future of language revitalization. Since the Motorola and Lenovo Foundation's initiative, similar projects have been created, such as the first-ever Nheenghatu Academy of Language in Brazil and Lenovo's Aotearoa Bilingual Keyboard in New Zealand. We hope many more will follow.</p><div class="content-block-mashable-video mt-8">

<h2>A global blueprint forward</h2><p>The <em>Hello Indigenous</em> whitepaper was our call to action to support language diversity worldwide. Collaboration is at the heart of the paper's strategy, given it was developed in conjunction with Indigenous communities to ensure the accuracy of the digitalisation of their languages. By detailing Motorola's approach to integrating these languages into its user interfaces, it also establishes a model the wider industry can apply. The paper shows even a language with limited speakers &mdash; Ladin has only 32,500 &mdash; can find a place in the digital landscape.</p><p>The UN General Assembly declaring 2022-2032 the <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/decades/indigenous-languages/about/idil2022-2032#:~:text=Following%20the%202016%20Resolution%2071,Permanent%20Forum%20on%20Indigenous%20Issues." target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">International Decade of Indigenous Languages</a> will help sharpen minds, but action must then follow suit. As the global focus on Indigenous languages grows, technology holds the potential to bridge the gap between cultural preservation and modern innovation. The work done in smartphones for Motorola and the Lenovo Foundation, supported by UNESCO, is just the beginning. With sustained investment, collaboration and innovation, digital technology can become a powerful ally in the revival and preservation of endangered languages.</p><p><em>Janine Oliveira and Juliana Rebelatto are the leads of <a href="https://motorolanews.com/motorola-expands-its-indigenous-languages-digital-inclusion-initiative-with-two-new-endangered-languages-spoken-in-india/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Motorola's Digital Inclusion of Indigenous Languages Initiative</a></em><em>.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Central to these secrets is Catherine, whose documentary work tends to focus on exposing the dark secrets of others. But when a self-published novel titled <em>The Perfect Stranger </em>shows up on her doorstep, she recognizes herself &mdash; and a troubling moment from her past &mdash; within its pages. It doesn't help that the book opens with a disclaimer that "any resemblance to persons living or dead is not a coincidence." Now, Catherine not only has to find the person responsible for writing the novel, she also has to stop its contents from imploding her relationships with her husband Robert (Sacha Baron Cohen) and her son Nicholas (Kodi Smit-McPhee, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-power-of-the-dog-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>The Power of the Dog</em></a>).</p><p><em>Disclaimer </em>doesn't hold back on revealing the "who" and "why" behind <em>The Perfect Stranger</em>'s existence. Running parallel to Catherine's panic is a revenge story rooted in grief. The avenger in question is retired teacher Stephen Brigstocke (Kevin Kline), who's lost both his son Jonathan (Louis Partridge, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/enola-holmes-2-review-netflix" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Enola Holmes</em></a>) and his wife Nancy (Lesley Manville, <em>Queer</em>). Jonathan passed away 20 years ago while alone on vacation in Italy, in an accident linked to Catherine (played in the past by Leila George) and infant Nicholas. Nancy died from cancer more recently, and upon going through her things Stephen finds a manuscript for <em>The Perfect Stranger</em>. It's Nancy's account of Jonathan's accident and the events leading up to it, which she pieced together with the help of some explicit photographs. The discovery lights a fire in Stephen, and he'll stop at nothing to burn Catherine's life to the ground.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p><em>Disclaimer </em>unravels these many story threads over a variety of timelines, moving between Jonathan's final vacation as it's described in <em>The Perfect Stranger</em>, Catherine's growing distress, Stephen's revenge plan, and his and Nancy's mourning of Jonathan. Each arc comes with its own specific stylistic flourishes to place you in the mind of the person telling or experiencing the story at that moment, hammering home <em>Disclaimer</em>'s ideas of narrative manipulation.</p><p>These flourishes are at their most visible during Jonathan's vacation scenes, which open and close with iris wipes to reflect both <em>The Perfect Stranger</em>'s storybook account of these events and the movement of Jonathan's camera shutter as he photographs the world around him. Long, mostly static shots in the vacation sections also evoke Jonathan's photography, reminding us that we're seeing these moments through a specific lens. Cinematographers Emmanuel Lubezki (who has collaborated with Cuar&oacute;n on projects like <em>Children of Men </em>and <em>Gravity</em>) and Bruno Delbonnel (<em>Am&eacute;lie</em>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-tragedy-of-macbeth-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>The Tragedy of Macbeth</em></a>) contrast these more fantastical trips through Jonathan's past with cooler tones in the present, an effective reminder of the harsh reality Catherine and Stephen find themselves in. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Cuar&oacute;n also incorporates voiceovers into the present. Catherine's flaws and worries are laid out to her in second person by an unknown narrator (Indira Varma). A guilty conscience, perhaps? Meanwhile, Stephen delivers his own internal monologue with chilling, poetic focus, the vengeful hero of his own story.</p><p>In lesser hands, this combination of different storytelling styles might be a confusing jumble, or simply too much. But with Cuar&oacute;n to guide the way, every element of <em>Disclaimer </em>&mdash; from its varying narrators to the occasional near-preposterously heightened sex scene &mdash; fits together to build a devastating tapestry of how one event can shatter so many people's lives. And with all these conflicting voices at play, <em>Disclaimer </em>asks, "Whose story do you really believe? Which narrative will you throw your allegiance behind?"</p><h2><strong>Cate Blanchett and Kevin Kline are astounding in <em>Disclaimer</em>.</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Guiding us through <em>Disclaimer</em>'s labyrinth are Blanchett and Kline, whose performances dig up the raw pain at the heart of the show's addictive thriller elements. As Catherine, Blanchett is a tight ball of nerves that gradually unspools as she reaches her breaking point. You may be tempted to draw comparisons between Catherine and Blanchett's role as Lydia T&aacute;r in <a href="https://mashable.com/article/tar-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>T&aacute;r</em></a><em> </em>&mdash; both are renowned public figures whose lives are coming under sudden scrutiny &mdash; but Blanchett's Catherine is far more vulnerable and pained than her steely, commanding Lydia.</p><p>Kline's Stephen is no less pained, but he gets some flashier chances to chew the scenery and does so with gusto. From Stephen's increasingly nasty plans to his flowery inner monologue, Kline turns his character from a grieving man who wears his wife's cardigans to feel close to her into a full-fledged villain. Or does Catherine actually deserve what's coming her way? Everyone who reads <em>The Perfect Stranger </em>certainly seems to think so.</p><p>Cuar&oacute;n's direction and <em>Disclaimer</em>'s excellent leading performances &mdash; as well as strong support from the ensemble, especially Manville and George, who's tasked with a deceptively tricky part &mdash; help carry the series over the occasional clunky hurdle. Cuar&oacute;n has referred to <em>Disclaimer </em>as <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/cate-blanchett-alfonso-cuaron-disclaimer-first-look" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">being like a seven-hour-long movie</a>, and that shows in some uneven pacing and bloat between episodes. Elsewhere, any exploration of the wider consequences of "cancel culture" &mdash; including a moment where Catherine is outright told, "You're so canceled" &mdash; falls mostly flat.</p><p>Despite these blips, the overall effect of <em>Disclaimer </em>is one of intrigue and of questioning the layers of narrative you see before you. With its commitment to formal changeups and a brutal knockout of a finale, <em>Disclaimer </em>is a puzzle that gets under your skin and refuses to leave.</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/aAVDqq?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Disclaimer%20premieres%20Oct.%2011%20on%20AppleTV%2B%2C%20with%20a%20new%20episode%20every%20Friday.&object_type=article&object_uuid=01TgbuZKnmVuOPkRAwq9Bm8&short_url=aAVDqq&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Disclaimer </em>premieres Oct. 11 on AppleTV+, with a new episode every Friday.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

I always thought I&rsquo;d have to take boring (and low-key intimidating) traditional lessons to play &ldquo;Piano Man,&rdquo; but I learned it from home.</p><p>The best part? I saved 60% on lifetime access to Skoove with this limited-time coupon. Just <strong>use code SAVENOW</strong> at checkout to get it for $119.99 (reg. $299.99).</p><h2>You could be the next piano man</h2><p>If you have a keyboard or piano, Skoove shows you how to finally master it &mdash;&nbsp;without making your roommates or neighbors hate your guts. I got started with the app&rsquo;s instructional videos that teach proper hand placement, scales, and technique.</p><p>On my iPad, I see a moving music score and an instructor&rsquo;s hands playing along, so I simply follow along on my keyboard. This has taught me to read sheet music while playing my favorite songs.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-T2hxOGzEYgE"></div>
</div>


<p>Skoove also catches when I play the wrong notes. AI technology listens to each note I play and gives me real-time feedback, so I improve each time I practice. It&rsquo;s like having an actual instructor, except it doesn&rsquo;t judge me when I mess up &ldquo;Uptown Girl.&rdquo;</p><p>Interested in <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGV12J?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=learning%20piano%20at%20home&object_type=article&object_uuid=04027yLsEtrcaTUWxyFWM4F&short_url=QGV12J&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">learning piano at home</a>?

<p>Confession: I&rsquo;m addicted to my AirPods Pro. I wear them more often than not.

<p>Before <em>Daddy's Head </em>launches us into a nightmarish creature feature, it introduces us to a nightmare that's all too real. Young Isaac (Rupert Turnbull) must say goodbye to his father James (Charles Aitken), who's being taken off life support following a devastating car crash.</p><p>Isaac has already lost his mother, and since James had no next of kin, his legal guardian is now his stepmother Laura (Julia Brown). While Isaac and Laura aren't close, <em>Daddy's Head </em>sidesteps the evil stepmother trope. Instead, early glimpses of home video from back when James was still alive paint Laura as someone trying to understand Isaac, even as he processes the arrival of a new maternal figure. At one point, seeing how much he loves drawing, Laura gifts him a set of colored pencils. Isaac is less than thrilled. It's a quietly brutal moment, one in which you can empathize with both Laura and Isaac. She hopes for connection, while he is still struggling with massive life changes.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>The uneasy distance between Laura and Isaac becomes fraught in the wake of James' death. Laura was certainly not ready to lose her husband, let alone be the mother to his son. Every night, she numbs herself with wine and home videos, all while weighing the option of surrendering Isaac to social services. Unsure of his own fate, Isaac plays games and yearns for his father's return.</p><p>You might think that return impossible, given the fact the film opens with flashes of his bloodied, pulverized face. Yet somehow, some aspects of James follow Isaac and Laura back to their sleek, ultra-modern house, turning their grief into a literal horror show.</p><h2><em>Daddy's Head </em>finds horror in the grieving process.</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The spooky occurrences in <em>Daddy's Head </em>start slow and disparate, with flashing lights reminiscent of police cars blasting through Laura and Isaac's windows, and unexplainable fires popping up in the forest that surrounds them. Here, the film falls into a pattern: day scenes that ramp up the tension between Laura and Isaac, then creepy night scenes where a wine-drunk Laura experiences these strange happenings. Between this pattern and a series of rote jump scares, <em>Daddy's Head </em>falls into a bland routine for a time.</p><p>Luckily, things pick up with the arrival of the titular monster, a scurrying, smiling replica of James' head. (Or could it even be the real thing?) It lurks in air vents and calls to Isaac from the forest with a raspy voice that, yes, recalls the Babadook. Of course, Laura believes the creature to be a figment of Isaac's imagination, <em>especially </em>given all the grotesque monsters he's drawn around his room. Even its form &mdash; and the film's own title &mdash; suggest a silly, childish monster.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

    </div>
<p>However, as proof of the creature's existence quickly grows irrefutable, how Laura and Isaac choose to deal with it will define their relationship going forward. Will they give in to the monster? Will they continue to deny its existence? Or will they band together and find common ground in this shared, traumatic experience? In this, the monster becomes a stand-in for grief, and for the emotional limits it pushes us to. Both Brown and Turnbull deliver moving work as two people with very different routes to take through mourning. Brown is all unsureness and numbness, while Turnbull brings a vulnerable rage to Isaac's pain.</p><p>Barfoot wrings scares from areas besides grief as well, especially when it comes to atmosphere. James designed the house Laura and Isaac now suffer in, effectively trapping his family in a prison of his presence. An unsettling wooden structure Isaac discovers in the woods makes for a folk horror-tinged counterpoint to the main house, and an ideal lair for the monster that lurks within. The slightest flicker of James' smile in the structure's dark depths is enough to send you cowering back in your chair. Equally chilling is the fact that Isaac appears not frightened by this sight, but instead comforted, his very perception of the world warped by loss. Yes, he may be haunted by a disembodied head, but grief and its impact are the real monsters here.</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/9wGeyD?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Daddy%27s%20Head%20was%20reviewed%20out%20of%20its%20world%20premiere%20at%20Fantastic%20Fest.%20It%20premieres%20Oct.%2011%20on%20Shudder.&object_type=article&object_uuid=05YLl3Bfk4mLyqrDZX17Eld&short_url=9wGeyD&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Daddy's Head </em>was reviewed out of its world premiere at Fantastic Fest.

<p><em>The Apprentice </em>frames Cohn and Trump's first meeting as that of an ingenue making a deal with the devil. As Trump sits awkward and alone in an elite New York City club, Cohn locks eyes with him from across the room. Strong's unbreaking gaze and some foreboding synths courtesy of composer Martin Dirkov drive home the fact that this man is the baddest of bad news. But after one conversation about how Trump and his father (Martin Donovan) can beat a federal lawsuit concerning racial discrimination against tenants, Trump takes Cohn on as his lawyer. In turn, Cohn takes Trump on as his prot&eacute;g&eacute;.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Cohn teaches Trump his three major rules for winning at all costs. One: "Attack, attack, attack." Two: "Admit nothing, deny everything." Three: "No matter what happens, you claim victory, and never admit defeat." If you pay even an ounce of attention to American politics, it's not hard to read any of these tactics onto Trump's presidency and re-election campaign. But in <em>The Apprentice</em>, we get to see Trump try these strategies out for the very first time, using them in his efforts to build a real estate empire and even court his first wife Ivana (Maria Bakalova, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/borat-sequel-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Borat Subsequent Moviefilm</em></a>). </p><h2><strong>Sebastian Stan makes a solid Donald Trump, but Jeremy Strong's Roy Cohn is the standout.</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>As Trump embraces Cohn&rsquo;s teachings and grows into a ruthless businessman, Stan&rsquo;s performance changes too. He takes on many of the mannerisms we associate with Trump today, from his exaggerated hand movements to the rambling quality of his speech &mdash; the latter also comes courtesy of screenwriter and journalist Gabriel Sherman. </p><p>But even while Stan becomes &ldquo;Trumpier,&rdquo; his performance never veers into caricature. As horrifying as many of the things Trump does in this movie are &mdash; including an upsetting scene of marital rape &mdash; it&rsquo;s clear <em>The Apprentice</em> doesn&rsquo;t wish to ridicule outright. Instead, it lays out its version of events and the man who caused them and lets their absurdity and evil speak for themselves. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Central to this absurdity and evil is Cohn, played with scene-stealing intensity by Strong. Each focused stare demands your fullest attention, to the point that you feel like you're under a microscope alongside Trump or the other men Cohn sizes up. But Strong's Cohn isn't just all extreme evil, all the time. He finds some humor in his performance, often accentuating Cohn's tirades with a turkey-like neck bob that may just be the most mesmerizing thing in the film.</p><p>Since Strong's Cohn is such a magnetic presence, it makes sense that <em>The Apprentice</em>'s best scenes are the ones Cohn and Trump share. Here, Abbasi's vision is clearest, showing us the genesis of a monster and the man who created him. It feels almost like a '70s-tinged <em>Frankenstein </em>story, with a graphic late scene of Trump undergoing liposuction and surgical treatment for his bald spot furthering the connection.</p><h2><strong>What can <em>The Apprentice </em>say about Donald Trump that hasn't already been said?</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Unfortunately, once <em>The Apprentice</em> jumps from the '70s to the '80s &mdash; a change accompanied by a visual shift from warm, grainy film to the cooler wobble of VHS &mdash; Cohn and Trump's scenes dwindle. By this point, Trump is rampaging through the real estate world, on a quest to go higher and higher. Meanwhile, out of sight, Cohn is dealing with his AIDS diagnosis. His absence throughout this portion of the film speaks louder than a hundred long-winded Trump speeches. Not only are we missing out on <em>The Apprentice</em>'s best performance, we're also missing the twisted friendship that makes it tick.</p><p>Without Cohn around as much, <em>The Apprentice </em>throws us into a stretch that might as well be summarized as "Trump's greatest hits from the '80s." This includes several moments that gesture at Trump's future in politics, including Trump taking in Ronald Reagan's campaign slogan, "Let's Make America Great Again." (Earlier footage of Richard Nixon saying "I'm not a crook" also points to Trump's own criminal activity.) Yet these nods to the future fall flat, playing like dull historical Easter eggs instead of knowing comedic beats.</p><p>The latter sections of <em>The Apprentice </em>also hit us over the head as much as possible with things we already know about Trump: his lies, his affairs, his willingness to shove others under the bus so he comes out on top. These elements are all deeply ingrained in the current political moment, and you would hope that in an election year, a Donald Trump biopic might have more to add beyond rehashing his worst qualities. (Although that may be a useful reminder for some voters.)</p><p><em>The Apprentice</em> almost transcends its rehashing of history thanks to Cohn and Trump's dynamic, which brings to the screen a genuinely fascinating relationship that may not currently be the most general knowledge. Sure, Trump is a showy figure, but it's his relationship with Cohn that makes for <em>The Apprentice</em>'s dark, oozing heart.</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/z3bdgE?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=The%20Apprentice%20was%20reviewed%20out%20of%20Fantastic%20Fest.%20It%20hits%20theaters%20Oct.%2011.&object_type=article&object_uuid=03ZVCBopxS13CO7wyTsW3On&short_url=z3bdgE&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>The Apprentice </em>was reviewed out of Fantastic Fest.

However, its aim is much broader, skewering global politics as a whole. More remarkable, this scorching satire from co-directors Evan Johnson, Galen Johnson, and Guy Maddin plays like the unholy and hilarious spawn of Luis Bu&ntilde;uel's <em>The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie </em>meets Sam Raimi's <em>Evil Dead 2</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Penned by Evan Johnson, <em>Rumours </em>wields an ensemble of international stars, including: Cate Blanchett, Charles Dance, Nikki Amuka-Bird, Rolando Ravello, Roy Dupuis, Denis M&eacute;nochet, Takehiro Hira, Alicia Vikander, and <em>Triangle of Sadness</em>' Zlatko Buri&#263;. Most of these actors appear as the leaders of Democratic nations, brought together for a summit about some crisis or another. The uncertain nature of the crisis is just one of the ways Johnson turns the knife in this cutting comedy, where the world's under attack by some mysterious force our leaders cannot begin to understand, much less ably confront.&nbsp;</p><h2>What's going on in <em>Rumours</em>?</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The G7 event held at a vast and elegant country estate is intended to be a peaceful space where seven world leaders can collaborate on a statement for the world to witness.

At first, the leaders can't locate another living soul &mdash;&nbsp;even to refresh the canap&eacute;s!

<p>Playing earnest Hilda Ortmann, the Chancellor of Germany and host of this summit, Blanchett welcomes not only the other leaders, but us &mdash; the unseen audience &mdash; into this event. Dropping the snarling intensity of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/tar-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>T&aacute;r</em></a> and the swagger cool of <em>Ocean</em>'<em>s 8, </em>Blanchett embraces a bouncy, conciliatory tone, which swiftly establishes her Hilda as a people-pleaser who will bend over backwards until she breaks.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps it's Hilda's own repressed emotions that draws her to the overwrought Maxime Laplace (a devastatingly dapper Dupuis), the heartbroken Prime Minister of Canada. While the crisply professional Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Cardosa Dewindt (Amuka-Bird), and the bloviating President of France, Sylvain Broulez (M&eacute;nochet), aim to crack into this supposedly important public statement, Maxime and Hilda wander off into a forest lit like a moody nightclub for some sexual sympathy under the haze of purple fog.&nbsp;</p><p>Sylvain's self-important gregariousness is well-paired with the smiling but often silent Tatsuro Iwasaki (Hira), the Prime Minister of Japan. But the most dazzling comedy duo here is Rolando Ravello as Antonio Lamorte, the clownish Prime Minister of Italy, and Charles Dance as Edison Wolcott, the President of the United States who speaks resolutely in a British accent. (A cheeky dialogue exchange addresses this detail without actually answering it. But truly, in a movie this devotedly ludicrous, if you're getting hung up on a curious accent, you're already lost.)&nbsp;</p><p>Together, these actors sharply navigate not only the uncertain terrain of <em>Rumour</em>'s rural setting, but also the cerebrally silly tone that infuses every bit of dialogue and action.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Rumours </em>relishes in buzz words and blathering.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>You know that very irksome thing where you ask someone a direct question &mdash;&nbsp;even a yes or no question! &mdash;&nbsp;and they devolve into a confounding collection of phrases and words that manage to add up to nothing? Though rampant in political debates, that's not an easy thing to write. And yet Johnson manages it infuriatingly well.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether massaging the language of a delicate topic or conceiving a plan of how to find help in a world swarming with resurrected, wanking cadavers, these laughable leaders talk in extraordinary circles. At first, when they are safely in the refined setting of china plates and posh meals, it's comedic yet low-key annoying to watch them talk around crisis &mdash;&nbsp;as if the word itself is a foreign concept because of their, power, wealth, and privilege. But as they come to realize their positions as world leaders mean nothing to the curious creatures of this freaky forest, a delicious schadenfreude sets in. Far from a slasher movie, where the audience might identify with the fleeing human prey, <em>Rumours </em>invites us to cackle at these politicians' peril, dehumanizing them through mocking portrayals just as political rhetoric too often does to the common person.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, if you're not much for subtext, there's also the pleasure of Johnson's twisted imagination, which unfurls nightmare creatures with curious kinks and confounding powers, leading to scenes of surreal spectacle and humorous violence. Undeniably, there's a thrill watching the absurd mayhem of <em>Rumours </em>play out, even if you're not sure what the hell is going on.&nbsp;</p><p>This surreally strange satire is a terrifically wild ride, fueled by the game performances from a charismatic cast and the deranged creatures into which they collide. Simply put, <em>Rumours </em>is a bonkers blast.</p><p><em>Rumours </em>was reviewed out of its North American Premiere at the 2024 Toronto International Film Festival.

<p>With <em>Saturday Night </em>(a nod to the the show's original title, <em>NBC's Saturday Night</em>), Reitman and screenwriter Gil Kenan (<em>Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire </em>co-writer/director) dug through the <em>Saturday Night Live </em>archives for anecdotes, fun facts, and Easter eggs to reimagine that first landmark night. Set over the course of the 90 minutes leading up to showtime, this film aims to capture the manic mayhem, creative conflicts, soul-crushing obstacles, and larger-than-life personalities that contributed to <em>Saturday Night Live</em>'s birth. And it fails.&nbsp;</p><p>Concentrating the massiveness of <em>SNL</em> into one film about its premiere is a boldly ambitious project.

One might admire the filmmaker's passion, but that's also the problem. Reitman, who spent a week as a guest writer on <em>Saturday Night Live</em> in 2008, is a devotee of the church of <em>SNL. </em>As such, <em>Saturday Night </em>is so stuffed with impressions and nostalgic callbacks that it's not much of a movie at all.</p><h2><em>Saturday Night </em>throws down a ticking clock that doesn't work.&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Beginning on the sidewalk in front of NBC's Manhattan studios, <em>Saturday Night </em>shows Lorne Michaels (<a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-fabelmans-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>The Fabelmans</u></em></a>' Gabriel LaBelle) fretting to an NBC page (<a href="https://mashable.com/category/stranger-things" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Stranger Things</u></em></a>' Finn Wolfhard), who is trying unsuccessfully to lure an audience into this free, live comedy show. From there, the film will follow Lorne almost constantly as he dips into the set still under construction, stressful meet-and-greets with network execs, literally explosive rehearsals, an intense control room, and a fateful dive bar, all before the metaphorical curtain rises on his show.&nbsp;</p><p>To enhance the tension, Reitman injects title cards that announce the time, counting down until the live show kicks off &mdash;&nbsp;or fails to launch entirely. But there's a prequel-like problem here in that we all know how this ends. Occasionally, this works as a visual gag, like when the camera cuts to the time just after a particularly anxiety-ridden moment as a mocking reminder. But as the film drags on with less story and more and more <em>SNL </em>fluff, this device turns on the viewer, reminding us how much of this movie we still have to sit through.</p><h2><em>Saturday Night </em>delivers a cavalcade of impressions.&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Podany as Crystal is so dead-on in pitch that the comedian is recognizable from voice alone. Rhys harnesses Carlin's wrath; Matula nails Curtin's crisp comedic timing. In his dual role, Braun capably shifts from the soft-voiced pleading of Henson to the high-pitched buffoonery of Kaufman doing his "thank you very much" shtick. The standout in this group, however, is Cory Michael Smith as Chevy Chase, and that's probably because he's the one who gets the closest thing to a character arc. Cocky, caustic, yet undeniably charismatic, Chase acts like he owns 30 Rock as soon as he enters frame. Smith owns the stride, smirk, and silliness that was Chase's signature. But sparks fly when he comes face-to-face with a bigger star with an even bigger ego.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Saturday Night</em> finds a great villain in J.K.

<p>Reitman and Kenan's script hinges on the conflict between the Golden Age of comedy versus the new revolutionaries. As such, Lorne faces off against snarling NBC executive David Tebet (Willem Dafoe), and takes a call from a derisive Johnny Carson (an uncredited role that's also the worst impersonation in the film). But most menacing of all is Berle, a well-established comedian who has his own variety show on NBC, which the movie regards as flashy hackery.</p><p>Berle prowls Lorne's studio like a predator searching for easy prey, riling the talent and brazenly hitting on Chevy's fianc&eacute;e, Jacqueline Carlin (Kaia Gerber). This leads to the film's most exciting exchange, where two equal forces of braggadocio face off with a battle of wits that is absolutely crass and cunning. Incredibly, it's Berle who gets the movie's best punchline, involving a bit of wordplay about a choice "comeback" and Chevy's mom. Perhaps that wasn't what Reitman intended, and Simmons just delivered the hell out of that line. Perhaps this moment &mdash; which leaves even Chevy Chase speechless &mdash;&nbsp;is meant to reflect the uphill battle <em>SNL </em>had ahead of them. Regardless, it's bizarre when a non-<em>SNL</em> figure gets the biggest laugh in your <em>SNL </em>movie.</p><h2>Rachel Sennott shines, despite an underwritten role.</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Sennott, who has awed critics and audiences in such heralded comedies as <a href="https://theplaylist.net/shiva-baby-review-20200325/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Shiva Baby</u></em></a><em>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/bodies-bodies-bodies-movie-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Bodies Bodies Bodies</u></a></em><em>, </em>and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/bottoms-movie-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Bottoms</u></em></a>, unsurprisingly delivers one of the best performances in <em>Saturday Night</em>, despite her part being horrifically written.&nbsp;</p><p>Sennott plays Rosie Shuster, an Emmy&ndash;winning comedy writer whose stint on <em>Saturday Night Live</em> ran from 1975 to 1988; she had a hand in bringing together the cast that would be in the show's first season, as well as many now-classic characters and sketches. She was also married to Lorne Michael from 1967 to 1980, and <em>Saturday Night </em>is much more focused on this latter bit. It's not just that Reitman and Kenan's script treats her like Lorne's sidekick, someone who can dole out advice or a pep talk with equal readiness. It's that the longest bit of dialogue she's given in this movie is doggedly explaining exactly who she is to Lorne, detailing their courtship, relationship, and sex life to Dan Aykroyd in a tedious walk-and-talk.</p><p>Reitman overloads the film with such cinematic devices. Far from bringing the excitement or tension of <em>The West Wing</em> to <em>Saturday Night</em>, repeated walk-and-talks reveal little new information visually and make overlong sequences impossible to cut down. A perfect example of Reitman's reliance on this technique is a drug trip experienced by a tertiary character who winds about in mounting panic; it's a detour that tries our patience with no escape. This is true of much of <em>Saturday Night, </em>which is overloaded with tidbits that are potentially fun or nostalgic, but with so little cohesion that this love letter feels more like a rant.&nbsp; It's left to the talented ensemble cast to keep things together, narratively speaking. While Sennott is beguiling with her trademark crooked grin and skill for biting banter, the role of Rosie is regressive, existing chiefly to inform the audience about Lorne.&nbsp;</p><p>This is especially dismaying when you look back at Reitman's filmography. <em>Juno, Young Adult, </em>and<em> Tully </em>all had complex female characters who were funny and fleshed out! Notably, Reitman directed but didn't write any of those movies; <a href="https://mashable.com/video/diablo-cody-zelda-williams-lisa-frankenstein-newlywed-game" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Diablo Cody</u></a> wrote them. Without her, it seems Reitman loses track of women's autonomy. But here, he loses track of much, much more.</p><h2><em>Saturday Night </em>fails to thrill or be all that funny.&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>In writing the script, Reitman and Kenan made some liberal changes from the facts of the matter. They include sketches and behind-the-scenes anecdotes that weren't a part of that first episode, and even cut an entire cast member from the story because his presence would have put the lie to their generational conflict. (Sorry to George Coe!) Such changes could be excused as poetic license in pursuit of good storytelling &mdash; if it actually added up to good storytelling.</p><p>Like <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, this movie is a frenzied collection of scenes. Some work, but many don't, primarily because of how this script chips away at others in service of Lorne. While weaving around sets and silliness, <em>Saturday Night</em> above all else paints Lorne Michaels as a creative genius. His main flaw is that he can't communicate his vision to basically anyone, which creates a domino effect of fighting, screaming, and violence. But far from recognizing these as consequences of Lorne's mercurial leadership, <em>Saturday Night </em>is infuriatingly conventional, excusing the shitty behavior of a famous man because he makes something that is popular.</p><p>The film treats Lorne as an underdog, put upon by powerful forces that refuse to acknowledge his (yet to be remotely proven) greatness. It's a tiresome, thin argument as it ever was. And in holding him up, <em>Saturday Night </em>reduces the female characters around Lorne to hasty sketches of the women they represent. The<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/jane-curtin-snl-sexism-infamous-ignorant-slut-line-1219343/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u> well-documented, damaging sexism</u></a> on that set is addressed only by a tongue-in-cheek rehearsal of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMX-KxrhuKQ" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>famous sketch</u></a>, where the female players turn the male gaze on a womanizing Aykroyd,&nbsp;to the amusement of the crew. Essentially, the actual sexism of early <em>SNL</em> is laughed off.&nbsp;</p><p>It's not that any movie could be expected to capture the complexity of early <em>Saturday Night Live</em>. But in capturing that first night, Reitman reduces Gilda Radner to a smile, Jane Curtin to a smirk, Laraine Newman (Emily Fairn) to a running gag about quick changes, and Rosie Shuster to a sidekick.</p><p>Further confounding, Reitman spends a gratuitous amount of time building the film's finale, literally brick by brick in a tedious metaphor. Then, he fumbles the turning point that brings this motley crew of chaotic individuals together into an ensemble. What saves the day is not a group scene. It's not a collaboration. It's the re-creation of a solo bit that's not even from an <em>SNL </em>cast member.</p><p>In the end, <em>Saturday Night </em>is not an ode to <em>Saturday Night Live</em>. It's a fawning portrait of the men of <em>Saturday Night</em> <em>Live</em>, who are granted punchlines, complexity, and character arcs, while their female counterparts are left with scraps. Longtime lovers of the show may find reason enough to soldier through Reitman's aggravating fanboying over Lorne and the guys. But assembling such a promising cast, looking back on such a pivotal moment in American entertainment, and offering this? It's a punchline that doesn't land.&nbsp;</p><p class="mx-auto">

But despite bringing together two of the hottest young actors currently working, Crowley&rsquo;s movie is astonishingly middling, set apart from forgettable fare only by a time-skipping device that feels inexplicable at best and frustrating at worst.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>We Live in Time</em>'s plotting gimmick does not work.&nbsp;</h2><p><em>We Live in Time</em> begins with a couple already so well established that they have a cozy morning routine.

<p>Despite the flashes back and forward, their story is straightforward, the stuff of weepy beach reads. They fall in love while she is building her first restaurant, and he is dealing with the end of his first marriage. They nearly break up realizing they have different expectations around children. But they will overcome these issues, as they will her first battle with cancer and its brutal chemo treatments. The main plot of the film takes place once they&rsquo;ve had their daughter and are faced with the recurrence of the cancer, more aggressive than before. The question becomes, will Almut endure another round of body-wilting chemo that may not even save her life? Or will she reject treatment to make the most of the time she has left?</p><p>The second cancer battle alone could have made an interesting movie. But because this screenplay aims to loop back-and-forth to show the breadth of their entire relationship,<em>We Live in Time</em> feels more like postcards of a relationship than a portrait that is fleshed out or remotely captivating. There&rsquo;s so little sense of cohesion from sequence to sequence, it&rsquo;s hard to get emotionally invested in these characters, even if you&rsquo;re someone who has been a fan of the actors, as I am.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Florence Pugh shines. Andrew Garfield is stranded.&nbsp;</h2><p>This is the kind of role that seems perfect for Florence Pugh, as it is a woman who is dealing with conflicting emotions that demand she smile and frown with equal passion. Almut loves her husband and her child, but also wants to be more than just &ldquo;someone&rsquo;s dying mum.&rdquo; So when an opportunity to compete in a high-level cooking competition arises, she can&rsquo;t bring herself to turn it down, even if it means pushing her body to its limits and spending less time at home.&nbsp;</p><p>Again, <em>this </em>could&rsquo;ve made a compelling story on its own. But <em>We Live in Time </em>aims to create some sort of balance by also following Tobias, who has much less to do. Where Almut is established as having desires outside of her marriage, her husband exists solely to mope when she disappoints him.<a href="https://mashable.com/article/kenergy-quotes-ryan-gosling-barbie-movie" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u> He&rsquo;s just Ken</u></a>, an accessory to hang on her like an anchor. Which is wild because Tobias&rsquo;s arguments in the film &mdash; for honesty in their marriage and for attempting a new round of chemo &mdash; are valid, yet undermined by a plotting that treats him as a clingy obstacle to Almut&rsquo;s professional dreams.&nbsp;</p><p>While Garfield delivers a soulful performance with big watery eyes, the scattered structure of the film gives him little to build on. Tobias is so thinly realized that the audience is left to fill in the gaps, perhaps with prior appreciation for Garfield or a general affection for Nicholas Sparks&ndash;style romances where the besotted lovers are doomed to be separated by death. In either case, the film on its own is frustratingly fractured.&nbsp;</p><h2>Crowley fails to elevate a lackluster script.&nbsp;</h2><p>To be clear, <em>We Live in Time</em> is not the worst movie of the year. That&rsquo;d be the repulsive and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-crow-2024-movie-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>abysmal relaunch of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-crow-2024-movie-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>The Crow</em></a></u></a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-crow-2024-movie-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>.</u></a> It&rsquo;s not the biggest bomb of the year, which looks to be Eli Roth&rsquo;s messy adaptation of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/borderlands-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Borderlands</u></em></a><em>.</em> It&rsquo;s not even a movie arguably enhanced by some sort of scandal, like Pugh&rsquo;s <a href="https://mashable.com/article/dont-worry-darling-drama-harry-styles-spit" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Don&rsquo;t Worry Darling</u></em></a> or 2024&rsquo;s other recent weepy <a href="https://mashable.com/article/it-ends-with-us-drama-fued-blake-lively-justin-baldoni-explained" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>It Ends With Us</u></em></a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/it-ends-with-us-drama-fued-blake-lively-justin-baldoni-explained" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>.</u></a> In fact, <em>We Live in Time</em> will likely be bolstered by the incredible chemistry its stars are sharing on red carpets and cheeky promotional interviews. But on its own, this movie is far less than the sum of its parts.&nbsp;</p><p>The cancer story could have been enough to sustain it. Perhaps with flashbacks to bolster our understanding not only of this couples' love but also the hardships they&rsquo;ve traversed before. It could have been a delicately balanced story from both perspectives, exploring how sometimes even the choice of life or death is achingly complicated. But Crowley&rsquo;s execution of Nick Payne&rsquo;s woe-infested scribblings of a screenplay manages neither. The time jumps feel like artless novelty, attempting to distract from how threadbare this story actually is &mdash;&nbsp;particularly Almut&rsquo;s first round of cancer, which makes up three short scenes.</p><p>While Pugh and Garfield give their all to Almut and Tobias, the chaotic smattering of scenes provides no build in emotional tension. In fact, jumping from the couple already together to not having met undercuts scenes of nervous flirtation with inevitability. It&rsquo;s like for everything that might work in this film, there&rsquo;s something else that works against it. Sequences like their first conversation in a hospital hallway and a birth sequence wildly alive with energy offer moments of hope that Crowley and company will cut their way through the messy plot device of time-skipping to hook into something unshakably profound.&nbsp;</p><p>But in the end, <em>We Live in Time </em>is profoundly mediocre, lacking the verve, sexiness, and raw human emotion we&rsquo;ve come to expect from Pugh and Garfield.&nbsp;</p><p class="mx-auto">

<p>Glossing over the low points of Williams' journey earned the film mixed reviews out of its debut at Telluride Film Festival. But the more I mulled over what this movie does offer, the more I was won over by its playful, glossy approach.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Piece By Piece </em>turns America's biggest hip-hop stars into minifigs.&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>To find the arc of Williams' story, Neville interviewed the multi-hyphenate star, his wife Helen Lasichanh, and a dazzling array of collaborators and colleagues, including Snoop Dogg, Missy Elliott, Jay-Z, The Neptunes' Chad Hugo, Gwen Stefani, and many more. In an interview with Mashable, Williams revealed many of these interviewees had no idea their contribution would be filtered through a Lego lens, and only discovered they'd been transformed into minifigs when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDlnwQCkiSA" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>the first trailer hit.&nbsp;</u></a></p><p>Neville's visual translation of these interviews includes amusing flourishes, like turning Snoop Dog into a Lego Doberman, and making metaphors about bakeries literal, with Lego Pharrell selling sweet treats the way he sold hit beats. In one instance, the idea of blowing one's mind with a sick bit of music is illustrated by having a smiling minifig&rsquo;s head pop right off its base in amazement. These choices bring a playfulness into the film that not only is sure to delight fans of <em>The Lego Movie </em>and <em>The Lego Batman Movie</em>, but also reflects the tone of Williams' hits, like "Happy" and "Get Lucky."&nbsp;</p><p>More than this however, by turning himself into a plaything, <em>Piece By Piece </em>gives Williams a creative distance to reflect on his own life as if it is one of his many media projects. Through warm narration, he opens up about his childhood in the Atlantis Apartments in Virginia Beach, Virginia. The colorful blocks not only reconstruct his humble home but also a more fantastical version of Atlantis, where an Afro-wearing baby Pharrell swims about with a giant goldfish as Poseidon looks on. This charming spectacle showcases Pharrell's imagination manifesting big, surreal scenarios, which becomes a recurring theme &mdash;&nbsp;down to dreaming up a Lego music biopic.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Piece By Piece </em>is a <em>Little Engine That Could</em> tale that kids will relish.</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>After this whimsical dip into brick-made oceans, Williams admits he was considered an oddball by others, confessing, "It broke my spirit." But weird kids out there (or the weird adults they became) might find solace as little Pharrell finds his crew, each of whom also revels in making music. From there, <em>Piece By Piece </em>becomes a story of succeeding by staying true to yourself and putting in the work to build your dream, brick by brick. Along the way, Neville laces various hits that Pharrell has contributed to, from "Hot in Herre" and "Shake Ya Ass" to "Hollaback Girl" and "Blurred Lines." (Parents, don't fret. Some of the racier lyrics have been delicately plucked out.)&nbsp;</p><p>While it's initially fun to indulge in the nostalgia as Neville recreates iconic music videos with minifigs, this device begins to get old as the story of his rise makes for a lot of name- and track-dropping. Pardon the pun, but things get a bit one-note. Then when it comes to a low point &mdash;&nbsp;a necessity for any biopic or story for that matter &mdash;&nbsp;Williams pulls back.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Piece By Piece</em> can't commit to its big swing.&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Rosy memories of childhood troubles is one thing, but sharing why his career took a dip is a Lego bridge too far. Instead of probing questions, Neville paves a path with platitudes about how his subject's greatest weakness is he has too many ideas. Colleagues speak vaguely about some business missteps or shameless yes-men who gave Williams bad advice, and these unnamed negative influences are imagined as a trio of gray-skinned ghouls wearing smiles and business suits.&nbsp;</p><p>Here the film suffers. Even with the mask of the minifig, Williams can't let his audience into the dark moments. (On the other hand, this is where <a href="https://mashable.com/article/better-man-review-robbie-williams" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Better Man</u></em></a> positively thrives.) Swiftly, Williams has reconnected with his pure inspiration, and the third act becomes a rousing celebration of song, dance, and Lego bits humorous and heartfelt. But this fumbled beat undercuts the movie's message. Being true to yourself isn't a one-time battle; it's ongoing. But with a community &mdash;&nbsp;like the minifig friends and family in <em>Piece By Piece</em> &mdash;&nbsp;one might get their block knocked off and still rebuild.&nbsp;</p><p>Even with help from an on-screen avatar, can Williams not admit the ugly truths of his own story? Or did he and Neville fear self-doubt in anything but the briefest mention might bring down the joy of their movie? To that, I'd point to the other Lego movies, where the Lego universe and Lego Gotham are brought to the brink of utter destruction without us losing faith in their minifig heroes. Heck, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/lego-movie-2-the-second-part-movie-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part</u></em></a><em> </em>even made the dark side of its happy hero the minifig villain!&nbsp;</p><p>This wobble aside, <em>Piece By Piece </em>is a winsome reinvention of the music biopic. Animation is enthusiastically employed to bring the audience into the experience of being Pharrell Williams. The colorful blocks not only allow the construction of musical beats to become a physical act rather than an abstract idea, but also give a <em>Ratatouille-</em>like understanding of how this art form affects its hero. His synesthesia is showcased in waves of color as the beat bounces.&nbsp;</p><p>While this colorful concept means <em>Piece By Piece </em>can be a hit with kids, it's easy to wish the movie dared to delve a bit more into the problems of being a grown-up. But all in all, <em>Piece By Piece </em>is a delight that could well have audiences dancing in the aisles.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/aXd7DO?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Piece%20By%20Piece%20is%20now%20playing%20in%20theaters.&object_type=article&object_uuid=05CiYKZQBNgWR1QnQltQ1kH&short_url=aXd7DO&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Piece By Piece</em> is now playing in theaters.</a></p><p class="mx-auto">

Speakers, headphones, and earbuds from just about every brand were reduced to low prices. But even though Prime Day is over, you can still snag a great new speaker at a low price. There are still some incredible audio-related sales lingering at Amazon, including a big discount on the beloved <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJVrJq?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Beats%20Pill&object_type=article&object_uuid=014nvx3QW7blfBUTAvPh0jn&short_url=zJVrJq&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Beats Pill</a>.</p><p>Recently upgraded, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJVrJq?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Beats%20Pill&object_type=article&object_uuid=014nvx3QW7blfBUTAvPh0jn&short_url=zJVrJq&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Beats Pill</a> is the same speaker we've loved for years, but better. It may appear petite and dainty, but it's robust. It packs a serious audio punch, with the new, bigger, bespoke racetrack woofer displacing 90% more air volume, meaning you get a much deeper, fuller bass. Not to mention, it even has IP67 water resistance so it's safe from accidental splashes.</p><p>For portable listening, the new 24-hour battery life will keep you going all day long, and can even be used to charge your phone or other devices through a USC cable.</p><p>As of Oct. 11, the Beats Pill is reduced to $99.99 (down from $149.95), saving you almost $50 on list price. This is the <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0D4SX9RC6" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">lowest it has ever been priced at Amazon</a>, so you know it's a great deal. This price is available in all the colors offered by Amazon: Matte Black, Champagne Gold, and Statement Red, but without the power adapter or <a href="https://mashable.com/article/applecare-plus-apple-improvements" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">AppleCare+</a>.</p><p>But you'll need to be quick, as Amazon has listed this as a limited-time deal.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The first round sees you trying to guess the word, with correct, misplaced, and incorrect letters shown in each guess. If you guess the correct answer, it'll take you to the next hurdle, providing the answer to the last hurdle as your first guess. This can give you several clues or none, depending on the words. For the final hurdle, every correct answer from previous hurdles is shown, with correct and misplaced letters clearly shown.</p><p>An important note is that the number of times a letter is highlighted from previous guesses does necessarily indicate the number of times that letter appears in the final hurdle. </p><p>If you find yourself stuck at any step of today's Hurdle, don't worry! We have you covered.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

Words can be made from linked letters &mdash; up, down, left, right, or diagonal, but words can also change direction, resulting in quirky shapes and patterns. Every single letter in the grid will be part of an answer. There's always a theme linking every solution, along with the "spangram," a special, word or phrase that sums up that day's theme, and spans the entire grid horizontally or vertically.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>By providing an opaque hint and not providing the word list, Strands creates a brain-teasing game that takes a little longer to play than its other games, like <a href="https://mashable.com/category/wordle" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Wordle</a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/category/connections" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Connections</a>.</p><p>If you're feeling stuck or just don't have 10 or more minutes to figure out today's puzzle, we've got all the NYT Strands hints for today's puzzle you need to progress at your preferred pace.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

Speaking on an earnings call at the time, Musk stated that the delay was so that Tesla could "improve the Robotaxi, as well as add in a couple other things for the product unveil."</p><p>Said "other things" have turned out to be the latest look at Tesla's humanoid robot Optimus, as well as the surprise unveiling of an automated van called the Robovan (pronounced by Musk as "Robo-ven" for reasons unknown).</p><h2>Musk reveals the Robovan, Tesla's autonomous van</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>While the Cybercab was the expected star of Thursday night's event, the unexpected reveal of the box-like Robovan received its fair share of attention as well. Allegedly capable of carrying up to 20 people or transporting goods, Musk claimed that the apparently fully autonomous vehicle had the potential to reduce travel costs to five or ten cents per mile.</p><p>"What happens if you need a vehicle that is bigger than a Model Y?" said Musk, introducing the Robovan as it rounded a corner to let several passengers emerge from its sliding door. "We're going to make this, and it's gonna look like that."</p><p>"That" is a bulky white vehicle with practically no clearance between it and the road, and no windscreen either. Instead, strip windows run across the edges of the Robovan's roof down to its nose and rear, following its left and right edges, with two more placed on the sides.&nbsp;</p><p>Comparing the design philosophy behind the Robovan to that of the Cybertruck, Musk stated that Tesla aims to "change the look of the roads, and that "the future should look like the future."

<p>Fortunately, the Robovan at least doesn't look like an extremely low-poly rendering of <a href="https://mashable.com/video/halo-trailer-season-2" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Halo</em></a>'s Warthog, which is for the best if Tesla hopes that anyone but diehard Musk stans will want to ride in it.</p><p>"The Robovan is what's gonna solve for high density," said Musk.</p><p>Screens inside the Robovan where the windscreens would typically be located appear to show the vehicle's surroundings, as rows of white chairs face each other rather than in the direction the van is travelling. While the lack of steering wheel or controls is no doubt a deliberate exclusion, the Robovan also doesn't appear to have any seat belts. Hopefully this is simply because the vehicle is still under development.&nbsp;</p><h2>Tesla provides an update on the Optimus robot</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Tesla's vehicles weren't the only products shown off at this event. Musk ended his presentation by showing off <a href="https://mashable.com/article/tesla-elon-musk-robot-unveiled" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Tesla's humanoid Optimus robots</a>, having a procession of them shuffle in. The billionaire stated that Optimus has "progressed dramatically year after year" since Tesla first revealed the concept in 2021, when it was <a href="https://mashable.com/article/tesla-bot-humanoid-ai-day" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">infamously illustrated by a person wearing a robot suit</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"It'll be [able to] do anything you want," said Musk, sharing his dreams for Optimus' capabilities. "It can be a teacher, babysit your kids, it can walk your dog, mow your lawn, get the groceries. Just be your friend, serve drinks. Whatever you can think of, it will do."</p><p>Such functionality is likely still a while away, judging by the tentative approach Optimus appeared to take when merely walking. Though at least that gives you plenty of time to save up if you do want an Optimus of your own.</p><p>Upping his 2022 Optimus pricing estimate of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/tesla-elon-musk-robot-unveiled" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">"probably less than $20,000,"</a> Musk predicted that these robots will set you back $20-30,000. However, this prediction came with the caveat that such pricing would only eventually be reached in the long term, once the Optimus is produced "at scale." As such, we can infer that Optimus' launch price is likely to be notably higher.</p><p>Considering this predicted pricing, Musk's assertion that a personal Optimus robot could be "something that anyone could own" seems fairly far off. Though Musk declared that Optimus would cost "less than a car," it's still a pretty penny to shell out. <a href="https://carbuzz.com/why-covid-19-markups-will-continue-to-haunt-buyers-for-years/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Car prices skyrocketed amidst the COVID-19 pandemic</a>, with the average price of a new car in the U.S. now at <a href="https://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/july-2024-atp-report/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">over $48,000</a>.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

It will be an age of abundance, the likes of which almost no one has envisioned," said Musk, sounding an awful lot like a <a href="https://mashable.com/video/jon-stewart-elon-musk-trump-rally" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">presidential candidate he's been hanging out with lately</a>.</p><p>Musk ended the We, Robot presentation by directing the audience to observe a group of Optimus robots doing the robot in a gazebo, and declaring that more would be serving drinks at the bar.

<p>While Musk's claims of fully autonomous cars and vans may sound exciting, it's prudent to approach such technology with caution and scepticism before entrusting it with your well-being.

It doesn't have a steering wheel, or pedals. It's got two butterfly wing doors, letting the passengers in &mdash; and only the passengers, as the car does not need a driver. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

    </div>
<p>According to Musk, "you could fall asleep, and wake up at your destination."</p><p>Inside, there's a large display similar to those in today's Tesla cars, and the whole idea is for the car to be like a nice little lounge in which you chill while the car does its thing. </p><p>The Cybercab also doesn't have a charging plug; it will use wireless induction charging instead. Battery capacity, charging speed and other details weren't mentioned during Tesla's presentation.  </p><p>As for the problems the Cybercab is meant to solve, Musk says traffic as it is today is slow, unsustainable, too expensive, and not safe enough. If most or all those cars on the streets were autonomous, "driving" would allegedly be ten times safer, cars would be cheaper, and they could actually make money for their owners while they sleep, by ferrying other passengers around, (robo)taxi-style. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-6v6dbxPlsXs"></div>
</div>


<p>The price for all this goodness if you were to buy one? About $30,000, said Musk. </p><p>We sort of knew most of this, as Musk has been talking about this as one of Tesla's primary goals (a fleet of robotaxis) for years. And given Tesla's (sometimes painfully slow) progress on its Full Self-Driving package, we know Tesla is trying hard to solve the autonomous driving problem. So the big question here is: When can we expect to see Cybercabs on the streets?</p><p>The answer is quite murky. According to Musk, Tesla plans to start fully autonomous, unsupervised FSD in Texas and California in 2025, with the Model 3 and the Model Y. Cybercab production should start in 2026, Musk said, but then immediately added that he tends to be "a little optimistic with time frames" and changed that timeframe to "before 2027." And all of this unsupervised, autonomous driving business needs to be approved by regulators before it can happen, both in the U.S. and abroad. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

        </a>
    </div>
<p>If you read the fine print, that means not much has changed for Tesla: The company still plans to launch autonomous driving on existing cars first via its FSD package. The problem is that Musk has been talking about this for nearly a decade, and while FSD is in parts impressive, it's not yet ready to be unleashed into the world as a fully autonomous, unsupervised driving package. It all boils down to whether Tesla can make this happen, how long will it take, and when regulators will put their stamp of approval on the whole idea. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Is it different in Australia?</h2><p>Prime Day is an annual online sales event, like <a href="https://mashable.com/au/deals/black-friday-deals-australia-2023" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Black Friday</u></a> or Click Frenzy, but exclusive to Amazon Prime customers. It started as a one-day event in the US in 2015, but has since expanded to a five-day event that takes place across the globe, including Australia.</p><p>The first Prime Day Down Under happened in 2018, and has grown every year since. Australia is unique in that it gets one of the longest Prime "Days" in the world &ndash; this year's event goes for a whopping five days, and because of our time zone, for us it&rsquo;s 5 and a half. This is because Australian users get access to deals on both <a href="https://zdcs.link/3dn7M?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Amazon.com.au&object_type=article&object_uuid=046wbEhx08SmysCS4Ad7HHM&short_url=3dn7M&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Amazon.com.au</u></a> and the<a href="https://zdcs.link/GdEMJ?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Amazon%20Global%20Store&object_type=article&object_uuid=046wbEhx08SmysCS4Ad7HHM&short_url=GdEMJ&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u> Amazon Global Store</u></a> until the conclusion of the event in the US.</p><p>Additionally, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/dlRy2?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Shop%20Local%20Businesses&object_type=article&object_uuid=046wbEhx08SmysCS4Ad7HHM&short_url=dlRy2&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Shop Local Businesses</u></a> store highlights a number of small Australian businesses that are also partaking in the Prime Day fun.</p><h2>What will be on sale this Prime Day?</h2><p>While it can be difficult to predict specific products that go on sale, Amazon has promised over 100,000 deals in Australia from big brands, small local brands, and everything in-between. The brands that Amazon has confirmed will be a part of Prime Day include Apple, Samsung, Lenovo, Bose, and more &ndash; a pretty hefty list!</p><p>Expect deals across all categories, including tech, such as TVs, Smart Home, Headphones, Gaming, as well as homeware, sports, fashion, beauty and more.</p><h2>How to find the best deals during Prime Day in Australia</h2><p>Amazon is often the cheapest place to find a particular product in Australia, but the really good deals can sometimes be a bit elusive. Of course, our list above features some of the very best tech deals available during Prime Day. However, you can also properly prepare for the event to make sure you truly get the most out of it.</p><p>Before Prime Day kicks off, you should put together a shopping list of items that you are after, then 'wishlist' those products on Amazon and set deal alerts on the Amazon app. This will ensure you don't miss top deals on products that you especially want.</p><p>Ensure you are subscribed to Amazon Prime, or else you won't be able to secure the products for the Prime Day deal price. A subscription costs A$6.99 per month, but there is a 30-day free trial available if you are just looking to take part in Prime Day and nothing else.</p><p>It is also worth spending a bit of time on Amazon and familiarising yourself with its interface and how it works. This can save you time and hassle when the deals start dropping (many of which are only available for a limited time).</p><h2>How to shop on Amazon Prime Day</h2><p>Of course, we'll be keeping track of all the best Prime Day deals we spot in the lists above.

While it resembles many modern third-culture stories &mdash; specifically, tales of disconnect between first-generation South Asians in the West and their immigrant parents &mdash; it widens its scope in surprising ways that reflect and refract both personal and cinematic identity.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Taking inspiration from a romantic Bollywood classic, the film follows a gay Indian American doctor whose parents are nominally accepting, but who want him to find "a nice Indian boy." Long story short: He does! The immediate wrinkle, however, is that this nice Indian boy is none other than <a href="https://mashable.com/video/jonathan-groff-voice-memo-kristoff" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Jonathan Groff</a> &mdash; yes, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/hamilton-sing-along-disney" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Hamilton</em></a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/hamilton-sing-along-disney" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">'s original King George</a> &mdash; playing a white man raised by Indian parents.&nbsp;</p><p>On one hand, <em>A Nice Indian Boy</em> is the tale of a typical Indian American family, with typical Indian American problems &mdash; a generational disconnect, gendered double standards, and a culture of awkward silence around sexuality &mdash; but on the other hand, its evolution into grand romantic saga is anything but typical. It's also a story of cross-cultural <a href="https://mashable.com/article/broker-return-to-seoul-adoption" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">adoption</a> that dovetails into not only a hilariously awkward meet-the-parents comedy, but also a film about freeing oneself from emotional and generational baggage, in a way that yields tears of joy and laughter.</p><h2>What is A Nice Indian Boy about?</h2><p>Dr. Naveen Gavaskar (<a href="https://mashable.com/video/deadpool-and-wolverine-full-trailer-super-bowl" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Deadpool</em></a><a href="https://mashable.com/video/deadpool-and-wolverine-full-trailer-super-bowl" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">'s Karan Soni</a>) is the kind of realistic queer protagonist seldom seen in Hollywood: an introverted gay man who'd rather be at home than at the club &mdash; or in the case of the movie's opening scene, at his sister's colorful wedding reception. As the guests dance to thumping tunes, and the camera tilts and spins to capture them, Naveen sits still, fending off over-enthusiastic family members whose words of marital encouragement sound more like a dire warning: "You're next!"</p><p>What Naveen's nosy aunties and uncles don't know, and what his parents begrudgingly accept, is that his wedding won't quite look like a Hindi movie, since he happens to be into guys.</p><p>Six years go by &mdash; notably, the amount of time between Sethi coming out and the film's premiere &mdash; and Naveen's life away from his parents is somewhat content, even though it involves lonely nights of leaving exes and crushes some uncomfortably awkward voice messages. He has absolutely no game, despite the efforts of his outgoing gay colleague Paul (Peter S. Kim) to bring him out of his shell. But the gods eventually smile on him when he comes across an attractive white photographer, Jay Kurundkar (Groff), at his local <em>mandir</em> (or temple) while praying to a statue of Ganesh, the elephant-headed Hindu god of wisdom and good luck.</p><p>Two things immediately stand out about Jay: his tranquil charm, and his authentic pronunciation of "Ganesh" &mdash; with an extended "e" as in "lace," rather than the protracted "e" of words like "less," to which most Westerners default. Naveen is immediately flustered by Jay's confident stares, but agrees to accompany him on a date to his favorite movie, which, to the good doctor's surprise, turns out to be <em>Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge</em> (or <em>DDLJ</em>), the iconic 1995 Bollywood romance about two star-crossed Indian Londoners, whose musical centerpiece features superstar Shah Rukh Khan serenading actress Kajol in a field of yellow mustard flowers.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

            Netflix's 'The Romantics': A nostalgic and impassioned tribute to Hindi cinema
            <svg class="inline-block ml-1 w-4 h-4 font-normal fill-current"><use href="https://mashable.com/images/icons/spritemap.svg#sprite-arrow-right-thin"></use></svg>

    </div>
<p>But instead of being bowled over by this gesture, Naveen finds himself unable to fully embrace the film or Jay's off-key crooning of its famous track, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNV5hLSa9H8" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Tujhe Dekha To</u></a>" (yes, Groff sings it himself, with barely a syllable out of place). Sincerity and vulnerability remain obstacles to Naveen, even after he and Jay start dating. This proves mildly problematic when meeting each other's friends, but it's downright disastrous when the question of Jay meeting Naveen's parents arises, given how little he's told them about his white, freelance photographer boyfriend who vapes and waxes poetic about Hindi cinema.</p><p>The results are as side-splitting as they are disheartening, because the one lesson <em>A Nice Indian Boy</em> takes from <em>DDLJ</em> is that Indian romantic films are family dramas too. However, what initially seems hopeless ends up an exciting challenge, because Jay has <em>also</em> internalized this lesson. And, like Shah Rukh Khan's brash Raj Malhotra, he'll stop at nothing to win over the parents of the person he loves.</p><h2>A Nice Indian Boy is also a family drama.</h2><p>The film, written by Eric Randall, is based on the play by Madhuri Shekar, and it has the structure of a five-act play, with each section broken up by significant time jumps. This ends up serving a dual purpose. On one hand, this shifts the typical feel-good rom-com climax to the middle of the story, away from its usual place in most three-act Hollywood screenplays, where it serves as a resolution. In the process, <em>A Nice Indian Boy</em> allows for the realities of long-term romance and wedding planning to creep in through the corners of the frame, beyond the broad declarations of love.</p><p>On the other hand, it also allows each member of Naveen's family to have their own dedicated section of the movie, during which they become a primary character. Like Naveen, his sister Arundhathi (Sunita Mani) harbors a grudge against their parents for the choices she did and didn't have while growing up, including in matters of love, and she sees their increased leeway with Naveen as a matter of grave injustice. Meanwhile, their outspoken mother Megha (Zarna Garg) tries to smooth things over with both children, but since she's just as hot-headed as her daughter, it's easier said than done. In terms of temperament, Naveen takes after his father Archit (Harish Patel), though his silent acceptance of Naveen's sexuality &mdash; while avoiding eye contact at all cost &mdash; hurts more than outright disapproval. Like his son, Archit has a problem with expressing himself honestly.</p><p>However, Megha and Archit's genuine attempts to bridge the gap between themselves and Naveen also leads to some uproarious overcompensation, between the topics they bring up in Jay's presence without any filter whatsoever, to their sincere attempts to educate themselves by binging raunchy reality shows on OutTV and bringing them up in conversation. It's incredibly funny <em>and</em> incredibly sweet, but none of these superficial gestures &mdash; no matter how well-meaning &mdash; are a substitute for the real emotional work the Gavaskar family needs.</p><p>The film doesn't let Naveen off the hook either, whether it comes to his avoidance of intimacy or the walls he keeps up between him and his family members. Those walls only start to come down after some rigorous and difficult dramatic moments, which Sethi directs with incredible command.</p><h2>A Nice Indian Boy is brilliantly directed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>The film's premise resembles a number of third-culture films and shows featuring South Asians in the West, like <a href="https://mashable.com/article/cry-of-the-week-the-big-sick" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>The Big Sick</em></a><em>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ms-marvel-disney-plus-premiere-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Ms. Marvel</a></em>, and <em>Blinded by the Light</em>. These stories of artistically driven first-gen kids and their immigrant parents who "just don't understand" have settled into a rote rhythm in recent years. A fellow SXSW selection, the lukewarm<a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/the-queen-of-my-dreams-review-1235936138/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"> <em><u>The Queen of My Dreams</u></em></a>, is a key example: a similarly Bollywood-inspired tale of a queer Pakistani Canadian who nominally reconciles with her conservative mother. It's rarely a good sign when you can map out the beats of a story based on its cultural premise, but <em>A Nice Indian Boy</em> finds numerous visual and thematic ways to buck that trend.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>It stands out, first and foremost, through its bustling visual energy, which not only captures the chaos and excitement constantly unfolding around Naveen &mdash; at weddings, family meetings, or parties hosted by Jay's outgoing friends &mdash; but also serves to magnify his glum stillness as the camera pushes in and pulls out prominently during both comedy beats and charged emotional moments. The film's comedy and drama stem from the same place: the tension of expectations, whether it involves Naveen wrestling with his prescribed role as an Indian man in the West; the implications of his queerness, according to his parents; or how Jay will fit into the Gavaskars' family dynamic.</p><p>What Jay yearns for, as a perpetual outsider who found love in an Indian household once before, is just as vital to the movie as Naveen's search for emotional authenticity. And when the film begins drawing more overtly from Bollywood iconography, it weaves together its grandiose romance from both their perspectives. To Jay, Hindi cinema is the ultimate expression of love and acceptance. To Naveen, it's a cheesy fa&ccedil;ade. The truth, it turns out, may lie somewhere in between, with Sethi presenting the story's key turning points as stylistic handshakes between formal grandeur and naturalistic, self-aware comedy, without compromising either character&rsquo;s point of view. The movie's sweeping declarations are as bold and unapologetic as they are goofy and silly, so they end up running the emotional gamut.</p><p>Rarely has a rom-com been this simultaneously hysterical and touching, though despite its boisterous tone, its biggest strength may very well be its silent moments. The father-son pairing of Naveen and Archit tend to find solace in silence, and that isn't likely to change anytime soon. So, in order to draw them out of their comfort zones, <em>A Nice Indian Boy</em> becomes a film about gestures both big and small. Its most heartrending moments arrive in the form of these two men &mdash; separated by generational disconnect, but bound by common cultural expectations &mdash; adapting to other people's modes of expression in the small ways they're able to. Over the course of the film, they learn to speak other people's love languages, leading to rousing, overwhelming moments (some of them in delightful musical form).&nbsp;</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

            'The Legend of Vox Machina' Season 3 review: Critical Role's series keeps raising the bar

<p>The character in question is the paladin Zerxus Ilerez (voiced by Luis Carazo, who also played Zerxus in <em>Calamity</em>). He is the current owner of the Plate of the Dawnmartyr, one of the Vestiges of Divergence that Vox Machina need in order to defeat the dragon Thordak (voiced by the late Lance Reddick). Their quest brings them to Zerxus' home in the Hells of Despath, where he and cleric Pike Trickfoot (voiced by <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-legend-of-vox-machina-pike-grog-killbox-travis-willingham-ashley-johnson" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Ashley Johnson</a>) play a high-stakes card game for the Plate. The sequence tweaks elements from the original campaign, which saw bard <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-legend-of-vox-machina-season-2-scanlan-shorthalt-sam-riegel" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Scanlan (voiced by Sam Riegel)</a> gamble for the Plate with a fire giant in the Elemental Plane of Fire. </p><p>"From a story perspective, we had an opportunity to combine two story beats from our campaign," Travis Willingham, who voices <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-legend-of-vox-machina-season-2-killbox-fight" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Grog Strongjaw</a>, told Mashable. (Willingham is also an executive producer on <em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em> and CEO of Critical Role.) The series could take Vox Machina's stint in the Fire Plane, which doesn't have the biggest story hook by this point in the show's timeline, and merge it with the idea that Ank'Harel ruler J'mon Sa Ord (voiced by Mara Junot) would have hidden the Plate in the Hells to keep it as far from Thordak as possible.</p><p>"And right after we had finished <em>EXU: Calamity</em>, with Zerxus' fate being sent to the Hells, it just popped up that maybe 800 years later, he's still down there, and that would be a nice thing to weave into the story," Willingham continued. "Particularly some of the lore that was revealed in <em>EXU: Calamity</em>, and how the Calamity kicked off, and why that might be important to larger antagonists in the story that we might try to utilize in a larger way if we get future seasons."</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Zerxus' appearance is no brief Easter egg. Instead, he plays a meaty role in the episode, with the show paralleling his complicated relationship to his deity &mdash; in <em>Calamity</em>, that's Asmodeus, Lord of the Nine Hells, although he goes unnamed here &mdash; with Pike's own doubts in her faith in the Everlight. In their encounter, he also gives Vox Machina a quick rundown of the events of <em>Calamity</em>, accompanied by a stained glass-style animated interlude reminiscent of the campaign's introduction sequence. Appearing in the interlude are Zerxus' companions, the other player characters from <em>Calamity</em>.</p><p>"I think there's a hidden desire on our part to incorporate everyone from <em>Calamity </em>at some point," Willingham said. And with more animated Critical Role projects in development with Amazon Studios, including a <a href="https://mashable.com/video/critical-role-mighty-nein-series-amazon-prime-video" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Mighty Nein</em></a><em> </em>series coming next year, a full <em>Calamity </em>adaptation of some kind may not be too far-fetched.</p><p>"It's ripe for a movie, a mini-series, something &mdash; we're just trying to figure out the best delivery method for it and how it would fit into everything," Willingham said.</p><q>

<p>For now, though, it looks like we haven't seen the last of Zerxus Ilerez in <em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em>. When Pike and her companions escape with the Plate of the Dawnmartyr, he utters a very foreboding statement: "We are his blood. The time for his ascension draws near."</p><p>The words echo those spoken by Delilah Briarwood (voiced by Grey Griffin) and other cultists of the Whispered One &mdash; also known as Vecna in the original campaign &mdash; all the way back in <a href="https://mashable.com/article/legend-of-vox-machina-review-critical-role" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Season 1</a>. Could this mean that <em>The Legend of Vox Machina </em>is positioning Zerxus as the Whispered One's champion? And if so, would that mean the series is mashing the Whispered One and Asmodeus together? Or did Zerxus choose to serve another deity in the hopes of trying to redeem him, as he hoped to do for Asmodeus in <em>Calamity</em>?</p><p>"A Redemption Paladin is still gonna redemption," Marisha Ray, voice of Keyleth, told Mashable. (Ray is also an executive producer on the show, as well as Creative Director of Critical Role.) "I think it's very fitting, because there are several entities in the world of Exandria that could fit that ticket of maybe being redeemed."</p><p>"We're hoping we will see some conspiracy theories [about that line]," added Willingham.</p><p>On top of prompting fan theories, Zerxus' addition to <em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em> is further proof of why the show<em> </em>is one of the most fascinating works of adaptation on TV today. Zerxus didn't exist as a character when Critical Role's first campaign came out &mdash; audiences didn't even get to meet him until months after Season 1 of <em>The Legend of Vox Machina </em>premiered. Yet as Critical Role continues to grow through its various campaigns, it's creating more source material for its animated adaptations to draw from in real time.</p><p>"One of my favorite things about working on the animated show is that after the Vox Machina campaign ended, we continued to expand and enrich the world and create history. We created future stories, but we also expanded what the past was," Liam O'Brien, voice of Vax'ildan and executive producer, told Mashable.</p><p>"That's really the best thing about adaptations. You can go through and sprinkle in some of the good stuff that wasn't there before," added Ray.</p><p>She continued: "I think we're really lucky in the sense that we're developing <em>Mighty Nein </em>in real time with <em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em>, as well as still continuing to shoot Campaign 3 and other ancillary stuff. So we have this 5,000-foot view of everything &mdash; except for all the stuff that is to be determined at the end of Campaign 3 &mdash; but we can take the Jenga blocks of the story and move them around to fit nicely."</p><p>So as <em>The Legend of Vox Machina </em>continues its run, be on the lookout for more substantial links to Critical Role's other campaigns. Zerxus may be the first <em>Calamity </em>crossover, but from the sounds of it, he probably won't be the last.</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/8jvd8?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3B%3Bamp%3B%3Bamp%3Btemplate=article&amp%3B%3Bamp%3B%3Bamp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3B%3Bamp%3B%3Bamp%3Belement=offer&amp%3B%3Bamp%3B%3Bamp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3B%3Bamp%3B%3Bamp%3Belement_label=Season%202%20of%20The%20Legend%20of%20Vox%20Machina%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Prime%20Video.&amp%3B%3Bamp%3B%3Bamp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3B%3Bamp%3B%3Bamp%3Bobject_uuid=05K0klBlyAvUijMbZiTNLv6&amp%3B%3Bamp%3B%3Bamp%3Bshort_url=8jvd8&amp%3B%3Bamp%3B%3Bamp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Fthe-legend-of-vox-machina-season-2-matthew-mercer-umbrasyl&amp%3B%3Bamp%3B%3Btemplate=article&amp%3B%3Bamp%3B%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3B%3Bamp%3B%3Belement=offer&amp%3B%3Bamp%3B%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3B%3Bamp%3B%3Belement_label=The%20Legend%20of%20Vox%20Machina%20Season%203%20premieres%20Oct.%203%20on%20Prime%20Video.&amp%3B%3Bamp%3B%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3B%3Bamp%3B%3Bobject_uuid=02VQ2239YaLKhBpfVzj6OVP&amp%3B%3Bamp%3B%3Bshort_url=8jvd8&amp%3B%3Bamp%3B%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Ffall-tv-preview-2024&amp%3B%3Bamp%3Btemplate=article&amp%3B%3Bamp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3B%3Bamp%3Belement=offer&amp%3B%3Bamp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3B%3Bamp%3Belement_label=The%20Legend%20of%20Vox%20Machina%20Season%203%20premieres%20Oct.%203%20on%20Prime%20Video.&amp%3B%3Bamp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3B%3Bamp%3Bobject_uuid=02VQ2239YaLKhBpfVzj6OVP&amp%3B%3Bamp%3Bshort_url=8jvd8&amp%3B%3Bamp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Ffall-tv-preview-2024&amp%3B%3Btemplate=article&amp%3B%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3B%3Belement=offer&amp%3B%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3B%3Belement_label=The%20Legend%20of%20Vox%20Machina%20Season%203%20premieres%20Oct.%203%20on%20Prime%20Video%2C%20with%20three%20new%20episodes%20every%20Thursday.&amp%3B%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3B%3Bobject_uuid=01tgxDBsCnwKNRIURvslq3v&amp%3B%3Bshort_url=8jvd8&amp%3B%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Fthe-legend-of-vox-machina-season-3-review&amp%3Btemplate=article&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=The%20Legend%20of%20Vox%20Machina%20Season%203%20premieres%20Oct.%203%20on%20Prime%20Video%2C%20with%20three%20new%20episodes%20every%20Thursday.&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=01tgxDBsCnwKNRIURvslq3v&amp%3Bshort_url=8jvd8&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Fthe-legend-of-vox-machina-season-3-review&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=The%20Legend%20of%20Vox%20Machina%20Season%203%20premieres%20Oct.%203%20on%20Prime%20Video%2C%20with%20three%20new%20episodes%20every%20Thursday.&object_type=article&object_uuid=05UFEZoblbjserGeeZi0DGo&short_url=8jvd8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>The Legend of Vox Machina </em>Season 3 premieres Oct. 3 on Prime Video, with three new episodes every Thursday.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

While it doesn't have a bunch of extra features (like Bluetooth connectivity or smart home compatibility), its affordable price tag more than makes up for it. We named it our favorite <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-tv-soundbars" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">starter soundbar</a> for those reasons.

She gave it an excellent 4.8/5 rating, commending its stunning twin OLED screens, 'decent battery life,' and solid overall value. (It has a built-in kickstand, and it ships with a free detachable keyboard and stylus.) </p><p>The base configuration with an M2-rivaling Intel Core Ultra 7 155H CPU is now on sale for $1,264.99,

<h3>Why we like it </h3><p>"Who says you need to spend a grand to get a nice (and decently sized) 4K TV? With the 35% discount that Amazon slapped on the 55-inch version of its most affordable Fire TV, Prime members could actually get one for<em> two</em> different rooms for way less than $1,000.</p><p>As Amazon's most basic in-house Fire TV, the 4-Series would be best suited for people who aren't super picky about saturation or brightness levels as long as it's a step up from their old LED TV &mdash;&nbsp;and this definitely will be. With the intuitive Fire TV platform built-in, the 4-Series can access all of your favorite streaming apps, which you can arrange in whatever layout makes sense to you." <em>&mdash;&nbsp;Leah Stodart,

And, at almost 50% off &mdash; down to just $32.99 &mdash; it's a steal. (You can get the five-to-six-player extension for $27.21). In this game, you&rsquo;ll need to collect resources, settle the land, and trade with other players to build the biggest settlements. If you like any of the digital empire-building games, Catan is a great tabletop version that requires tight strategy, some luck, and a good dose of diplomacy to win." <em>&mdash;&nbsp;Tabitha Britt, Mashable Shopping Contributor</em></p><h3>More board game deals </h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qm2Xln?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Candy%20Land%20Kingdom%20Of%20Sweet%20Adventures&object_type=article&object_uuid=05rcrQNBZikYz4UTSfB9wUt&short_url=Qm2Xln&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Candy Land Kingdom Of Sweet Adventures</em></a><em> </em>&mdash; <strong>$9.99 </strong><s>$11.99</s> (save $2)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/QKDOXV?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Guess%20Who%3F&object_type=article&object_uuid=05rcrQNBZikYz4UTSfB9wUt&short_url=QKDOXV&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Guess Who?</em></a> &mdash; <strong>$12.99 </strong><s>$17.99</s> (save $5)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/QbnxYj?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Azul&object_type=article&object_uuid=05rcrQNBZikYz4UTSfB9wUt&short_url=QbnxYj&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Azul</em></a> &mdash; <strong>$17.09 </strong><s>$39.99</s> (save $22.90) </p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/z7bE3y?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Splendor&object_type=article&object_uuid=05rcrQNBZikYz4UTSfB9wUt&short_url=z7bE3y&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Splendor</em></a> &mdash; <strong>$17.09 </strong><s>$39.99</s> (save $22.90) </p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/z7bE6y?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Monopoly%20Ultimate%20Banking%20Edition&object_type=article&object_uuid=05rcrQNBZikYz4UTSfB9wUt&short_url=z7bE6y&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Monopoly </em>Ultimate Banking Edition</a> &mdash; <strong>$23.49 </strong><s>$37.99</s> (save $4.50) </p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/91b6Kn?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Ticket%20to%20Ride&object_type=article&object_uuid=05rcrQNBZikYz4UTSfB9wUt&short_url=91b6Kn&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Ticket to Ride</em></a> &mdash; <strong>$29.99 </strong><s>$54.99</s> (save $25) </p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/QGVGXq?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=The%20Uzzle&object_type=article&object_uuid=05rcrQNBZikYz4UTSfB9wUt&short_url=QGVGXq&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>The Uzzle</em></a> &mdash; <strong>$39.99 </strong><s>$70.99</s> (save $31) </p></li></ul><h2>Best drone deal </h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>"Ecovacs wasn't lying when it came up with the term 'all-in-one cleaning hub' here, considering that this robot vacuum not only empties itself and washes and dries its own mopping pads, but also has another sweet feature tacked onto the dock: a handheld cordless vacuum. If your main hesitation with robot vacuums was that they can't scale a staircase, sweep under couch cushions, or detail corners up to your standards, this is the one robot vacuum purchase that <em>can</em> &mdash;

<h3>Why we like it </h3><p>"Ideal for smaller wrists, the Garmin Venu 3S is about .2 inches smaller in diameter and .3 oz lighter than the standard Venu 3. It still offers the same advanced features, like a built-in speaker and microphone to take calls, the ability to store music, and an abundance of health and fitness tools and insights. The only real difference besides the size is that the 3S has a slightly shorter battery life (about 10 days in smartwatch mode versus the 3's 14 days), but it still blows the Apple Watch battery out of the water. It's usually $449.99, but you can save $55 during the October Prime event and get it for only $395. That's a new all-time low." &mdash; <em>Christina Buff, Mashable Shopping Contributor</em></p><h3>More fitness tracker deals</h3><p><strong>Garmin deals</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/z3bvMq?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Garmin%20Forerunner%2055&object_type=article&object_uuid=05rcrQNBZikYz4UTSfB9wUt&short_url=z3bvMq&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Garmin Forerunner 55</a> &mdash;

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>"Samsung's Galaxy A35 is a 'strong buy for the price,' as our friends at PCMag (also owned by Ziff Davis) said in their <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-a35-5g" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">review</a>. The budget-friendly Galaxy phone was released as a more affordable alternative to the Galaxy S24. As a budget phone, it doesn't offer the same speed and performance as the S24, but it also doesn't cost over $1,000. It packs a gorgeous 6.6-inch display, Samsung's Exynos 1380 processor, a 50 MP wide-angle camera with optical image stabilization, and a long-lasting 5,000mAh battery that supports fast charging. It's not the most impressive phone on the market, but on sale for [under $300], it's a pretty hard deal to beat." &mdash;&nbsp;<em>Christina Buff, Mashable Shopping Contributor</em></p><h3>More Samsung Galaxy deals</h3><p><strong>Galaxy Buds deals</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/QVDb5O?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%20Galaxy%20Buds%20FE&object_type=article&object_uuid=05rcrQNBZikYz4UTSfB9wUt&short_url=QVDb5O&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><s>Samsung Galaxy Buds FE</s></a><s> &mdash;

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>"Noise-cancelling headphones can easily cost a couple hundred bucks, even on sale.

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>"Have you ever heard the crash of a YETI Rambler as it connects with concrete as you drive down the street, blissfully unaware you left it on top of your car? I assure you, it's very loud. So loud, in fact, I expected my water bottle to be too damaged to use &mdash; I know a HydroFlask wouldn't have survived that fall. But when I circled back to collect my YETI from the middle of the road, the bottle had one small scratch, and one small dent, and two years later, is still perfectly usable. What I'm saying is, if you want a water bottle that's built to last, a YETI Rambler is a pretty good bet." &mdash; <em>Bethany Allard, Lead Shopping Reporter</em></p><h2>More of the best deals under $25</h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/QrpdO5?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Anker%20313%20Wireless%20Charging%20Stand&object_type=article&object_uuid=05rcrQNBZikYz4UTSfB9wUt&short_url=QrpdO5&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Anker 313 Wireless Charging Stand</a> &mdash;

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>The Beats Studio Buds + are some of our favorite <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-noise-cancelling-headphones" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">mid-range noise-cancelling earbuds</a>, but at $119.99, their lowest price ever, they're inching ever-closer to being a budget pick. Since they're made by Apple, they pair just as quickly with iOS devices as a pair of AirPods, but if you're an Android user, they're also compatible with Google Fast Pair. Their sound is well-rounded and not too bass-heavy &mdash; overall they're an excellent pair of headphones at full price, and even better at $120.</p><h3>More earbud deals</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/aepnGl?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Soundcore%20by%20Anker%20P30i%20Noise-cancelling%20Earbuds&object_type=article&object_uuid=03GeaifyYLQAmhc39kPq7Le&short_url=aepnGl&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Soundcore by Anker P30i Noise-cancelling Earbuds</a> &mdash;

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/samsung-galaxy-book4-series-laptops" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Released early this year</a>, the Samsung 16-inch Galaxy Book4 Pro packs all the bells and whistles (an Intel Core Ultra 7 155H CPU with Intel Arc Graphics, a 3K AMOLED touchscreen, AKG Quad speakers, a new Knox security chip). The 16-inch base model has 16GB of RAM, 1TB of storage, and a 21-hour battery life and typically retails for $1,749.99. During Prime Big Deal Days, however, the price dropped to just $1,274.99, and that deal is still live for now. That's 27% in savings.</p><h2>Best Galaxy phone deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>Samsung's pastel-colored Z Flip 6 is making flip phones cool again. It's also a much more reasonable size than the huge <a href="https://mashable.com/article/pixel-9-pro-fold-vs-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung Z Fold 6</a>. Part of the new generation of AI-powered Samsung phones, this trendy device has become a cult hit for its cute aesthetics alone. However, it's so much more than a pretty face. The FlexWindow on the front lets you check messages and notifications without opening the phone, and it has a ton of nifty AI and photography features. It can even act as a handheld translator device, making it ideal for social creators who love to travel. This phone isn't even on sale at Samsung, so head to Amazon while it's on sale for almost $250 off the regular price.</p><h3>More Galaxy phone deals</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/a5bpBO?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%20Galaxy%20A35%20%28Unlocked%2C%20128GB%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=01aldwaLk5QD5m2XyWNxXeC&short_url=a5bpBO&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung Galaxy A35 (Unlocked, 128GB)</a> &mdash; <strong>$313.99</strong> <s>$399.99</s> (save $86)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/9Yd6Jl?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%20Galaxy%20S24%20%28Unlocked%2C%20128GB%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=01aldwaLk5QD5m2XyWNxXeC&short_url=9Yd6Jl&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung Galaxy S24 (Unlocked, 128GB)</a> &mdash; <strong>$719.99</strong> <s>$799.99</s> (save $80)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/QOD3Pn?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%20Galaxy%20S24%20Ultra%20%28Unlocked%2C%20256GB%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=01aldwaLk5QD5m2XyWNxXeC&short_url=QOD3Pn&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><s>Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra (Unlocked, 256GB)</s></a><s> &mdash; <strong>$1,049.99</strong></s><s> $1,299.99 (save $250)</s></p></li></ul><h2>Best Galaxy Tab deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>The Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ may not be as fancy as the brand's S9 lineup, but not everyone is looking for a tablet that practically doubles as a computer. If you just want something reliable that can handle the basics without breaking the bank, check out the A9+. Our friends at <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-tab-a9-plus" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">PCMag</a> (which is owned by Mashable's publisher, Ziff Davis) called it the "best low-cost Android tablet you can buy," noting that it "succeeds at everything a low-cost tablet should." </p><p>It sports an 11-inch screen, quad speakers powered by Dolby Atmos, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 processor, and expandable storage up to 1TB. The base model is already pretty affordable at its full price of $219.99. But post-Prime Day, you can grab it for only $149. That's 32% in savings and its lowest price ever.</p><h3>More Galaxy Tab deals</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/9lwe2R?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%20Galaxy%20Tab%20A9%2B%20%28128GB%2C%20WiFi%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=01aldwaLk5QD5m2XyWNxXeC&short_url=9lwe2R&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ (128GB, WiFi)</a> &mdash; <strong>$209.99</strong> <s>$269.99</s> (save $20)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qq47ep?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%20Galaxy%20Tab%20S9%20FE%20%28128GB%2C%20WiFi%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=01aldwaLk5QD5m2XyWNxXeC&short_url=Qq47ep&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><s>Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE (128GB, WiFi)</s></a><s> &mdash; <strong>$385.99</strong></s><s> $449.99 (save $64)</s></p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/91bXXq?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%20Galaxy%20Tab%20S9%20%28128GB%2C%20WiFi%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=01aldwaLk5QD5m2XyWNxXeC&short_url=91bXXq&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 (128GB, WiFi)</a> &mdash; <strong>$657.23</strong> <s>$799.99</s> (save $142.76) </p></li></ul><h2>Best Galaxy Watch deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>Keep all your adventure snacks and drinks chilled with the 90-quart Igloo Marine Ultra Cooler. Amazon has it discounted to just $100.79 post-Prime Day. That's 20% in savings and the lowest it's been since the last Prime Day event. Whether you're trekking through the sand at the beach, pulling up to a tailgate, or going on a weekend fishing trip, the oversized all-terrain wheels and comfort swing-up handle make it easy to tote this beast of a cooler with you. Plus, its fully insulated body and lid will keep ice for up to five days. </p><p>If you can't fathom spending the $400 plus on a Yeti Tundra Haul, this is a much more affordable alternative. </p><h3>Last call: More Prime Day outdoor deals</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/9g3jxe?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Energizer%20Universal%20Plus%20LED%20headlamp%20%282-pack%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=01p3HgZ1F60hexMlWObA3P9&short_url=9g3jxe&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Energizer Universal Plus LED headlamp (2-pack)</a> &mdash;&nbsp;<strong>$9.18</strong> <s>$16.99</s> (save $7.81)<strong><em>&#10024;</em></strong></p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/aDVgmw?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Energizer%20Weatheready%20LED%20emergency%20lantern&object_type=article&object_uuid=01p3HgZ1F60hexMlWObA3P9&short_url=aDVgmw&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Energizer Weatheready LED emergency lantern</a> &mdash;

It turns out that's not really true.</p><p>In a statement to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24266183/youtube-not-hiding-skip-button-ads" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">The Verge</a>, YouTube confirmed that the option to skip some ads isn't going away, but is rather getting a visual overhaul. According to a YouTube spokesperson, the site is trying to clean up the way ads look, and part of that is by changing the skip button into a progress bar on the bottom of the video. This will apparently be the case for both desktop and mobile users.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>YouTube needed to address this in a statement because various places such as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/extremelyinfuriating/comments/1ftyw5w/youtube_adding_blackout_squares_over_adverts_to/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/youtube-hiding-skip-button-mobile/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">AndroidPolice</a> noticed that the skip button wasn't appearing on desktop or mobile. On desktop, things got particularly interesting, as it appeared that the YouTube video player was drawing a black rectangle over the skip button, almost as if to discourage people from using it. However, according to YouTube, that's not what's happening.</p><p>As always, you can avoid this entirely by paying for YouTube Premium. Such is life. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The universalization of the self-emptying dock has also made it a much more affordable feature in general, even when no discount is present &mdash;&nbsp;so Prime Day deals on these robovacs mean you don't have to pay more than $300 or $400 to be off dustbin duty.</p><p>The newest robot vacuums do much more than self-empty, though.

These are obviously pricier than hybrids that make you do this manually, so to have a few hundred dollars knocked off the price is game-changing. </p><p>Though Prime Big Deal Days officially came to an end, almost all of the best deals on self-emptying robot vacs are still live. We're tracking the top discounts below. <strong>Note: <em>All newly added deals are marked with a &#10024;, while deals with a &#128293; have dropped to an all-time low price.

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>If you want the best bang for your buck, this four-pack of AirTags provides a great value. At $79.98 for four AirTags, each one comes out to about $20, saving you $5 per AirTag over buying them individually &mdash; that's $20 in total savings. While this isn't the absolute lowest price we've seen this four-pack hit, it is the same deal that was live during October Prime Day itself. Plus, having multiple AirTags gives you the flexibility to use them on your luggage, your keys, your pets &mdash; basically, your options open up. </p><h2>Best individual AirTag deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>You might already own several AirTags and just want one more, or you maybe you've never owned a Bluetooth tracker before and want to try one out before buying four of them. Whatever your reason, $5 off an Apple AirTag is a nice bonus, if not a huge markdown. We typically don't see them fall much lower than $25, even in the midst of shopping holidays.</p><h3>More Apple AirTag deals</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/aB1Z4b?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20AirTag%20key%20ring%20%28mulberry%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=02ZjNkohPgGnI3CUHw9AR1r&short_url=aB1Z4b&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple AirTag key ring (mulberry)</a> &mdash;

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>One of the juicier discounts we found on any Ninja Foodi during Prime Big Deal days was a 43% slash on the 8-in-1 XL air frying oven. It has since sold out, but the 10-in-1 Foodi is still at a decent discount with $80 off. The 10-in-1 oven has buttons for air fry, air roast, bake, whole roast, broil, toast, bagel, dehydrate, reheat, and pizza, and it can do two of those at once. The two-shelf design is seriously spacious, fitting two 12-inch pizzas, a tray of veggies and a five-pound chicken, or a full 12-pound turkey if you remove the shelf.</p><h2>More Ninja kitchen deals</h2><p><strong>Pressure cookers, air fryers, and other countertop cookers</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/yLex0?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Ninja%20Foodi%202-in-1%20Flip%20Toaster%20%28ST101&object_type=article&object_uuid=04ebnjiYyNATYrTpKkPoTrJ&short_url=yLex0&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Ninja Foodi 2-in-1 Flip Toaster (ST101</a>) &mdash;

   <em><strong>UPDATE: Oct. 10, 2024, 2:00 p.m. EDT </strong>Prime Big Deal Days 2024 has officially ended, but some deals are still live &mdash;&nbsp;the list at the bottom of this post has been updated with the best ones.</em>
</p>
<p>The difference between <a href="https://mashable.com/category/prime-day" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Prime Day</a> and Black Friday &mdash; their roots, anyway &mdash;&nbsp;probably isn't a mystery to anyone who has dabbled in online shopping before. </p><p>Most of us know that Black Friday is the big sale frenzy that happens around Thanksgiving as a precursor to the holidays, and that almost every store you can think of participates. Alternatively, the name "Prime Day" suggests that the event is indeed an Amazon-specific event made up by Amazon for members of its Prime subscription. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>The lines between these two shopping holidays also aren't quite as blurred as they are between <a href="https://mashable.com/article/black-friday-vs-cyber-monday-deals" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Black Friday and Cyber Monday</a>, which have become pretty indistinguishable from each other due to 1. being just a few days apart on the calendar, and 2. Black Friday relying just as heavily on online shopping as Cyber Monday does. </p><p>But back to the question at hand. Most people aren't concerned with these shopping holiday semantics. The people just want to know: Does Prime Day or Black Friday have better deals?</p><h2>Does Amazon have better deals on Prime Day or Black Friday?</h2><p>Amazon hypes Prime Day up so much that you can't help but assume those two days in July and two days in October are its Olympics. In the case of October Prime Day, specifically, Amazon <em>can't </em>possibly have the bandwidth to turn around and do the same damn thing a month later for Black Friday, right?</p><p><em>Jeff Bezos is heard cackling in the distance.</em></p><p>Amazon price history shows us that, in many cases, Amazon does go as hard for Black Friday as it does for Prime Day. It's not uncommon to plug the URL for any popular item from Amazon into price tracker <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Camelcamelcamel</a> to see a handful of very consistent dips to that item's all-time low pricing &mdash;&nbsp;those few instances being middle of July (Prime Day) and the end of November (Black Friday), plus a common third dip in mid-October (<a href="https://mashable.com/article/october-prime-day-deals-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Prime Big Deal Days</a>, which we know is essentially another Prime Day). </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Black Friday deals also tend to be a little more accessible than Prime Day deals, as you don't have to be a paying Prime member to unlock them (most of the time) like you do for Prime Day deals. (It's the same story for Walmart's Walmart+ events and Walmart's Black Friday sale, though being a paid Walmart+ member still has its perks, like getting early access to Black Friday deals.)</p><p>In terms of what's on sale, there's a ton of overlap between Prime Day and Black Friday deals. Robot vacuums, headphones, Apple devices, laptops, and kitchen gear are likely to get similar treatment for both, so if you find a stellar deal on one of those items, there's probably no need to hold out until the other event to see if the deal is better then.</p><h2>A few categories are better to shop on Black Friday than Prime Day</h2><p>A few categories do play favorites, though. Black Friday is a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-time-to-buy-a-tv" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">better time of year to find TV deals </a>&mdash;&nbsp;aside from its own Fire TVs, Amazon doesn't go super hard with TV deals at any time throughout the year. Best Buy has a much wider selection on its (virtual) shelves at any given point, specifically offering way more big screen premium options than Amazon.

</p>
<p>Did you get everything on your list this October Prime Day? </p><p>Now that <a href="https://mashable.com/article/october-prime-day-everything-you-need-to-know-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Prime Big Deal Days</a> is over, we have to face some hard truths: It's easy to get caught up in the sales, indulge in some impulse purchasing, and experience a bit of buyer's remorse.</p><p>While there are <a href="https://mashable.com/article/amazon-prime-day-deals-2024-still-live" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">still Prime Day deals to shop</a>, you've likely done the bulk of your shopping, and now, you might be left with some questions.

<p>Since contacting <a href="https://mashable.com/category/amazon" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Amazon</a> can be tricky at times (many big tech companies make it extremely difficult to talk to an actual human being at the company), here are all the ways you can get in touch with their customer service. Hopefully, you can get some assistance for a smoother online shopping experience following Prime Big Deal Days:</p><h3>Amazon customer service help page</h3><p>This is probably the most common, and easiest, way to look for answers to common queries, such as those about Amazon&rsquo;s return policies or information about international shipping. The page contains a whole library of questions that users can get answers to, including how to track packages, cancel orders, or start a return. Your most recent purchases will pop up at the top of the page for easy navigation.</p><p>To access Amazon&rsquo;s Customer Service Help Page, go to the website landing page and click on&nbsp;"<a href="https://zdcs.link/aAVgo7?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Customer%20Service&object_type=article&object_uuid=01BdXeOgiQGD9gDg6zNKSY1&short_url=aAVgo7&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><strong>Customer Service</strong></a>" in the top left of the screen.&nbsp;</p><h3>Amazon customer service email</h3><p>Sometimes customer queries need to be worked through on a case-by-case basis, and the answers on the official website need to be more specific to offer any help to shoppers. In these cases, users can <strong>email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:cs-reply@amazon.com" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">cs-reply@amazon.com</a></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>and explain their issues. Remember that contacting Amazon&rsquo;s customer service via email might not be the best solution if you have an urgent question regarding your purchases, since customers are unlikely to get a prompt response.</p><h3>Amazon customer service phone number</h3><p>Need a quicker reply? <strong>Call Amazon at&nbsp;1-888-280-4331</strong>. When customers call this number, a bot picks up the phone and eventually connects them to Amazon staff, depending on the type of query that needs to be answered. It&rsquo;s important to note that customers should have a cell phone number connected to their Amazon account. Customers must enter verification codes that will be messaged to their linked contact information before using this service. In other words, things can get a bit tricky if you're sharing an account with someone else.</p><h3>Amazon online chat service</h3><p>Real-time chatting with Amazon representatives is the most convenient way to get all your questions answered. To use the live chat feature, return to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=508510&amp;ref_=nav_cs_customerservice" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><strong>Customer service help page</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>and click on&nbsp;"Something else."<em>&nbsp;</em>Another page opens with a list of more help options. Select<strong>&nbsp;</strong>"I need more help."</p><p>Now you've officially entered the chat. Type "Talk to associate" in the chat box. Amazon's messaging assistant might prompt you to give more info on your issue, which you can, but if you'd rather get to a real person ASAP, you can select, "I need more help" from the pre-written responses. </p><p>From there, you can choose if you&rsquo;d prefer to talk via chat or call.&nbsp;If you're looking for immediate help with a Prime Day purchase &mdash;&nbsp;be it due to buyer's remorse, a damaged package, an address change, etc. &mdash; this is your best bet to get your needs met.</p><p>For simple questions, Amazon is also testing a <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-rufus" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">new AI chat feature</a> called "Rufus," who can help customers solve some problems.</p><h3>Contact Amazon via social media</h3><p>If your questions aren&rsquo;t that urgent, you can contact Amazon Customer Service at&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/AmazonHelp?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">@amazonhelp</a>&nbsp;on X,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/amazon/?hl=en" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">@amazon</a>&nbsp;on Instagram, and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.facebook.com/Amazon" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">www.facebook.com/Amazon</a>&nbsp;on Facebook.&nbsp;</p><h2>Prime Day deals still live</h2><p>Not quite done shopping yet?

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>Trying to break your Starbucks habit? Invest in a fancy brewer for your home, like the Ninja Specialty Coffee Maker. It happens to still be on sale for just under $120 the day after October Prime Day, or 20% off. It features four brewing styles (classic, rich, over ice, and specialty brew), six brewing sizes (cup, XL cup, travel mug, multi-serve travel mug, half carafe, and full carafe), and a fold-away milk frother. That means you can create anything from hot or ice lattes and macchiatos to cappuccinos and iced coffee from the comfort of your kitchen. </p><h3>More coffee maker deals</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qm2n56?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=AeroPress%20Coffee%20Maker&object_type=article&object_uuid=00YLHWm0KQsqRNdcC73AbtR&short_url=Qm2n56&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><s>AeroPress Coffee Maker</s></a><s> &mdash;

      <description><![CDATA[A new TikTok trend has folks expressing their...interest...in unconventional crushes, who are often cartoon characters.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/05J3mmQhjgtS3PIzSBr2buR/hero-image.png" alt="screenshots of tiktoks of people doing hear me out cake trend"><p>You might be curious why people are putting print-outs of cartoon characters into cakes. And, well, the answer is a tiny bit uncomfortable: It's basically confessing an attraction to the strangest characters, people, or things</p><p>So the so-called "hear me out" cake is basically the people somewhat jokingly saying, "Hear me out; I would hook up with this character." </p><p>The trend follows a few key beats. Two or more people &mdash; sometimes large groups &mdash; take turns placing skewered print-outs of their "hear me outs" into a cake. Oftentimes, things get more unhinged or obscure as the TikTok goes on. You might hear the dad from <em>Finding Nemo,</em> a background character in <em>Spongebob</em>, or the literal number eight, for instance.  </p><p>The trend has proven to be really popular, seemingly as viewers either find themselves agreeing or being shocked. Here's one from the couple account <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@meghanandjack" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">@MeghanandJack</a> that's racked up some 3.4 million views.</p><blockquote class="tiktok-embed" data-video-id="7422062952657767722" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;">

<p>Here's a group of friends that posted one that's garnered nearly 28 million views. </p><blockquote class="tiktok-embed" data-video-id="7420184253993848094" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;">

<p>There are lots of videos with lots of views. </p><blockquote class="tiktok-embed" data-video-id="7422762951519653125" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;">

<p>It's not <em>totally </em>clear where the trend started, exactly. Crush cakes have been a thing online for a while, where people put <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@prioricafe/video/7245869875095145770" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">their crushes</a> into cakes. <em>Today </em><a href="https://www.today.com/food/trends/hear-me-out-cake-tiktok-rcna174595" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">noted that</a> one of the earliest videos with a crush cake and the phrase "hear me out" came from user <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@desgovname/video/7418083800279747871" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">@desgovname</a> in late September.

<p>We've seen particularly good AirPods deals sell out before, but luckily these have hung around. If you've been waiting to buy a pair, now is a good time. The only other time the Pros and Lightning AirPods Max hit the prices they're currently at this year was during July's Prime Day (the Maxes have dropped slightly lower one other time earlier this summer).

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>If work takes you away from home or the office often, a portable monitor might be ideal. With a super lightweight design, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/9ywDBe?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Asus%20ZenScreen&object_type=article&object_uuid=04FykQa1koH8nRpMU7BrCTG&short_url=9ywDBe&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Asus ZenScreen</a> measures 15.6 inches and comes with the ability to mount it on a tripod. The anti-glare screen makes it easier on the eyes, as does the low blue light technology and anti-flicker technology. Adding to the travel-friendly design of the portable monitor, the Asus ZenScreen doesn't require its own power source, but rather powers through a USB-C connection to your laptop. That means there's one less plug to pack on your travels.</p><h3>More monitor deals still live after Amazon Prime Day</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/QWdYAN?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%20Odyssey%20G3%20Gaming%20Monitor%20%2827%20inches%2C%20180Hz%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=04FykQa1koH8nRpMU7BrCTG&short_url=QWdYAN&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung Odyssey G3 Gaming Monitor (27 inches, 180Hz)</a> &mdash; <strong>$139.99</strong> <s>$229.99</s> (save $90)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/QVDXR7?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=LG%20UltraGear%20QHD%20Gaming%20Monitor&object_type=article&object_uuid=04FykQa1koH8nRpMU7BrCTG&short_url=QVDXR7&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">LG UltraGear QHD Gaming Monitor</a> &mdash; <strong>$180.49</strong> <s>$299.99</s> (save $119.50)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/9YdWoR?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%20Odyssey%20Monitor%20%2832-inches%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=04FykQa1koH8nRpMU7BrCTG&short_url=9YdWoR&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung Odyssey Monitor (32-inches)</a> &mdash; <strong>$199.99</strong> <s>$329.99</s> (save $130)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/avx42x?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%20ViewFinity%20S50GC%20Monitor&object_type=article&object_uuid=04FykQa1koH8nRpMU7BrCTG&short_url=avx42x&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung ViewFinity S50GC Monitor</a> &mdash; <strong>$219.99</strong> <s>$349.99</s> (save $130)</p></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[New Zealand's indigenous community is rallying against a proposed bill that could strangle state support and stoke anti-Maori rhetoric, opponents say.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/05XwQMLKs2cGRCrOgp8ljOg/hero-image.jpg" alt="A person cheers and holds up a green flag that reads "Proud to be Maori.""><p>Members of New Zealand's parliament have rallied the international community in support of the island country's indigenous groups, as contentious legislation moves forward that could threaten Maori support systems. </p><p>In a now viral video taken during the legislative session, Te Pati Maori member Hana-Rawhiti Kareariki Maipi-Clarke &mdash; the country's youngest member of parliament &mdash; rises amid commencement of the first vote and begins a ringing haka, soon joined by other members of the Maori Party and parliament. The haka, a type of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/4691873/2023/07/19/new-zealand-world-cup-haka/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">striking group performance</a> embodying New Zealand's rich indigenous culture, is often interpreted as a cry of challenge. </p><p>And a challenge there certainly was. The group of representatives were <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/new-zealand-parliament-debates-controversial-bill-protesters-march-capital-2024-11-14/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">rallying against a proposed bill</a> contentiously reinterpreting the Treaty of Waitangi, a 184-year-old agreement between the British and Indigenous Maori that established rules of government for the colonizing government and indigenous leaders. The new bill would narrow the treaty's definitions and powers, which have, until this moment, offered interpretive pathways for the expansion of Maori rights and stands as a beacon of race relations in the country. The bill is credited with facilitating the creation of a Maori health authority and initiatives to preserve the indigenous language.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Notably, no members of the Maori community were consulted for the proposed bill, which could have a reverberating impact on the 20 percent of New Zealand's population that identify as Maori. </p><p>Following <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/14/nz-parliament-maori-rights-bill-mps-debate-haka-new-zealand" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">tense debate</a> in the chambers, Rawhiti tore up a copy of the legislation and stirred her party to begin the chant. While the haka successfully suspended the vote for 30 minutes, two lawmakers were ejected from the chambers and the bill was later passed through its first round. The bill will now be sent to a committee for a six month hearing process before a second reading, but experts don't believe it will pass another vote.  </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<h2><strong>Amazon's new low-cost retailer is called 'Haul'</strong></h2><p>Haul, Amazon's new economical online retailer, will keep prices capped at $20. However, most of the products will be less than $10. Amazon's press release cited examples of some of these budget-friendly items:</p><ul><li><p><strong>An necklace, bracelet, and earring set for $2.99</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Two kitchen tongs for $4.99</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>An <a href="https://mashable.com/review/iphone-16-and-iphone-16-plus" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">iPhone 16</a></strong><strong> case for $1.79</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>A belt for $1.99</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>A three-piece trimmer razor set for $2.99</strong></p></li></ul><p>Orders must be $25 or more to qualify for free delivery &mdash; but don't expect them to be delivered in two days. According to Amazon's press release, Haul's delivery timeframe is between one to two weeks.</p><p>&ldquo;Finding great products at very low prices is important to customers, and we continue to explore ways that we can work with our selling partners so they can offer products at ultra-low prices,&rdquo; said Dharmesh Mehta, Amazon's vice president of worldwide selling partner services.</p><p>As mentioned at the outset, the mass production of inexpensive products has faced criticism. For example, Shein's rapid production model contributes to substantial carbon emissions, according to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/shein-is-officially-the-biggest-polluter-in-fast-fashion-ai-is-making-things-worse/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Wired.</a></p><p>We reached out to Amazon about how it plans to evade these concerns. In response, an Amazon rep said the following:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Low-priced items are not new to our business and we continue to focus on identifying opportunities to build on our progress toward our Climate Pledge of reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2040. With Amazon Haul, we&rsquo;ll account for its impact &ndash; like we do all of our operations &ndash; and work to mitigate it in a similar way.</p><p>We constantly work to prevent, manage, and reduce waste across our business, including waste we produce in our operations and customer waste, like packaging and retired products. We aim to avoid waste through innovation, design, and operational efficiencies. Amazon has replaced all of the plastic air pillows from delivery packaging used at our global fulfillment centers with paper filler. Since 2015, we&rsquo;ve reduced the average per-shipment packaging weight by 43% and avoided a total of more than 3 million metric tons of packaging.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>For now, Haul is in beta and available exclusively through a mobile app. You can access it <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?node=122341379011" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">here.</a></p><p></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[Xbox might be working on a Steam Deck competitor.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/074VXhpY7MeW1ggmpHxHCWj/hero-image.jpg" alt="A black handheld gaming console"><p>There may be an Xbox-branded answer to the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/steam-deck-review-valve" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Steam Deck</a> on the horizon.</p><p>Xbox executive Phil Spencer hinted at this possibility in an interview with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-13/microsoft-s-gaming-chief-is-still-looking-for-acquisitions-sees-future-growth?embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> that was published on Wednesday. As he put it, the "expectation is that [Xbox] would do something" in the handheld gaming market and the company is working on prototypes right now. </p><p>According to Spencer, you shouldn't expect to see the fruits of that labor for at least a few years. </p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">
        <span class="font-bold text-primary-400">SEE ALSO:</span>

        </a>
    </div>
<p>Unfortunately, that's about all we know. Spencer didn't share specifics, as those details may not exist yet. One only needs to glance at the handheld gaming market to make an educated guess about Microsoft&rsquo;s possible plans. The enduring popularity of the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/asus-rog-ally-x" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Nintendo Switch</a>, along with the recent success of high-end handhelds like <a href="https://mashable.com/review/steam-deck-oled" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Steam Deck</a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/review/asus-rog-ally-x" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Asus ROG Ally,</a> indicate that there's a strong demand for console-quality games in a portable format. </p><p>Given that Xbox is all in on Game Pass as a service these days, it would make sense for the Xbox handheld to have robust Game Pass support. Of course, this would mean the device would need enough power to handle Game Pass titles, which frequently include big-budget AAA releases &mdash; games that <a href="https://www.stuff.tv/review/valve-steam-deck-oled-review/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">some critics say the Steam Deck struggles with.</a></p><p>There&rsquo;s also a chance that Xbox could go through the prototyping process, decide it&rsquo;s not satisfied with the results, and abandon the project altogether. We&rsquo;ll likely know in a couple of years.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h3><strong>Why we like it </strong></h3><p>Pro controllers are more of a "nice to have" than anything else, but when they go on sale (which isn't often), the prospect gets a little more tantalizing. The <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-playstation-5-controllers" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Dualsense Edge controller</a> for PlayStation 5 is the console's most feature-packed controller to date, and it's $10 off in the weeks leading up to Black Friday. It comes with all the extras you'd expect from a pro-style controller, including various swappable back paddles and thumbsticks, remappable inputs, and more.</p><h2><strong>More PlayStation deals</strong></h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/92bWm5?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Final%20Fantasy%20XVI&object_type=article&object_uuid=01qYPcvkHSW4sGkpPxLob4N&short_url=92bWm5&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Final Fantasy XVI</em></a> &mdash;

<p>The holidays are right around the corner which means busy calendars are about to take over. Between normal work tasks, keeping the kids entertained during school breaks, and showing up to social events, the household chores take a back seat. There will be time to vacuum the floors next weekend, right? Instead of trying to fit it all in, enlist the help of a hybrid robot vacuum that also mops, and Amazon has a great model on sale today.</p><p>As of Nov. 14, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGV51Y?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Eufy%20Omni%20C20%20hybrid%20robot%20vacuum%20and%20mop&object_type=article&object_uuid=00zo3ueuZp3WL3gfDrWTyZw&short_url=QGV51Y&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Eufy Omni C20 hybrid robot vacuum and mop</a> is on sale for just $399.99 at Amazon with the on-page coupon, down from the typical price of $599.99.

The Eufy Omni C20 is a hybrid model that takes care of both tasks, with extra convenience from its self-emptying base. </p><p>Mashable senior shopping reporter Leah Stodart tested out the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/eufy-x10-pro-omni" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Eufy X10 Pro Omni</a> this year and was impressed by its performance. She mentions that while the Eufy Omni C20 has a less powerful suction (7,000 Pa instead of 8,000) and lacks small-obstacle avoidance for cords and pet waste, the sale price on the Omni C20 makes this a great option that comes with plenty of perks.</p><p>For one, the Eufy Omni C20 has self-washing mopping pads which means you'll never need to touch the dirty and wet pads. Instead, the base automatically washes and dries both mopping pads after use. </p><p>The robot itself has a slim design, measuring just 3.35 inches tall, so it can easily fit under the couch to vacuum and mop areas that might have been a challenge before.</p><p>If you dread the task of cleaning floors, hand off the task to the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGV51Y?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Eufy%20Omni%20C20&object_type=article&object_uuid=00zo3ueuZp3WL3gfDrWTyZw&short_url=QGV51Y&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Eufy Omni C20</a>.

<p>Collins, formerly a disinformation reporter at NBC News, recruited a group fronted by billionaire Jeff Lawson <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91126211/the-onion-ceo-ben-collins-jeff-lawson-nbc-news-elon-musk" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">to purchase The Onion</a><em> </em>earlier this year. The company has since worked to bring back the sort of fun, skewering side of the internet that's been slowly killed off by the media landscape. Purchasing Infowars seems like the sort of bold step that makes sense for this new version of The Onion. Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit aimed at stopping gun violence, has agreed to advertise on the relaunched Infowars, the <em>Times </em>reported. </p><p>Global Tetrahedron <a href="https://theonion.com/heres-why-i-decided-to-buy-infowars/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">dropped a press release</a> on the purchase from its faux CEO Bryce P.

<p>The statement read, in part: </p><blockquote><p>"Founded in 1999 on the heels of the Satanic 'panic' and growing steadily ever since, <em>InfoWars</em> has distinguished itself as an invaluable tool for brainwashing and controlling the masses. With a shrewd mix of delusional paranoia and dubious anti-aging nutrition hacks, they strive to make life both scarier and longer for everyone, a commendable goal. They are a true unicorn, capable of simultaneously inspiring public support for billionaires and stoking outrage at an inept federal state that can assassinate JFK but can&rsquo;t even put a man on the Moon."</p></blockquote><p>Jones himself responded to the purchase in a video <a href="https://x.com/RealAlexJones/status/1857058831135645739" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">posted</a> to X. </p><p>"They said they're shutting us down, even without a court order," he said.

<p>MacBooks have long been considered some of the best options around, especially for creatives. But with only 8GB of RAM, the MacBook Air didn't fit the bill for everyone.

<p>Location sharing is currently available to all users via the Snap Map, but the new tool allows parents to request their teen's live location at any moment, as well as share their own. Parents and caregivers can select up to three designated locations and receive alerts when members arrive or depart from those spots on the Snap Map.

<p>Simply put, 8GB of RAM is just <a href="https://mashable.com/article/macs-8gb-of-ram-dead" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">not enough for a MacBook</a>. Typically, boosting the RAM to 16GB would cost you an extra $200, but since Apple decided to make 16GB the new standard, you can get an upgraded model for the same price. And if you want to save even more, opt for the slightly older M2 MacBook Air from 2022, which is on sale for just $749 instead of $999. That's the lowest price to date for the now-standard 16GB base model with 256GB of storage. Sure, it's not the latest and greatest MacBook on the market, but it's still a very solid laptop that Tech Reporter Alex Perry gave the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-macbook-air-m2-2022-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Mashable Choice Award</a> badge of honor. He praised its zippy M2 processor, rock-solid battery life, slim profile, and more than satisfying keyboard design.</p><p><a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-macbook-air-m2-2022-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Read our full review of the M2 MacBook Air</em></a>.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row pogoClear">

<p>A direct replacement for the Sony WH-CH710N headphones &mdash; which our friends at <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/sony-wh-ch710n" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">PCMag</a> (also owned by Ziff Davis) said "offer solid audio performance and active noise cancellation for a relatively affordable price" &mdash; the WH-C720N are on sale for just $79.99 at Amazon. That's 47% in savings and a record-low for this model. The new design is more inspired by the much more expensive <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-headphones" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">WH-1000XM5s</a> (which we love). They add some sound and noise-cancelling upgrades compared to their predecessor, boosting sensitivity in the drivers and increasing the dynamic range, yet keep the impressive 35-hour battery life (with ANC). They're not the fanciest noise-cancelling headphones on the market, but they're stylish, reliable, and budget-friendly.</p><p><em>None of these deals catching your eye?

If a robot vacuum didn't make the cut last year, let Black Friday 2024 be the time to finally treat yourself to a significantly shorter chore list.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

(More robot vacuums than I can count on one hand are cheaper the first week of November than they were in the weeks after October Prime Day.)</p><h2>Black Friday deals are making high-end vacs super accessible</h2><p>The robot vacs already getting attention deals-wise ahead of Black Friday are packed with high-end features. I'm personally eyeing the number of options that bring home smart mapping and small obstacle avoidance (no more eaten phone chargers) and self-washing and drying mopping pads in the $500 to $700 range. Considering the latter two features in that trio I just rattled off were once so newfangled that they were only available in the $1,000+ range, these sale prices are ones to hop on without hesitation.</p><p>Below, I'm tracking the robot vacuum deals live ahead of Black Friday. Deals are organized into two sections:&nbsp;robot vacuums that don't mop and robot vacuum and mop combos, with self-emptying docks noted when applicable. Within each category, all robot vacuum deals are ordered by price from cheapest to most premium. </p><p>This list will be updated weekly with new deals in the lead-up to Black Friday week, so check back frequently to see if the model you're eyeing drops. (Need help deciding which robot vacuum to buy? <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-choose-a-robot-vacuum" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">I have some guidelines</a>.)</p><h2>Best robot vacuum deal ahead of Black Friday</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row pogoClear">

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>This nearly 50% off discount on the Roomba Combo j5+ is stellar at first glance, but it looks like an even sweeter deal when compared to the current deal on the cheapest self-emptying Roomba, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/znONV8?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Roomba%20Vac%202&object_type=article&object_uuid=04r07Kq0OvAq4v0D7OFNLzz&short_url=znONV8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Roomba Vac 2</a>. For $249.99, that bare-bones Roomba doesn't mop and can't smart map your house. For $299 &mdash;&nbsp;just $50 more &mdash;&nbsp;the Roomba Combo i5+ <em>can</em> mop and <em>can</em> smart map to clean specific rooms in your home on command. If $300 is your budget cap for a new robot vacuum, spending that extra $50 is a no-brainer.</p><p>The only downside to choosing the Combo i5+ over the more advanced Combo j5+ that was on sale last week is that the i series Roombas don't have small obstacle avoidance technology, so they can't dodge things on the floor like charging cords or pet waste. However, if your home is already pretty tidy as it is, or you're down to deal with tidying up ahead of vacuuming, the Combo i5+ is a total steal ahead of Black Friday.</p><h3>More robot vacuums (that don't mop) on sale</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/drx21?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Ionvac%20SmartClean%202000&object_type=article&object_uuid=04r07Kq0OvAq4v0D7OFNLzz&short_url=drx21&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Ionvac SmartClean 2000</a> &mdash;

The Ultimate option even comes with access to EA Play for access to a variety of EA titles as well. </p><p>There are tons of other reasons to use Xbox Game Pass Ultimate as well, including online multiplayer and Xbox Cloud Gaming, but the unlimited access is the biggest.

That's a savings of $196 and a 47% discount.</p><p>The Vitamix Explorian blender is an incredibly versatile kitchen appliance, ready to help you create everything from smoothies to hot soups to fresh salsa. The blender has three program settings for smoothies, hot soup, and frozen desserts. You can also use the blender in a manual mode, selecting a speed on the dial between 1 and 10. The pulse function is perfect for adding in quick bursts of blending. </p><p>The blender's container measures a large 64 ounces which means you'll be able to feed the family, but its low-profile design means it's more likely to fit under your cabinets. </p><p>Vitamix blenders are known as some of the most powerful and durable blenders out there. Unfortunately, that comes with a steep price, but buying a model that's been renewed from Vitamix's rigorous renewal process is a great way to grab a Vitamix without paying the big bucks. In order to gain the Vitamix Renewed premium stamp of approval, the blender must pass a 17-point inspection process and the blade needs to be under a year old.</p><p>Vitamix then puts the sanitized blade into a new container shell and packs it up with a brand new two-part lid and tamper. Essentially, this means buying a renewed model gets you all new parts, except for the blade, which is under a year old.</p><p>If you've had your heart on a Vitamix blender but haven't been thrilled with the high price tag, snag a renewed <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVDBbN?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Vitamix%20Explorian%20blender&object_type=article&object_uuid=02SKBGvuDodEfcuLmZgq0iw&short_url=QVDBbN&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Vitamix Explorian blender</a> from Amazon for under $200.

But the stakes may feel a little higher if you're in your 40s, especially when considering the <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-free-dating-sites-apps-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">cost of dating sites</a> nowadays and whether or not they're truly worth it for finding love. </p><p>You may assume that people in your demographic either aren't interested in dating or are already settled into long-term relationships, but many people in their 40s are <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-sites-for-single-parents-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">single parents</a>, divorced, or unpartnered, leading to a diverse age range within the dating pool. Getting on one of the best dating sites for over 40 singles could help you find your forever partner &mdash; it's not too late to date. </p><p>According to a recent <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/06/28/a-record-high-share-of-40-year-olds-in-the-us-have-never-been-married/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Pew Research Center analysis</a> of Census Bureau data, as of 2021, nearly 25 percent of 40-somethings in the U.S. have never been married. Additionally, only 22 percent of unmarried adults ages 40 to 44 were cohabiting couples. </p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>So, have people in their 40s given up on finding love? Not at all. In fact, according to the Pew Research analysis, approximately one in four 40-year-olds who weren't married in 2001 tied the knot by age 60. But unlike people in their 20s and 30s, single people over 40 know what they want and aren't afraid to wait a little longer to find the right person. </p><h2>How to find a partner in your 40s</h2><p>Now, after that speech and spew of statistics, you're probably wondering what our grand plan is to get you out on the dance floor. The answer? <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-apps" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Online dating</a>. Before you scoff, hear us out.</p><p>Online dating is a great way to meet new people in a low-pressure environment. The best dating sites for people over 40 make it so easy to connect with potential partners. You can filter through profiles and find matches who share your interests and values. Imagine if you could do that when scanning the room at a party &mdash; it would save a lot of time and effort.</p><p>But before you download a bunch of apps, <a href="https://www.foriawellness.com/pages/kiana-reeves" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Kiana Reeves</a>, Somatic Sex Educator, Intimacy Coach, and Chief Education Officer at Foria, recommends taking a moment for self-reflection: "We join dating sites because we&rsquo;re looking for connection, whether in the form of a serious relationship, a casual fling, or something in between. With that in mind, it&rsquo;s important to identify the kind of connection you&rsquo;re looking for before you join any dating sites, apps, etc."</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">
        <span class="font-bold text-primary-400">SEE ALSO:</span>

        </a>
    </div>
<p>Next, consider your approach to online dating, Reeves says. "Are you looking for a casual swipe-through site to meet people in a new city? Are you someone who likes to <a href="https://mashable.com/article/bumble-revamps-the-first-move-opening-moves-and-other-features" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">make the first move</a>? Are you looking for someone who is only interested in a serious relationship? Are you looking for someone who shares your same faith? How much time are you planning to devote to making a connection?" </p><p>Once you've clarified your dating goals, Reeves recommends "joining a couple [apps] to start out with, so you can feel out what kind of user experience makes the most sense for you." She adds, "Of course, if you&rsquo;re feeling overwhelmed, it&rsquo;s totally fine to just join one to start."</p><p>Ready to find love after 40? Or maybe you're just looking for a <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-hookup-apps" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">no-strings-attached fling</a>? We get it, and we're here to help. As dating site experts, we've combed through the best dating sites and best dating apps for people over 40,  done the research, and even tried them out ourselves to find the best options for singles like you.

<p>Launched nearly five years ago, the action-adventure game came out on PC, PS4, and Xbox One. But on a shiny new M4 MacBook Pro, I was floored by its graphical fidelity and breathtaking visuals.</p><p>The M4 chip breathed new life into <em>Control</em>. Playing as Jesse Faden, a young woman with supernatural abilities, I levitated over the jagged terrain &mdash; and I was mesmerized by the dynamic lighting that danced on each rock formation, casting soft-edged, realistic shadows that shifted with my movements.</p><p>Some floating debris and polished stone surfaces picked up ambient reflections, adding a subtle glossy effect. Even distant light sources bounced off rocks and debris, creating reflections that feel true-to-life.</p><p>The graphics were vivid, crisp, and eye-catching. Faden looked visually stunning, too. She was kicking butt and taking names with a leather jacket that seemed so tangible, I was convinced I could feel the texture if I touched the screen.</p><p>Why does <em>Control </em>look so darn good? Thank the hardware-accelerated ray-tracing and mesh shading found on the M4 chip (as well as the previous-generation M3 chip). In simple terms, the latest Macs can render ultra-realistic lighting and shadows. Plus, they can manage detailed 3D environments more seamlessly.</p><p>With a computationally complex game like <em>Control </em>playing so smoothly and responsively on the 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro, Windows should be concerned. </p><p>It's worth noting, though, that I didn't get to feel the underside of the MacBook Pro to determine its thermal management. Plus, I wasn't able to observe any load times for <em>Control </em>&mdash; the game was already fired up and ready to play at Apple's showcase. </p><h2><strong>Apple may lure more laptop consumers away from Windows</strong></h2><p>Let's say you're looking for a new laptop. You don't consider yourself a gamer, but you want to get started. You want a machine that's perfect for daytime productivity and casual nighttime gaming. You don't have any allegiance to macOS nor Windows, but the former has a reputation of delivering long battery life and beastly performance. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>This is not to be confused with using Gemini in Google's Google app on iOS, although the experience is quite similar. The standalone Gemini app skips all the additional parts and just goes straight to Gemini, which you can ask questions in text or speech format. Additionally, you can attach a photo to your query.</p><p>Other options include Gemini Live, which turns Gemini into a far more conversational partner. This is a big one, as it's not available in the Google app, so it's probably going to be the primary reason to choose the standalone Gemini app over the Google app. </p><p>The app is a <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-gemini/id6477489729" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">free download</a> in Apple's App Store, but it does offer in-app purchases. That's if you want to upgrade to Gemini Advanced, which is a part of Google's One AI premium plan. For a $18.99 monthly fee, you'll get a more advanced Gemini model, access to Gemini in apps such as Gmail and Docs, and faster access to new and experimental features. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>While not the latest in the Solo range (for that check out the <a href="https://zdcs.link/z6bN53?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Beats%20Solo%204&object_type=article&object_uuid=03ynHfxHvshY6egyccWwCBL&short_url=z6bN53&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Beats Solo 4</a>), these are a great option, especially at this reduced price.

And when you do, the Fast Fuel function will mean that with just a five-minute charge you'll have another three hours of listening.</p><p>As is standard with this range, the Beats Solo 3 are designed with comfort in mind. They've got adjustable, cushioned ear cups to keep your head feeling comfy while you listen. They also fold up nicely, perfect for stowing in your bag and heading out the door. You can even use Siri through these headphones, meaning you can take calls and control music hands-free. </p><p>And of course, with Beats, you know you're getting second-to-none sound quality, with clear audio and a seriously punchy bass. And for under $70, we can't argue with that.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This powerful robot vacuum boasts a four-stage Cleaning System that picks up all types of dirt, whether it's everyday mess, stubborn stains, or pet hair stuck deep into the carpet. It uses Dual Multi-Surface Rubber Brushes, which adjust to various floor types. It uses Imprint Smart Mapping to learn your home&rsquo;s layout, so there's no need to manually map out a cleaning path. The Dirt Detect Technology also makes sure that there's enough cleaning done in high-traffic areas i.e. where you regularly walk or eat.  </p><p>Like most premium robot vacuums, it empties its own bin into an enclosed bag that holds up to 60 days of debris, so you don&rsquo;t have to think about emptying it for two months. </p><p>And let's not forget, this robot also has a built-in mop. The microfiber mop pad is perfect for wiping away dirt, dust, and footprints on hard floors.</p><p>This is a limited-time deal at Amazon, so don't miss out.</p>]]></content:encoded>

It's the third Wilson adaptation produced by the director's father, Hollywood superstar Denzel Washington &mdash; after <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ma-raineys-black-bottom-movie-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Ma Rainey's Black Bottom</em></a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/video/fences-trailer-2016" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Fences</em></a>, the latter of which Denzel also directed &mdash; but it's the first to fully succeed as cinema.</p><p>Set in the mid-1930s, the story follows a pair of siblings who come into conflict over what to do with a slavery-era heirloom: a piano that one of them hopes to sell in order to buy his own land, while the other tries to hold on to it. With a powerful cast at his disposal, Washington directs the hell out of Wilson's stage play, and transforms it into cinema by filling out its margins.</p><p>This does, at times, lead to a literalization of the show's looming metaphors (the play has fantastical elements that the film practically transforms into horror), and the movie often suffers from some awkward assembly. However, Washington's remarkable visual approach transcends the two predecessors in his father's ostensible trilogy. Rather than simply filming a stage show in three dimensions, as was the case with <em>Ma Rainey's</em> and <em>Fences</em>, Washington uses his camera to interrogate the confines of the text, and builds on Wilson's Pulitzer Prize&ndash;winning play in impeccable ways.</p><h2>What is <em>The Piano Lesson</em> about?</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>With a script by Washington and Virgil Williams, <em>The Piano Lesson </em>is a faithful adaptation of its 1987 source material, though the writers add&nbsp;bookends to take the narrative outside the confines of its central setting. Most of the story unfolds in the Pittsburgh home of widow Berniece Charles (Danielle Deadwyler), where she lives with her uncle, Doaker (Samuel L. Jackson), and adolescent daughter Maretha (Skylar Aleece Smith). However, the movie opens with a flashback to 1911, depicting a key event recounted later in both the film and the play: Doaker and Berniece's father stealing their family's precious piano from a former plantation in Mississippi.</p><p>This heist takes place on the Fourth of July, a fleeting detail in Wilson's text that Washington turns into an opportunity for deeper reflection. Fireworks paint the characters in washes of red, white and blue, forcing consideration of what "freedom" really means, in a story where financial and emotional liberation are constantly at stake. Back in the '30s, the financial constraints of the Great Depression leads Berniece's brother Boy Willie &mdash; played by the director's brother and <a href="https://mashable.com/video/tenet-nolan-theories" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Tenet</em></a><a href="https://mashable.com/video/tenet-nolan-theories" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"> star John David Washington</a> &mdash; to her doorstep, accompanied by his friend Lymon (Ray Fisher). The duo has made their way to Pittsburgh to sell watermelons off the back of their truck so Boy Willie can purchase a plot of land, but gathering the money would also require him to sell the piano his father stole. It's an object to which Berniece still clings even though she doesn't play it, a contradiction Deadwyler sells convincingly by turning the quiet moments between her dialogue into moments of intense personal dilemma.</p><p>This piano is special, for carved into its body &mdash; by Berniece and Boy Willie's great grandfather, an enslaved woodworker &mdash; are the faces of enslaved relatives who were sold to acquire the instrument, alongside depictions of their family's history. Part keepsake and part painful albatross, the piano remains central to several scenes and conversations that play out over a number of&nbsp;days, as Boy Willie and Lymon stick around in the hopes of convincing Berniece to give it up.</p><p>Along the way, numerous characters with whom the family shares a history come and go from Berniece's household, resulting in scenes of catching up, reminiscing, and even arguing, as Washington finds unexpected ways to explore Wilson's rhythmic dialogue.</p><h2><em>The Piano Lesson</em> adapts the famous stage play with flair.</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Like any good stage-to-screen translation, <em>The Piano Lesson </em>retains room for its actors to play. As soon as any two of them interact &mdash; with initial excitement that eventually gives way to more complex feelings &mdash; entire histories between them are clarified through the smallest of gestures. Washington doesn't mess with this formula, born of Wilson's thoughtful writing, and instead compliments it by allowing his cast to craft spontaneous performances.</p><p>As Boy Willie, John David Washington's rapid-fire dialogue lays track immediately before the charging locomotive that is the movie's plot, but he constantly laces his heavy exposition with infectious effervescence. When he finally slows down for more difficult dramatic scenes, moments of silence envelop the soundscape, and he practically warps the movie's texture around him, making its drama almost suffocating. All the while, the camera follows him through the lower floor of Berniece's home, between the kitchen and the living room, as he chews the scenery while bringing light and life to the setting. He does so via friendly conversations with Doaker and his other uncle, Wining Boy (Michael Potts) &mdash; a once-famous musical artist dealing with disappointment &mdash; and via more adversarial verbal tussles with the local reverend, Avery Brown (Corey Hawkins), who's smitten with his sister.</p><p>As a director, Washington unearths the intimacy of each conversation by either gradually circling around the characters and capturing their collective energy, or by holding on them in close-ups for long periods &mdash; and in unexpected moments. Rather than keeping the lens trained on whoever's speaking, he diverts our attention to reaction shots, building a more interpersonal story in the process, as characters respond to each other's recollections or to new information.</p><p>There is, however, a slight downside to just how in tune Washington is with his performers. The movie's moment-to-moment construction suffers on occasion; in order to capture the actors' spontaneity and their performances at length, shots feel inelegantly stitched together, with objects and bodies obscuring enough of the frame that it's momentarily distracting. The rhythm of Wilson's words is maintained, but the rhythm of the editorial cuts feels strange in the process; movement and blocking feels directionally correct, but the cuts from one character to the next become jarring in the process. Most viewers may not notice some of these individual instances, but the result is a compounding effect that subtly unsettles the audience.</p><p>However, the movie swerves into phantasmagorical territory often enough that these unsettling breaks in visual melody end up feeling part and parcel of its approach. A ghost happens to be haunting Berniece, or so she claims. Its historical meaning grows increasingly clear as the dialogue reveals more about the family's history, and in the meantime, Washington's horror-inspired flourishes create intrigue. Although he grants the play's invisible spirits corporeal form, cinematographer Mike Gioulakis obfuscates them in shadow for just long enough that they still remain mysterious. The film's use of light is often marvelous, veering between stage-like spotlights emanating from fixtures overhead, to warm glows that don't just softly illuminate the actors' faces but work in tandem with the echoes of the sound design to draw out internal thought from their performances. The family's legacy is constantly on the tip of Wilson's tongue, and Washington further elucidates this subtext through the characters' self-reflections, which attempt to draw out internal thought in moments of deep self-reflection on the family's legacy.</p><h2><em>The Piano Lesson</em> wrestles with the past.</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The eponymous piano has an enormous presence throughout the film, whether as a central element of production design &mdash; characters often lean on it or inspect it as they speak &mdash; or even as a lurking entity in the background and out of focus, lying in wait to cause a rift between the siblings. It is, at once, a reminder of the demonic white supremacy that defined their family's lives, as well as an embodiment of the continued resilience of those very same people.</p><p>In effect, the piano embodies the weight of history for the Charles family as Black Americans, for whom slavery is only two or three generations removed. They occasionally speak of this burden, but&nbsp;the dialogue is enhanced by the movie's use of flashbacks to decades before. As Doaker tells the story of the piano, what he's really recalling are the recollections of other characters &mdash; or recollections of recollections &mdash; since he hadn't been born until after slavery was abolished. And yet, the edit ties his words to this flashback footage as though we were witnessing his own memories.</p><p>The flashbacks in question involve fleeting, expressionistic images, both of woodworking and of enslaved people glancing at the camera, &agrave; la Barry Jenkins' <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-underground-railroad-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>The Underground Railroad</u></em></a>. In the process, Doaker and the Charles family become a sort of conduit between the audience and the film, the play, the Depression-era setting &mdash; during which monetary survival was a topic on everyone's tongue &mdash; and eventually, the family's ancestors, whose lives have been preserved in wood.</p><p>More importantly, by expanding on Wilson's text though cinematic form, Washington more closely connects each character to the spiritual quandary the piano represents. Selling it would mean moving forward, as Boy Willie's ancestors would have hoped for him, and it would also mean putting generations of pain behind him. However, for Berniece, it would also mean forgetting the past. These opposing forces are inextricably linked in the consciousness of Black America, and the movie brings them to light in stunning dramatic form, through a film that makes living room chats feel like enormous proclamations that echo through history.</p><p>Combining the best of stage and screen, <em>The Piano Lesson</em> finds deft balance between overt melodrama and dazzling aesthetic flourishes. Through light and sound that guide and shift alongside the story, Berniece's home &mdash; and the film as a whole &mdash; come to life, transforming the screen into a living stage where practically any emotion can be expressed.&nbsp;</p><p><em>The Piano Lesson</em> is currently in select theaters. <a href="https://zdcs.link/9yw7ke?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=It%20will%20debut%20on%20Netflix%20Nov.%2022.&object_type=article&object_uuid=02kDZk44o0oeX72UeGG840K&short_url=9yw7ke&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">It will debut on Netflix Nov. 22.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In the new <em>Nature</em> study, scientists actually analyzed a sample of 36 massive dust-obscured galaxies. Though most of them didn't conflict with scientific models, the three ultra-massive standouts were found churning out stars nearly two times more efficiently &mdash; and thus faster &mdash; than smaller galaxies of the same period.&nbsp;</p><p>"Already in its first few years of operation, JWST has thrown us a couple of curveballs," Wuyts said.

<h2>Is <em>Blink Twice</em> worth watching?</h2><p>Despite a slow <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl4082008065/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">theatrical release</a>, grossing about $46.3 million against a $20 million production budget, <em>Blink Twice</em> opened to largely positive reviews. That just goes to show that box office numbers don't tell the whole story. You could have a massive theatrical release, but if audiences don't enjoy it, what's the point?</p><p>With a 75 percent critic rating and 70 percent audience rating on Rotten Tomatoes, <em>Blink Twice</em> is certainly worth a watch. Puchko pointed out that its plot and aesthetic details are influenced by 2019's <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ready-or-not-sequel-officially-confirmed" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Ready or Not</em></a> and there are visual nods to <em>I Spit on Your Grave</em>. "But Kravitz uses familiar pieces to build her foundation, then crafts a freshly exhilarating adventure that feels of its time. Rather than an imitator of these movies, it feels a kindred spirit, using its screams to deliver a message that is achingly timeless."</p><p>She ultimately concludes: "<em>Blink Twice</em> is a knockout."</p><p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/blink-twice-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Read our full review of Blink Twice.</em></a></p><h2>How to watch <em>Blink Twice</em> at home</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

If you don't mind waiting, there's a good chance <em>Blink Twice</em> will end up streaming on Prime Video in January. </p><h2>Can I get MGM+ for free?</h2><p>If you're new to MGM+, you can enjoy the streaming service for free for a week through <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qx7GwY?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=MGM%2B%20directly&object_type=article&object_uuid=05NCF0Mo0250aclrT4kBYkN&short_url=Qx7GwY&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">MGM+ directly</a> or as an <a href="https://zdcs.link/92bov5?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=add-on%20via%20Prime%20Video&object_type=article&object_uuid=05NCF0Mo0250aclrT4kBYkN&short_url=92bov5&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">add-on via Prime Video</a>.

All hope isn't lost, though. If you want to save a little cash, your best option is to sign up for the annual subscription versus the monthly subscription. You'll save 30% by paying for a year upfront, which is a pretty big savings compared to annual subscriptions from other streamers.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row pogoClear">

</div>


<p>French filmmaker Jacques Audiard has previously wowed critics with dramas like <em>Rust and Bone, A Prophet, </em>and <em>The Sisters Brothers. </em>Now, he traverses daring new terrain with a musical with a telenovela plotline. Its story begins with a cartel boss (transgender telenovela star Karla Sof&iacute;a Gasc&oacute;n), who is looking to leave a life of crime behind and become the woman she's always believed she could be. This means transitioning through medical procedures, faking her death, and changing her name to Emilia P&eacute;rez. However, the film that bears her name also weaves in the dramatic journeys of the women around her, including her oft-stressed lawyer (Zoe Salda&ntilde;a), the wife she leaves behind (Selena Gomez), and her new love interest (Adriana Paz). Passionate and provocative, it's a musical that dances to its own beat. </p><p>In <a href="https://mashable.com/article/emilia-perez-movie-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">his Mashable review</a> out of Cannes, Siddhant Adlakha wrote, "The Spanish-language Cannes title not only won Audiard the Jury Prize &mdash; the festival's third most prestigious accolade &mdash; but it was also awarded the Best Actress trophy to not one but four of its central performances, each of which brings a unique thoughtfulness and passion to the screen... Above all else, the film's four leading ladies are perfectly attuned to Audiard's volatile mixture of operatic emotion and naturalistic cinematic influence. The result is a dazzling, dramatic high-wire act that's always fun to watch, and is frequently invigorating, too." <em>&mdash; Kristy Puchko, Entertainment Editor</em></p><p><strong>Starring: </strong>Zoe Salda&ntilde;a, Karla Sof&iacute;a Gasc&oacute;n, Selena Gomez, and Adriana Paz</p><p><strong>How to watch:</strong> <a href="https://zdcs.link/91by4q?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Emilia%20P%C3%A9rez%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Netflix.&object_type=article&object_uuid=07pMquX4DgyZw8fln6WpdRE&short_url=91by4q&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Emilia P&eacute;rez </em>is now streaming on Netflix.</a></p><h2>8. <em>Ally McBeal,</em> Seasons 1- 5</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

<p>On top of some inspired hospital hijinks &mdash; like the world's worst operating room playlist &mdash; <em>St. Denis Medical </em>boasts an extra-promising ensemble, including frazzled head nurse Alex (Allison Tolman), brash director Joyce (Wendi McLendon-Covey), and disgruntled doctor Ron (David Alan Grier). Rounding it out are bro-y trauma surgeon Bruce (Josh Lawson), and nurses Val (Kaliko Kauahi, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nbc-superstore-office-romance" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Superstore</em></a>), Serena (Kahyun Kim), and Matt (Mekki Leeper, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/jury-duty-review-amazon-freevee" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Jury Duty</em></a>).

<p>Need a feel-good movie? Then our top pick for you is this barrage of sunshine out of Sundance 2024. Written and directed by Josh Margolin as an ode to his beloved grandmother, <em>Thelma </em>plays like <em>Mission: Impossible </em>&mdash;&nbsp;if it followed a 93-year-old grandma who kicks butt and takes names. </p><p>Academy Award&ndash;nominee June Squibb stars as our eponymous action-comedy hero. After being duped out of some big bucks on a telephone scammer, this no-nonsense nonagenarian sets forth on a quest to get vengeance &mdash;&nbsp;and her money back! Along the way, she'll commit a string of petty crimes, like stealing a mobility scooter (or getaway ride) from her dear friend Ben (<em>Shaft</em>'s Richard Roundtree). Meanwhile, her adoring family (Fred Hechinger, Parker Posey, and Clark Gregg) frantically search to stop her before she gets hurt! But fret not. <em>Thelma </em>is old-school fun that never mocks its retiree leads and always keeps comedy firmly in the scooter seat. </p><p>As I wrote in <a href="https://mashable.com/article/thelma-review-june-squibb" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Mashable's review out of Sundance</a>: "In the end, <em>Thelma </em>laughs at the absurdity of aging, not the elderly.... These heroes might fall, but like Tom Cruise, they'll get up again, perhaps inspiring us as they rise. Bolstered by some cheeky action tropes, including twists, chases, gunplay, and even an explosion, <em>Thelma </em>is more than a winsome romp. It's a real thrill."&nbsp;<em>&mdash; K.P.</em></p><p><strong>Starring:</strong> June Squibb, Fred Hechinger, Richard Roundtree, Parker Posey, and Clark Gregg</p><p><strong>How to watch:</strong> <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qx7GPP?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Thelma%20begins%20streaming%20on%20Hulu%20Nov.%2015.&object_type=article&object_uuid=07pMquX4DgyZw8fln6WpdRE&short_url=Qx7GPP&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Thelma </em>begins streaming on Hulu Nov. 15.</a></p><h2>1. <em>Fast and Furious: 1 - 6 </em></h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

<p><strong>For the Baker:</strong> A KitchenAid stand mixer is the ultimate gift for baking enthusiasts. With 10 speeds, a 4.5-quart bowl, and a tilt-head design that lets you add ingredients while mixing, it doesn't get much better than this for at-home baking gadgets. Plus, it looks beautiful on the countertop.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row pogoClear">

Fear not: Whether he's your husband, dad, grandpa, son, cousin, situationship, or friend, we've got you covered.</p><p>As with any great birthday gift, the key to success is to focus on what he's into. Is he an audiophile? Opt for headphones or a speaker. Is he an outdoorsman? There's plenty of outdoor gear ripe for the gifting. Does he love to entertain? Some fancy new kitchen accessories might be just the ticket.</p><p>If you don't know him well, we've also included some excellent crowd-pleaser picks, including a self-warming mug, board games, an instant camera, cool Lego sets for adults, and more. Whether you go the posh or the practical route, you're sure to find something that will make his day &mdash; and hopefully set him up for a great year ahead.</p><p>Here's our promise to you: This list will never include whiskey stones. We know they're probably great for the whiskey drinker, but if you're looking for a gift, we assume you already know about them. They are truly on every list.</p><p>Here are our picks for the best birthday gift ideas for men.</p><h2><strong>Ember Mug 2</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2>What is Connections?</h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer.</p><p>If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. Like <em>Wordle, </em>you can share the results with your friends on social media.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>What is Connections Sports Edition?</h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has launched in association with <em>The Athletic</em>, the New York Times property that provides the publication's sports coverage. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer.</p><p>If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. Like <em>Wordle, </em>you can share the results with your friends on social media.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

Words can be made from linked letters &mdash; up, down, left, right, or diagonal, but words can also change direction, resulting in quirky shapes and patterns. Every single letter in the grid will be part of an answer. There's always a theme linking every solution, along with the "spangram," a special, word or phrase that sums up that day's theme, and spans the entire grid horizontally or vertically.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

        </a>

<p>By providing an opaque hint and not providing the word list, Strands creates a brain-teasing game that takes a little longer to play than its other games, like <a href="https://mashable.com/category/wordle" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Wordle</a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/category/connections" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Connections</a>.</p><p>If you're feeling stuck or just don't have 10 or more minutes to figure out today's puzzle, we've got all the NYT Strands hints for today's puzzle you need to progress at your preferred pace.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>The problem with this very real nationwide scam is that it sounds improbable. </p><p>But thieves, who are often members of organized criminal networks, go into stores with gift card displays, pocket numerous cards, and tamper with the packaging in order to steal the barcode and PIN that recipients use to activate their card. Sometimes the fraud happens within the store itself, when a cashier swaps out your paid card for a dud during the activation process. </p><p>Either way, when the recipient attempts to access their gifted funds, the balance is confusingly zero. </p><p>The exact amount of gift card fraud is unclear, but if even one percent of the annual $570 billion Americans load on to gift cards each year is scammed, that could put consumer losses at more than $5 billion, according <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/maryland-gift-card-scams-prevention-act-walmart-incomm-retail" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">to an estimate provided to ProPublica</a>. </p><p>Aside from purchasing a digital or electronic gift card directly from the retailer or brand, there is no guaranteed way to avoid becoming a victim of gift card draining. But practicing these expert tips can add layers of protection: </p><h2>1. Inspect the gift card before buying it. </h2><p>Some scammers have gotten so good at tampering with gift cards that consumers don't know the difference. While <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/maryland-gift-card-scams-prevention-act-walmart-incomm-retail" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">legislation passed in Maryland this year</a> could ultimately improve gift card security nationwide, the products are still vulnerable to tampering. </p><p>That's why the <a href="https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/avoiding-and-reporting-gift-card-scams#commonscams" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Federal Trade Commission recommends</a> making sure that a card still has its protective sticker, and that it doesn't appear to have been manipulated. The PIN number on the back also should not be visible. If you suspect a card has been tampered with, give it to a store employee and choose a different one. </p><h2>2. Keep a copy of the gift card and the store receipt. </h2><p>The FTC recommends taking a picture of both the gift card and your purchase receipt. The card information, plus the transaction data on the receipt, can help you report fraud to both the gift card company and the store. </p><p>The <a href="https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/avoiding-and-reporting-gift-card-scams#contact" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">FTC maintains contact information</a> for major gift card companies. If you don't see contact information for your card on the FTC's list, try using the details provided on the card itself. <a href="https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Report it to the FTC</a> if the card issuer cannot be reached or refuses to speak with you.</p><h2>3. Buy gift cards from trustworthy merchants. </h2><p>You might be tempted to buy a gift card from an online auction site or other third party, but their offerings may be fake or stolen. For extra peace of mind, Jory MacKay, head of editorial content for the online safety product Aura, recommends buying gift cards directly from the brand's website. </p><h2>4. Purchase a gift card using a credit card with fraud protection.  </h2><p>If you have a credit card with fraud-protection benefits, MacKay suggests using it for a gift card purchase. That's because credit cards typically offer better security for unauthorized charges and may come with $0 fraud liability if you've been deceived by a scam. Be sure to keep the receipt as it will have details you may need to share with the credit card company. </p><h2>5. Consider buying multiple gift cards instead of one card for a large amount. </h2><p>Sure it can be satisfying to hand a loved one a gift card for an eye-popping value, but purchasing a number of smaller cards instead may be the wiser move, says MacKay. This way, your loss may be minimal if you unknowingly bought a drained card. </p><h2>6. Register the card online, if possible. </h2><p>You can register some gift cards online, which typically offers more protection and options to freeze the card or track the balance, says MacKay. It's also easier to report a drained card when it's been registered. </p><h2>7. Quickly use the card's balance. </h2><p>When you hand the card to the recipient, you might gently encourage them to spend the balance sooner than later, and register it if that's not already been done. </p><p>MacKay says unused cards are more vulnerable to potential theft and hacking. </p><p>If the card you gifted has a balance of zero, MacKay recommends first checking to make sure you have the receipt. </p><p>Then, contact the retailer or card issuer. They can help you determine whether the card was drained or tampered with prior to purchase. MacKay says that trusted stores and brands are likely to replace or refund the card, especially if you're quick to report the problem. </p><p>"The key is to act fast&mdash;getting on top of the issue early can help make sure your recipient gets the full value of their gift," MacKay says.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><strong>Musk's App Store interest</strong></p><p>While Musk might not lose any sleep over this after winning significant influence with the incoming Trump administration, App Store rankings have been a bit of an obsession for the owner of X.</p><p>Musk <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1856456726163136939" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>has</u></a> frequently <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1854574653865705922" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>boasted</u></a> about X <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1855652744302039323" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>hitting</u></a> #1 in the News <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1856454529971093521" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>category</u></a> on the U.S. and international App Store charts since the election. It should be noted that X doesn't really have much broad competition in the News category, as most apps in that section belong to traditional media outlets publishers like the <em>New York Times</em> or Fox News.&nbsp;</p><p>Aside from X and Reddit, most social media platforms categorize their iOS apps in the much more competitive Social Networking category. A first place ranking in that category translates to a first place ranking overall in the entire App Store, as Bluesky currently holds both distinctions. (For another example, Meta's WhatsApp iOS app is in third place in the Social Networking category and then in 8th place among the top charts.) </p><p>X, however, holds a first place ranking in the News category on the App Store, which only translates to 27th place overall.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[How I stopped worrying and learned to leave social media: Why focusing on self-care is what we need to move forward after 2024.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/02KAN6q6mMkhCuUfaLT6sAf/hero-image.jpg" alt="A smartphone screen gets smashed"><p>"I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it any more." </p><p>That's the apparently immortal line from <em>Network, </em>Paddy Chayefsky's acerbic Oscar-winning masterpiece from 1976. Deranged newsreader Howard Beale (played by Peter Finch in the movie, and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/bryan-cranston-howard-beale" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Bryan Cranston</a> in a theater version) urges his audience to scream it out of their windows, and his TV network capitalizes on the resulting outrage. Nearly 50 years later, Beale looks ever more the mad prophet &mdash; not just of the airwaves, but of social media. </p><p>Indeed, Beale's line might be the only unifying scream across both sides of the political gulf, one that opened ever wider online between the 2016 and 2024 U.S. presidential elections. We don't even agree on basic facts any more. What we <em>do</em> agree on is that we're mad as hell about the other side, and we're not going to take this nonsense from them one minute longer. Let's find someone being wrong on the internet and dunk on them!   </p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>But in the wake of the 2024 election, it's time to quit, even as we steel ourselves for the actual IRL fights that lie ahead. Because here's the thing we forgot about being Howard Beale: It's the opposite of being politically effective. It can leave you <em>sad</em> as hell, not to mention frazzled and sick, and you shouldn't take it anymore.  </p><p>The newsreader ended up as a conspiracy-addled cypher, his unfocused <em>cri de coeur</em> at <gestures at all of this> used by a media conglomerate three times over. The network tore the guardrails of decency off Beale's newscast, turning it into a rant-fueled variety show in which Beale literally collapsed every night. It persuaded Beale to start spouting its owner's vision of inhuman capitalism. And in the end &mdash; well, no spoilers if you haven't seen it, but let's just say Beale's contract is terminated with extreme prejudice. </gestures></p><p>If we are to avoid becoming a world of a billion Howard Beales, then the first thing we have to do is <em>stop</em> the screaming &mdash; and the social media doomscrolling that goes with it. It's not just that every click and thumb-flick of your feed is being monetized by <a href="https://mashable.com/article/musk-trump-president" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">billionaires who have already padded their wealth significantly thanks to a highly divisive election</a>. </p><p>It's that doomscrolling is paralyzing, and the one thing your causes need is for you to not be paralyzed. </p><h2>How I stopped worrying and learned to leave social media</h2><p>Towards the end of the first Trump administration, I delved into the history of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/self-care-history" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">self-care as a necessary political act</a>. The TL;DR was this: Philosophers and activists from Socrates to Audre Lorde have been trying to tell us what self-care isn't (retreats, spas, champagne, Instagram glow-ups) and what it is (time that feeds the soul, which in turn makes you a better citizen, able to use your strength to help the underprivileged in any society). </p><p>But, as I realized sending that story to friends who were burned out or terrified by the 2024 election results, I hadn't exactly been take my own advice. Twitter was my social media outrage drug of choice, one I persuaded myself I needed for work even as I largely abandoned Facebook. </p><p>The end result: I too had gotten mad as hell. Even in the wake of a billionaire buying it and turning it into X, an echo chamber that boosts hard-right voices including his own, even as I posted much less as a result, I persuaded myself of the importance of bearing witness to the craziness in all my spare moments. </p><p>Daily I enlarged my own echo chamber &mdash; one that had convinced itself that all the wrong voices on the other side were heading for a fall. </p><p>I quit Twitter (<a href="https://mashable.com/article/stephen-king-trolls-elon-musk-twitter-x" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">in common with Stephen King</a>, I <a href="https://mashable.com/article/elon-musk-meet-twitter-resistance" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">still call it that</a>) on election night, in the same way one might quit a TV show that has gone on past its time. I could see the next few episodes with Cassandra-like clarity. Twitter/X would become a dunking machine. There would be a lot of recrimination in the echo chambers of the left, a lot of <em>woulda coulda shoulda</em>. Keyboard warriors and bots on the winning side would be emboldened; their victims would need defending. </p><p>Mad as hell, projecting wider fears on the smallest targets, everyone from every online constituency would be highly motivated to dunk on each other for the mildest offense. Nothing, not even <a href="https://mashable.com/article/elon-musk-twitter-trump-tactics" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">the doomscrolling bot</a> that gained many users in Musk's early days, can save us from the pointless time-suck of getting mad online, that distraction from the real work of grieving and moving on. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>In the week since I quit cold turkey, I have felt the missing limb of Twitter less than I expected. Muscle memory made me tap the X icon on my phone a couple times, so I moved it to the back of my news folder; no performative deleting necessary. Maybe someone somewhere would have had a hollow laugh at the would-be tweet that bubbled up in my head post-election: <em>this is like if the time traveler who changed the future by stepping on a butterfly went back and stomped on it again. </em></p><p>But is that really the best use of my time now, throwing nerdy political posts against the wall to see if they stick?   </p><p>To my surprise, I haven't felt uninformed or disengaged. The news has come to my inbox anyway, thanks to a bunch of newsletters with a high signal-to-noise ratio, and a network of activated friends that transcends social media. I do not miss the endless dissection of each announcement from the incoming administration. My blood pressure, which hit new highs on November 5, has come down steadily ever since. </p><p>Shorn of the endless scroll, I spent more time in the real world. My modest donation to <a href="https://shecan.global/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">an organization that funds education for girls around the world</a> will, in the long run, make more of a difference than Ray Bradbury reference tweets. </p><p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/bluesky-post-election-user-growth-elon-musk-x" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Bluesky has seen a massive uptick in adoption post-election</a>. My account is ready to go; depending on how 2025 plays out, perhaps I'll join the Twitter refugees there. But not before my self-care regimen has become more soulful: more deep reading, less surface tweeting, all the better to meet the needs of a future filled with storm clouds. </p><p>Retreating into books doesn't mean you're not meeting the needs of the moment. Quite the opposite: when society takes a dystopian turn, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/dystopia-book-club-catalyst" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">dystopian novels can provide effective frames</a> for those who wish to change it. To quote the title of an excellent 2024 nonfiction book on the subject of psychological warfare: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stories-Are-Weapons-Psychological-American/dp/0393881512" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Stories are Weapons</em></a>. </p><p>Which brings us back to the Howard Beale story we've been telling ourselves for five decades, but need to quit now. With a little tweaking, the fictional newsman's rant &mdash; which helped yield our 21st century world &mdash; can lead us to a better one:</p><p><em>I don't have to tell you things are bad. Everybody knows things are bad. There's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do and there's no end to it. We sit in the house and slowly the world we're living in &mdash; on our phones &mdash; is getting smaller. I don't want you to protest, I don't want you to riot, I don't want you to write to your Congressman because I wouldn't know what to tell you to write. I don't know what to do about depression, and the fact that people don't understand inflation, and the Russians, and the criminal now entering the White House. </em></p><p><em>All I know is that first, you've got to stop getting mad. You've got to say "I'm a human being, goddammit! My life has value!" Turn off your social media right now, turn it off. Feel your grief inside and declare: "I'm as sad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!"</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>He posted a few videos of her reacting to the acoustic song on his Instagram story, in which she mostly just laughs. In a video Priscilla posted on her Instagram Story, Mark asks, "Is that the most romantic thing I've done or what?"</p><p>"It's so romantic," she says. "Twenty-one years later I can't get quite as low, but it brings back a lot of fun memories."</p><p>You can even listen to the song on Spotify. (It's listed under Zuck and T-Pain's duo moniker, Z-Pain.) </p><div class="mx-auto mt-4 max-w-2xl">

<p>Zuckerberg has many flaws but his public admiration of his wife is not one of them. It feels so nice to see a tech giant like their partner that it almost doesn't matter if it's a PR strategy or not. </p><p>Does he love his wife so loudly because he loves his wife or because it makes him look good to the public? We will probably never <em>really</em> know. The man is worth $200 billion. If he wanted to, he could have forced a reunion of Lil Jon &amp; the East Side Boyz to preform a private rendition of the song. But he chose to make this single public. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>There's really no point in sitting around and waiting for <a href="https://mashable.com/category/black-friday" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Black Friday</a> to score a <s>good</s> great deal on an iPad. On this random Wednesday in November, we're already seeing a record-low price on the 13-inch M2 iPad Air.</p><p>Released earlier this year, the M2 iPad Air has seen many discounts over the last six months &mdash; including on <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-prime-day-ipad-deals-2024-day-two" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Prime Day</a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/amazon-prime-day-2024-ipad-deals-still-live" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Prime Big Deal Days</a>. But none have been as impressive as today's $200 discount. As of Nov. 13, you can grab the <a href="https://zdcs.link/avxjlq?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=13-inch%20M2%20iPad%20Air&object_type=article&object_uuid=02CGd4RXcECYQWHqfGMJ7wx&short_url=avxjlq&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">13-inch M2 iPad Air</a> with 512GB of storage and WiFi connectivity for just $899 instead of $1,099. That's an 18% discount and the lowest price on record by around $100. There's just one catch: The discount is only available on the purple model.</p><p>Aesthetically, not much changed between <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ipad-air-2024-new-features" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">the 2022 iPad Air and the 2024 iPad Air</a>, but internally the M2 chip gives it an impressive upgrade. As Mashable's Kim Gedeon noted in her <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-ipad-air-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">review</a>, "The M2 chip brings sweet energy efficiency and a performance uptick." Its zippy performance allows it to keep up with the big dogs, including some of <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-laptops" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">our favorite laptops</a> &mdash; like the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/asus-zenbook-duo" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Asus Zenbook Duo</a>. Not to mention, its battery life lasted three hours longer than expected when we tested it (13 hours versus the promised 10). </p><p>It's not going to blow you away as much as the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qx7G5P?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=iPad%20Pro&object_type=article&object_uuid=02CGd4RXcECYQWHqfGMJ7wx&short_url=Qx7G5P&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">iPad Pro</a>, but it's not meant to. It's also much easier on your wallet. If you don't mind the color purple, snag it on sale for just $899 while the deal sticks around.</p>]]></content:encoded>

But, for one reason or another, the term "crash out" or "crashing out" is everywhere this week. </p><p>For the unfamiliar, crashing out boils down to losing it. As <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Crash%20Out" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Urban Dictionary</a> puts it, to crash out is to "get really mad or upset; lose all your self-control." It can also mean that you're almost willingly entering a situation &mdash; or acting a certain way &mdash; that will prove harmful in the long term.</p><p>If you've been online lately, you've likely seen people talking about crashing out. Go on <a href="https://mashable.com/category/twitter" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">X</a>, the app formerly known as Twitter, and you'll see recent, super-viral posts using the term crash out. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>To be clear: This is not some new phrase.Younger folks, especially, have been using the term for quite some time. But, at least to my eye, it's ramped up in the past few weeks. </p><p>Why might that be? Well, for one, there's quite a lot to crash out about these days. While young voters did swing toward President-elect Donald Trump in 2024, the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/g-s1-33331/unpacking-the-2024-youth-vote-heres-what-we-know-so-far" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">majority of voters</a> under 30 still voted for Vice President Kamala Harris. Those young Harris voters, women especially, might be feeling like it's a time for crashing out. </p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

Nothing seems to inspire a "crash out" more than a bad breakup.</p><p>But, in general, the internet these days seems to really latch onto words and phrases. And it might just be "crash out's" time. Back in August, when the entire internet was <em>very demure</em>, I <a href="https://mashable.com/article/demure-tiktok-meaning-tiktok-language" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">wrote about TikTok's propensity for shaping language</a>. </p><p>I wrote at the time: </p><blockquote><p>"Think of it this way: in your group of friends &mdash; especially during high school or college &mdash; you probably had buzzwords and shorthand that only your group understood. You spent so much time together that you developed an internal language. TikTok&rsquo;s influence on our word usage is similar, only now the friend group is essentially everyone with an internet connection."</p></blockquote><p>Right now, that collective group is latching onto crashing out. The phrase, though not new, is a trend of sorts. As <a href="https://mashable.com/article/gen-z-internet-slang-defined-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Mashable's Elena Cavender has covered</a>, the internet cycles through this slang with relative rapidity. So right now we're all crashing out &mdash; but that likely won't last. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Considering Mashable reporter Alex Perry called this laptop "just about the ideal work-from-home (or work-from-<em>wherever</em>, really) companion," <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-macbook-air-m2-2022-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">in his review</a>, this memory upgrade is certainly welcome. </p><h3>More MacBook and Mac deals</h3><p><strong>MacBook Air (13-inch)</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/Jpx3q?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20MacBook%20Air%2C%2013-inch%20%28M1%2C%208GB%20RAM%2C%20256GB%20SSD%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=041lr4Bh7dPDZhB40gfwR0w&short_url=Jpx3q&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple MacBook Air, 13-inch (M1, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD)</a> &mdash;

This model typically doesn't see price drops of $100, let alone $200. The M2-powered tablet works well for folks who prefer their tablet to double as a laptop, as <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-ipad-air-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Mashable tech editor Kim Gedeon writes in her review</a>.  The 13 inches of display could be a welcome upgrade for artists (though this tablet comes with a 60Hz LCD panel compared to the iPad Pro's OLED display). That said, Gedeon noted that in ideal lighting, it's hard to tell the difference between the displays on the Pro and the Air.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-watch-series-10-hands-on" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Read more from Mashable about the Apple Watch Series 10.</em></a></p><p>The Apple Watch Series 10 is officially $50 off, marking its biggest discount to date. Last Black Friday, we saw the Series 9 Watch drop down to $329 for a total markdown of $70 off. We wouldn't be surprised to see a similar deal this time around, but if you don't want to wait a couple weeks (and risk any colors selling out), this is a solid price on this smartwatch that just dropped two months ago.</p><h3>More Apple Watch deals</h3><p><strong>Series 10</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/z6bAqY?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20Watch%20Series%2010%20%2846mm%2C%20GPS%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=041lr4Bh7dPDZhB40gfwR0w&short_url=z6bAqY&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple Watch Series 10 (46mm, GPS)</a> &mdash; <strong>$379</strong> <s>$429</s> (save $50)</p></li></ul><p><strong>SE</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/QLn4Gm?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20Watch%20SE%20%2840mm%2C%20GPS%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=041lr4Bh7dPDZhB40gfwR0w&short_url=QLn4Gm&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple Watch SE (40mm, GPS)</a> &mdash; <strong>$189</strong> <s>$249</s> (save $60)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/QKD6ly?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20Watch%20SE%20%2844mm%2C%20GPS%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=041lr4Bh7dPDZhB40gfwR0w&short_url=QKD6ly&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple Watch SE (44mm, GPS)</a> &mdash; <strong>$219</strong> <s>$279</s> (save $60)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/z3b6kP?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20Watch%20SE%20%2840mm%2C%20GPS%20%2B%20cellular%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=041lr4Bh7dPDZhB40gfwR0w&short_url=z3b6kP&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple Watch SE (40mm, GPS + cellular)</a> &mdash; <strong>$239 </strong><s>$299</s> (save $60)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/zjGgMM?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20Watch%20SE%20%2844mm%2C%20GPS%20%2B%20cellular%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=041lr4Bh7dPDZhB40gfwR0w&short_url=zjGgMM&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple Watch SE (44mm, GPS + cellular)</a> &mdash; <strong>$269</strong> <s>$329</s> (save $60)</p></li></ul><p><strong>Ultra</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/a5bmk8?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20Watch%20Ultra%202%20%2849mm%2C%20GPS%20%2B%20cellular%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=041lr4Bh7dPDZhB40gfwR0w&short_url=a5bmk8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple Watch Ultra 2 (49mm, GPS + cellular)</a> &mdash; <strong>$699.99</strong> <s>$799</s> (save $99.01)</p></li></ul><h2>AirPods deals ahead of Black Friday</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row pogoClear">

<p>Musk appears to be positioning himself to encourage Trump to bring his trusted employees and allies into the administration, aiming to secure favorable outcomes for his ventures.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d207c4a9-0e6d-4ece-a44d-abf890316b5a" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Financial Times</u></em></a>, some of the likely names that Musk will float include individuals like Steve Davis, president of The Boring Company, Musk's tunneling company that is <a href="https://nevadacurrent.com/briefs/musks-boring-company-makes-list-of-dirty-dozen-workplace-safety-offenders/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">ranked as one of the worst for workplace safety</a>. Davis played an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/08/us/politics/elon-musk-steve-davis-trump-super-pac.html" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">important role</a> with Musk's pro-Trump lobbying group America Pac this year<strong>.</strong> Davis was also the key figure Musk <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/boring-company-ceo-identified-twitter-employees-layoff-report-2023-2" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">relied on to cut</a> 80 percent of then-Twitter's employees shortly after Musk acquired the platform now known as X.</p><p>Musk will likely also turn to Omead Afshar, who helped Musk with Twitter layoffs and the cutting of 14,000 jobs at Tesla earlier this year.</p><p>Musk's most trusted associate Jared Birchall will likely also play a role in Trump's administration, if Musk has any sway. Birchall has been referred to as Musk's right-hand man and runs his family office while also working directly with Musk's xAI, Neuralink, and The Boring Company. Birchall also played a major role in Musk's Twitter acquisition.</p><h2><strong>SpaceX may benefit the most</strong></h2><p>The Musk company with the most to gain from relaxed regulations and favorable government contracts is his space exploration company SpaceX. According to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/us/politics/elon-musk-trump-benefits.html" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>New York Times</u></em></a>, Musk asked Trump to consider SpaceX employees for positions with the Department of Defense, including Senior Vice President for Global Business and Affairs Tim Hughes, former Air Force general and SpaceX advisor Terrence J. O&rsquo;Shaughnessy, and Senior Director of Government Affairs Mathew Dunn.</p><p>While Tesla already <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/policy/economy/news/elon-musk-is-speaking-out-against-government-subsidies-hereaposs-a-list-of-the-billions-of-dollars-his-businesses-have-received-/slidelist/88303093.cms" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">benefits from tax credits</a>, Musk's EV company will find itself further wrapped up in regulatory issues as it looks to push the autonomous driving capabilities of its planned robotaxi. While most of these conflicts are at the state level, Musk may look to leverage the federal government to exert pressure on these regulators. Peter Scheutzow, Tesla's head of autopilot and AI, and safety chief Suraj Nagaraj, are also potential Musk-backed candidates for roles within the administration.</p><p>And, of course, no list of potential Musk candidates would be complete without his fellow Silicon Valley elites. Venture capitalists and hedge funders like David Sacks, Jason Calacanis, and Bill Ackman have all become more active in pro-Musk politics online and could certainly play a role in a Trump administration. Musk's weapon-tech buddies like Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale and Anduril co-founder Palmer Luckey could also potentially find a place within Trump's Department of Defense.</p><p>Regardless of who Trump picks, things within the U.S. government are looking very good for Elon Musk in the coming years &ndash; as long as he stays on Trump's good side.</p><h2><strong>Department of Government Efficiency</strong></h2><p class="mx-auto">
   <em><strong>UPDATE: Nov. 13, 2024, 12:04 p.m. EST </strong>Just days after this piece was originally published, Trump officially announced the Department of Government Efficiency, headed up by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy.</em>
</p>
<p>In addition to pushing for Trump to choose his appointment recommendations, it appears Musk already got his dream governmental job &ndash; a position technically outside of government so he doesn't have to divest from his companies.</p><p>The <a href="https://mashable.com/article/trump-elon-musk-doge-department-government-efficiency" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Department of Government Efficiency</a> or "DOGE" isn't a real government agency. It&rsquo;s a temporary group, with a deadline set by Trump for July 2026, that will provide cost-cutting recommendations aimed at achieving "a smaller Government, with more efficiency and less bureaucracy."</p><p>Its hard to imagine that Musk's recommendations won't include slashing regulations and governmental agencies that stand in the way of his companies making even more money.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>For some of us, coffee is the reason we get out of bed in the morning. It's a bright way to start the day that feels like a warm, comforting hug, especially in the depths of dark winter mornings. These days, we have tons of options when it comes to making a morning cup of coffee. There's the unfussy French press or a standard drip machine, but some prefer a creamy latte or a spicy mocha. </p><p>If you prefer something more akin to a coffee-house drink, it might be worth the investment to own your own espresso machine. While some espresso machines come with a hefty price, they often save money in the long run since they help curtail swinging by the drive-thru for a quick latte on the go. </p><p>If you're ready to dive into making coffee-house drinks at home, winter is a great time to hone in on your skills.

While excelling in looks, it also packs a punch when it comes to performance. The Caf&eacute; Bellissimo has everything needed to make espresso drinks at home, including a built-in conical burr grinder and milk frother. The steam wand's 180-degree rotation makes it easy to use while creating your perfect milk foam while you also select either a single or double shot of espresso. </p><p>Preheating the machine takes under 80 seconds and there's a large capacity water reservoir which means you won't have to refill it often. Plus, the machine's auto-shut off kicks in after 20 minutes, so you'll never need to sit in the office and wonder if you need to call a neighbor to go turn it off. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Fire TV Cube is Amazon's fastest streaming player, and it includes an octa-core processor. The retail giant claims that makes it twice as powerful as the Fire TV Stick 4K Max, and it comes with built-in Alexa support so all you need to do is call out what you want to watch and search for it. It's also compatible as a smart home hub, if you need it: it can control your TV itself, soundbar, and other audio equipment like a receiver.</p><p>You can stream from just about any service on the Fire TV Cube, and it supports 4K, Dolby Vision, HDR, and Dolby Atmos. With WiFi 6 capability, you'll get it all lightning fast, too. Plus, it's a cube-shaped box that's easy to tuck away somewhere inconspicuous; it's bigger than a streaming stick, but small enough that it won't get in the way. </p><p>Grab the cube while it's on sale ahead of Black Friday.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Trump likened the new venture to a modern Manhattan Project &mdash; the secret U.S. program that developed the atomic bomb, devastating Japanese civilian populations and changing warfare and international politics from WWII on. Under the new administration, DOGE appears to be a downsizing weapon in the war against "corruption" in the administrative state, helmed by what Ramaswamy and Musk call "<a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1855828970807406610" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">a band of small-government revolutionaries</a>."</p><p>But what exactly will this meme-mandated agency do under the new administration, and what will a more "efficient" government under Musk look like? </p><h2>What will the 'Department of Government Efficiency' do?</h2><p>Though its name suggests otherwise, the "Department of Government Efficiency" <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/13/department-of-government-efficiency-musk-ramaswamy/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">isn't a department at all</a>, but rather a commission or advisory body consulting with the president on spending and regulations. While Congress retains oversight of large budgetary actions, advisory groups like DOGE can advise members under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, and both Trump and Musk have said the agency would have the power to make some cuts.  </p><p>Musk also claimed the agency would retain a publicly accessible scoreboard of its cuts, open for feedback, and a leaderboard of "most insanely dumb spending" of tax dollars. "The entertainment value will be epic," he <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1856524169338314838" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">said</a>. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>DOGE's streamlining plans, helmed by the private sector, aren't a new concept for the federal government, nor is the notion of outside advisors aiding in the implementation of a president's vision, including Trump's "Save America" plan, unprecedented. The executive branch's current <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Office of Management and Budget (OMB)</a> is tasked with managing and coordinating the president's policy, budget, and regulatory objectives. Trump's picks, however, have been pegged to bring an "entrepreneurial approach" to government at an unprecedented scale, working alongside the OMB to make the government "smaller," according to the president-elect. </p><p>In Trump's words, this involves "dismantling government bureaucracy, slashing excess regulations, cutting wasteful expenditures, and restructuring federal agencies." In the announcement, the president-elect said the DOGE's work would last through July 4, 2026. Ramaswamy has said the pseudo-department's first task will be "crowdsourcing examples of government waste, fraud, and abuse" from Americans at large. </p><p>The department's announcement has been met with a mix of support and derision from both parties. "I&rsquo;m a Democrat for Government Efficiency," <a href="https://x.com/deanbphillips/status/1856690016275095957" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">posted</a> Democratic Minnesota congressman Dean Phillips, in support of the announcement. Ramaswamy responded: "Welcome aboard to Americans for Government Efficiency!" Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren was more critical, swiping at the fact that DOGE will have two executives leading it. &ldquo;The Office of Government Efficiency is off to a great start with split leadership: two people to do the work of one person,&rdquo; <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/elizabeth-warren-musk-ramaswamy-doge-trump-b2646365.html" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Warren said</a>. &ldquo;Yeah, this seems REALLY efficient.&rdquo;</p><h2>What is on the 'DOGE' chopping block?</h2><p>The agency continues the regulatory shedding that became a beacon of Trump's previous presidential term, which targeted federal safety regulations, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/trump-paris-climate-withdraw-bad-idea-why" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">climate policy</a>, and even <a href="https://mashable.com/article/donald-trump-nasa-program-cancellation" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">space exploration</a>. Boosted by Musk and Ramaswamy's own gusto for "streamlining" workforces (aka laying people off), most recently <a href="https://%20https://mashable.com/article/twitter-employees-react-to-elon-musk-layoffs" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">modeled under Musk's takeover of X/Twitter</a>, the conservative shrinking is set to begin again.  </p><h3>Slashing of federal agencies</h3><p>During his first term, Trump tried and failed to downsize more than a dozen federal agencies. Past comments from both Musk and Ramaswamy show an eagerness to carry on his mission and hit agencies first. Musk has previously said he would like to cut the number of agencies down from 400 to a striking 99. </p><p>Ramaswamy has previously alluded to the dismantling of the FBI, the the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives; the Nuclear Regulatory Commission; the Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service; and, to mass outcry, the Department of Education. He's also said he would limit the power of the Federal Reserve. </p><p>A major part of the Trump campaign's goals, Musk has also publicly posted about eliminating the Department of Education, which he says isn't "<a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1856021153359286325" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">great value for money</a>."</p><h3>Budget cuts and federal employee layoffs</h3><p>The Trump administration has made a big show of supporting federal spending cuts, with Musk adding to the budget austerity cries with claims that he would help trim the federal spending by $2 trillion. Musk has since reposted <a href="https://x.com/stclairashley/status/1856543038593515750" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">several</a> <a href="https://x.com/CollinRugg/status/1856538155211526300" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">X threads</a> positing examples of "ridiculous" spending, which include several public health campaigns and federal science grants.</p><p>In his own presidential campaign, Ramaswamy promised to cut 75 percent of the civilian federal workforce &mdash; or 1.7 million jobs &mdash; in order to diminish federal spending and trim waste. </p><h3>Clearing of federal regulations</h3><p>DOGE's leaders have both spoken out about loosening the chokehold of federal regulations within the last 24 hours.  </p><p>"The world is suffering slow strangulation by overregulation. Every year, the noose tightens a little more. We finally have a mandate to delete the mountain of choking regulations that do not serve the greater good," said Musk in a recent X <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1856729913148989710" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">post</a>. </p><p>Ramaswamy cited several U.S. Supreme Court decisions in a claim that "eliminating bureaucratic regulations isn&rsquo;t a mere policy preference. It&rsquo;s a legal <em>mandate</em>."</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Musk, owner of transportation companies Tesla and SpaceX, has previously taken issue with the regulatory power of the Federal Aviation Administration and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Ramaswamy, founder of pharmaceutical company Roivant Sciences, called the Food and Drug Administration's "<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/how-musks-us-government-efficiency-panel-might-work-2024-11-13/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">regulations hypocritical, harmful, and unconstitutional</a>."</p><p>In a statement issued Wednesday, American Federation of Government Employees National President Everett Kelley said, "Budget cuts of this magnitude, coupled with the massive tax reductions Trump has said he will implement, will affect vital programs that tens of millions of Americans currently rely on for their financial security and their health and safety. This includes Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, food assistance for low-income families, veterans&rsquo; benefits and health care, and so much more,"</p><p>"To really attack government waste, the administration should target private contractors who are price gouging American taxpayers to deliver poorer service at higher cost while their corporate profits and executive pay skyrocket."</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The length of the sentence also has to do with Teixeira pleading guilty to six charges of willfully disseminating national defense information under the Espionage Act. The leaks, which were shared on Discord over the course of about a year between 2022 and 2023, allegedly included information about providing aid to Ukraine, among other things.</p><p>No matter how wild and weird your friend group's Discord server is, it probably will never live up to that.</p><p></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you spend a lot of time gaming, there's one accessory you can never have too many of: controllers. There are tons of reasons why you might need more than one (or even two), including controller drift, new color releases, and general griminess. And maybe you're starting to feel a little badly about giving all your guests the third-party controller that's just a little worse to play with than the official option. Whatever the case may be, you can snag a new Xbox controller today for a great price thanks to this early <a href="https://mashable.com/category/black-friday" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Black Friday</a> deal. </p><p>As of Nov. 13, you can get an <a href="https://zdcs.link/91b08x?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Xbox%20wireless%20controller&object_type=article&object_uuid=03ALmZ8UJR4BoOjEAYf2bkk&short_url=91b08x&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Xbox wireless controller</a> in Velocity Green from QVC for $34.99 when you use promo code <strong>HOLIDAY30</strong>.

Keep in mind that you will need to be a new QVC customer to be eligible for this deal, and you will need to make an account, even if you plan on shopping as a guest.

<p>The Velocity Green color is a fun, bright option (and a great way to keep brat summer alive) that gives the original white and black options a run for their money. It's a standard yet versatile controller that you can use with all Xbox consoles, from the Series X to the Xbox One and Windows devices as well. It even makes a great Steam controller. It also has a hybrid D-pad with textured grip and a Share button built-in so you can take screenshots and send or share them with others. </p><p>Grab one or a few to have on offer if something happens to the one you have; you can always keep one on reserve and charging while you game with another.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As a refresher, actual Black Friday is on Nov. 29 in 2024. That two-week window for Black Friday shopping seems more than adequate until you remember that <a href="https://mashable.com/article/early-black-friday-2024-best-buy-deals" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/early-black-friday-2024-target-deals" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Target</a>, and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/early-black-friday-2024-walmart-deals" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Walmart</a> have been in their Black Friday bag since October, announcing their Black Friday calendars before Halloween and hosting early events on and off throughout November. Isn't it so casual and normal that a Black Friday event kicking off an entire week before Thanksgiving would still be considered late?</p><p>It's possible that Amazon chilled a little longer than the other retailers because it needed some extra time to regroup after <a href="https://mashable.com/category/prime-day" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">October Prime Day</a>, which happened barely a month ago. (Not that Amazon's ever been one to take a breather if there's money to be made.)</p><h2>What will be on sale at Amazon for Black Friday?</h2><p>This limbo period between Prime Day and the start of the sale on Nov. 21 doesn't mean there are no good deals at Amazon right now. Actually, the Prime Day that<em> just </em>happened provides some good intel on what record-low pricing we might see return (or be beaten) come the start of Amazon's Black Friday sale: <a href="https://mashable.com/article/amazon-prime-day-2024-apple-macbook-deals-still-live" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">MacBooks</a> and the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/oct-8-prime-day-2024-apple-ipad-mini-deal" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">iPad Mini</a> come to mind.</p><p>We're already seeing early <a href="https://mashable.com/article/early-black-friday-2024-robot-vacuum-deals" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">robot vacuum deals</a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/early-black-friday-2024-fire-tablet-deals" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Fire tablet deals</a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/early-black-friday-2024-headphones-and-speakers-deals" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">headphone deals</a>, and more live at Amazon in early November, including a handful of prices that match or beat record-low sale prices we saw in October for Prime Big Deal Days. In the press release, Amazon specifically mentioned these upcoming savings:</p><ul><li><p>Up to 55% off Echos, the 50-inch 4 Series Fire TV and 55-inch Omni QLED Fire TV, and Kindles</p></li><li><p>Up to 50% off robot vacuums from iRobot, Roborock, and Shark</p></li><li><p>Up to 45% off laptops from HP, Lenovo, and Acer</p></li><li><p>Up to 45% off kitchen appliances from Cuisinart, Nutribullet, and KitchenAid</p></li><li><p>Up to 40% off Dyson vacuums and air purifiers and up to 20% off Dyson hair care</p></li></ul><p>The list goes on, but it's your expected heavy hitters. Check out our coverage from <a href="https://mashable.com/article/amazon-prime-day-deals-2024-still-live" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">October Prime Day</a> for more details on the brands and categories Amazon likes to focus on during big sale events.</p><h2>What's the difference between Prime Day and Black Friday?</h2><p>While much of the same stuff goes on sale for both events, the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/prime-day-vs-black-friday" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">main difference between Prime Day and Black Friday</a> is that you don't need to be a Prime member to access most of Amazon's Black Friday deals. (We can't promise that some discounts won't be under Prime lock, but the chances are much, much lower when the sale event isn't one Amazon made up for itself.) In fact, many Amazon purchases over a certain amount can still qualify for free few-day shipping &mdash;&nbsp;so if you can manage to not be such a last-minute shopper, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-cancel-amazon-prime" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">you don't necessarily need to pay $14.99 per month</a> for November and December just to get free shipping.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

Amazon will still prioritize its own Fire TVs, of course, but it's much more likely to throw other, more premium TV deals (like Samsung's The Frame) into the mix. Amazon did drop tons of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/october-prime-day-2024-lego-deals" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">record-low Lego deals during Prime Day</a>, so expect those to make a return. Other toys in the spotlight (as mentioned by the press release) include up to 50% off Disney, Marvel, American Girl, Hot Wheels, Barbie, Fisher-Price, and Star Wars.</p><p>And remember: Prime Day might officially be Amazon's thing, but Black Friday is every store's thing. A lot of good deals at Amazon might exist (or be better) at another retailer, and other stores might have better deals selections in categories where Amazon has slim pickings.</p><h2>Pro tip: Don't forget to check Amazon price history before buying</h2><p>To confirm whether a deal at Amazon is "good" or not, you can paste the listing URL into Amazon price history tracker <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Camelcamelcamel</a> to see how low that item's price has dropped in the past.</p><p>Cross-checking price history on Camelcamelcamel or the product's MSRP listed on that brand's official website is a smart habit to get into &mdash;&nbsp;Amazon has a habit of inflating some list prices to make discounts look much steeper than they are. Speaking of shopping cautiously at Amazon, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/what-not-to-buy-october-prime-day-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">all of our same tips</a> about avoiding products sold or shipped by third-party sellers still apply (especially on big tech investments like laptops and TVs).</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If your holiday plans involve checking a bag on a flight, you'll want to include a Bluetooth tracker in your luggage. With the Tile app on your smartphone, you'll have constant access to the whereabouts of your bag. In Mashable's review of the <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-bluetooth-trackers" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">best Bluetooth trackers</a>, the Tile Pro earns the title of the best alternative to the popular AirTag, and it's a great option if you have an Android device since the AirTag is only compatible with iOS.</p><p>But the Tile Pro is useful for so much more than just luggage. Thanks to the tracker's design, you can attach it to your keyring, wallet, bag, or almost anything else you tend to misplace. If your lost item is within a range of 500 feet, you can follow the app's instructions to play a sound on the Tile Pro, giving you a way to follow the sound to your lost item.</p><p>This deal on the Tile Pro includes two trackers, one black and one white. Use both yourself to track two items or share with family members. They can also make great gifts if you have a forgetful friend. </p><p>Instead of paying the typical $59.99 for the 2-pack, save $12 at Amazon and get two <a href="https://zdcs.link/91b008?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Tile%20Pros&object_type=article&object_uuid=02G95DsZIyo5anGbj5aXyxB&short_url=91b008&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Tile Pros</a> for just $47.99 and remove a stress point from the holidays this year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Discussion about 4B has grown in Western online spaces in recent years. In 2023, The Cut published a widely-discussed <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/4b-movement-feminism-south-korea.html" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>explainer on 4B</u></a> (that's since been updated in light of the election).</p><p>4B emerged in South Korea as a part of a wider feminist wave that swept the country from the late 2010s to early 2020s, Jung told Mashable over email. There were heated discussions on and offline about misogyny, patriarchy, gender violence, and gender discrimination. <a href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2024/10/602_370268.html" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Korea has a steep gender pay gap</u></a> and was also ranked last among 29 OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries for <a href="https://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20240308050439" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>women's working environment</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>A major part of these discussions was about the uneven burden women face in terms of domestic labor and caregiving, oftentimes at the expense of personal aspirations, Jung said. Around this time, the term "no marriage" &mdash; roughly translated to "willfully unmarried" &mdash; began to become popular and widely used for women who chose not to marry.&nbsp;</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>"4B is at the extreme end of the whole spectrum of women in South Korea who choose to stay single and childless," Jung said. The arguments for 4B, according to the women involved that Jung spoke to, come down to being tired of the patriarchal culture ingrained in the institution of marriage, societal pressure to marry and have children, and intimate partner violence (IPV) and lack of protection for victims. These women choose to boycott marriage and even romantic relationships with men until society and men change how they treat women.</p><p>With <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-43534074" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>South Korea's #MeToo movement</u></a>, IPV, and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/why-south-korea-is-high-alert-over-deepfake-sex-crimes-2024-08-30/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>digital sex crimes</u></a> gaining public attention in the late 2010s &mdash; coupled with the "no marriage" precedent in the country &mdash; there was momentum for 4B to settle and become more popularized, said sociology Ph.D. candidate at Yale University, Meera Choi, who studies the 4B movement.</p><p>There aren't definite numbers of how many women are in the 4B movement in South Korea. Those who identify as feminists in Korea are subject to harassment, bullying, career setbacks, and even job loss and violence, Jung said. So some 4B followers don't share this publicly.</p><p>Both Jung and Choi said that there is a broader discontent about marriage and childbearing among South Korean women beyond those who identify as 4B. Also, some women are choosing to be childless and single and not identify as 4B because they don't see it as a political statement.</p><p>"The core message of the 4B movement is a far more condensed, intense, and outspoken version of the frustration and grievances many ordinary South Korean women feel about the institution of marriage or patriarchal family culture in general," Jung said.&nbsp;</p><h2>Why are American women talking about 4B?</h2><p>Donald Trump's win spurred discussion about 4B in the U.S., as did misogynistic gloating in its wake &mdash; such as <a href="https://mashable.com/article/elon-musk-twitter-reinstates-nick-fuentes-kanye-west-advisor" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">white nationalist Nick Fuentes</a> claiming, "<a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/donald-trump-nick-fuentes-your-body-my-choice-4b" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Your body, my choice</a>."</p><p>On social media, discussions of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/celibacy-boy-sober-is-all-the-rage-on-social-media" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>voluntary celibacy and being "boy sober"</u></a> have emerged among heterosexual women in the last year. This is largely because of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/dating-app-fatigue-has-led-to-a-flurry-of-irl-singles-events" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>frustrations over modern dating</u></a> and dating apps, as well as <a href="https://mashable.com/article/is-casual-sex-bad-for-you" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>dissatisfaction with casual sex</u></a>.

Choi said there are inherent differences between American and South Korean feminism, however. An example she gave was American feminism focuses on individual desire and freedom, which is a more optimistic outlook. Choi said pessimism is more prevalent in Korea, and there's a greater focus on what makes someone a "good" feminist.&nbsp;</p><h2>Who can participate in 4B?</h2><p>A flurry of discourse among American women started around who can and can't be 4B. Women began <a href="https://x.com/bambilith/status/1854217352105050270" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>asking if they could be in 4B</u></a> if they have a boyfriend, husband, and/or children. </p><p>"if u have a boyfriend or a husband u cannot be apart of the 4b movement [sic]," said X user @lilmswinehouse3. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Jung said similar arguments have sometimes appeared on South Korean social media and internet chatrooms since 4B emerged. "The arguments usually revolved around the question of whether a woman can be a true feminist if she is dating with a man, if she is married, thus 'selling out' to the patriarchal institution of marriage," Jung said. "And I think that this kind of debate inevitably happens when there is a social media-driven movement based on the deeply personal changes in a woman's everyday life."</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Choi said that 4B has become almost an orthodox, separatist feminist movement in Korea. The question of who is the "better" feminist does come up. It's an insular group, with some 4B women only associating with each other because they are tired of discussions about men that their married friends might talk about, for example.&nbsp;</p><p>"Among these women who adopt 4B as not just a practice, but almost an identity," Choi said. In her research, she has interviewed women who said they're not 4B because they don't follow the "rules," or they're not ready to not have relationships with men, or because they wear makeup and have long hair. The latter points refer to the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/05/06/703749983/south-korean-women-escape-the-corset-and-reject-their-countrys-beauty-ideals" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>"escape the corset" movement</u></a>, where Korean women reject societal beauty ideals by cutting their hair and not wearing makeup in order to not look feminine.</p><p>Further, many 4B women in Korea are <a href="https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095846595" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>gender essentialists</u></a>, meaning they believe men and women have intrinsic, biological differences. Many (but not all) are also trans-exclusionary. This seems to be in contrast with the swath of women who are talking about 4B in America, who appear to be primarily liberal (though some may be TERFS as well, trans-exclusionary radical feminists).&nbsp;</p><p>Some women in Korea are critical of 4B &mdash; even if they don't engage in heterosexual relationships themselves &mdash; for gender and sexuality reasons, said Choi. Similar feminist separatist movements in the U.S. have also been <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-94823-013" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">criticized for excluding trans women</a>. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/bbcthree/article/1fc04f3e-3128-4be7-a78a-28ea31db4101" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Sex strikes</a>, in general, have occurred <a href="https://blogs.sussex.ac.uk/global/2024/08/22/the-liberian-sex-strike-a-double-edged-sword-for-peace-and-empowerment/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">elsewhere around the world</a>.

<h2>Will 4B spread in the U.S.?</h2><p>It remains to be seen whether 4B or something similar will become widespread in the U.S.&nbsp;</p><p>In the days since the election, it seems that the practices of 4B, but not the identity aspect of it, have spread on American social media. The context that some South Korean radical feminists hold gender essentialist beliefs may be lost stateside.</p><p>Aside from the lost context, Choi said it's difficult to say simplistically whether the movement gaining traction is a good thing or a bad thing. It's a reaction to the rising conservative thinking, but it could empower women to think about their lives beyond relationships with men. "I empathize and sympathize with these women's strategies and tactics," Choi said, and she's curious how it will unfold in the U.S.</p><p>"With <em>Roe v. Wade</em> gone and another Trump presidency on the horizon, the interest among American women in the 4B movement and what it stands for seems to indicate the growing sense of anger and hopelessness women feel about the patriarchal force in their society &mdash; a key factor that paved the way for the 4B movement in South Korea to begin with," Jung said.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite cultural and political differences, the anger and frustration women feel in a patriarchal society are all too similar.</p><p class="mx-auto">

   <em><strong>UPDATE: Nov. 13, 2024, 10:00 a.m. EST </strong>This story has been updated with new information about Amazon's Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales.</em>

It always takes place on the fourth Friday in November (and the day after Thanksgiving), which happens to fall abnormally late in the month this year. For consumers, that means two things: There's a <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/consumer-insights/consumer-trends/holiday-sales-day-season/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">shorter-than-usual window</a> for last-minute Christmas shopping, but more-than-usual leeway for scoping out Black Friday deals in advance. Plan accordingly.</p><p>I'm a Senior Shopping Reporter at Mashable, and I've been covering Black Friday sales since 2019. Here's what I think you need to know about them in advance to strategize and score the best deals this season.</p><h2>When is Black Friday 2024?</h2><p>With Thanksgiving slated for Thursday, Nov. 28, Black Friday is happening on <strong>Friday, Nov. 29</strong> this year. </p><p>That being said, most major retailers have already begun rolling out "early Black Friday deals" well ahead of time (that is, weeks in advance). Some will draw things out even longer with Black Friday discounts that bleed into the following weekend. In practice, Black Friday is not restricted to a rigid 24-hour timeframe.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Vehicles affected are Cybertrucks produced from Nov. 6, 2023, to July 30, 2024, or those "equipped with metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFET) in the drive inverter." In total, 2,431 Cybertrucks are affected. </p><p>By our count, this is the sixth time the Cybertruck has been recalled, which is a lot given that the vehicle has been on the market for about a year.</p><p>And this is not one of those recalls that can be fixed with a software update. This time, owners of affected vehicles will have to schedule a service appointment to get the recalled inverter replaced with an inverter equipped with a properly functioning MOSFET component, which should take "approximately three hours."</p><p>You can check out <a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/annual-and-recall-service" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Tesla's official page</a> with information about Tesla vehicle recalls.</p>]]></content:encoded>

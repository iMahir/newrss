      <description><![CDATA[Looking for no strings attached sex? We've lined up a selection of sex apps for finding something casual.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/roundups/032PDBUNHFvBoerJxJZRCEd/hero-image.jpg" alt="Three people in bed"><p><em>This content originally appeared on Mashable for a US audience and has been adapted for the UK audience.</em></p><p>Hookup culture is all about keeping things <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-dating-sites-uk" target="_self">casual</a>, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. We can all get stuck in a <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vibrators-uk" target="_self">sexual rut</a> from time to time, and trying to take strangers home from a bar or constantly texting your ex can be exhausting. If you're struggling to find a match in the real world, it might be time to put your faith in dating sites.</p><p>When we think about these sites, it's normal to go straight to the likes of <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/9d96?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Match&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=032PDBUNHFvBoerJxJZRCEd&short_url=9d96&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Match</a>, eharmony, EliteSingles, and other marriage-minded options, but not everyone is thinking about <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-dating-sites-for-serious-relationships-uk" target="_self">something so serious</a>. Sometimes all you want is a little fun, and you best believe that there's an app for that.</p><h2>How do you find a hookup?</h2><p>It's still possible to <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-dating-sites-uk" target="_self">find a connection</a> in the real world, because meeting in bars, clubs, parks, and other real-life locations still happens on a regular basis. You're simply shortening your odds by subscribing to a dating site. Why not give yourself the best chance of success?</p><p>Dating sites and sex apps allow you to get your information out there to a massive network of <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-dating-sites-for-geeks-nerds-uk" target="_self">like-minded individuals</a>. Plus, you can save a lot of time, energy, and cash by testing out a potential relationship on an app before meeting up. We know that some dating apps can be expensive, but just think about all those wasted coffees you could avoid by chatting through an app first.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

        </a>
    </div>
<p>Lastly, using dating apps and sites is a whole lot less intimidating than meeting someone face to face. If you find the idea of meeting people slightly terrifying, these apps can help you dip your toe into the world of dating from the comfort of your own home. </p><h2>Should you use free dating apps?</h2><p>The good news is that there are a lot of <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-free-dating-sites-for-serious-relationships-uk" target="_self">free dating sites and apps</a> out there, and the likes of <a href="https://mashable.com/category/tinder" target="_self">Tinder</a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-sites-for-introverts" target="_self">Hinge</a> are popular options with massive networks of users. Plus, most of the biggest and best dating sites have free versions with limitations on certain features. So yes, you can easily enter the online dating game without spending anything. However, as with most things in life, you get what you pay for with dating apps. And sometimes free apps just don't cut it.</p><p>For the best experience with the greatest possibility of finding exactly what you're looking for, you are going to have to cough up some cash. We're sorry to break it to you, but the best dating sites don't come cheap. It all comes down to access to advanced and premium features. You can still find a hookup with a free app, but if you're looking for compatibility tests, chat rooms, videos, and a greater level of control, we recommend upgrading.</p><h2>What makes an app good for hooking up?</h2><p>When it comes to <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-sexting-apps-uk" target="_self">sex apps</a>, you probably don't mind long questionnaires or in-depth profiles, but when you're just looking for a casual hookup, that all seems unnecessary. Sure, you want to gauge that you're at least a little compatible and not hooking up with a complete <a href="https://mashable.com/category/mental-health" target="_self">psychopath</a>. The best hookup apps have quick and easy bios or prompts that give you an insight into who you'd be getting down and dirty with.</p><p>Photos are also a huge factor in good hookup apps. Some sex apps and dating sites gatekeep people's pics unless you have a paid subscription, and we don't really love that. Apps that show the full view of someone's profile are the way to go. You definitely want to make sure you're physically attracted to the person you're going to be <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-mattress-for-sex-uk" target="_self">having sex</a> with.</p><h2>What is the best sex and dating app for hooking up?</h2><p>The good news is that there are absolutely loads of dating sites and sex apps out there for every type of dater and dating situation. The problem with this wealth of options is that deciding on the right site for you can be difficult. This is where we can help.</p><p>We have tracked down a strong selection of your best options for hooking up, with sites like <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/9dpt?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=AdultFriendFinder&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=032PDBUNHFvBoerJxJZRCEd&short_url=9dpt&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">AdultFriendFinder</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/GYW2E?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=iHookup&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=032PDBUNHFvBoerJxJZRCEd&short_url=GYW2E&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">iHookup</a> making the cut.

      <description><![CDATA[The best VPNs for streaming and cybersecurity, including popular services like ExpressVPN, CyberGhost VPN, and NordVPN.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/roundups/00LIXqEbjGTX2HXlTuJTKvN/hero-image.jpg" alt="Surfshark on phone"><p><a href="https://mashable.com/category/vpn" target="_self">VPNs</a> are handy security tools that can protect your identity and data, <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-for-streaming-uk" target="_self">bypass online restrictions</a> to access extra content, and much more. If this is all very new to you, you've probably got a lot of questions. Don't worry, because we can help. </p><p>We've done all the hard work for you and thoroughly researched these services to provide the information that matters to you. Here's everything you need to know about VPNs.</p><h2>What is a VPN?</h2><p>VPNs (or Virtual Private Networks) provide important protection for your data and identity when you're online. They offer this <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-for-anonymity-uk" target="_self">online privacy and anonymity</a> by creating a private network that hides your real IP address (digital location). This means that all of your activity is untraceable and secure. </p><p>Basically, you can think about VPNs as encrypted tunnels through which all of your online traffic passes through. Nobody can see into the tunnel, and everything inside the tunnel is protected against online threats like viruses, hackers, and malware.  </p><h2>Do you need a VPN?</h2><p>Any sort of activity on an unsecured WiFi network leaves your private information and browsing habits exposed to the world, unless you're using a VPN. There's no need to panic, because whether you're sending important emails, doing some online shopping, or paying essential bills, VPNs make sure that everything remains private and anonymous.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

            The best VPNs for your iPhone
            <svg class="inline-block ml-1 w-4 h-4 font-normal fill-current"><use href="https://mashable.com/images/icons/spritemap.svg#sprite-arrow-right-thin"></use></svg>
        </a>
    </div>
<p>First and foremost, VPNs are designed to provide online security, but there is another reason that millions of people use these services: streaming more content from around the world. By hiding your real IP address and connecting you to a server in another location, you can trick your favourite streaming services into thinking that you are based in a different country. This means that you can watch all of the shows and films from global libraries, like all the extra content on <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-netflix" target="_self">U.S. Netflix</a>. This is the quickest and easiest way of boosting your content options, without the need to rely on a dodgy stream.</p><h2>What should you consider before subscribing to a VPN?</h2><p>There are plenty of things that you should consider when it comes to VPNs, but we don't have all day. Instead of listing off every feature offered by the <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-deals" target="_self">best VPNs</a>, we have highlighted a selection of the most important things to think about.</p><p>Before you make any sort of decision, you should look out for connection speed, server network, number of logins, and more important features:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Bandwidth </strong>&mdash; There are some VPNs out there that place monthly caps on network bandwidth, meaning you can only download a certain amount of data. You should avoid these services, unless you're on a free trial. If you're paying for a VPN, you should be able to download and upload as much as you want.</p></li><li><p><strong>Connection speed </strong>&mdash; Using a VPN is going to produce a drop in your connection speed, but you shouldn't accept a significant drop that is going to result in buffering. Be sure to select a VPN that doesn't negatively impact your connection speed to the point that you can't watch a film or download a file without frustration.</p></li><li><p><strong>Encryption </strong>&mdash; There are different levels of encryption, and whilst it's important to take note of the grade provided by your VPN, the best options will all offer powerful protection for your data. You are likely to come across terms like "military-grade" and "enterprise-grade," which just means that you can rely on it to do its job.</p></li><li><p><strong>Number of connections </strong>&mdash;<strong> </strong>Some VPNs let you connect an unlimited number of devices with the same account. Others limit you to just a single device. You should look out for a service that offers multiple simultaneous connections, so you can stay protected on all your devices at the same time.</p></li><li><p><strong>Server network </strong>&mdash; The very best VPNs provide access to literally thousands of geographically diverse servers. It's useful if a VPN has a lot of servers in key locations, because you should always be able to find a stable and speedy connection for <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-streaming-movies-uk" target="_self">streaming</a>, shopping, or browsing anonymously. It's not a straightforward case of more is better, but it's always good to have options.</p></li><li><p><strong>Privacy policy </strong>&mdash; It's worth paying special attention to the data-handling, storage, and usage practices of the VPN you are planning on using. These practices should be laid out in a privacy policy, and if they aren't clear, it's best to avoid. Most VPNs require access to your IP address, online transactions, and browsing history, plus your personal details when you sign up. If privacy is the objective, it's absolutely essential that your VPN is not going to store these details. If it does, the whole thing is kind of pointless.</p></li></ul><p>There are other things to consider, like price and subscription plans, but these features are a good place to start.</p><h2>Should you use free VPNs?</h2><p>There are plenty of <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/deals/best-vpn-for-free" target="_self">free versions</a> of popular VPNs, plus free trials of VPNs with full access to everything you get with a premium plan. So why would you ever pay for a VPN?</p><p>As with most things in life, you get what you pay for with VPNs. There tends to always be a catch with free versions, and it's normally in the form of limited data usage. If you're just an occasional user, these plans will work fine. But if you're going to be streaming or downloading, this isn't going to work. Free trials are a little bit different: they come with everything you get in a paid plan, but obviously they don't tend to last very long. Trials are great for testing out a service before committing, but this isn't a long-term solution. </p><p>What we're saying is that the best option for streaming securely and accessing the online world without restrictions is with a paid subscription to a VPN. To gain access to advanced security features without limitations on usage, you need to pay up. The best VPNs are generally the most expensive, but there are plenty of <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-cheap-vpn-services-uk" target="_self">cheap plans</a> out there, especially if you're willing to commit to a lengthy contract.</p><h2>What is the best VPN?</h2><p>There are a lot of VPN providers out there all offering different sets of features, with different pricing structures. We recommend taking some time to carefully access your options, and decide on what you really need from a VPN. Once you have established your priorities, you can check out this definitive list of the best VPNs this month.</p><p>We have tracked down everything on offer and lined up a selection of the very best VPNs for streaming, shopping, and everything else. We have tried to find something for everyone and every budget, and you can find popular services like <a href="https://go.expressvpn.com/c/190434/1462855/16063" target="_blank">ExpressVPN</a>, <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/76q9?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=NordVPN&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=00LIXqEbjGTX2HXlTuJTKvN&short_url=76q9&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">NordVPN</a>, and <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/e2no?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=CyberGhost%20VPN&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=00LIXqEbjGTX2HXlTuJTKvN&short_url=e2no&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">CyberGhost VPN</a> in this list. All you need to do is weigh up these options against your own set of priorities, and then pick a favourite from the bunch.</p><p>These are the best VPNs in 2024.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[Best massage guns from top brands like Theragun and Hyperice.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/roundups/04ivyO96VDfrzqTywLQX0LB/hero-image.png" alt="man using a Theragun Pro"><p>Have you ever skipped doing a proper warm down and stretch after a <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-dumbbells-uk" target="_self">workout</a> because you just didn't have the time? Hey, we all<em> </em>have. </p><p>That's just the reality of trying to stay fit in amongst the hustle and bustle of everyday life. When you're pushed for time, a warm down &mdash; never mind a proper massage &mdash; is the first thing to go. What you need are the tools to help you stay on top of both your body and your schedule.</p><p>Enter the massage gun. Turns out that those mesmerising skin ripples are more than just a weird flex. This form of portable muscle therapy began with professional athletes but has trickled down into the lives of your average gym-goer who doesn't have the time or money for foam rolling sessions on sore days. That means you, us, everyone.</p><p>If you have chronic shoulder, neck, or back pain, the ability to give yourself a deep-tissue massage at home can be life-changing. You'll find there's a range of models to hit the spot of your <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-protein-powders-uk" target="_self">muscle recovery needs</a> &mdash; from the basic to pro athlete level. Here's some useful information to get you started.</p><h2>How do massage guns work?</h2><p>Percussive therapy is the name of the game, and it's a more professional term for "your muscles like it rough." Athletes use deep-tissue massage for quick pain relief and <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-fitbits-uk" target="_self">faster recovery times</a>. This is when a professional masseuse delivers forceful, rapid thumps to a specific area of the body to stimulate a specific set of muscles. The percussive therapy afforded by a massage gun lets individuals perform this same type of penetrative tissue attention on themselves without extra help, and these devices are said to provide hours worth of massage benefits in minutes. </p><h2>What are the benefits of a massage gun?</h2><p>Massage guns deliver short-duration pulses to enhance the blood flow, soften knots, and accelerate the repair of muscle fibres, all of which can lead to better-prepared warmups and quicker recovery times. Your <a href="https://medium.com/thrive-global/how-massage-affects-your-mood-334663052773" target="_blank">mood</a> might see a spike, too. The <a href="https://archive.attn.com/stories/5332/pressure-points-for-stress-relief" target="_blank">pressure point relief</a> that massage provides has been linked to decreased levels of cortisol (the stress hormone), an increased production of endorphins (the feel-good chemical), and even a lower heart rate.</p><p>We should point out that percussive therapy isn't a fix-all. A massage gun can replace pricey massage appointments, but there's literally no substitute for the nutrients you get from a balanced diet, sleep, and getting proper hydration are still crucial to the muscle growth and recovery process.</p><h2>Percussion massagers vs. vibration massagers &mdash; what's the difference?</h2><p>Percussion massagers mimic the kneading hands of a masseuse, providing pressure that hammers below the top layers and work damaged muscle fibres. Perfect for heavy-duty workouts. Casual exercisers and chronic pain sufferers may prefer surface-level rumblings from a vibration massager, which gives speedy pulses but less "punch". </p><h2>What features do massage guns offer?</h2><p>Massage guns tend to offer some key features that appear in multiple models:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Battery life</strong> &mdash; Many people depend on their massage gun for a rushed cool down in the middle of a busy schedule, and charging after every use is a huge inconvenience. The best massage guns will get up to three hours of battery life while the weaker ones max out at around 40 minutes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Massage heads </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>The first thing you'll notice when buying a massage gun is that they usually come with a selection of heads, each designed to work specific muscle groups in a different way and get different results. </p></li><li><p><strong>Noise</strong> &mdash; No one wants to sit at the gym (or at home with a sleeping baby) using a device that sounds like a pneumatic drill. It's impossible for massage guns to be completely silent, but check the reviews for sound levels.</p></li><li><p><strong>Speeds </strong>&mdash; Look for a gun with different speeds, or revs per minute (RPM. But don't forget that higher speed doesn't always mean vigour. The amplitude (how deep the massage head will push into your body) relies on the amount of force behind each pulse, and heavier force on a slow RPM setting will feel more intense&nbsp;than a faster RPM setting with weaker force.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>Keep these points in mind when shopping around for a massage gun.</p><h2>What is the best massage gun?</h2><p>There is a lot to know about massage guns, and it's important to do your research before making a purchase. To make your job a little easier, we have tracked down six of the best guns to cover all muscular bases. We've tried to find something for everyone and every budget. You just need to scroll through the options and pick a favourite. Your muscles will thank you &mdash; well, they certainly won't complain as much.</p><p>These are the best massage guns in 2024.</p>]]></content:encoded>

It's difficult to know which site is best for you, and you could easily spend hours researching all of the sites on offer without a definitive answer.</p><p>We know that you don't have time for all of that, so we've set out to make things a little easier for you.</p><h2>What are the benefits of using dating apps?</h2><p>By subscribing to a <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-dating-sites-uk" target="_self">dating site</a>, you're shortening your odds of finding a connection.

<p>Subscribing to dating apps and sites is also a way less intimidating way of meeting someone compared to a face-to-face situation. If you find the idea of meeting people slightly terrifying, these apps can help you face your fears from the comfort of your own home.  </p><h2>Is online dating worth the hassle?</h2><p>Sentiments aside, we have some hard data to back our reasoning for Why Online Dating Is Worthwhile&trade;: <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/2158/online-dating/" target="_blank"><u>Statista</u></a> predicted that the online dating audience will grow to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/417654/us-online-dating-user-numbers/" target="_blank">53.3 million</a> by 2025, compared to 44.2 million users in 2020. A <a href="https://qz.com/1546677/around-40-of-us-couples-now-first-meet-online/" target="_blank"><u>study</u></a> from Stanford released in 2019 asserted that online dating is officially the most common way for couples to meet, rounding out at nearly 40 percent of couples having first met online.</p><p>This pre-pandemic prediction came before the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/cuffing-season-2020-dating-app-increases-hinge-match" target="_self">COVID-era dating app sign-ups surge</a>. Though people are eager to get back to doing as many things IRL as possible now, dating apps are still a great place to find someone, whether you want a <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-sites-for-serious-relationships-uk" target="_self">relationship</a> or are just looking to <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-hookup-apps-uk" target="_self">get nasty</a>.</p><p>And yes, though there are <a href="https://mashable.com/article/tinder-bumble-hinge-okcupid-grindr-dating-app-algorithms" target="_self">algorithms</a> that dictate what profiles pop up on your screen, we firmly believe that the stars aligning still comes into play. After all, the person who signs up on the app and is looking for love at exactly the same time you are is up to fate and the universe, proving that online dating romance is very much alive and well.</p><p>Because it's not 2007 anymore, the need for mobile-friendly online dating isn't just a millennial thing &mdash; <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-sites-apps-over-40-uk" target="_self">people over 40</a> don't have time to sit around at their home desktops, either. Dating sites that are older than most members of Gen Z (like Match and eharmony) have been forced to give serious attention to their smartphone counterparts if they don't want to be outgrown.</p><p>However, that statistical promise still requires patience and a game plan,&nbsp;the game plan is choosing the dating app with features that best fit your lifestyle &mdash; and the lifestyle of the type of person you're looking for. Are you looking for an <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-hookup-apps-uk" target="_self">app strictly for sex</a> or an app <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-sites-for-serious-relationships-uk" target="_self">more serious than Tinder</a> but less serious than eharmony? Or maybe, you'd just really love to find an app where <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-apps-for-lesbians-uk" target="_self">queer women</a> aren't relentlessly sexualized by creeps and <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-apps-for-bisexual-people-uk" target="_self"><u>pestered by unicorn hunters</u></a>.</p><h2>Should you use free dating apps?</h2><p>The good news is that there are a lot of <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-free-dating-sites-for-serious-relationships-uk" target="_self">free dating sites and apps</a> out there, and the likes of <a href="https://mashable.com/category/tinder" target="_self">Tinder</a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/hinge-debuts-distraction-free-dating-guide" target="_self">Hinge</a> are good examples of free apps with massive networks of users.</p><p>The bad news is that a lot of free apps simply don't cut it. You get what you pay for with dating sites and apps, and for the best experience with the greatest possibility of finding exactly what you're looking for, you are going to have to cough up the cash. </p><p>You can still find something worth your time with a free app, but if you're looking for compatibility tests, chat rooms, videos, and a greater level of control, we recommend upgrading. Paid sites provide access to premium features that give you the best chance of finding something special.</p><h2>What is the best dating site?</h2><p>We're sorry to break it to you like this, but there isn't a single dating site that is better than the rest. Instead, there are a lot of sites and apps with similar features and packages, and the best option for you really comes down to your own set of preferences.</p><p>To make the decision process a whole lot easier for everyone, we have lined up a selection of the most popular sites in the dating game, including leading sites like <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/9udl?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=EliteSingles&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=06ojRRZ6SEsjSuCRklQZYI9&short_url=9udl&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">EliteSingles</a>, <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/5l39?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Match&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=06ojRRZ6SEsjSuCRklQZYI9&short_url=5l39&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Match</a>, and <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/5mkq?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Eharmony&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=06ojRRZ6SEsjSuCRklQZYI9&short_url=5mkq&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Eharmony</a>.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/roundups/021H0qy0c3KkFe38B5m8upD/hero-image.png" alt="person grilling outside"><p><em>This content originally appeared on Mashable for a US audience and has been adapted for the UK audience.</em></p><p>The British aren't good at many things. Queuing, complaining, and crying over football are certainly up there as national skills. But there's another great British skill that sometimes goes overlooked: The natural, God-given ability to get out the barbecue at the very first glimmer of sunshine.</p><p>Even if you're not an experienced grill-person, few people can deny the great taste of barbecued food. That goes for veggies too. Barbecuing isn't only for the carnivores these days. But getting that great taste means getting a great bit of BBQ kit.</p><p>Fortunately, there are lots of options out there &mdash; from charcoal to gas via hybrid models. That doesn&rsquo;t make buying a barbecue any easier. Barbecues are a hot topic, and it&rsquo;s easy to go cold if you get blindsided by jargon, features, and tasty-looking choices. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re here to help. Indeed, before you part with any cash, here&rsquo;s a quick guide to buying a BBQ &mdash; and a selection of the very best models.</p><h2>Charcoal or gas BBQs &mdash; which is better?</h2><p>This is the ultimate question. Well, when it comes to barbecuing at least. Charcoal barbecues are of course the classic version. They give that distinctive smoky, chargrilled taste. They also need fewer extras than gas barbecues which means they&rsquo;re usually cheaper, too. But they can be tricky to light and take much longer to get to the right temperature. They're also much harder to clean. </p><p>Gas barbecues are easier and faster. They&rsquo;re usually ready to cook on in 10 minutes or less and have easily-controllable temperature dials &mdash; not to mention other fancy features and mod cons. They do, however, lack that authentic barbecue taste, unless they have flavouriser bars. And the added convenience will hit you right in the wallet.</p><p>It all comes down to personal preference: It's taste vs. convenience. Or you could meet halfway and get a gas-charcoal hybrid. Whatever you choose, it's all tasty stuff.</p><h2>How big is a barbecue?</h2><p>You can file this one alongside &ldquo;How long is a piece of string?&rdquo; There&rsquo;s no straight answer but charcoal barbecues tend to be much smaller. In fact, there are options that are extremely portable &mdash; meaning you can take them on camping trips or even to the park. Gas barbecues tend to be bigger bits of kits. They're more like an oven on wheels and tend to suit larger gardens. Ask yourself some storage-related questions. Where will you keep your barbecue? In the garden all year round, under a protective cover? Or will you wheel it in and out of the garage? Size up your outdoor space first. </p><h2>What are the important BBQ features?</h2><p>It&rsquo;s not only about gas and coal. There are lots of other features to consider. Here are some that might seal the deal for you:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Cooking space </strong>&mdash;<strong> </strong>That&rsquo;s right, cooking space is always at a premium. Space might come in the form of side tables, condiment holders, and even hooks for your tools. Anything that helps maximise your BBQ'ing area.</p></li><li><p><strong>Burners </strong>&mdash;<strong> </strong>On the subject of space, the number of actual burners (which you'll find included on gas barbecues) is crucial. Big family? Then four or even more burners might be necessary. Extra griddles and side burners are also a bonus. </p></li><li><p><strong>Fat drip trays &mdash; </strong>Cleaning a barbecue can be a job in itself. That&rsquo;s why fat drip trays are super useful. They can also reduce the amount of flare-up you get from the flames.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hood </strong>&mdash; If a barbecue has a hood, it immediately levels-up your griddle game. This allows you to roast meant as well as grill. Especially good for cooking whole chickens. </p></li></ul><p>Keep these things in mind when shopping for an upgrade.</p><h2>What is the best barbecue?</h2><p>We have researched everything on offer and highlighted a selection the very best models to suit you and your garden. We've considered price, size, cooking speed, fuel access, and much more, so you don't have to. Just pick a favourite. </p><p>These are the best barbecues for 2024.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[Unblock and watch U.S. Netflix from anywhere in the world with a streaming-friendly VPN.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/roundups/04qgd80xTaW4kYEBpwViXd7/hero-image.jpg" alt="Netflix on laptop"><p>Collecting all your favourite snacks and drinks, surrounding yourself with comfortable cushions and blankets, and then spending hours in front of a screen can be a truly therapeutic experience. Unfortunately, there is one big problem with this hobby: There is a limited amount of <a href="https://mashable.com/category/streaming" target="_self">content</a> out there to keep you entertained.</p><p>We're a greedy bunch, and regular <a href="https://mashable.com/category/netflix" target="_self">streamers</a> can easily get to a point where it feels like there's nothing left to watch. What are you supposed to do then? Don't panic, because there is a simple solution to this frustrating issue.</p><p>If you've reached this point of streaming shortage, you should consider investing in a <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-vpn-uk" target="_self">VPN</a>. It will likely unlock a lot of shows and movies on services to which you're already subscribed.</p><h2>What is a VPN?</h2><p><a href="https://mashable.com/category/vpn" target="_self">VPNs</a> are security tools that provide protection for your information by creating a private network that hides your real IP address (digital location). All of your activity is untraceable and secure, because all of your online traffic passes through an encrypted tunnel. Nobody can see into the tunnel, and everything inside the tunnel is protected against online threats like hackers, viruses, and malware.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

        </a>
    </div>
<p>The act of hiding your real IP address is what can trick leading streaming sites into thinking you are based in another country.</p><h2>Do you need a VPN?</h2><p>VPNs are used to provide <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-for-anonymity-uk" target="_self">protection for your sensitive </a>information, which is obviously super important. This isn't the only reason VPNs are so popular though, because these tools can be also be used to watch content that is normally blocked in your location.</p><p>By hiding your real IP address and connecting you to a server in another country, you can watch all your favourite content from that location. For example, you could watch all the extra films and shows on American Netflix that are not usually accessible outside of the U.S. There is so much content out there that can be accessed with the help of a VPN.</p><p>Everyone is in need of something that can bypass geo-restrictions to access all of this blocked entertainment, and that something is a VPN. These services are keys to the online world, granting you access to more of the shows and films you love. </p><h2>How to unblock U.S. Netflix</h2><p>If you think accessing American Netflix is going to be difficult with a <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-amazon-prime-video-uk" target="_self">VPN</a>, think again. It's actually a really simple process that absolutely everyone can understand:</p><ol><li><p>Sign up to a streaming-friendly VPN (like <a href="https://go.expressvpn.com/c/190434/1462856/16063?subId1=netflix" target="_blank">ExpressVPN</a>)</p></li><li><p>Download the app to your device of choice (the best VPNs have apps for Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux, and more)</p></li><li><p>Open up the app and connect to a server in the U.S.</p></li><li><p>Visit Netflix to watch movies and shows from the U.S. content library</p></li></ol><p>If you're worried that this whole thing sounds a bit illegal, then maybe we can reassure you. It's currently legal to watch Netflix while using a VPN, although we should point out that Netflix states in its <a href="https://zdcs.link/z31YV?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=terms%20of%20service&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=04qgd80xTaW4kYEBpwViXd7&short_url=z31YV&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><u>terms of service</u></a> that it may restrict your account without compensation or notice if you are engaged in "improper" use. We're not entirely sure what that means, but consider yourself warned.</p><p>We should make it very clear that you still need to be subscribed to Netflix for this trick to work. A VPN is not going to grant access to the streaming site for free. A VPN provides access to more libraries from around the world, once you're subscribed.</p><h2>Should you use free VPNs?</h2><p>There are plenty of <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-free-vpn-uk" target="_self">free versions</a> and free trials of VPNs, so why would you ever consider paying for a service? As with most things in life, you get what you pay for with VPNs. </p><p>There is always a catch with free versions, and it's normally in the form of limited data usage. These plans will be just fine if you're just an occasional user, but if you're going to be <a href="https://mashable.com/category/streaming" target="_self">streaming</a> or downloading anything, this isn't going to work. Free trials are different as come with everything you get in a paid plan, but obviously they don't tend to last very long. Trials are great for testing out a service before committing, but this isn't a long-term solution.</p><p>To gain access to advanced security features without limitations on usage, you generally need to pay up.

The game is all about finding the "common threads between words." And just like <em>Wordle</em>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-20-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> resets after midnight and each new set of words gets trickier and trickier&mdash;so we've served up some hints and tips to get you over the hurdle.</p><p>If you just want to be told today's puzzle, you can jump to the end of this article for August 1's <em>Connections</em> solution.

<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple.

<p>Friend, a wearable orb-like AI companion you wear around your neck was created by Avi Schifmann, most known for a website he built in 2020 to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/high-school-student-avi-schiffman-made-a-coronavirus-tracker-2020-5" target="_blank">help track the spread of Covid-19</a>.

<p>Thus, what we're left with and what was shown in the reveal trailer is essentially a Bluetooth device strapped to your neck that is always listening. This is so it can send you texts on your phone. <a href="https://www.friend.com/product.html" target="_blank">Per the site's FAQ page</a>, "your friend is always listening and forming their own internal thoughts. We have given your friend free will for when they decide to reach out to you."</p><p>Understandably, that might sound a bit creepy. The site reassures would-be buyers that nothing is tracked, recorded, or written down. They promise all data is "end-to-end encrypted" and deletable through the Friend app &mdash; which, FYI, is only available for iOS. Oh, and if you break your Friend, you'll need to start over with a new one.</p><p>If you want to get your hands on one, you'll have to wait. Pre-orders are starting at $99.99 and according to the site, will tentatively ship in Q1 of next year. Maybe during that time, you can make actual friends.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            New iPhone 16 leak reveals 5 vibrant colors and camera redesign

<p>According to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/31/new-iphone-16-pro-color-bronze-appearance/" target="_blank">MacRumors</a>, this is <em>potentially</em> contradictory with a <a href="https://weibo.com/6315816381/OnJaKmDOi" target="_blank">previous Weibo leak</a>, which came courtesy of user "OvO Baby Sauce OvO" earlier in July. That leak claimed that the new color for the iPhone 16 Pro was called "Rose," which would certainly not be "bronze-like," if accurate. However, as MacRumors pointed out, there's a possibility (however slight) that the two leaks are correct &mdash; and perhaps the devices were just seen by different people under different lighting.</p><p>This leak came only a day after <a href="https://mashable.com/article/iphone-16-leaked-colors-photo" target="_self">another Weibo leak</a> about iPhone 16 colors, which was a good deal more substantial. That post included a photo of five entry-level iPhone 16 models, showcasing five potential colors. As always, it is expected that Apple will tell us more about the iPhone 16 sometime in September.</p>]]></content:encoded>

It's one of the coolest things I've ever seen in my life. With a short, severe bob, glasses that I'm sure are made for the event, a gun in her hand, and <a href="https://x.com/elixirof_Love/status/1818410789814124595" target="_blank">an elephant plushie</a> on her hip, she looks like an assassin. The 31-year-old wears what <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/olympics-2024-kim-yeji-south-korean-shooter-style-icon" target="_blank">GQ calls</a> a "cyborgian uniform" that has "captured the nerdiest/most online spectators&rsquo; hearts." </p><p>According to Korean news outlet Insight, she has a 5-year-old daughter and carried the small elephant-shaped stuffed animal off her waistband as a good luck charm. </p><p>In response, we got <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@staykarious/video/7397555735627828510?lang=en" target="_blank">fancams</a> and trending videos on Twitter. We had to face questions like, "Why does the U.S. even have a second amendment when we can't win sharpshooting competitions at the Olympics, and countries with far more&nbsp;<a href="https://www.minnpost.com/community-voices/2021/05/what-america-can-learn-from-south-koreas-model-of-gun-regulation/" target="_blank">reasonable gun laws</a>&nbsp;and far fewer deaths are so much better with guns?"</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>While Kim won silver, her 19-year-old teammate Oh Ye-Jin took home gold &mdash; and despite Kim's stone-cold vibe on the stage, she was elated to celebrate Oh.</p><p>"She is like my youngest sibling, and I always want to care for her and always be there for her.

      <description><![CDATA[A neuroscientist explains why Google's Gemini chatbot isn't the right tool for the task at hand.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03w05K40a0H0V9W6B9D512L/hero-image.png" alt="Girl running on track, with a Google Gemini prompt superimposed, as featured in Google's recent ad."><p><a href="https://mashable.com/category/artificial-intelligence" target="_self">Artificial intelligence</a> can do remarkable things, but a general consensus seems to have emerged about one thing it can't, or perhaps shouldn't, do: Compose a child's admiring letter to her sports hero.</p><p><a href="https://mashable.com/category/google" target="_self">Google</a> learned this lesson the hard way. "Dear Sidney," the company's new ad for its AI-powered chatbot, Gemini, in which a dad asks Gemini to write a note to Olympic hurdler Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone on his daughter's behalf, has been <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/29/tech/googles-ai-olympics-ad-backlash/index.html" target="_blank">widely criticized</a>. People have wanted to "<a href="https://shellypalmer.com/2024/07/why-googles-dear-sydney-ad-makes-me-want-to-scream/" target="_blank">scream</a>." They are "<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lindaholmes.bsky.social/post/3kybcnej5672l" target="_blank">grossed out</a>." They've <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/1edk7du/disgusting_gemini_ad/" target="_blank">described the ad</a> as "disgusting." </p><p>Dr. James R. Doty, a Stanford University neuroscientist who studies how people set intentions and achieve their goals, felt less outrage and more concern for the commercial's troubling premise. </p><p>"This is a very personal narrative that comes, if you will, from [a person's] heart and soul," Doty told Mashable. "Somehow switching it to have an AI do it for you&hellip;it destroys the whole understanding of what it is to write a letter to a hero." </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

            Iconic moments from the 2024 Olympics: Our running list

        </a>
    </div>
<p>Doty, author of the new book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Magic-Neuroscience-Manifestation-Everything/dp/0593541146" target="_blank"><em>Mind Magic: The Neuroscience of Manifestation and How It Changes Everything</em></a>, said that using generative AI to compose such a message isn't just a missed opportunity for authentic human expression.  </p><p>In addition, the author is skipping a crucial part of their own intention- and goal-setting process, given that our heroes often prompt us to consider the kind of life we want for ourselves. </p><p>Doty said that effective goal-setting should begin with deep reflection about your values, connecting those to the goal you want to achieve, understanding how that aim can be of service to others, and then setting intentions that, along with hard work, help you ultimately manifest the aspiration.</p><p>So for the young girl in Google's ad &mdash; or any child who sees a reflection of their own ambition and dedication to a sport &mdash; taking the time to contemplate and articulate why they adore their hero, and want to break their record, can be a pivotal part of goal-setting. Of course, doing this with a parent, like the dad in the commercial, would create a unique bonding moment, too.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-NgtHJKn0Mck&amp;t=2s"></div>
</div>


<p>Doty noted that an AI chatbot given this writing task might just gather the information it thinks is relevant, such as the hero's records, awards, and accolades. That r&eacute;sum&eacute; roundup might reduce time spent on research for the letter writer. </p><p>But Doty argued that the results could also omit achievements that aren't so quantifiable &mdash;&nbsp;such as an athlete's positive contributions to their own community or their sexual or gender identity &mdash; which help make them a hero in so many people's eyes. </p><p>Sure, a child might hope to be their sport's next GOAT, but the prospect of becoming an athlete role model to children could be just as important to them.   </p><p>"For it to resonate authentically, it has to be your narrative, not AI's narrative, which it has created out of a million pieces of information about that athlete," Doty said. </p><p>He added that many AI products, particularly those that cater to social media content, are pitched to users as tools to help them get more likes or engagement. </p><p>While Gemini is marketed as a chatbot that helps users "supercharge" their ideas, it might still aim to create likable content, which could steer an author of any age away from heartfelt reflection, or undermine confidence in their own vision and voice. </p><p>Importantly, Doty said that goal-setting works best when you're dreaming big in a calm, relaxed state, and able to imagine future achievements in a state of mind driven by love, not fear. In other words, it's much harder to accomplish goals formed by a desire for external validation or material goods because of the attendant anxiety and disappointment. But AI wouldn't necessarily know that. </p><p>Despite his criticism, Doty is no opponent of generative AI; he co-founded a <a href="https://www.happi.ai/" target="_blank">mental health app</a> that uses the technology, and he believes it can support human creativity and expression without substituting for it. </p><p>"If it writes something that's not you, or how you deeply feel, then it's not you, and it's a lie," Doty said. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This is a surprising because Google typically rolls out its Pixel phones in the fall.</p><p>For reference, here are <a href="https://www.stuff.tv/features/google-pixel-9-preview-specs-rumours-release-date/" target="_blank">the release dates</a> for the previous device launches:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro - Oct. 4, 2023</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro - Oct. 6, 2023</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro - Oct. 19, 2023</strong></p></li></ul><p>The only time Google did <em>not </em>launch in October was in 2020, the year when the pandemic shook up the tech hardware industry. (Even Apple didn't launch their iPhone until October that year, even though they typically unveil their new handsets in September.)</p><h2><strong>Google Pixel 9 price</strong></h2><p>There aren't any credible rumors on pricing, however, Google already increased the price tags of both devices last year, bumping them by $100.</p><p>As such, we doubt that Google will instate yet another price hike for 2024. That being said, the expected price tags for the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro are the following:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Pixel 9 - $699</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Pixel 9 Pro - $999</strong></p></li></ul><p>Interestingly, however, according to <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/google-pixel-9-renders-design-exclusive/" target="_blank">91Mobiles</a>, Google may consider bringing a <em>third </em>phone into the mix, offering a trio of devices similar to the Galaxy S24 series.

<p>This wouldn't be the first time the Google introduced an "XL" phone into the mix. The last time we saw an "XL" device was the Pixel 5 series &mdash; and we haven't seen it since.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro XL will reportedly have the following specs:</p><ul><li><p><strong>6.5-inch, QHD+, OLED display with 120Hz refresh rate</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Triple-camera setup</strong></p></li></ul><p>Interestingly, if these specs are accurate, Pixel 9 Pro XL will feature a slight reduction from the Pixel 8 Pro's 6.7-inch display.</p><p>You may be wondering, "What does it look like?" Funny story. So popular leaker @Onleaks, also known as Steve H.McFly on X, revealed what they<em> thought</em> was the Pixel 9 Pro on Jan. 24. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>As it turns out, the Pixel 9 Pro renders are actually the Pixel 9 Pro XL, according to clarification from @Onleaks via <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/google-pixel-9-renders-design-exclusive/" target="_blank">91mobiles</a>.</p><p>Finally, thanks to the YouTube channel @pixophone, it looks like we have a video leak of the new Pixel 9 Pro XL. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

<p>The Pixel 9 will have a dual-camera rear setup. The Pixel 9 Pro, alongside the Pixel 9 Pro XL, will reportedly have a triple-camera setup. For a long time, rumors on the Pixel 9 series' cameras were sparse &mdash; until <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/exclusive-google-pixel-9-cameras-3460690/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> dropped an exclusive recently.</p><p>Here are the reported camera specs for the Pixel 9:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Ultrawide - 50MP</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Wide - 50MP</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Selfie - 10.5MP</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Telephoto - N/A</strong></p></li></ul><p>And here's the information we have on the Pixel 9 Pro and Pro XL:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Ultrawide - 50MP</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Wide - 50MP</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Selfie - 50MP</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Telephoto - 50MP</strong></p></li></ul><p>For reference, here are the specs for the entry-level Pixel 8:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Ultrawide - 12MP</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Wide - 50MP</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Selfie - 10.5MP</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Telephoto - N/A</strong></p></li></ul><p>And the Pixel 8 Pro:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Ultrawide - 48MP</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Wide - 50MP</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Selfie - 10.5MP</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Telephoto - 48MP</strong></p></li></ul><p>To sum these specs up, the entry-level Pixel 9 is bumping its ultrawide camera up to 50MP. The Pixel 9 Pro and Pro XL devices are getting 50MP sensors all across the board. </p><p>The entry-level Pixel 9 will continue to lack a telephoto lens, which is useful for anyone who enjoys taking portraits and zoom-in photos.</p><h2><strong>Google Pixel 9 specs</strong></h2><p>According to <a href="https://rozetked.me/news/33143-eksklyuziv-zhivye-foto-google-pixel-9-pro-ot-rozetked" target="_blank">Rozetked</a> and 91mobiles, you'll find the next-gen Tensor chip inside the Pixel 9 series, likely the Tensor G4 processor.</p><p>Per the former, the Pixel 9 Pro will sport 16GB of RAM, a step up from the Pixel 8 Pro's 12GB of memory. As more companies take deeper plunges into the world of AI, this isn't surprising. While running AI in the background, these devices are going to need all the memory they can get.</p><p>Other specs you'll reportedly find across the Pixel 9 series:</p><ul><li><p><strong>New Qi2 charging technology, which increases wireless charging up to 15W and offers better alignment (similar to MagSafe)</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>New "Adaptive Touch" feature, which lets you adjust the display's sensitivity based on your surroundings</strong></p></li><li><p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-pixel-9-satellite-connection-addition-rumors" target="_self"><strong>Satellite connectivity</strong></a><strong> via a Samsung modem upgrade</strong></p></li></ul><p>As mentioned, the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro (and perhaps a Pixel 9 Pro XL) are dropping on Aug. 13.

<p>In the past, Apple has deviated from this cadence due to reported production hindrances (e.g., supply chain issues). For example, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/france-suspends-iphone-12-sales-high-radiation-levels" target="_self">the iPhone 12</a> and the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-iphone-14-plus-review" target="_self">iPhone 14 Plus</a> shipped in October, but typically, we get new iPhones unveiled some time during the first half of September every year.</p><h2><strong>iPhone 16 design</strong></h2><p>Let&rsquo;s dive into arguably the most important aspect of the iPhone&rsquo;s design: the screen. </p><p>There haven&rsquo;t been any significant changes to the display sizes since the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/iphone-12-and-iphone-12-pro-review" target="_self">iPhone 12</a>, but according to reliable leaker <a href="https://twitter.com/URedditor" target="_blank"><u>Unknownz21</u></a>, the upper-tier iPhone 16 models are going to be a little bit more unwieldy in your hands.</p><h3><strong>Display</strong></h3><p>The iPhone 16 Pro will reportedly have a 6.3-inch display while the iPhone 16 Pro Max will pack a 6.9-inch panel.

<p>However, he offered slightly different numbers: 6.2 inches and 6.8 inches. What could be the reason behind the discrepancy? According to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/16/iphone-16-display-sizes/" target="_blank"><u>MacRumors</u></a>, it&rsquo;s "likely due to the difference between actual display area and viewable display area."</p><p>Another rumor we're hearing is that the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-iphone-16-60z-refresh-rate" target="_self">iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus will continue to have 60Hz refresh-rate displays.</a> This is a little disappointing considering other phones in the market at least have 90Hz screens, making navigating through the UI smoother, zippier and seamless.</p><p>Finally, according to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/10/iphone-16-pro-brighter-display/" target="_blank">MacRumors</a>, citing popular Weibo leaker "Instant Digital," the iPhone 16 Pro will reportedly have a 20% brighter display for SDR content.

The current-gen iPhone 15 Pro models' Action Button can be programmed to launch a range of apps and functions, including Flashlight, Camera, Silent Mode, Voice Memo, Focus, Magnifier, Translate (coming to iOS 17.2), and a range of accessibility features.</p><p>When iPhone 16 drops, however, the rumor mill states that Apple will add more functionality to the Action Button.</p><h3><strong>Capture Button</strong></h3><p>The Action Button was all the rage for the iPhone 15 series, however, according to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/iphone-16-capture-button/" target="_blank">MacRumors</a> and <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-plans-iphone-camera-button-as-creators-shift-to-horizontal-videos?rc=bdqvyp" target="_blank">The Information</a>, a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/iphone-16-camera-button" target="_self">new Capture Button</a> will be one of the biggest selling points for the iPhone 16. Reportedly placed slightly under the power button, the Capture Button is a camera-focused feature that can do the following:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Zoom in and out of photos/videos with swiping gestures</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Allows users to focus on subjects</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Activates the shutter button</strong></p></li></ul><p>While MacRumors and The Information both concur that Apple is testing a "capture button" on the iPhone 16, both aren't on the same page on whether it's a mechanical button or a capacitive one. MacRumors says it's the latter, but The Information claims it's both.</p><h3><strong>Solid-state buttons</strong></h3><p>Apple reportedly planned on introducing solid-state buttons with the iPhone 15 Pro models, but instead, we got a customizable Action Button. For the uninitiated, solid-state buttons aren&rsquo;t buttons <em>per se </em>&ndash; they&rsquo;re panels that feature haptic feedback sensations that simulate real button presses (Think of the iPhone SE series' Home button). On the plus side, the solid-state buttons aren&rsquo;t totally out of the picture. According to respected <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/two-iphone-15-pro-models-removal-of-solid-state-button-design-negatively-affects-cirrus-logic-and-a456d5e7386c" target="_blank"><u>Apple leaker and analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</u></a>, Apple is working on debuting solid-state buttons on the iPhone 16 Pro models instead.<br></p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Kuo added that these solid-state buttons will add two additional <a href="https://apple.fandom.com/wiki/Taptic_Engine" target="_blank">Taptic Engines</a>, which will help fire off tangible feedback to users. (If this is true, the number of Taptic Engines in the iPhone 16 will increase to three &mdash; up from one.)</p><p>According to a tip from Weibo (via <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/iphone-16-extra-button-rumor/" target="_blank">MacRumors</a>), the Action Button on the iPhone 16 Pro will be a solid-state button and sit flush against the chassis. To make room for this change, Apple will reportedly move the mmWave antenna to the left of the iPhone 16 Pro as opposed to the right. This Weibo tip comes from a leaker with the moniker "Instant Digital," a bean spiller that reportedly has an accurate track record, according to MacRumors.</p><h3><strong>Renders</strong></h3><p>Based on all the design notes listed above (as well as some details from <a href="https://twitter.com/MajinBuOfficial/" target="_blank">leaker Majin Bu</a>), digital artist Aaron Carpenter gave us a good look at what the iPhone 16 could look like:</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<h3><strong><br>Storage</strong></h3><p>According to news aggregator account "yeux1122" from Naver, a Korean blog, the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max will feature options that offer <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/iphone-16-pro-2tb-option-rumor/" target="_blank">2TB of storage</a>.</p><p>That is double the current max storage capacity of the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><h3><strong>Chipset</strong></h3><p>In recent years, Apple has followed the trend of putting <em>last year's </em>chip into the two entry-level models while the Pro models, the Pro and the Pro Max, get the new-generation chip. For example, the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus got the A16 Bionic chip, the same inside the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max. However, the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max got outfitted with the <em>new </em>A17 Pro chips.</p><p>If this pattern continues, it should follow that the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus get the A17 Pro while the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max get the A18 chips. Pu hinted that this is how it will be for the iPhone 16 line, hinting that the A17 Pro will reportedly be less efficient. In other words, the iPhone 16 models equipped with this chip may take a battery life hit. This is because the next-generation chip will offer tremendous performance gains at the expense of power efficiency.</p><p>However, another rumor tells a different story. </p><p>According to an alleged iOS 18 code leak from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/20/ios-18-code-four-new-iphone-models/" target="_blank">MacRumors</a>, the<strong> entire</strong> iPhone 16 line will get<em> </em>an<em> </em>A18 chip. However, there&rsquo;s a chance that Apple will use a &ldquo;Pro&rdquo; identifier name to differentiate from the standard and Pro models (e.g., A18 chip and A18 Pro).</p><p>The iPhone 16 Pro models will also reportedly support Wi-Fi 7 (current models support WiFi 6E). Wi-Fi 7 should offer zippy transfer speeds that exceed 40 Gbps, quadrupling what WiFi 6E can do.</p><p>According to Pu (via <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/10/12/iphone-16-pro-faster-5g-wi-fi-7/" target="_blank"><em>9to5Mac</em></a>), the iPhone 16 Pro will come with Qualcomm&rsquo;s Snapdragon X75 modem, which can reach a 5G download rate of up to 7.5 Gbps.</p><p><em>We&rsquo;ll periodically update this rumor hub as new iPhone 16 leaks trickle in, so be sure to bookmark this page.&nbsp;</em></p><p></p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3>Why we like it:</h3><p>The International Olympics Committee is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/olympics-ditched-mario-sonic-series-to-explore-nfts-and-esports" target="_blank">reportedly</a> dumping Mario &amp; Sonic for NFTs and esports, but we're not ready to move on just yet. Its final collab with Nintendo and Sega is set at the 2020 Summer Games and features over 30 events, including karate, gymnastics, archery, and equestrian jumping. This appears to be one of its biggest discounts ever, at least compared to its <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B07SXNKFGS" target="_blank">historical pricing</a> on Amazon.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>If you have multiple <a href="https://mashable.com/category/apple" target="_self">Apple products</a>, you probably know the unique frustration of dealing with the different cables you need to keep everything charged. Before the move to <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-iphone-usb-c-charging-confirmed" target="_self">USB-C</a> for newer iPhones, you might need a Lightning charger, a USB-C cable, and a MagSafe Apple Watch cable for some configurations. While that's been streamlined somewhat, it's still much more convenient when you don't have to use multiple chargers to juice everything back up. Thanks to a deal at Amazon, you can bring home a super handy 3-in-1 MagSafe-compatible charger that's now returned to its lowest price ever. </p><p>Anker has been <a href="https://mashable.com/article/july-26-anker-charger-deals" target="_self">hosting some great charger deals</a> at Amazon this July.

<p>Skinner criticized the squad after its selection. "Besides Simone, I feel like the talent and depth isn't what it used to be," Skinner said in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MyKaylaSkinnerOfficial" target="_blank">a YouTube video</a> published earlier this month that was later deleted. </p><p>She <a href="https://x.com/gymguyri/status/1808619618010829261" target="_blank">added</a>, "I just notice, like, obviously, a lot of girls don't work as hard. The girls just don't have the work ethic." </p><p>Notably, however, Skinner <em>also </em>brought up SafeSport, an independent body created to curb abuse, and how coaches can't be as tough as they used to be. Keep in mind that Biles has championed a complete overhaul and shift in priorities for U.S. gymnastics <a href="https://mashable.com/article/athlete-a-review" target="_self">amid horrific, long-running abuse</a> in the sport. </p><p>"It's hard, too, because of SafeSport. Like, coaches can't get on athletes," Skinner said. "They have to be really careful what they say. Which, in some ways, is really good, but at the same time, to get to where you need to be in gymnastics, you do have to be, I feel like, a little aggressive and a little intense."</p><p>While Skinner later walked back her comments, Biles clearly did not forget what she said. Folks were pretty pleased to see Biles publicly shade Skinner. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>There's something quite satisfying about Biles &mdash; the best to ever do it &mdash; being just a <em>little </em>petty after triumphing once again. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>And to put a perfect little bow on the whole sequence, Biles posted Wednesday on X: "oop I&rsquo;ve been blocked." This drama is almost as gold medal-worthy as Biles' floor routine. </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[A growing malware campaign is targeting Android users and gaining access to their SMS messages.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/06Q4kpO28asmfY3cUKCS1oW/hero-image.jpg" alt="Android logo on smartphone"><p>A new malware campaign has just been outed and it's targeting Android devices in the sneakiest of ways.</p><p>According to a <a href="https://www.zimperium.com/blog/unmasking-the-sms-stealer-targeting-several-countries-with-deceptive-apps/" target="_blank"><u>new report</u></a> from ZLabs researchers at the mobile security company Zimperium,&nbsp;there's a massive SMS stealer campaign <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/massive-sms-stealer-campaign-infects-android-devices-in-113-countries/" target="_blank"><u>spreading</u></a> across the globe that's gaining access to Android users' devices and stealing their sensitive information before sending it to bad actors for financial gain.</p><p>How are they doing this? By tricking users with fake app download pages or through Telegram bots that provide false promises of free Android apps.</p><h2><strong>A massive SMS stealer campaign</strong></h2><p>The hackers' initial encounter with a potential victim begins mostly in one of two ways.</p><p>Some victims were served with a fake app advertisement on a malicious webpage. Users who are tricked by the ads are taken to a page that mimics a legitimate Android app download link. The software, of course, isn't the advertised app. Instead, It's malware that prompts users to inadvertently give it permission to read their SMS messages.</p><p>Another way the SMS stealer campaign is targeting victims is through Telegram bots. Zimerium researchers say it discovered "roughly 2,600 Telegram bots" that lured victims into believing they were being offered pirated Android apps for free. Victims would be asked for their phone number in return for the app. However, the downloads they actually receive are "unique malicious applications disguised as legitimate APKs."</p><p>Once these bad actors gain access to the device, they're able to use the victim's personal data for financial gain. The text message access of this malware campaign is especially heinous. It potentially provides these malicious actors with OTPs, or one-time passwords, that are often required by banks and other financial institutions to verify a user's access.</p><p>Zimperium researchers say that they have been tracking this SMS stealer campaign for nearly two and a half years. Over that time period, researchers say they have seen "over 107,000 malware samples" connected to the campaign, showing how the bad actors behind this malicious software have been constantly updating their campaign so it stays effective.</p><p>And it seems like these hackers have found success.</p><p>Researchers claim that the SMS stealer campaign has claimed victims in 113 countries. The majority of the victims appear to be in India and Russia. However, there are also a significant number of victims in Brazil, Mexico, the United States, Ukraine, and Spain.</p><p>Android users should be aware of this malicious campaign and beware of any download links promising free app downloads.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/amazon-prime-day" target="_self">Prime Day</a> graced us with fantastic deals in mid-July, but sadly we now have to wait (and cross our fingers) for <a href="https://mashable.com/article/when-is-the-next-prime-day-2024" target="_self">a Prime Day sequel</a> come October. However, if you missed out on the sale, you can still shop a handful of Prime Day holdouts. And if you're in the market for a new TV, one of our favorite Prime Day TV deals is still available.</p><p>The <a href="https://zdcs.link/6XWl3?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Insignia%2032-inch%20HD%20Fire%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=03rjEh7fPyBsGwaHPXivYkc&short_url=6XWl3&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Insignia 32-inch HD Fire TV</a> is just $79.99 at Amazon, marked down from the usual price of $129.99. That's a 38% discount or a savings of $50. It's also the <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B09ZLTMWWH" target="_blank">lowest</a> price we've ever seen at Amazon. To make things even more interesting, this TV is actually listed for sale on Amazon by Best Buy (yes, you can buy Best Buy products through Amazon). </p><p>With a sale price of under $80, the 32-inch Insignia HD Fire TV is pretty unbeatable when it comes to price, but it also does well in terms of performance. With 720p resolution, your shows will look crisp and clear. While it's not top-of-the-line, the affordable price still makes this TV a solid option, especially if you're shopping for an extra TV for the garage, kitchen, or a kids' bedroom.</p><p>It also comes with an Alexa Voice remote, so you can speak commands instead of entering them into the remote. Alexa will be able to locate and launch your desired show or movie after you've told her what you'd like to watch. As we've come to expect from a smart TV, you can stream your favorites from Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, and more on the Insignia TV. Plus, you can use it as a gaming monitor.</p><p>Hurry to snag the <a href="https://zdcs.link/6XWl3?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Insignia%2032-inch%20HD%20Fire%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=03rjEh7fPyBsGwaHPXivYkc&short_url=6XWl3&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Insignia 32-inch HD Fire TV</a> while it's on sale for just $79.99.

<p>Influencer Sofia Elizabeth shared a TikTok video about <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sofiaelizabethsbackup/video/7396548656918465838" target="_blank">changing her dating app location to the Olympic Village</a> &mdash; it's <a href="https://olympics.com/en/paris-2024/the-games/village" target="_blank">located</a> north of Paris across Saint-Denis, Saint Ouen, and L'&Icirc;le-Saint-Denis. She later clarified that <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sofiaelizabethsbackup/video/7396939864530275630" target="_blank">she did so on Hinge</a> because changing your location on that app is free (<a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-change-location-tinder-bumble-hinge-travel" target="_self">unlike on Tinder and Bumble</a>). </p><p>"Whoever said to change your location to the 'Olympic Village' currently in Paris to match with an Olympian, I just wanna thank you from the bottom of my heart," she said in a video with over 16 million views as of publication. She didn't respond to Mashable's request for comment, and Hinge declined to comment.</p><p>While this is a tactic for singles watching the Olympics at home, some Olympians themselves are indeed on dating apps during the games. Emily Delleman, rower for Team USA, posted a TikTok about her experience <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@happydelly/video/7395643135092657454" target="_blank">Tinder swiping at the Olympic Village</a>. </p><p>Delleman, who didn't respond to Mashable's request for comment, said in her video she had downloaded Tinder for the first time in years. She added that Tinder was "hyping up" matching with athletes on the App Store &mdash; which is indeed the case:</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Delleman made it clear on her profile that she was an Olympian &mdash; but unlike Elizabeth, didn't have luck matching with fellow athletes.</p><p>"So far I think I've seen a total of two other Olympians," Delleman said. Given that Tinder was a bust, she said she searched for "other forms of entertainment" &mdash; like TikTok. </p><p>Tinder told Mashable that in July, there's been an almost 20 percent increase in swipes in France, and a 103 percent increase in <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-change-location-tinder-bumble-hinge-travel" target="_self">Passport Mode</a> (a paid feature to change your location) to sites like Paris. The U.S., Brazil, and Turkey are the top origin countries where daters are using Passport Mode to change their location to France.</p><p>In Paris, Tinder says there's been a 52 percent jump in the number of users with "Olympian" as their job description, and a 43 percent in "athlete." </p><p>The Olympic Village will accommodate <a href="https://olympics.com/en/paris-2024/the-games/village" target="_blank">14,250 athletes</a> during the Olympic Games, and 8,000 during the Paralympic Games.</p><p>And if all goes well, Elizabeth said, you can fly to Paris to meet your match "and see their <a href="https://mashable.com/article/olympics-cardboard-beds-tiktok-us-rugby" target="_self">cardboard beds</a> in-person."</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This lines up exactly with <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1792223282361680169" target="_blank">predictions</a> Apple reporter Ming-Chi Kuo made about the iPhone 16's color palette back in May. As such, it's reasonable to believe these will be the iPhone 16 colors when it drops later this year.</p><p>However, colors aren't the only interesting thing happening here. The iPhones in Dickson's photo all have vertically oriented dual-camera bumps, a notable departure from the diagonally oriented bumps on the iPhone 15. It's not a monumental alteration by any means, but it's worth noting, nonetheless.</p><p>As always, keep your grain of salt handy; this is an unconfirmed leak.

   <em><strong>UPDATE: Jul. 31, 2024, 9:11 a.m. EDT </strong>This piece has been updated with a statement from Meta.</em>
</p>
<p>Some social media influencers on Facebook and Instagram are now dealing with a growing new problem on Meta-owned platforms: extortion.</p><p>According to a new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-30/meta-copyright-tool-is-exploited-in-middle-east-by-extortionists" target="_blank"><em><u>Bloomberg</u></em></a><em>, </em>scammers are now issuing copyright takedowns on Facebook and Instagram content that they do not own &mdash; and they're doing it with Meta's own rights management tool that is meant to help protect creators' work.</p><p>Malicious actors are seeking to coerce influencers out of thousands of dollars, sometimes demanding recurring payments, to prevent future illegitimate takedowns from occurring.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

            Crypto scam victims are being scammed double by fake law firms, FBI warns
            <svg class="inline-block ml-1 w-4 h-4 font-normal fill-current"><use href="https://mashable.com/images/icons/spritemap.svg#sprite-arrow-right-thin"></use></svg>
        </a>
    </div>
<h2>Extorting influencers with Meta's own tools</h2><p>The new report from <em>Bloomberg</em> focuses on social media influencers in the Middle East who are finding that their content is being taken down through Meta's rights management tool over nonexistent copyright issues. When these content creators reached out to the contact that issued the takedown through Meta's system, the scammer behind the copyright strike admitted that there was no actual copyright issue &mdash; and then attempted to extort them.</p><p>This fraudulent practice seems to be growing on social media platforms, so scammers are likely finding success in their fake copyright scheme.&nbsp;</p><p>One influencer from Iraq shared that the scammer offered to restore the content that they took down for $3,000. Furthermore, the scammer offered to stop issuing fraudulent takedown requests on his content for a recurring payment of $1,000 per month or an upfront payment of $7,000 per year.</p><p>Scammers have long attempted to weaponize copyright to extort money out of Facebook users. However, most attempts could often be ignored as they typically consisted of a <a href="https://cybernews.com/security/facebook-users-targeted-copyright-infringement-scam/" target="_blank"><u>phishing email</u></a> pretending to be from the company.</p><p>However, more resourceful scammers are now gaining access to the Meta rights manager, a tool that requires approval from Meta, through black markets selling access. Using this tool, users aren't extorted with the threat of a copyright takedown; the takedown occurs, which presumably makes extortion much easier.  </p><p>&ldquo;Our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/copyrights_terms" target="_blank"><u>Rights Manager Terms</u></a>&nbsp;strictly prohibit users from uploading other people's content and claiming it as their own, and we routinely revoke access or disable accounts when we identify cases of misuse," a Meta spokesperson said in a statement provided to Mashable. "Our Rights Manager tools are global, and we invest heavily in them so people around the world can protect their rights and manage their content at scale. We continue to encourage people to report these issues so we can investigate and take action.&rdquo;<em> </em></p><h2>Fraudulent copyright takedowns are becoming a bigger issue across social media</h2><p>Content creators often have to deal with bad actors ripping their work from online platforms and uploading it as their own. Oftentimes, these individuals monetize this content, essentially stealing money from the original creators.</p><p>To help fight this, many platforms over the years have rolled out rights management and copyright tools for big content creators and companies. Essentially, these tools help creators take a proactive approach by establishing ownership over specific pieces of content. From there, these creators can issue takedowns when uploads of their content are detected on social media platforms.</p><p>However, scammers have discovered that they can utilize these tools, but uploading stolen content as their own, so the platform then wrongly establishes the thief as the legitimate owner.</p><p>And it's not only happening on Meta-owned platforms. This has unfortunately been a fairly common <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/youtube-strikes-now-being-used-as-scammers-extortion-tool/" target="_blank"><u>practice</u></a> on YouTube through the platform's own copyright management tool for creators.</p><p>One specific incident regarding fake copyright claims on music on YouTube highlights how lucrative this scheme is becoming for these con artists. As Mashable <a href="https://mashable.com/article/youtube-copyright-royalties-heist" target="_self"><u>reported</u></a> in 2022, two scammers were able to steal more than $23 million by simply claiming songs that they had nothing to do with through YouTube's Content ID system.</p><p>With the incentive in place for scammers, this exposure to abuse may worsen until social media platforms get better at weeding these bad actors out of their copyright management tools.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you haven&rsquo;t heard of smart bulbs, let us introduce you to the future of lighting. The Kasa smart light bulbs (4-pack) do so much more than turn on and off. They can cycle through 16 million colors, be set to a specific hue, and even turn on and off via voice commands (with a compatible device like an Amazon Echo or Google Home). </p><p>The best thing about these bulbs is that you don&rsquo;t need a smart home hub to use them &mdash; all you need is a WiFi connection and the free Kasa app. Once you've installed the app and connected the bulbs, you&rsquo;re ready to go.</p><p>With the app, you can set schedules for when the lights turn on and off, dim them, and group multiple bulbs together. Plus, they come with a two-year warranty if anything goes wrong. </p><h3>More smart light bulb deals</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/ZRZ2P?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=TP-Link%20Tapo%20smart%20light%20bulbs%20%284-pack%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=01hrpirroH3XEftPqH7Rca7&short_url=ZRZ2P&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">TP-Link Tapo smart light bulbs (4-pack)</a> &mdash; <strong>$21.99 </strong><s>$25.99</s> (save $4)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/BdvjV?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Sengled%20color-changing%20light%20bulb%20%284-pack%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=01hrpirroH3XEftPqH7Rca7&short_url=BdvjV&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Sengled color-changing light bulb (4-pack)</a> &mdash; <strong>$22.99 </strong><s>$29.99</s> (save $7)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/5MoZ5?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Govee%20smart%20light%20bulbs%20%284-pack%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=01hrpirroH3XEftPqH7Rca7&short_url=5MoZ5&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Govee smart light bulbs (4-pack)</a> &mdash; <strong>$24.99 </strong><s>$34.99</s> (save $10) </p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/0P65A?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=LIFX%20color%20smart%20LED%20bulb&object_type=article&object_uuid=01hrpirroH3XEftPqH7Rca7&short_url=0P65A&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">LIFX color smart LED bulb</a> &mdash; <strong>$31 </strong><s>$39.99</s> (save $8.99)</p></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Olympic match mirrored a pivotal scene in the beloved volleyball manga in which Team Japan squared off against Team Argentina in the Olympic finals. The moment was only alluded to in the manga, which saw Karasuno High duo Hinata and Kageyama, for Team Japan, face off against their longtime rival Oikawa (playing for Argentina). While the winner of said Olympic match was never revealed on the page, some fans like to believe that setter Oikawa came out on top. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>If you've been watching the games in Paris, you may have noticed athletes and fans alike decked out in personal air conditioners. Europeans might turn up their noses at air conditioning, but we say there's no shame in staying cool. (Paris famously chose <em>not </em>to provide <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/06/24/nx-s1-5017544/paris-olympics-air-conditioning-usa" target="_blank">air conditioning for athlete housing</a>, a decision they may be regretting in the midst of a totally predictable heat wave.)</p><p>What are personal air conditioners? These wearable gadgets help cool you down in a flash. They range from simple neck fans to $200 personal cooling appliances. And you don't have to be sweltering in the Paris heat to score one. You can bring one home from Amazon right now for up to 25% off. </p><p>As of July 31, you can save big on several personal air conditioners at Amazon. One of our favorite picks is the <a href="https://zdcs.link/weol6?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Sweetfull%20Portable%20Neck%20Fan&object_type=article&object_uuid=0781kOwgxGcvGdfYi1Wgfap&short_url=weol6&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Sweetfull Portable Neck Fan</a>. It's just $22.99 right now, which is down from its original price of $29.99. That's a discount of 23% and $7 off. </p><p>This wearable neck fan looks like a pair of headphones, but it's a bladeless fan that promises to cool you down by 70% without any wires or cords. Its fan runs for 4 to 9 hours on its 4000 mAh rechargeable battery, and it's  quiet as well, so you won't walk around all day sounding like a box fan. It's also just 8.5 ounces, so it won't give you neck pain at the cost of being cool and comfortable. </p><p>For people who run <em>really </em>hot, several premium Torras personal air conditioners are also on sale right now. So, when you can't stay inside to enjoy that sweet, sweet air conditioning, a personal air conditioner can help. </p><h3><strong>More personal air conditioners on sale now: </strong></h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/0P6j3?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Jisulife%20Portable%20Neck%20Fan&object_type=article&object_uuid=0781kOwgxGcvGdfYi1Wgfap&short_url=0P6j3&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Jisulife Portable Neck Fan</a> &mdash; <strong>$25.99</strong> <s>$31.99</s> (save $6)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/oe2B6?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Torras%20Coolify%20Portable%20Neck%20Fan&object_type=article&object_uuid=0781kOwgxGcvGdfYi1Wgfap&short_url=oe2B6&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Torras Coolify Portable Neck Fan</a> &mdash; <strong>$59.99</strong> <s>$79.99</s> (save $20)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/lVGlN?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Torras%202024%20Portable%20Neck%20Air%20Conditioner&object_type=article&object_uuid=0781kOwgxGcvGdfYi1Wgfap&short_url=lVGlN&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Torras 2024 Portable Neck Air Conditioner</a> &mdash; <strong>$149</strong> <s>$179</s> (save $30)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/MVwEm?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Torras%20Cyber%20Ultimate%20Neck%20Air%20Conditioner&object_type=article&object_uuid=0781kOwgxGcvGdfYi1Wgfap&short_url=MVwEm&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Torras Cyber Ultimate Neck Air Conditioner</a> &mdash; <strong>$264</strong> <s>$279</s> (save $15 with on-page coupon)</p></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>Hugh Hammer's mother may be why Vermithor chose him</h2><p>We find out in episode 7 that Hugh's mother was the sister of Baelon Targaryen, meaning her father was King Jaehaerys the Concilliator himself &mdash; the very first rider of Vermithor.</p><p>Even though Hugh doesn't tell his wife Kat (Ellora Torchia) what his mother's name was, he does reveal that she worked in a pleasure house.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>"She was granted more freedom than most 'cuz of who she was," he says. "She used to tell me I was no different to her brother's boys: Viserys and Daemon."</p><p>The fact that Hugh's grandfather was Vermithor's first rider surely plays a part in why the dragon chose him &mdash; but if we look at <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-book-vs-show" target="_self">George R.R. Martin's </a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-book-vs-show" target="_self"><em>Fire and Blood</em></a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-book-vs-show" target="_self"> book</a>, there may be even more to it than that.</p><h2>Hugh's mother had a difficult relationship with her father</h2><p>Although Hugh only gives us limited information in the show, it seems most likely that his mother is <a href="https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Saera_Targaryen" target="_blank">Saera Targaryen</a>, who fled Westeros and worked at a pleasure house in Lys after a falling out with her parents.</p><p>In the book, Saera and King Jaehaerys have a difficult relationship that results in him sending her away to live with the Faith as punishment for her sleeping with Ser Braxton Beesbury. After she flees across the narrow sea the two become estranged, but Jaehaerys mistakes his carer for Saera when he's on his deathbed, thinking she's finally come back to him.</p><p>Is it possible that Vermithor felt a special connection to Hugh because of who his mother was? That maybe he chose Saera's son because he knew how much she secretly meant to Jaehaerys?</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/el4jA?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3B%3B%3Btemplate=article&amp%3B%3B%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3B%3B%3Belement=offer&amp%3B%3B%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3B%3B%3Belement_label=New%20episodes%20of%20House%20of%20the%20Dragon%20air%20Sundays%20at%209%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20HBO%20and%20Max.&amp%3B%3B%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3B%3B%3Bobject_uuid=03jg0PhZrarqGYLH6vmYtlc&amp%3B%3B%3Bshort_url=el4jA&amp%3B%3B%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Fhouse-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-5-who-will-be-the-next-dragonriders&amp%3B%3Btemplate=article&amp%3B%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3B%3Belement=offer&amp%3B%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3B%3Belement_label=New%20episodes%20of%20House%20of%20the%20Dragon%20air%20Sundays%20at%209%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20HBO%20and%20Max.&amp%3B%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3B%3Bobject_uuid=03V5PwCtaXC5HLKjmgAasL1&amp%3B%3Bshort_url=el4jA&amp%3B%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Fhouse-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-6-seasmoke-new-rider-addam-velaryon&amp%3Btemplate=article&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=New%20episodes%20of%20House%20of%20the%20Dragon%20air%20Sundays%20at%209%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20HBO%20and%20Max.&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=03yW3dOwoto3yupo0H84Bmy&amp%3Bshort_url=el4jA&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Fhouse-of-the-dragon-vermithor-silverwing-dragon-riders&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=New%20episodes%20of%20House%20of%20the%20Dragon%20air%20Sundays%20at%209%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20HBO%20and%20Max.&object_type=article&object_uuid=026ovN7eMv6DFQ4NdLJBYtt&short_url=el4jA&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">New episodes of <em>House of the Dragon </em>air Sundays at 9 p.m. ET on HBO and Max.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://mashable.com/category/portable-speakers" target="_self">Bluetooth speakers</a> are the unsung heroes of summer adventures, from backyard barbecues to beach days. These nifty little gadgets make it easy to create your own soundtrack wherever you go, but they can get expensive &mdash; unless you find a killer deal. </p><p>As of July 31, you can get a <a href="https://zdcs.link/1vnmA?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Bose%20SoundLink%20Flex%20Bluetooth%20speaker&object_type=article&object_uuid=001m0obIXtU75h0XYNzFZTo&short_url=1vnmA&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Bose SoundLink Flex Bluetooth speaker</a> for just $109 at Amazon. That&rsquo;s $40 off the listing price and the lowest price we&rsquo;ve seen this speaker go for at Amazon, per price trackers like <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B099TJGJ91" target="_blank">CamelCamelCamel</a>. (Select colors of this speaker were briefly priced at $99.99 during Prime Day and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/july-8-bose-soundlink-flex-speaker-deal" target="_self">Target Circle Week</a>, but that deal didn't last long.)</p><p>The SoundLink Flex is one of Bose&rsquo;s best portable speakers, and a way better option when compared to the <a href="https://zdcs.link/0P6qN?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Bose%20SounLink%20Max&object_type=article&object_uuid=001m0obIXtU75h0XYNzFZTo&short_url=0P6qN&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Bose SounLink Max</a>, at least <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bose/comments/1df21yt/the_bose_soundlink_flex_is_better_than_the_bose/" target="_blank">according to Reddit</a>. We've also tested out this speaker, and it offers big sound and easy connectivity. Not only is it fully waterproof, but it can even float. It's also dust-proof and resistant to corrosion and UV light, making it the ideal summer companion. It also comes in a variety of colors, but the black model is the cheapest at $109. You can get other colors, like white smoke or stone blue, for $119.</p><p>This speaker is small enough to throw in your duffle but powerful enough to fill a room or outdoor space with crisp, immersive audio. You can also connect it to your phone to make and answer calls hands-free. With up to 12 hours of playtime per charge, you&rsquo;ll be able to keep the tunes going all day long &ndash;&nbsp;or until your neighbors complain, whichever comes first.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[Google Search results should limit nonconsensual deepfake imagery.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/008oW0wYwLWWL7rkglmhBYy/hero-image.jpg" alt="Laptop with Google Search pulled up. "><p>The explosion of nonconsensual deepfake imagery online in the past year, particularly of female celebrities, has presented a difficult challenge for search engines. Even if someone isn't looking for that material, searching for certain names can yield a shocking number of links to fake explicit photos and videos of that individual.  </p><p><a href="https://mashable.com/category/google" target="_self">Google</a> is trying to tackle that problem with an update to its ranking systems, the company announced in a <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/google-search-explicit-deep-fake-content-update/" target="_blank">blog post</a>. </p><p>Google product manager Emma Higham wrote in the post that the ranking updates are designed to lower explicit fake content for many searches. </p><p>When someone uses terms to seek out nonconsensual deepfakes of specific individuals, the ranking system will attempt to instead provide "high-quality, non-explicit content," such as news articles, when it's available. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

            The consequences of making a nonconsensual deepfake

    </div>
<p>"With these changes, people can read about the impact deepfakes are having on society, rather than see pages with actual nonconsensual fake images," Higham wrote.</p><p>The ranking updates have already decreased exposure to explicit image results on deepfake searches by 70 percent, according to Higham.  </p><p>Google is also aiming to downrank explicit deepfake content, though Higham noted that it can be difficult to distinguish between content that is real and consensual, such as an actor's nude scenes, and material generated by artificial intelligence, without an actor's consent. </p><p>To help spot deepfake content, Google is now factoring into its ranking whether a site's pages have been removed from Search under the company's policies. Sites with a high volume of removals for fake explicit imagery will now be demoted in Search. </p><p>Additionally, Google is updating systems that handle requests for removing nonconsensual deepfakes from Search. The changes should make the request process easier. </p><p>When a victim is able to remove deepfakes of themselves from Google Search, the company's systems will aim to filter all related results on similar searches about them, and scan and remove duplicates of that imagery. </p><p>Higham acknowledged that there's "more work to do," and that Google would continue developing "new solutions" to help people affected by nonconsensual deepfakes.</p><p>Google's announcement comes two months after the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/biden-calls-on-tech-companies-to-stop-deepfakes" target="_self">White House called on tech companies</a> to stop the spread of explicit deepfake imagery.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The game is all about finding the "common threads between words." And just like <em>Wordle</em>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-20-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> resets after midnight and each new set of words gets trickier and trickier&mdash;so we've served up some hints and tips to get you over the hurdle.</p><p>If you just want to be told today's puzzle, you can jump to the end of this article for July 31's <em>Connections</em> solution. But if you'd rather solve it yourself, keep reading for some clues, tips, and strategies to assist you.</p><h2>What is Connections?</h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. Like <em>Wordle, </em>you can share the results with your friends on social media.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Earlier this week, Pizza Hut announced that customers in Hong Kong and Macao can have pineapple added to their pizzas free of charge until July 31.&nbsp;</p><p>"If you are a foodie, choose the Italian style and add pineapple," <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pizzahut.hk/posts/893578779475489" target="_blank">Pizza Hut Hong Kong &amp; Monaco wrote on Facebook (translated via Google Translate).</a> "Or add Hawaiian style with pineapple, starting from $139 [$US18]!"</p><p>The post was accompanied by a graphic showing a fencer with three pineapple rings threaded on their sword.</p><div class="facebook-embed text-center mb-4">

<p>Pizza Hut's promotion seems specifically designed to rile up Italians by ostensibly ruining one of their most famous dishes. <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/pineapple-pizza-italy-naples/index.html" target="_blank">Pineapple on pizza</a> has long been a controversial topping, with many considering it tantamount to sacrilege (<a href="https://en.pizzadixit.com/do-italians-really-hate-pineapple-pizza-no-i-dont-think-so-heres-why/" target="_blank">albeit typically in a joking manner</a>).</p><p>However, this lighthearted potshot didn't come out of nowhere. Pizza Hut's pineapple promotion came hot on the heels of Hong Kong defeating Italy in fencing for gold at Paris, responding to the latter's poor reaction to the loss.</p><h2>The Olympic fencing controversy between Hong Kong and Italy</h2><p>On Monday, at Paris' Grand Palais, Hong Kong fencer Ka Long Cheung defeated Italy's Filippo Macchi to win the 2024 Olympic gold medal in the men's fencing individual foil event. <a href="https://olympics.com/en/news/paris-2024-fencing-hong-kong-china-cheung-ka-long-olympic-champion-mens-foil-individual" target="_blank">The close bout ended with a score of 15-14</a> after going to sudden death, with Macchi putting up an impressive fight against the defending champion at his first ever Olympic Games. There were even two moments where the judges had to review video footage to determine whether the winning 15th point had been scored, though no point was awarded both times. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Cheung eventually emerged victorious after a video review of a third contentious point was ruled in his favour. Unfortunately, both Cheung's gold and Macchi's silver have been marred by what appears to be some rather poor sportsmanship. </p><p>Shortly after the match, <a href="https://federscherma.it/giochi-olimpici-parigi-2024-arbitraggio-inaccettabile-la-federazione-italiana-scherma-inoltra-una-protesta-ufficiale-per-loro-negato-a-filippo-macchi/" target="_blank">the Italian Fencing Federation (IFF) announced it was filing a formal protest</a> against the results with the F&eacute;d&eacute;ration Internationale d'Escrime (the governing body of Olympic fencing) and the International Olympic Committee. In particular, the IFF took issue with the referees' home countries of Taipei and South Korea, alleging that they were too close geographically to Hong Kong to arbitrate fairly. </p><p>This seems a strange argument considering that the entire history of international conflict suggests physical proximity bears little relation to whether countries actually like each other. As such, many people online have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/olympics/comments/1efsm5l/comment/lfnhymh/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank">attributed the IIF's complaint to anti-Asian racism</a>.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>"Filippo Macchi is the real winner and he was denied a gold he deserved," said IFF president Paolo Azzi in a statement (translated via Google Translate). "The selection of referees is a problem but the level of refereeing was below the great final we saw."</p><p>The gold medal match was refereed by Huang Hao-Chih from Taipei, with Suh Sangwon of South Korea acting as the video referee. Ayoub Ferjani from Tunisia and Vilem Madr from the Czech Republic served as assistant referees. These four judges had previously refereed <a href="https://www.eurosport.com/olympics/sport/fencing/event/men-foil-individual/match/fem001202/" target="_blank">Macchi's 15-11 semi-final win against U.S. fencer Nick Itkin</a>, albeit with Ferjani and Huang acting as referee and video referee respectively. </p><p>Macchi's quarter-final win against Egypt's Mohamed Hamza was also overseen by Madr and Tim Claus Bardenhagen, whose respective home countries of the Czech Republic and Germany are notably closer to Italy than Egypt.&nbsp;</p><p>The IFF did not raise any objection to the choice of referees in either of these previous matches.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Italy's apparent sore loser behaviour wasn't confined to IFF officials. People from both Italy and Hong Kong quickly took to social media to insult the opposing athletes, the match referees, and each other. Such comments have ranged from sharing offensive food combinations to more aggressive and mean-spirited attacks.</p><p>It isn't all vitriol, though. While Macchi, Cheung, and the judges' Instagram comment sections still contain mean-spirited posts, there are many congratulatory and appreciative sentiments as well. </p><p>For his part, Macchi is leading by example by accepting his Olympic silver medal with class and grace. The Italian fencer acknowledged fans who felt he'd been robbed of gold, but said he considered himself fortunate to have come in second.</p><blockquote class="mx-auto instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/C-Chpkhs6Yw/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="12" style=" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin-top: 1px; margin-bottom:1px; max-width:540px; min-width:326px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);">

<p>"I&rsquo;ve heard of all kinds, they robbed you, outrageous arbitration, it&rsquo;s a shame,"&nbsp; <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C-Chpkhs6Yw/" target="_blank">Macchi wrote in a post on Instagram (translated via Instagram)</a>. "Yet I'm reminded that I'm one lucky guy. I'm 22, a beautiful family, amazing friends, and a girlfriend that constantly leaves me speechless.&nbsp;</p><p>"I came second in the most important competition for any athlete playing a sport, and because I play this sport I learned that referee decisions must be respected, always! I know both referees, I don&rsquo;t feel like pointing a finger at them and blaming them for my lack of success even because it would lead to nothing but creating an alibi for me. What has happened is in the past, now it is gone, what will happen in the future is up to me!"</p><p>Macchi's mature response appears to have earned him the respect of many, whether they're from Hong Kong or elsewhere. Fortunately, the men's fencing individual foil wasn't his only chance of winning gold at the Paris Olympics. The Italian fencer is currently scheduled to compete against Poland in the men's foil team quarter-finals next week. He'll no doubt have quite a few more people cheering for him now.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Some of the most highly anticipated Apple Intelligence features, like <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-use-genmoji-on-ios-18" target="_self">Genmoji</a> (AI-generated emojis) and Image Playground (AI-generated images), are not available yet. However, there are still some Apple Intelligence utilities you can test right now &mdash; especially since they've made their first robust debut with the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-intelligence-how-to-install-ios-18-developer-beta" target="_self">iOS 18.1 developer beta</a> that Apple dropped on Monday.</p><p>With my <a href="https://mashable.com/article/iphone-15-pro-max-2-months" target="_self">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a>, I tested some Apple Intelligence features, and to be succinct, I appreciate how much it indulges my laziness. Of course, it's not perfect &mdash; not yet at least. After all, the iOS 18.1 developer beta is expectedly a bit rough-around-the-edges as Apple collects feedback from testers. (This is why you should always <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-backup-iphone" target="_self">backup your iPhone</a> before installing any iOS beta because it can be risky.) </p><p>Overall, though, Apple has something here that will make its "Pro" and "Pro Max" iPhone models even more enticing than ever.

<h2><strong>New 'Summarize' tool makes Safari more attractive</strong></h2><p>Apple basically put a TLDR (too long, didn't read) button in Safari, allowing me to skip ultra-long articles and get to the point. After opening Safari, I can press-and-hold the icon on the left of the URL bar, tap "Summarize," and wham, Apple Intelligence gives me "CliffsNotes," if you will, of any article I don't have time to read. It's perfect for when you want to get to the gist of the story as quickly as possible.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>As someone with an attention deficit, I can't help but get a little antsy after stumbling upon a wall of text or a verbose story. Typically, I'd read a few sentences and give up. However, with the "Summarize" tool, I received short-and-sweet synopses on articles that ramble, meander, and seem to go nowhere fast. In fact, at times, I found myself wanting to read a lengthy article <em>in its entirety </em>after the AI-powered summary revealed that the story is juicier than expected.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>That being said, when it comes to delving into dense articles, why would I use Google Chrome? I'm hopping and skipping over to Safari to take advantage of that new Apple Intelligence-powered Summarize tool.</p><p>The only downside, however, is that the Summarize tool tests my patience sometimes. It can be a few seconds too slow for my tastes, but this isn't unique to Apple Intelligence (ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini can be slow pokes, too.) But admittedly, it's worth the wait.</p><h2><strong>'Writing Tools' feature is surprisingly useful</strong></h2><p>One of the most popular use cases for AI, whether it's <a href="https://mashable.com/category/chatgpt" target="_self">ChatGPT</a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/wwdc-2024-apple-ai-gemini-chatgpt" target="_self">Google Gemini</a>, or <a href="https://mashable.com/article/what-is-copilot" target="_self">Copilot,</a> is "tone tuning" text. For example, you can drop in an email draft and ask those AI tools to help adjust your tone.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>However, I'll admit that I was one of those people who thought, "Pfft, I don't need an AI chatbot to tell me how to make something sound more professional!" As it turns out, the Apple Intelligence-based tone-adjustment tool, which can be accessed via the new Writing Tools feature, is a lot more helpful than I thought.</p><p>You'll be surprised how often you may <em>think </em>you're coming across friendly and congenial in emails and texts, but instead, your messages are being interpreted as prickly. To reduce the risk of this, I found myself using the "friendly" tone-adjustment tool to nix unintended snippiness. The best part is that I was able to use Writing Tools in almost <em>any</em> text field across the iOS 18.1 developer beta. I just highlight the words, hit "Writing Tools," and choose my desired tone.</p><p>As a result, I've definitely seen more positive responses from my co-workers, friends, and other loved ones.</p><h2><strong>No more endless scrolling on the Photos app</strong></h2><p>I take a <em>lot </em>of pictures and selfies, but no, I don't categorize them nor put them into albums (because, spoiler alert, I'm lazy). I just let them pile up into a haphazard collection of random snapshots. Every now and then, however, I need to find that <em>one </em>picture, which requires me to scroll endlessly to find it.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Fortunately, with the iOS 18.1 developer beta, I can use natural language to search for a particular picture in the Photos app. For example, I typed the word "pancakes" to find a saved screenshot of my favorite IHOP order.</p><p>This natural search feature can also detect text on the photo, which is helpful, too. However, the natural language-based search function isn't sophisticated yet. For example, while I can get away with typing something like "laptop" and "food" (and it will find photos that match those terms), it's not advanced enough to grasp more complex searches like, "Woman wearing a red shirt." </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Again, this beta version of iOS 18 is early days, so the search function's complexity may get a boost when iOS 18 officially drops later this year. </p><h2><strong>Siri is more helpful than ever</strong></h2><p>Siri received an AI-powered boost with Apple Intelligence, but my favorite perk is its contextual awareness.

<p>Siri is aware of which article I'm looking at, so it can snatch the URL and send it to my fianc&eacute; without needing to lift a single finger. (I'm telling you &mdash; I've been spoiled rotten.)</p><h2><strong>Is Apple Intelligence worth it?</strong></h2><p>As hinted at the outset, Apple Intelligence nurtures my laziness &mdash; and I dig that. I don't always want to suffer through several paragraphs to get to the author's point. I don't want to spend too much time hemming and hawing over how to best respond to someone. And finally, I don't want to scroll endlessly through my cluttered gallery to find a specific photo &mdash; it's like finding a needle in a haystack.</p><p>Apple Intelligence addresses all of those concerns. I was initially skeptical of Apple's new suite of AI features, but as it turns out, Apple Intelligence is useful, and yes, totally worth it.</p><p>Apple Intelligence is expected to officially roll out with iOS 18 later this year (but keep in mind that reports claim that <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-ai-late" target="_self">some features may be delayed).</a></p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

      <description><![CDATA["Shelby Oaks," the first film from YouTube reviewer Chris Stuckmann, includes influences ranging from "The Blair Witch Project" to "Barbarian."]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00VzU5sMyQVHpJ4uhEAMozU/hero-image.jpg" alt="A woman holds out a photograph in "Shelby Oaks.""><p>Can a great horror movie be Frankensteined together from a laundry list of iconic ones? That's what I'm left pondering after watching <em>Shelby Oaks</em>, the promising and oft unnerving but also somewhat scattered first feature from popular YouTube movie reviewer Chris Stuckmann.</p><p>The movie starts out convincing you it's one thing, but reveals itself in quick succession to be a very different beast altogether. From <em>The Blair Witch Project</em> to <em>Martyrs</em> to <em>Barbarian</em> and several beyond that, <em>Shelby Oaks</em> doesn't just wear its many genre influences on its sleeves &mdash;&nbsp;it wears them on its chest and back and shoulders. It's a coat of many horror movies, made of cuts deep and broad. And, to ever so slightly belabor the metaphor, some of the coat fits just right, while as much of it could use some more refined tailoring.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, as far as Kickstarter-funded first features go, <em>Shelby Oaks</em> is a big, bold swing &mdash; albeit one produced by horror honcho Mike Flanagan, the man behind a swath of Netflix horror miniseries like <a href="https://mashable.com/article/haunting-hill-house-domestic-horror-love" target="_self"><em>The Haunting of Hill House</em></a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-fall-of-the-house-of-usher-review" target="_self"><em>The Fall of the House of Usher</em></a>. It's twisty as hell, bears some ace performances, and truly gifts audiences with some very sticky and very spooky images. Most of all, it marks the emergence of a horror filmmaker worth keeping an eye on.&nbsp;</p><h2>Shelby Oaks blends The Blair Witch Project with Lake Mungo &mdash; and that's just the start.</h2><p>"Who took Riley Brennan?" is the question at the heart of <em>Shelby Oaks.</em> The film opens with the last known bit of footage of Riley Brennan (Sarah Durn), YouTuber/ghost hunter, before she went missing in the titular town. In the scene, she sits on a bed in a cabin in the middle of the woods. She's seen sobbing, absolutely terrified, saying into the camera, "I'm so scared."</p><p>It's an inch-long leap from Riley's tearful lament to Heather Donahue's legendarily snotty apologia in <em>The Blair Witch Project,</em> the one that poetically stated, "I'm scared to close my eyes, and I'm scared to open them."</p><p>Writer-director Stuckmann anticipates his horror-loving audience will make this connection. But then he does something really interesting, pivoting from the found-footage conceit to a true-crime documentary framework. Leaping to a decade or so after Riley's disappearance, it turns out that Riley's older sister, Mia (Camille Sullivan), has spent the intervening years fruitlessly searching for the truth of what happened in the woods of Shelby Oaks that night. And she's now starring in a true-crime documentary in an effort to reignite interest in the case of her missing sister.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For horror fanatics, this turn might well recall <em>Lake Mungo</em>. Told via talking-head interviews with the family of the missing blonde girl at its center, the 2008 Australian horror film unfurls its paranormal revelations piecemeal through conversations and scattered bits of phone video. <em>Lake Mungo</em> is admittedly a deeper cut than <em>The Blair Witch Project, </em>but no sooner does <em>Shelby Oaks </em>settle into this faux-documentary conceit than Stuckmann pivots again to a straightforward narrative film. Well, it's as straightforward as the twisty likes of <em>Hereditary </em>or <em>Barbarian.</em></p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Essentially, <em>Shelby Oaks </em>maintains its cast, but ditches the documentary framework altogether, showing us what is "really" happening &mdash; but through artifice, forcing us to question what is real. The camerawork becomes stylized, with special effects and slow motion and close-ups; an aggressive and manipulative score takes over. The film will shift from these narrative scenes to the documentary setup to found footage and back again, maximizing this sense of narrative disquiet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>These structural sleights of hands, like all good and proper rug-pullings, are where <em>Shelby Oaks</em> works its greatest magic. Playing on the expectations of horror diehards, Stuckmann manages to keep us on our toes, even discombobulated. We find ourselves switching between missing-person found footage to the cult horror of <em>Hereditary</em> with the twists and turns (and hidden underground caverns) of <em>Martyrs</em> and <em>Barbarian</em>, and then right back to a talking-head true-crime doc on a dime. This all builds up its own sort of disassociation within the experience of watching it.&nbsp;</p><h2>Shelby Oaks is a hodgepodge of horror, from found footage to Satanic panic.</h2><p>Despite these daring shifts, <em>Shelby Oaks</em> begins to feel more like the parts of its sum and not vice versa. Stuckmann is motioning toward all of these other movies to unmoor us, but those references often distract from the actual plot and, in turn, undermine our investment in it. For instance, the casting of&nbsp;Brendan Sexton III as Mia's husband proves distracting, even though he's terrific. An actor who's been killing it since Todd Solondz's 1995 hit, <em>Welcome to the Dollhouse</em>, Sexton turns in yet another lovely, sad piece of work here. But you set him against multiple scenes that take place inside of a haunted prison, and now all I'm thinking about is <em>Session 9</em>, Brad Anderson's fantastically creepy 2001 haunted prison movie, where Sexton made a mark as one of the asbestos cleaners who found himself on the wrong end of some rusty psychiatric equipment.</p><p>To what end is this? At what point do these Easter eggs overwhelm? All these allusions ultimately get in the way of <em>Shelby Oaks </em>standing on its own and becoming truly, deeply scary. Stuckmann seems very aware of the exact moment when his scares are supposed to land, often to the point of self-consciousness. You could set a timer to when the thing you're supposed to be dreading will appear, and the dreaded thing will stick that mark every time. There are moments when a zag would've kicked the ass of a zig, but Stuckmann keeps on zigging, playing right into horror connoisseur expectations. There is real, earned tension, but the film keeps deflating itself despite the fun of its reality-shifting and the many excellent go-for-broke performances therein.&nbsp;</p><h2>Camille Sullivan leads a cast that fights valiantly for Shelby Oaks.&nbsp;</h2><p>An actor who's been nipping at the edges of recognition for two decades, appearing in TV shows from <em>Dark Angel </em>to <em>The Man in the High Castle</em>, Camille Sullivan has long proven a reliable performer. And here at last she is given the spotlight to make the most of it.&nbsp;</p><p>Even when Mia starts doing incredibly stupid things that put her right in harm's way, Sullivan is genuinely devastating. She sells the hell out of bad choices, making it clear that Mia's a person who would go to any lengths to uncover what happened to her beloved sister. (And as long as we're talking references, besides this being the lead's arc in that French Extremity classic <em>Martyrs,</em> it's straight out of the terrifying 1988 Dutch thriller <em>The Vanishing</em>,<em> </em>too.)&nbsp;</p><p>Sullivan nails big action moments, like emotional blowups and freak-outs in which her palpable fright is legitimately difficult to look at. But even the small moments give her opportunities to send shivers. Just watch the way the flashlight trembles in her hand as she investigates that haunted prison, a subtle shift in body language that communicates a bone-deep terror. It's those touches that carry the audience alongside Mia the entire way.&nbsp;</p><p>Sarah Durn is also haunting as missing girl Riley, who has to sell her undoing while staring off into space during the "naturalistic" found-footage portions of this movie. These are scenes we keep coming back to to see more of as, natch, more footage gets found, and her haunted presence diffuses into every corner of the film. As we know from decades of subpar found-footage movies, it's not easy, this high-wire balancing act of giving a relaxed and unprofessional-seeming performance under those constraints. Loads have failed spectacularly. But Durn makes us understand why her sister won't let her go even as everyone else has long given up. She makes Riley our ghost, too.</p><p>The whole ensemble expertly submerges into the multiple realities of this story. Even if Stuckmann needs to get a little bit out of his own way in some other areas, he proves to be terrific with his performers. Sullivan and Sexton share some very moving moments together as they watch their marriage crumble in the face of tragedy. Michael Beach wears a bone-deep exhaustion in his performance as the main detective on the case, giving a lived-in sense of resignation at the system's endless failures. And Keith David (the deep-voiced legend from <em>The Thing</em> and <em>They Live</em>, among many) shows up to Keith David it out of the park, playing the former warden of that haunted prison who has seen some shit and who, in typical fashion, is going to colorfully monologue to you all about it.&nbsp;</p><p>But best of all is the great and notoriously underused Robin Bartlett. One of those stalwart character actors with decades of stealing scenes under their belts (she's been doing it since <em>Heaven's Gate</em> in 1980, but I always first think of her hilarious scenes around the dinner table in <em>Inside Llewyn Davis</em> whenever I see her), Bartlett shows up and gives the movie a last-act goose that takes it over the edge into true unhinged horror-movie delight. More I cannot and will not spoil, except to say that yes, this is how you give Robin Bartlett her due. She ends up stealing &mdash; and in so doing, <em>making</em> &mdash; the entire movie.</p><p>Playing like a post-post-modern pastiche, an ouroboros of antecedents, and sometimes just a wicked walk through a nightmare wasteland, <em>Shelby Oaks</em> has enough gas in its tank for 10 movies. That it sometimes feels like 10 movies we've seen before is both part of its weird ballsy charm and its scrappy undoing. In the end, <em>Shelby Oaks </em>is a battle between Stuckmann's many, many inspirations. But the gripping performances and big swings in style make for a movie worth its runtime. Despite its faults, the directorial debut should prove a hell of a calling card for Chris Stuckmann as a new voice in horror. I can't wait to see what he delivers to us next.</p><p><em>Shelby Oaks </em>was reviewed out of the Fantasia International Film Festival.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This milestone sets the stage for future removal and a sustainable space environment!"</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Operating in such close orbital proximity to another object is daunting. Many objects in Earth's lower orbit travel at some 7 to 8 kilometers per second (15,660 to 17,895 mph). The company first attempted a fly-around in June, but an anomaly prompted the satellite to abort. "ADRAS-J safely maneuvered away from the upper stage as designed, demonstrating the effectiveness of its on-board collision avoidance system in safely approaching a non-cooperative object," Astroscale said in a statement. </p><p>But as the imagery below shows, the next flybys on July 15 and 16 were successful. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The greater space debris removal mission is part of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency's (JAXA, which is Japan's <a href="https://mashable.com/category/nasa" target="_self">NASA</a> counterpart) "Commercial Removal of Debris Demonstration" project, which seeks a proven way to remove problematic space junk from Earth's orbit. </p><p>"We selected this target because it is a large piece of space debris and there are many similarly shaped (cylindrical) pieces on the [space debris] list," Yamamoto Toru, who leads Japan's commercial removal mission, said in a <a href="https://global.jaxa.jp/activity/pr/jaxas/no092/03.html" target="_blank">statement</a>. "If we are successful, we expect to be able to apply these techniques to the removal of similarly shaped space debris."</p><p>With the reconnaissance now complete, Astroscale will next attempt to capture the debris (using a spacecraft currently under construction) with a robotic arm, and bring the rocket stage down to a lower orbit. Eventually, it will largely burn up in Earth's atmosphere. In the future, the hope among spacefaring nations and commercial space interests is to keep low Earth orbit (LEO) largely clear of threatening <a href="https://mashable.com/article/space-debris-blown-up-satellite" target="_self">space debris</a> &mdash; especially inert craft that can't maneuver on their own.</p><p>"LEO is an orbital space junk yard," NASA explains. "There are <a href="https://mashable.com/article/starlink-spacex-satellites-orbital-debris" target="_self">millions of pieces of space junk</a> flying in LEO. Most orbital debris comprises human-generated objects, such as pieces of spacecraft, tiny flecks of paint from a spacecraft, parts of rockets, satellites that are no longer working, or explosions of objects in orbit flying around in space at high speeds."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The streaming service not only boasts such <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-crime-documentaries-netflix" target="_self"><u>popular documentaries</u></a> as <em>Making a Murderer, The Keepers, </em>and <em>Amanda Knox</em>, but also <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-crime-shows-netflix" target="_self">gripping drama series</a> based on real crimes, like <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-watcher-true-story-john-list-graff" target="_self"><em>The Watcher</em></a><em>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/when-they-see-us-central-park-five-review" target="_self">When They See Us</a></em><em>, </em>and<a href="https://mashable.com/video/mindhunter-season-2-trailer-netflix" target="_self"> </a><a href="https://mashable.com/video/mindhunter-season-2-trailer-netflix" target="_self"><em>Mindhunter</em></a><em>. </em>So, it seemed a natural fit for Netflix to resurrect <em>Unsolved Mysteries </em>in 2020, even if it meant a radical reimagining.&nbsp;</p><p>While the series continues to cover everything from suspicious deaths to missing persons cases to paranormal activity, the rebooted <a href="https://mashable.com/video/unsolved-mysteries-volume-2-trailer" target="_self"><em>Unsolved Mysteries</em></a> ditched the anthology format. Instead of a series of segments about various mysteries, each episode focuses on one case. Gone too is the ominous yet resolute voiceover of the late Robert Stack, and it is sorely missed. Rewatching the episodes of the classic series, you can see how even the grimmest cases offered a moment of hope. As the segment concluded, you'd hold your breath waiting for Stack's husky timber to say firmly: "Update." Then, a racing synth score would play, laying out how the case has moved forward or even been solved. </p><p>With Stack having passed over 20 years ago, this wouldn't be the case even if Netflix's version solved the mysteries. (While Netflix's relaunch has led to some <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/05/17/unsolved-mysteries-kayla-unbehaun-other-cases/70227551007/" target="_blank">updates</a>, they are typically announced<a href="https://www.facebook.com/netflixus/videos/925100251292561/?ref=embed_POST" target="_blank"> over social media</a>.) Still, never have I yearned for Stack's gruff but urgent "Update" more than at the conclusion of <em>Unsolved Mysteries </em>Volume 4, episode 2, "Body in the Basement."&nbsp;</p><p>Before you dive into Netflix's latest offering of true crime tales, take this as a warning: Do not watch this alone.&nbsp;</p><h2>In "Body in the Basement," Unsolved Mysteries explores the case of Amanda Antoni's suspicious death.&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Volume 1 began with this <a href="https://unsolvedmysteries.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Suspicious_Deaths" target="_blank">unsettling subset</a> of <em>Unsolved Mysteries, </em>focusing on the bizarre demise of Rey Rivera, a beloved husband who raced out the door in flip-flops never to come home. He'd be found days later, fallen through the broken roof of a historic high-rise hotel. But the police's insistence that it was suicide didn't satisfy family and friends who pointed to various clues that just didn't add up.&nbsp;Did he fall or was he pushed? A similar and similarly troubling question arises in the fourth, and latest, volume of the series, with "Body in the Basement."</p><p>Directed by Gabe Torres, the second episode of Volume 4 begins like many a true-crime documentary, with the playing of a frantic 911 call. "There's so much blood." weeps the caller, Lee Antoni, who is detailing the scene he came home to after a weekend away from his wife, Amanda. Interviews with her brothers will set up who she was through warm memories and family photos. Then, they begin to paint a picture of Lee. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>As her spouse, he's naturally the police's first suspect after she's found dead in the basement of their house. But swiftly, the police&nbsp;and this episode&nbsp;move on from Lee as a suspect and instead regard him as a resource, as it seems he was on the phone with her when disaster struck. What made their pet Labrador, Ruby, bark in apparent alarm? Why did Amanda's call get abruptly cut off? </p><p>Was it a break-in? A murder? An accident? These are the possibilities that still haunt Amanda's loved ones. What forensics offer is that Amanda's head was cut open, causing her to bleed profusely and fatally as, over hours, she walked around the basement but didn't leave to seek aid. Her bare footsteps in the blood tell us this much. But how did her head come to be cut? Why didn't she leave the basement? And why &mdash;&nbsp;over the day and half that she was in the basement before discovery &mdash;&nbsp;did neither her dog or cat come down, disturbing the blood with their paw prints?&nbsp;</p><p>As a detective stands at the base of the stairs where Amanda's blood footprints stopped, the audience is left to wonder about these questions with no promise of resolution. Worse yet, we're left to wonder what to even root for, as all possibilities are bone-chilling.&nbsp;</p><h2>I beg you: Do not watch this Unsolved Mysteries episode alone.&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>I watch a lot of true crime, both for work and because I can't stop. "Body in the Basement" was the episode I turned on before my work day began. But it stopped me cold. I was unfit for morning chitchat. Coffee couldn't shake the shivers from my legs. Even now, thinking back on Amanda's story, my eyes sting, threatening tears, and my legs are covered in goosebumps. This episode didn't show footage of her remains at the scene. But it did show the blood, so much blood, that surrounded where her body laid before being removed by police. Worse still, it showed those footprints that sketch a story we cannot (yet?) understand.&nbsp;</p><p>I can't wrench loose the vivid image in my head of Amanda walking around her basement, bleeding, her loyal Labrador just up the stairs with no door to separate them, yet keeping her distance. What were those hours like for Amanda? And do I really want to know? All the speculation I can offer is fueled by fear, and none of it gives me solace.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Volume 4 delves into five new mysteries, among them a summary of the crimes of Jack the Ripper; the cold case of Sigrid Stevenson, who was murdered on the college stage on which she loved to perform; the curious incident of an embalmed head being found in Pennsylvania; and a look into the American cryptid most beloved by internet culture, the Mothman. </p><p>These stories are in turn shocking, sad, and maybe even at times outrageous. (The expert who points to the blue heron as a possible cause for Mothman hysteria is pretty amusing in his barely restrained cynicism about the cryptid's existence.) Yet nothing hits as hard as the mystery of Amanda Antoni. It's been days since I first learned her story, saw her home, heard her brothers' praise and saw her husband's tears. And I wish I had something profound to say about her or their loss. I wish I had something to offer beyond a warning.&nbsp;</p><p>Some true crime stories serve as cautionary tales. Some sing of justice, however long delayed. Some warn of the fatal flaws in our society. Some will break your heart to pieces. And some scar your psyche, cutting deep to the very root of fear and existential dread. "Body in the Basement" is the last two. </p><p>So brace yourself before hitting play. If you dare at all.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/Ddq7R?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Unsolved%20Mysteries%20Volume%204%20premieres%20on%20Netflix%20Aug.%2031.&object_type=article&object_uuid=02lAkGJKN3ToFj0E6FKaTRe&short_url=Ddq7R&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><em>Unsolved Mysteries </em>Volume 4 premieres on Netflix Aug. 31.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>The M3 MacBook Air is for all intents and purposes back down to its record low price, sitting just one cent away from the its technical $898.99 record low. This deal rivals with Prime Day pricing, offering an 18% discount on a laptop with one of the best chips you can find in a MacBook, along with an 18 hour battery life, WiFi 6E support, and the ability to connect up to two external displays with the laptop lid closed. Of course, it also has the signature portability of the Air line, making it great for <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-macbooks" target="_self">working at home or taking on the go</a>.</p><h3>More iMac and MacBook deals</h3><p><strong>MacBook Air</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/Jpx3q?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20MacBook%20Air%2C%2013-inch%20%28M1%2C%208GB%20RAM%2C%20256GB%20SSD%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=00AbPlZbVetQKOqcrEnaYbS&short_url=Jpx3q&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Apple MacBook Air, 13-inch (M1, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD)</a> &mdash;

Considering this was one of our biggest gripes with the 2022 Air, we're happy to see that this change came without a price jump. </p><h3>More iPad deals</h3><p><strong>iPad (10th gen)</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/glYAP?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20iPad%20%28WiFi%2C%2064GB%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=00AbPlZbVetQKOqcrEnaYbS&short_url=glYAP&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Apple iPad (WiFi, 64GB)</a> &mdash; <strong>$299.99</strong> <s>$349</s> (save $49.01)</p></li></ul><p><strong>iPad Air</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/Bd5k1?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20iPad%20Air%2C%2011-inch%20%28M2%2C%20WiFi%2C%201TB%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=00AbPlZbVetQKOqcrEnaYbS&short_url=Bd5k1&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Apple iPad Air, 11-inch (M2, WiFi, 1TB)</a> &mdash; <strong>$1,024</strong> <s>$1,099</s> at Amazon (save $75)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/qkYdw?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20iPad%20Air%2C%2013-inch%20%28M2%2C%20WiFi%2C%20128GB%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=00AbPlZbVetQKOqcrEnaYbS&short_url=qkYdw&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Apple iPad Air, 13-inch (M2, WiFi, 128GB)</a> &mdash; <strong>$735</strong> <s>$799</s> at Amazon (save $64)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/ZRX8m?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20iPad%20Air%2C%2013-inch%20%28M2%2C%20WiFi%2C%20512GB%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=00AbPlZbVetQKOqcrEnaYbS&short_url=ZRX8m&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Apple iPad Air, 13-inch (M2, WiFi, 512GB)</a> &mdash; <strong>$1,024</strong> <s>$1,099</s> at Amazon (save $75)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/KJGk8?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20iPad%20Air%2C%2013-inch%20%28M2%2C%20WiFi%2C%201TB%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=00AbPlZbVetQKOqcrEnaYbS&short_url=KJGk8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Apple iPad Air, 13-inch (M2, WiFi, 1TB)</a> &mdash; <strong>$1,209</strong> <s>$1,299</s> at Amazon (save $90) </p></li></ul><p><strong>iPad Pro</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/R0pvy?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20iPad%20Pro%2C%2011-inch%20%28M4%2C%20WiFi%2C%20256GB%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=00AbPlZbVetQKOqcrEnaYbS&short_url=R0pvy&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Apple iPad Pro, 11-inch (M4, WiFi, 256GB)</a> &mdash; <strong>$919</strong> <s>$999</s> at Amazon (save $80)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/vdYKx?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20iPad%20Pro%2C%2011-inch%20%28M4%2C%20WiFi%2C%20512GB%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=00AbPlZbVetQKOqcrEnaYbS&short_url=vdYKx&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Apple iPad Pro, 11-inch (M4, WiFi, 512GB)</a> &mdash; <strong>$1,099</strong> <s>$1,199</s> at Amazon (save $100)</p></li></ul><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p><a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-iphone-15-plus-review" target="_self"><em>Read our full review of the iPhone 15.</em></a></p><p>The iPhone 15 hasn't really received the "get it free" deal treatment since it's been on the market. Although this particular deal comes with the standard caveats of requiring a new line and particular cell phone plan, it's still one of the best we've seen on this phone. With its USB-C charging port, Dynamic Island, and 48-megapixel camera, it is, as Mashable Senior Editor Stan Schroeder calls it in his review, one of "the best new iPhones for most people."</p><h3>More iPhone deals</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/gL5VD?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=iPhone%2015%20%28128GB%29%20at%20AT%26T&object_type=article&object_uuid=00AbPlZbVetQKOqcrEnaYbS&short_url=gL5VD&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">iPhone 15 (128GB) at AT&amp;T</a> &mdash; <strong>$129.99 </strong>with an eligible trade-in on select unlimited plans.

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>If you're looking to get an Apple Watch on the cheap, you'll want to check out this Apple Watch SE deal at <a href="https://zdcs.link/lnGA0?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Walmart&object_type=article&object_uuid=00AbPlZbVetQKOqcrEnaYbS&short_url=lnGA0&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Walmart</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/L3qeR?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Amazon&object_type=article&object_uuid=00AbPlZbVetQKOqcrEnaYbS&short_url=L3qeR&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Amazon</a>. This smartwatch is more on the basic side, without an S9 chip (and therefore Double Tap), an ECG sensor, and a display that maxes out at 1,000 nits of brightness (as compared to 2,000 nits). However, it can still act as a heart rate monitor, and of course, the ability to download a whole host of apps. </p><h3>More Apple Watch deals</h3><p><strong>Series 9</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/AdkYj?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20Watch%20Series%209%20%2841mm%2C%20GPS%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=00AbPlZbVetQKOqcrEnaYbS&short_url=AdkYj&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Apple Watch Series 9 (41mm, GPS)</a> &mdash; <strong>$329</strong> <s>$399</s> at Amazon (save $70)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/0ejor?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20Watch%20Series%209%20%2845mm%2C%20GPS%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=00AbPlZbVetQKOqcrEnaYbS&short_url=0ejor&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Apple Watch Series 9 (45mm, GPS)</a> &mdash; <strong>$359</strong> <s>$429</s> at Amazon (save $70)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/JdJkl?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20Watch%20Series%209%20%2845mm%2C%20GPS%20%2B%20cellular%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=00AbPlZbVetQKOqcrEnaYbS&short_url=JdJkl&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Apple Watch Series 9 (45mm, GPS + cellular)</a> &mdash; <strong>$429</strong> <s>$529</s> at Amazon (save $100)</p></li></ul><p><strong>SE</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/L3qeR?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20Watch%20SE%20%2840mm%2C%20GPS%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=00AbPlZbVetQKOqcrEnaYbS&short_url=L3qeR&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Apple Watch SE (40mm, GPS)</a> &mdash; <strong>$189</strong> <s>$249</s> at Amazon (save $60)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/MVwbk?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20Watch%20SE%20%2844mm%2C%20GPS%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=00AbPlZbVetQKOqcrEnaYbS&short_url=MVwbk&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Apple Watch SE (44mm, GPS)</a> &mdash; <strong>$219</strong> <s>$279</s> at Amazon (save $60)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/q7jww?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20Watch%20SE%20%2844mm%2C%20GPS%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=00AbPlZbVetQKOqcrEnaYbS&short_url=q7jww&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Apple Watch SE (44mm, GPS)</a> &mdash; <strong>$219</strong> <s>$279</s> at Walmart (save $60)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/b1rqE?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20Watch%20SE%20%2840mm%2C%20GPS%20%2B%20cellular%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=00AbPlZbVetQKOqcrEnaYbS&short_url=b1rqE&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Apple Watch SE (40mm, GPS + cellular)</a> &mdash; <strong>$229 </strong><s>$299</s> at Walmart (save $70)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/1vlo5?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20Watch%20SE%20%2844mm%2C%20GPS%20%2B%20cellular%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=00AbPlZbVetQKOqcrEnaYbS&short_url=1vlo5&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Apple Watch SE (44mm, GPS + cellular)</a> &mdash; <strong>$269.99</strong> <s>$329</s> at Amazon (save $59.01)</p></li></ul><h2>AirPods and Apple accessories deals</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>It's hard to overstate how freaking cool the play was. I'm no rugby expert but it was basically the sport's version of a Hail Mary completion to win the game in football.

<p>Biles' routine sets the highest difficulty scores of anyone else you'll see tumbling across the mat &mdash; and these are already some of history's greatest gymnasts. Her last pass (usually the lowest difficulty score out of a typical three- or four-pass routine) is scored nearly the same as other gymnasts' hardest tumbling efforts. It also features a skill named entirely after her. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-I_4n7HPl7uw"></div>

<p>Team USA, at large, showcases several powerhouse routines. However, nerves were high during the first qualification round. While Biles pulled in a huge 14.6 for her routine on Sunday, teammate and floor expert Carey stumbled into a major fall for the usually solid athlete. But in the finals, the entire team was on fire &mdash; and the podium seemed closer than ever for all three floor competitors. </p><p>Biles nearly nailed her history-defining passes, soaring through the air with only a few wobbles outside of bounds. But the minor slip-up was a trivial one: Biles got a 14.666. Lee brought in an impressive 13.533 herself, and Jordan Chiles &mdash; a known floor performer &mdash; nabbed a stunning 13.966 as she and her team were <a href="https://x.com/USAGym/status/1818350589937664384" target="_blank">brought to tears</a> on the mat. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Writing a book wasn't always on her radar, though. In fact, when her team first pitched it, she was pretty uninterested.</p><p>"Initially, I didn't even think I could write a book because I didn't think anything I had said up until that point was worth a book," Afualo says, adding that her manager encouraged her to consider it anyway. She was worried that because she isn't an expert in a scientific field, she didn't have enough to say &mdash; then she decided to lean into a book that's part <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-self-help-book-advice" target="_self">self-help</a>, part memoir. It felt right to her. "I think it just fits my niche very well."</p><p>In her debut title, <a href="https://zdcs.link/NM2jD?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Loud%3A%20Accept%20Nothing%20Less%20Than%20The%20Life%20You%20Deserve&object_type=article&object_uuid=04lqqzBgiBMq26lt9SbD156&short_url=NM2jD&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><em>Loud: Accept Nothing Less Than The Life You Deserve</em></a>, Afualo talks about feminism, racism, family, life online, and more.

<h2>Mashable: How do you describe this book to people?</h2><p><strong>Drew Afualo:</strong> Typically, I like to say it's more in the self-help category. I think, more than anything, it's extremely anecdotal, as opposed to many self-help books. I feel like most self-help &mdash; at least the ones I've read &mdash; are very statistical. They're very scientific, which I love. Mine is more life experience. </p><p>I just didn't wanna write exclusively a memoir because I'm only 28, so I felt like I hadn't lived a life long enough yet to warrant that more. But I thought talking about my own lived experience and my journey through unpacking a lot of my internalized biases leans more toward self-help.</p><h2>What do you feel like you can accomplish in a book that you can't on TikTok or on your podcast? Why write this book at all?</h2><p>Part of what I really was looking forward to accomplishing with the book was the fact that on TikTok and on my podcast, I'm also a comedian. I love to make silly jokes. I love to banter; I love entertaining as a whole. My platform has been wonderful in the sense that I've been able to almost put a pill in cheese and give it to my dog. Teach people about misogyny and patriarchy and bigotry as a whole in a way that's digestible and entertaining. And I think that's wonderful. If I'm their first intro to wanting to unpack it and learn more about it, I think that's wonderful. </p><p>Please don't stop at me. For the love of God, please don't stop at me. It goes so much deeper than me. The book is an opportunity for me to expand a lot more in a way that's a lot more erudite and driven by historical facts. It's driven by a lot of things that I feel like you should know.&nbsp;</p><h2>Like what?</h2><p>For example, how&nbsp;<a href="https://mashable.com/article/sofie-hagen-fat-activism-history-becomes-her" target="_self">fatphobia</a>&nbsp;is so grossly intertwined into many different facets of bigotry, but it's also important that we diagnose it and recognize it and, more importantly, break it. That's what I talked about in the book, how I lean more towards body neutrality than body positivity. I think body neutrality just works a lot better for me, personally. I don't want to pull anything from my body other than gratefulness and thankfulness that it works and it keeps me alive.</p><p>The book was an opportunity for me to give [my audience] a lot more information that I can't really be as snappy and entertaining within 45 minutes of my show or in a two-minute TikTok.There is the attention span that you're fighting against when you're making content online. The book was just a way for me to expand a lot more and give people a much more nuanced understanding of why I think the things I do and why I believe the things I do.</p><h2>You start the book with a quote from Nelson Mandela: "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart." Why did you choose this quote to start it off?</h2><p>I usually say that when speaking to your oppressor, you have to speak in a language they understand. A lot of times, it's violence. And I know for a fact I didn't make that up. I was trying to find who actually said it, and I couldn't. But there are a lot of Nelson Mandela quotes that I love.&nbsp;</p><p>When people fight oppression, it takes many different forms. And a lot of times, the only forms that are ever remembered in hindsight are nice ways or what people perceive to be nice. I really admire Nelson Mandela for many reasons. I thought this quote was perfect because it is exactly what I've been trying to communicate.</p><q>

    </q>
<h2>You write a lot about feminism, sexism, and misogyny in the book. Did you read anything &mdash; memoir or feminist theory &mdash; in preparation?&nbsp;</h2><p>I have read lots of feminist theories and books prior to having a platform. But when writing my book, I didn't read anything. The reason for that was intentional, and it was because I have a photographic memory, and I also have a sponge for a brain. So I feared that I would absorb things that were not mine and I would write them into my book. And so, to be very careful and cognizant of that, I haven't read anything for the last year and a half while I have been writing this book. That was intentional on purpose because the last thing I would ever want is for any unintentional plagiarism to happen.&nbsp;</p><h2>What books would you recommend to people who read your book and are interested in delving into it more?</h2><p>bell hooks. Roxanne Gay. Jessica Valenti is also wonderful. I spoke with Jessica Valenti in the very early stages of [having] my platform. There are incredible intersectional feminist authors, all of whom are far and away much more of an expert than I ever will be. Bren&eacute; Brown's books truly changed my life after I got fired. Not necessarily in the feminist vein, but more so in the mental health kind of vein, which I think go hand-in-hand in a lot of ways. Over the years, I've read so many wonderful authors that I was like, "Please don't ever think that I'm the one-stop shop for this." I am but a silly internet clown. That is who I am. So if mine is like, an intro, great. Please go read far more talented, far more informed authors other than myself.</p><q>
     I am but a silly internet clown.
    </q>
<h2>Tell me a bit about your writing process.</h2><p>I didn't write anything longhand. I did right before I started writing the book &mdash; I did an <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-10-06/tiktok-drew-afualo-misogynists-trolls-social-media-sexism" target="_blank"><u>op-ed for the <em>Los Angeles Times</em></u></a>. And when I initially did the op-ed, I did hand-write it. That kickstarted me actually writing my own book. But it was in pieces. I wrote very out of order.</p><p>My team, my literary agents, and my publishing team were like, "Give me 20 topics that are related to what you talked about online but things that you would like to expand on or have stories from your personal life that drove why you believe what you do and why your convictions are so strong and steadfast."</p><p>From there, we whittled it down. Which ones seemed a little repetitive? Which ones needed their own chapter? Which ones could go inside another chapter? Once we had those topics lined out, my team would tell me, "Give me 3000 words on this," or "Give me 1800 words on this." That's how the writing process went. But before we even started writing, they just listened to me talk for hours. We just recorded so many hours of me talking on Zoom with my team just about my life, from the very beginning until now, and going through all my different life experiences and stories that solidified my beliefs in certain things. And that shaped my perception and my perspective on things. </p><p>After that, it was just writing, writing, writing, editing, writing, writing, writing, editing. It gets very tedious after the initial thing is finished. I feel like my writing process was relatively tame compared to other people's, whose books are probably harder to write.</p><h2>I know that talking online is what you do, but that sounds exhausting.</h2><p>It was a lot. It's honestly quite boring in the sense of like, it's not very interesting to watch happen. You're just sitting and typing for hours. And as far as playlists go, I love listening to music when I write or when I'm reading. I like to listen to music. I like listening to music with lyrics. I know sometimes people don't like listening to music with lyrics because it can be distracting when they read. I personally like it. I just have a very tame flow in my playlist. So they're very soft songs. They're very melodic. They're very soothing. That's the kind of music I like to listen to when I write.</p><h2>You write about the relationship between gender and race in Loud. We know that gender is a racial construct. How has being Samoan shaped the lens that you use to criticize the patriarchy?</h2><p>In multiple ways. The first one that I talk about a lot is that Samoan culture at its genesis, prior to being colonized, was matriarchal and is still very matriarchal in a lot of ways. Obviously, we are not immune to the effects of white supremacy and colonialism after it's already happened to us. So, in modern times, we struggle with things that many other ethnicities struggle with: white supremacy, misogyny, homophobia, and transphobia. But prior to being colonized, that was not the case for my people. </p><p>I was raised in a home where women are equals, men and women do the same things, and we have the same responsibilities, and it's a culture rooted in service. It's giving with no expectation of anything in return, and it's serving whether it's the lord or your elders. That's just where Samoan culture thrives; that's the very beating heart of it. That's how I was raised. That played a huge role in how I viewed respect and being treated like an equal. </p><q>
    It's very rare that I get attacked by a misogynist that is not also racist. It's a real hat on a hat, you know?
    </q>
<p>I think another one is that Samoan people are genetically larger, whether that's taller, bigger, fatter, or whatever you want to call it. So, having grown up around a very different kind of body type that was desired both in men and women and anyone else who didn't adhere to a gender binary, that also plays a huge role because fatphobia is rooted in white supremacy and Eurocentric beauty standards. And so what's beautiful in my culture, what's desirable in my culture, is not what your beauty standards are.</p><p>Those are two huge things in my Samoan culture that have really informed my view on patriarchy and how white supremacy, misogyny, racism, homophobia, and transphobia are all so closely intertwined. It's very rare that I get attacked by a misogynist that is not also racist. It's a real hat on a hat, you know?</p><h2>You're posting constantly, you've got a podcast, and you wrote this book, all while being constantly affronted by sexist, racist men. How do you not just quit?</h2><p>I'm stubborn. If anything is gonna make me quit, it is never gonna be a man.</p><p>Maybe that's just me being petty until the end. But I think more than anything, and I've gone over in explicit detail in the book, I've done a lot of work to unpack and let go of a lot of my internalized biases and prejudice, both towards myself and others. So because I've done so much unpacking prior to doing this for a living, it's done nothing but serve me. Letting go of male validation, specifically, almost makes me immune to having to hear that all the time. I do get an unbelievable amount of vitriol every single day of every single month of every single year. For the last three years, I've gotten some very violent hate consistently on all my platforms.</p><q>
    If anything is gonna make me quit, it is never gonna be a man, I'll tell you that much.
    </q>
<p>So, I think unpacking all of that and letting go of male validation specifically doesn't hurt me. I don't draw any sort of strength or power from men who don't know me telling me that they're attracted to me. That makes me angry. That doesn't fire me up; it truly triggers my prey drive to the point where I get angry and violent. I seek and want nothing from them, so their hate means nothing to me.</p><h2>Have the platforms done anything to protect you from that vitriol?&nbsp;</h2><p>I am lucky enough now that my platform is large enough that I have wonderful people who can help if things get out of hand on the different platforms. They are very aware of my niche and the kind of hate I get. They do everything they can to help me, and I'm very appreciative of that.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, that aspect of hate is something you just get used to with time. Even if I was the most PG, amazing, superficial creator ever, I would still get hate. It's unfortunately a reality of being an online person. That part I've just gotten used to, but I do have wonderful people who help me if something gets crazy.</p><h2>Did you learn anything about yourself while you were writing this book?</h2><p>I learned that I struggled a lot more with being vulnerable than I thought I would. I think because I've been an online person for so long now, I feel like I've shared so much of myself &mdash; which I have, to an extent. But then I realized in writing the book that there were many parts of myself I hadn't really shared. I've shared that I can be mean. People got that part; they're up to speed on that. But being vulnerable and very open and honest about certain life experiences, like my sister's coming-out story and my thoughts on kids, those kinds of experiences that I detail in the book, were very hard for me.</p><p>But I have a wonderful team who gently, gently pushed me. They always assured me, "You don't have to share anything that you don't feel comfortable sharing, but if you give me a little bit more, if you really want to take me there, take me there." We struck a wonderful balance, but I did learn that I struggled with the vulnerability part, which was a little shocking for me.&nbsp;</p><h2>We've got TikTok, we have a podcast, we have a book. What's next?</h2><p>Sleeping. [I] haven't done that in a while. I would say going on my book tour, which is very exciting. And definitely going to do more standup, which is also very exciting. I've only done a little baby five, but I'm definitely getting into that. Hopefully, more stuff in the TV and movie area. The sky's the limit. I'm gonna bleed into every platform and we're never gonna stop hearing about me.</p><h2>What do you remember as the first place you spent a lot of time online? Was it Neopets or Club Penguin?</h2><p>I loved computer games when I was a kid. My sister and I liked <a href="https://myscene.fandom.com/wiki/My_Scene_(Website)" target="_blank"><u>My Scene</u></a>. We loved <a href="https://www.stardoll.com/en/" target="_blank"><u>Star Doll</u></a>. As far as social media, the first social media I ever had was MySpace. I loved MySpace. I was so into MySpace.</p><h2>Were you mean to men on MySpace?</h2><p>Honestly, no. I thought I was just the coolest alive on MySpace. I don't know why. Even though I was just copying everything my sister was doing when she learned how to code HTML.</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/NM2jD?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Loud%3A%20Accept%20Nothing%20Less%20Than%20the%20Life%20You%20Deserve%20by%20Drew%20Afualo%20is%20out%20now%20via%20Auwa.&object_type=article&object_uuid=04lqqzBgiBMq26lt9SbD156&short_url=NM2jD&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><em>Loud: Accept Nothing Less Than the Life You Deserve</em> by Drew Afualo is out now via Auwa.</a></p><p><em>This interview has been edited for clarity.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

It uses a special comb to break up hair and fur to prevent hair wrap, which makes it a great option for pet owners or anyone who deals with hair fall in their home. It's lightweight and versatile and can switch from an upright vacuum to a detachable canister machine. It's no slouch when it comes to dirt either, and when you're finished vacuuming it only takes a few minutes to empty the canister and get back to work. Plus, its retractable cord makes it easy to put away without tangles when you're finished. </p><h2>Best Bissell wet-dry vacuum deal </h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

Use it on tile, linoleum, area rugs, and more with its two tanks. Clean water and cleaning solution are kept separately until you release it so you can tackle small or large messes and save on solution until you need it. It uses an antimicrobial filter to keep you from spreading germs while you clean, and it's simple and lightweight to cart around your home. Just because it splits duties between vacuuming and surface cleaning, however, doesn't mean it's not good on its own as a vacuum. It can clean carpeting and flooring effectively without ever breaking out the water, but its 2-in-1 capabilities make it well worth snagging. </p><h2>Best Bissell cordless vacuum deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

    </div>
<p>Developed by <a href="https://mashable.com/category/ubisoft" target="_self">Ubisoft</a> Studio Massive Entertainment, <em>Star Wars Outlaws </em>follows Kay Vess, a space scoundrel whose creation was <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/star-wars-outlaws-kay-vess-was-inspired-by-han-solo-but-is-a-little-bit-more-relatable/" target="_blank">clearly inspired by her more famous predecessor Han Solo</a>. Left with a bounty on her head after a job gone wrong, Kay assembles a team to pull off a massive heist in hopes of paying off the syndicate of space criminals pursuing her.</p><p>Mashable didn't get quite that far in the four hours we spent previewing <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, which is set between <em>Empire Strikes Back </em>and <em>Return of the Jedi</em>. Instead, we explored the savannah moon Toshara and snuck around the snowy planet of Kijimi largely solo &mdash; barring Kay's furry, axolotl-like, alien pet Nix (and yes, you can <a href="https://mashable.com/article/can-you-pet-the-dog-video-game-twitter" target="_self">pet the alien</a>).</p><p>Stealth features significantly in <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>' gameplay, befitting Kay's occupation as a space thief. While my blaster was certainly required at times, I preferred and was largely encouraged to avoid battles where possible. Instead, I crouched behind boxes and crept outside of sight lines to pilfer equipment or information, accessing encrypted files via a <a href="https://mashable.com/category/wordle" target="_self"><em>Wordle</em></a>-like symbol deduction minigame.</p><q>

    </q>
<p>Nix was invaluable to these criminal escapades, and a clear highlight of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>' gameplay. Capable of attacking or distracting enemies, stealing items, and even activating panels, Kay's merqaal companion makes it much easier to sneak through areas undetected. I enjoyed sending Nix to latch onto peoples' faces so I could knock them out without raising the alarm. He also seemed to have fair self-preservation instincts, so I never had to worry about his safety in a firefight.</p><p>My sneaky efforts were further assisted by my enemies' frequently questionable peripheral vision, situational awareness, and ability to detect downed colleagues. This made covertly taking down enemies much easier than it could have been, making me feel relatively accomplished, though I got the impression that I wasn't exactly contending with the brightest stars in the galaxy.</p><h2>Into the air vent, flyboy</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>I appreciated that <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> sometimes offers multiple avenues through which you can achieve your set objective. For example, I could try to rustle up enough credits to pay for access to a restricted area, or simply find a way to sneak in. I initially went for the former, but the gambling mini-game cut me off after I'd only bet on a few space horse races, leaving me without enough for the buy-in on space cards.</p><p>Fortunately, I ended up finding a handy dandy Kay-sized air vent leading to the area, which allowed me to save my meagre stash of credits. You'll likely spend a notable amount of time searching for and crawling through vents in <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, which are rather useful for infiltrating places you aren't authorised to enter. Seasoned criminal organisations should really have tighter security.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Vents are also a good indicator that you're probably going in the right direction. I had notable difficulty with navigation in <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>' open world. Despite the direction markers at the top of the screen, there's a relative lack of visual prompts, and it was often unclear exactly how to get where I needed to go.&nbsp;More than once I found myself wandering in circles. While <em>Star Wars Outlaws </em>does use colour to signify climbable surfaces, I found the slight yellow hue so subtle that it often blended with the rest of the scenery, especially when the lighting is also yellow. As a result it's easy to miss areas you can climb, or erroneously attempt to climb surfaces that are merely decorative.</p><p>I further found the boundaries of where I was and wasn't allowed to go weren't always clear. Occasionally I found myself unceremoniously thrown out of areas with no warning, having wandered too close to its entrance guards. Not only was this annoying, it also cost me reputation points with the affronted criminal faction.</p><h2>Star Wars Outlaws makes you the most important outlaw in the galaxy</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Though the Zerek Besh are <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>' primary antagonists, Kay will also encounter other criminal organisations such as the Pyke Syndicate and Crimson Dawn. These space gangs do not get along, so you'll have to balance your relationships. Taking on jobs, sharing information, and getting caught infiltrating gang territory can all impact your standing with each faction, and sometimes you'll have to pick a side. This in turn affects your access to quests, areas, and gear from these syndicates.</p><p>Fortunately for you, it isn't difficult to begin earning these criminals' approval. There's a lot of talk about suspicion and betrayal, yet everyone seems largely happy to trust Kay immediately. Maybe not with larger jobs, which you'll only be able to access once you've built up a good reputation. Yet warring criminal factions will still entrust Kay with sensitive missions and confidential information despite her being a complete stranger.</p><p>The effect is jarring considering that almost everyone around you speaks as though you're embroiled in an environment of deep suspicion. It feels distinctly like playing pretend, which doesn't help with immersion.</p><p>Yet it all makes sense if you simply remind yourself: this is very clearly a video game, and Kay is very clearly the protagonist.</p><h2>A flat Star Wars universe revolving around you</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The conceit of <em>Star Wars Outlaws </em>is that you are a criminal living on the fringes of polite society, taking what jobs you can. The Empire is a constant presence, but much in the same way the police are. Intergalactic battles, politics, and power struggles may be occurring, however they don't concern you. You aren't a Skywalker, or even a Solo. You're a nobody.</p><p>Despite this, the game's universe constantly reinforces that you, a penniless outlaw and rebel <a href="https://www.starwars.com/databank/rebel-alliance" target="_blank">with a lowercase R</a>, are in fact the main character and thus the most important person in the universe.&nbsp;</p><q>
    You aren't a Skywalker, or even a Solo. You're a nobody.
    </q>
<p>A mechanic you meet immediately after crash landing inexplicably forces his help on Kay despite her clear hostility toward him. A job broker singles her out and offers her work instantly. Non-player character conversations feel like little skits performed specifically for Kay to overhear, concerning either information specifically relevant to her, or quests she might elect to take up.</p><p><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>' dialogue frequently felt akin to the stories in mathematics problems, offering a thin veil of narrative to convey a new mechanic or quest. This isn't uncommon in video games, however I found <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>' stage curtains more sheer than expected or typical. Characters felt like tools for conveying quest information rather than living organisms, which wasn't helped by the lack of realistic reasoning to their actions.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, enemies wandered around blankly repeating empty, rote lines such as "I can do more than this," "What are we doing here?" and "The boss knows what is best for us."&nbsp;</p><p>It made <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>' world<em> </em>feel underbaked, especially when compared to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@detroitvillian/video/7293095661157797162" target="_blank">more lifelike NPC interactions</a> found in other modern games. Not every NPC needs a deep, rich backstory, but it would be great if they could at least vaguely pass for sentient.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

<p><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>' appeal lies in being able to explore the universe that so many have come to love since it was first introduced in 1977. Sadly, much of the world felt disappointingly flat. There were pockets of interest, such as in the fantastical yet vaguely familiar cantina food (I was amused to see comically oversized mangosteen in my ship's kitchen). Yet all of the game's elements failed to coalesce into an engaging, rich universe, feeling more like theatre staging.</p><p>I must also note that I was disappointed not to hear any jatz <a href="https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a45334182/star-wars-jizz-mos-eisley/" target="_blank">(or jizz</a>) in the cantinas. Though the Mos Eisley Cantina's band was an iconic part of <em>A New Hope</em>, Toshara's denizens eschew live music in favour of an uninspiring jukebox. My fingers are crossed that the full release will include a few jatz tunes, but I'm not holding out hope.</p><h2>Star Wars Outlaws is an empty playground in a galaxy far, far away</h2><p>A good way to approach <em>Star Wars Outlaws </em>is to think of it as a Star Wars-themed amusement park filled with actors guiding you through a script that centres you as the hero, kind of what <a href="https://mashable.com/article/star-wars-hotel-starcruiser-preview" target="_self">Disney's </a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/star-wars-hotel-starcruiser-preview" target="_self"><em>Star Wars </em></a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/star-wars-hotel-starcruiser-preview" target="_self">hotel</a> intended (<a href="https://mashable.com/article/star-wars-hotel-viral-video-youtube" target="_self">and failed</a>) to be. Whether you enjoy yourself will depend on if you can turn off your brain and just lean into the fantasy.</p><p>Despite how obviously shallow it was, I still had an inoffensively pleasant four hours previewing <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>. After all, you typically play a game to play a game. A box cake is still cake. Sometimes you're just in the mood for empty calories. So as long as you aren't expecting anything more, you'll likely have an fun, forgettable time exploring this galaxy far, far away.</p><p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/april-12-star-wars-outlaws-preorders" target="_self"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/april-12-star-wars-outlaws-preorders" target="_self"> arrives Aug. 30 on Xbox, PlayStation 5, and PC.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>That's because artistic gymnastics &mdash; the version of the sport you most commonly see on TV screens, different from its equally beautiful sister sport, <a href="https://olympics.com/en/paris-2024/sports/rhythmic-gymnastics" target="_blank">rhythmic gymnastics</a> &mdash; is scored to the near decimal point, with nail-biting finishes and routines that can come down to a single foot out of place. </p><p>It's all based on a gymnastics scorebook known as the "Code of Points."  </p><p>But the judges and their scores are historically fickle, and viewers should be used to live commentators capping off jaw-dropping routines with phrases like, "We'll see what the judges say." (Fans of the 2006 cult classic <em>Stick It</em> are all too familiar.)</p><p>Even so, there's a basic formula every routine abides by. And the way global competitors, in particular, win medals has its own system. Here's a general overview of how Team USA goes from on the mat to the top of the podium. </p><h2>How an Olympic gymnastics routine is scored</h2><p>Gymnasts compete in different events based on apparatuses: Vault, uneven bars, balance beam, and floor (tumbling). Each routine begins with a base difficulty score of zero, with points added to their difficulty as they include more and more complicated elements, from flips to twists to the order of elements and even the way they're facing when they land. Certain events also have "composition requirements," or skills every gymnast has to complete. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

        </a>
    </div>
<p>During the competition, an athlete can elect to adjust their difficulty score by adding or subtracting elements (like an additional half twist or alternative landing). On a beam routine, for example, this may mean getting on the beam in a simpler way to eliminate an early mistake. Small elements may only cost a few decimal points. </p><p>If an athlete attempts all elements in their routine, their difficulty score will be set to its max, decided by the "difficulty panel" of judges. It's the baseline for scoring.</p><p>That's just part one. Athletes are then scored by their execution of said routine, rated on a scale of 10. Here's where the confusion lies: Judges on the execution panel are keeping a careful watch on the smallest details as an athlete competes and deduct points for what they deem errors. These can be things like extra steps, bobbles on the beam, flexed feet, bending knees, a hunched posture, and more. You'll see these marked under "penalty score."</p><p>Execution scores are then added to the difficulty score for a final total. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<h2>How teams score at the Olympics</h2><p>Each event feeds into a larger push for a medal, and that includes the team at large. National teams compete in two rounds.

Full teams compete in all events, with scores for each gymnast being added together for a total amount of points per event. </p><p>You might have seen just one or two athletes from a country during a qualification round &mdash; they're going for individual medals, not a team win. </p><p>The team will then drop one of its four scores from the total amount for the event, submitting just three valid entries into the final scoring. At the end, all of the event totals are added together for a final, all-encompassing score and, thus, their ranking going into finals.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Team USA ended the qualification round with a grand total of 172.296 points &mdash; nearly six points ahead of second place. They will now do it all again heading into the final, alongside the other top seven scorers, but with just three athletes competing per event. </p><p>Team USA selected Simone Biles and Jordan Chiles to compete in all four events again. Sunisa Lee will compete on the uneven bars, balance beam, and floor. Jade Carey will compete on the vault. Hezly Rivera, the youngest American delegate at the Olympics, will not compete, but she'll still qualify for a medal if Team USA takes the podium. </p><h2>How individual gymnasts score at the Olympics</h2><p>As Team USA and its competitors racked up three-digit point totals, judges were also keeping track of each individual gymnast, with a final all around score given to each competitor.</p><p>Individuals can win medals in two ways: As an all-around champion with the highest total amount of points or as a winner for a specific event or apparatus (or both). For example, at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, Team USA walked away with a silver medal in the team competition. Lee took away the all-around gold medal and the bronze in uneven bars, while her teammates brought in gold for floor (Carey), bronze for vault (Mykayla Skinner), and bronze for beam (Biles). </p><p>After Sunday's qualification round, Biles, Lee, and Chiles scored the top three spots in total points across all competitors. A country can only send two athletes into the all-around competition, however, and Team USA selected Biles and Lee to compete for the all-around spot.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<h2>Simone Biles is creating her own scoring system</h2><p>The sport's scoring code has evolved over the last century, picking up speed after the millennium as athletes become faster, stronger, and more daring. Team USA has repeatedly showcased record-breaking scores across events, but Biles has blazed a trail never before seen. Since her debut at the 2016 Olympics, Biles' routines have ramped up their difficulty scores &mdash; she even has <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/simone-biles-gymnastics-moves-paris-olympics-record-breaking/" target="_blank">multiple moves named after her</a>. </p><p>Her baseline difficulty scores are so high that scoring a "perfect 10" in execution is often unnecessary. But the added pressure of being the first woman in history to attempt what she does is a hurdle in itself, as judges have <a href="https://www.vox.com/22575301/simone-biles-olympics-scoring-explained-gymnastics-yurchenko-double-pike" target="_blank">routinely "shortchanged" her total scores</a> because there's simply no comparison.</p><p>With the finals, maybe the points are finally meeting her where she's leaped ahead. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

The code for these traps, which is available on <a href="https://github.com/computationalprivacy/copyright-traps" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, can hide bits of hidden text throughout copyrighted works that would, theoretically, later show up as smoking guns if AI models were trained on that content.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>The idea of a copyright trap isn't new to the world, having previously been used for other types of media &mdash; but it <em>is</em> new to AI. The nitty-gritty technical details are kind of a lot to parse, but the idea is that strings of gibberish text would be hidden somewhere on a page &mdash; like in the source code, for instance &mdash; and would be detectable if used to train large language models. </p><p>The researchers admitted that this is imperfect. Someone who knows to look for the traps could find and remove them, for instance. But with copyright arguments constantly happening around generative AI, it only makes sense that people would work on ways for creators to fight back.</p>]]></content:encoded>

You can play around with the new suite of AI features and test them. However, it's not <em>officially </em>out to the public just yet.</p><p>You won't be able to test <em>all </em>of the Apple Intelligence features the Cupertino-based tech giant introduced at <a href="https://mashable.com/article/wwdc-2024-everything-apple-announced" target="_self">WWDC 2024</a>, but you'll get a taste of your iPhone's AI smarts via the <a href="https://%20https://mashable.com/article/apple-intelligence-how-to-install-ios-18-developer-beta" target="_self">iOS 18.1 developer beta</a> that dropped on Monday. You may be wondering, "Which Apple Intelligence features, exactly, will I get the pleasure of experimenting with in this new beta version?" We've got the answers for you.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>6 Apple Intelligence features you can use right now</h2><p>Firstly, you'll need to have an <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-review" target="_self">iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max</a> to use Apple Intelligence. Secondly, follow our guide on <a href="https://%20https://mashable.com/article/apple-intelligence-how-to-install-ios-18-developer-beta" target="_self">how to install the iOS 18.1 developer beta</a>. (Remember that this is a beta, so you should consider <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-backup-iphone" target="_self">backing up your iPhone first</a> because it's likely not quite polished nor refined.)</p><p>With that being said, here are the Apple Intelligence tools you can explore right now on the iOS 18.1 developer beta:</p><h3>Writing tools</h3><p>Writing Tools allow you to rewrite, proofread, and summarize anywhere in the operating system where there is a text field. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">
    <div class="flex justify-center">
                    <img class="border border-gray-100" src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/07CJul78eAJaa1lgP3TKKf7/images-4.fill.size_2000x1125.v1722351545.png" alt="Writing tools demo at WWDC 2024" width="2000" height="1125" loading="lazy" srcset="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/07CJul78eAJaa1lgP3TKKf7/images-4.fill.size_800x450.v1722351545.png 800w, https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/07CJul78eAJaa1lgP3TKKf7/images-4.fill.size_1400x788.v1722351545.png 1400w, https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/07CJul78eAJaa1lgP3TKKf7/images-4.fill.size_2000x1125.v1722351545.png 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px">

            <div class="mt-2 subtitle-2 font-sans ">
            <span class="normal-case text-gray-1000">Writing tools will also available on iPadOS and macOS.</span>
            <span class="text-gray-600 credit">Credit: Apple</span>
        </div>
    </div>
<p>Writing tools can also help you find the right tone, whether you're seeking a more professional vibe or a friendlier resonance, Apple Intelligence is designed to help.  This convenient feature is automatically available in Apple apps &mdash; and third-party apps that use Apple's standard text controls.</p><h3>Apple Intelligence-powered Siri</h3><p>Anyone running iOS 18.1 can now use the new Apple Intelligence-powered Siri. Apple's assistant has a new redesign &mdash; you can now see an elegant, glowing light that wraps around your iPhone screen. And as you might have guessed, Siri now has advanced capabilities. For example, even if you stumble over your words, Siri should still understand the gist of what you're saying.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">
    <div class="flex justify-center">
                    <img class="border border-gray-100" src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/07CJul78eAJaa1lgP3TKKf7/images-3.fill.size_2000x1125.v1722351545.png" alt="Siri demo at WWDC 2024" width="2000" height="1125" loading="lazy" srcset="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/07CJul78eAJaa1lgP3TKKf7/images-3.fill.size_800x450.v1722351545.png 800w, https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/07CJul78eAJaa1lgP3TKKf7/images-3.fill.size_1400x788.v1722351545.png 1400w, https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/07CJul78eAJaa1lgP3TKKf7/images-3.fill.size_2000x1125.v1722351545.png 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px">

<p>For example, saying something like, "&ldquo;Siri, set an timer. No, oops, I meant an alarm. Wake me up at 3:45 p.m. Actually, no, let's make that 4:10 p.m.," and it will still follow through with your core request. 15 minutes It can also maintain context from one request to the next. </p><p>And finally, Siri was more well-versed in product knowledge. For example, if you have no idea what a particular iPhone feature is called, describe it to Siri &mdash; and it will likely nail it.</p><h3>Apple Intelligence-powered Mail</h3><p>In the Mail app, you'll have the ability to tap into Apple Intelligence to get summaries of messages in your inbox. You will also be able to experiment with the new smart reply feature, which gives you AI-powered suggestions and recommendations on how to best respond to your co-workers, friends, loved ones, and more. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>There is also on-device categorization, so your mail will be organized into different sections, including "Primary," "Transactions," "Updates," and "Promotions."</p><h3>Auto-summarized notifications</h3><p>On iOS 18.1, you'll be able to test the new Apple-Intelligence-powered notifications, which can now be automatically summarized. In other words, you'll get a quick "Cliffnotes," if you will, of your texts and emails.</p><h3>Natural language search for Photos app</h3><p>If you have a massive library of pictures in the Photos app, you no longer have to scroll endlessly to find that one snapshot you forgot to organize into one of your albums. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

Sure, you can slather yourself in mosquito repellent or light a candle. But why do that when you could buy a device that helps repel the pests in the first place? Stop letting these winged beasts infiltrate your domain while you're trying to have a pleasant evening in your backyard. It's time you added a mosquito repeller to your home, and time for mosquitos and other insects to buzz off. </p><p>As of July 30, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/lVG5X?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Thermacell%20Mosquito%20Rechargeable%20Repeller&object_type=article&object_uuid=020XA6silnAoistYLeKekwz&short_url=lVG5X&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Thermacell Mosquito Rechargeable Repeller</a> is just $28.97 at Amazon. That's $11.02 off its normal price of $39.99 and a 28% discount. </p><p>This simple device can keep mosquitoes up to 20 feet away. It's small, perfectly portable, and comes with a battery that lasts up to 5.5 hours. Just place it wherever you find it'll be the most effective, whether that's on your porch, your deck, poolside, or patio. It can diffuse repellent for a 20-foot zone of protection from mosquitoes without DEET and even distribution so the mosquitoes don't even have a chance to get around you. </p><p>This isn't a zapper, you don't need extra bug spray to supplement it, and there's no scent, smoke, flames or harmful chemicals emitted as it's been tested and reviewed by the EPA for safety. Just sit back, relax, and let it do all the work. And kiss all those mosquito bites goodbye. </p><p>This package comes with the repeller, which has a rechargeable battery, a 12-hour refill, and a USB charging cable. If you find mosquitoes are regularly bugging you, it might be time to bring out the big guns. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This is a big deal for Biles to return for the team final.

Since all of the affected devices were Windows-based PCs, Microsoft faced criticism for the outage, too.</p><p>In a new <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/07/27/windows-security-best-practices-for-integrating-and-managing-security-tools/?ranMID=46107&amp;ranEAID=TnL5HPStwNw&amp;ranSiteID=TnL5HPStwNw-E1D2sN2_1EVVPjKJqrQ0Ww&amp;epi=TnL5HPStwNw-E1D2sN2_1EVVPjKJqrQ0Ww&amp;irgwc=1&amp;clickid=_mkrzkxuzr0kfajlv2vjgs1konn2xfjnh2cg1tkwg00&amp;OCID=AIDcmmaqfwnksg_AFF_1243925_3327_TnL5HPStwNw-E1D2sN2_1EVVPjKJqrQ0Ww_190407&amp;tduid=%28ir__mkrzkxuzr0kfajlv2vjgs1konn2xfjnh2cg1tkwg00%29%283327%29%281243925%29%28TnL5HPStwNw-E1D2sN2_1EVVPjKJqrQ0Ww%29%28%29&amp;OWTGT=AFF_1243925" target="_blank"><u>blog post</u></a> over the weekend, Microsoft shared its own analysis of the CrowdStrike situation and offered solutions to ensure an outage of this scale doesn't happen again.</p><p>However, one interesting piece of information in the blog post, as noticed by <a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/microsoft-says-millions-more-devices-could-have-been-hit-by-crowdstrike-outage" target="_blank"><u>TechRadar</u></a>, is that Microsoft claims that the number of reported affected devices was vastly <em>underestimated</em>.</p><h2>CrowdStrike outage impacted more devices than initially reported</h2><p>One day, after the CrowdStrike outage, Microsoft <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/07/20/helping-our-customers-through-the-crowdstrike-outage/" target="_blank"><u>reported</u></a> that 8.5 million Windows machines were affected by the error in the cybersecurity company's software update.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, in its latest update, Microsoft has shared that the 8.5 million number is just a small "subset" of devices actually affected. Microsoft did not share the actual estimated number of affected Windows devices. But, it clearly seems to be many millions more than it previously revealed.</p><p>According to Microsoft, the 8.5 million figure that was shared came from devices that shared crash reports with the company. Crash reports are an optional feature, which automatically lets Microsoft know when a system encounters an error. If a consumer or company decides not to share crash reports with Microsoft, the company isn't pinged with the issue. As such, they would not be counted in the affected devices estimate.</p><p>While most of the millions of Microsoft computers have been <a href="https://mashable.com/article/crowdstrike-outage-microsoft-recovery-tool-easier-fix" target="_self">fixed</a> at this point, the industry is still gripping with how this could have been allowed to happen.</p><h2>Microsoft's next steps</h2><p>The reason why the CrowdStrike update error caused so much damage was because it runs at the kernel level, which is the core part of the operating system. This is why when the update error occurred, it didn't just affect CrowdStrike's software. It took the whole computer system down, too, resulting in the dreaded Windows blue screen of death.</p><p>Microsoft explained in its post the reasons why cybersecurity software tends to operate at the kernel level, but clearly, after this latest debacle, that approach needs to be reconsidered.</p><p>According to Microsoft, the company is currently looking at "reducing the need for kernel drivers to access important security data." Along with that, the company will also be working with third-party vendors to ensure they follow the best practices when rolling out updates. so that they can catch issues before they go live.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/falcon-content-update-remediation-and-guidance-hub/" target="_blank"><u>CrowdStrike</u></a>, as of last Thursday, 97 percent of affected devices are back online.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Amazon has truly revolutionized the way we shop. Through the mega-retailer we can order just about anything to our doorstep, and it often arrives within just a few days (or hours). Amazon also offers some incredible discounts, especially during <a href="https://mashable.com/article/when-is-the-next-prime-day-2024" target="_self">Prime Day sales</a>. However, we occasionally find a deal from another retailer that blows Amazon's sale price out of the water. A solid case in points come today on an Amazon product sold at Best Buy.</p><p>As of July 30, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/2eRwl?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Amazon%20Kindle%20Scribe%20%2816GB%2C%20basic%20pen%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=02aU8jeSg0xmOWLy6Kx8ocG&short_url=2eRwl&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Amazon Kindle Scribe (16GB, basic pen)</a> is on sale at Best Buy for just $234.99, marked down from the list price of $339.99. That's a 31% discount or a savings of $105. It's also <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B09BS26B8B" target="_blank">lower</a> than the best sale price we've ever seen at Amazon.</p><p>The Amazon Kindle Scribe is first and foremost an e-reader, allowing you to carry dozens of downloaded or borrowed books on a single device. If you have travel in your future, packing the Kindle Scribe instead of several books to read pool-side will save you big time when it comes to precious suitcase space. </p><p>But the Kindle Scribe goes beyond basic reading. It's also a notebook, annotating device, and document viewer. You can use it as a personal notebook to write down thoughts, daily journal, or use it as a virtual sketch book. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p><em>Simone Biles Rising</em> always has Biles' path to Paris on the horizon, but it begins at the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics, with the first episode mostly focusing on Biles' most challenging career moment to date: her decision to <a href="https://mashable.com/article/simone-biles-withdraws-olympics-tokyo" target="_self"><u>withdraw from the artistic gymnastics women's team final</u></a>. Biles had the world's eyes firmly fixed on her, navigating intense pressure to bring home the gold. In the final, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/07/27/sports/olympics/biles-vault-gymnastics.html" target="_blank"><u>Biles lost her way midair</u></a> during a vault, experiencing a disconnection with her spatial awareness &mdash; an indication of <a href="https://olympics.com/en/news/what-are-the-twisties" target="_blank">"the twisties"</a>. Biles describes the feeling in her interview as "in jail with my brain and body," and the series digs further into just how dangerous and heartbreaking it can be for a gymnast, as well as the intense psychological stress related to it.</p><p>But Biles' decision would <a href="https://mashable.com/article/simone-biles-mental-health-goat-redefine-winning" target="_self"><u>redefine the term GOAT</u></a> and publicly champion the need to take care of oneself. Walsh's documentary examines how much pressure that term actually puts on an athlete, with perfection expected at every turn amid press and social media noise &mdash; admirably, Biles is tough enough to read some mean tweets right into the camera.&nbsp;</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Some of the most impressive parts of the documentary are the sections in which you're allowed to join Biles back in the gym post-Tokyo, starting her years of training to rebuild, with the 2021 World Championships on the horizon &mdash; yep, the one where <a href="https://mashable.com/article/simone-biles-yurchenko-double-pike" target="_self"><u>she landed the never-seen-before Yurchenko double pike</u></a>. Honestly, watching these training sections, if you're a gymnastics noob like me, you won't see anything wrong &mdash; the jaw-dropping skills are out, people. But for Biles, this was a long road to recovery. The word "inspiring" gets thrown around a lot, especially with sports documentaries, but watching Biles keep at it with the support of her teammates and coaches, you can't really put it any other way.&nbsp;</p><h2>Simone Biles is frank, courageous, and real about her personal experiences</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Ever a powerful speaker, Biles is generously candid about her experiences in her interviews in the documentary, reflecting on <a href="https://mashable.com/article/simone-biles-olympics-mental-health" target="_self">caring for her mental health</a> and the impact of trauma on one's mind and body. Notably, Walsh gives Biles the space to reflect on recovery after sexual abuse. In 2018, among the #MeToo movement, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/olympian-simone-biles-accuses-usa-gymnastics-physician-larry-nassar-sexual-abuse" target="_self">Biles came forward</a> with hundreds of women against USA Gymnastics team physician Larry Nassar, who was <a href="https://mashable.com/article/judge-sentences-larry-nassar-175-years-sexual-assault" target="_self"><u>charged for decades of abuse against over 500 girls and young women</u></a> &mdash; including Olympians <a href="https://mashable.com/article/gabby-douglas-sexual-assault-olympic-doctor" target="_self"><u>Gabby Douglas</u></a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/aly-raisman-sexual-assault-olympic-doctor" target="_self"><u>Aly Raisman</u></a>, and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/mckayla-maroney-sexual-assault-dr-nassar" target="_self"><u>McKayla Maroney</u></a>. Biles showed incredible courage revisiting her trauma and testifying before the Senate with <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Biles%20Testimony1.pdf" target="_blank"><u>a powerful statement</u></a>, and in the documentary, she's generous again in speaking to it alongside her teammates&nbsp;(I can also highly recommend watching Bonni Cohen and Jon Shenk's outstanding and enraging documentary <a href="https://mashable.com/article/athlete-a-review" target="_self"><em><u>Athlete A</u></em></a> on Netflix, which specifically centres the survivors and sheds light on the corrupt systems created by USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic Committee that failed to protect athletes.)</p><p>Biles also gives viewers a personal insight into private elements of her life, speaking about her childhood and foster care over photo albums, sharing her personal video diaries following her Tokyo exit, and letting viewers into her "forbidden Olympic closet" &mdash; a genuine treasure trove fit for a future museum. Watching Biles suddenly confront her Tokyo leotard, the uniform she was wearing during her vault, is deeply moving &mdash; and seemingly cathartic for the athlete. But there's plenty of joy too; watching Biles celebrate her successes is a delight to watch. The athlete taking you through all the moves named after her &mdash; <a href="https://mashable.com/article/simone-biles-new-moves-qualifying" target="_self">including "The Biles"</a> &mdash; with footage of each staggering skill is the most satisfying flex, and seeing Biles herself ask Siri "how many Olympic medals does Simone Biles have" is pure squeal.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Importantly, the series also takes a broader look at gymnastics itself, diving into the unethical pressure put on young athletes. This includes the impact of a lack of proper support for athletes through injuries, namely citing U.S. gymnast Kerri Strug who vaulted with a broken ankle in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. The series also covers problematic beauty standards and centred whiteness within gymnastics and the experiences of Black women gymnasts like champions Betty Okino and Dominique Dawes, both of whom are interviewed in the series. Here, Biles also reflects on her epic <a href="https://x.com/Simone_Biles/status/1710437259969704197" target="_blank">"Black girl magic"</a> moment sharing the World Championship podium with Brazil's Rebeca Andrade and America's Shilese Jones in 2023, and it rules.</p><q>
    A quintessential and comprehensive portrait of one of the greats &mdash; and she's only 27.
    </q>
<p>In fact, Biles' personal and professional story is told and supported by an impressive array of talking heads like these, including Biles' mother Nellie, father Ron, and sister Adria, coaches C&eacute;cile Canqueteau-Landi and Laurent Landi, teammates including Aly Raisman and Joscelyn Roberson, NCAA gymnastics champion and psychology professor Onnie Willis Rogers, journalists Alice Park and C&eacute;line Nony, sports commentator Olly Hogben, and many more. Plus, there's some very sweet moments with her husband, NFL player Jonathan Owens, whom Biles married in 2023.&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, the first two episodes of <em>Simone Biles Rising</em> are a quintessential and comprehensive portrait of one of the greats &mdash; and she's only 27 &mdash; amid a broad brush consideration of the state of gymnastics itself by those in it. With two more chapters on the way, the series has already offered a compelling look at Biles' athletic career that will perfectly pair with your Olympic viewing, while giving you an understanding of what it means to rebuild, work hard, and challenge yourself to overcome life's curveballs &mdash; whatever form they may take.</p><p><strong>How to watch:</strong> <a href="https://zdcs.link/weoWp?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Simone%20Biles%20Rising%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Netflix.&object_type=article&object_uuid=01iekGDA5SLhDbr0hEBd76J&short_url=weoWp&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><em>Simone Biles Rising</em> is now streaming on Netflix.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>A potential sex toy emoji</h2><p>The company's asking you to help develop the world's first sex toy emoji (it looks like the suction vibrator <a href="https://zdcs.link/mV7bq?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=SONA%202%20Cruise&object_type=article&object_uuid=03e8VKoFEOOyCGm1XxMfqr8&short_url=mV7bq&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">SONA 2 Cruise</a>) by signing the "<a href="https://www.change.org/p/implement-the-sex-toy-emoji-in-unicode" target="_blank">Implement the Sex Toy Emoji in Unicode</a>" petition on Change.org. Less than 100 people have signed as of publication, but LELO is hoping to obtain at least one million signatures. Then, they'll submit the petition to the <a href="https://www.unicode.org/consortium/consort.html" target="_blank">Unicode Consortium</a>, the nonprofit organization that manages the universal emoji standard (AKA the folks in charge of emojis).</p><p>Unicode currently adds <a href="https://emojipedia.org/new" target="_blank">new emoji on an annual basis</a>. The latest &mdash; which could come to iOS 18 &mdash; appear to include a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-ios-18-new-emoji-baggy-eyes" target="_self">baggy-eyed face, a harp, and a fingerprint</a>. Not very sexy.</p><p>This isn't the first time LELO has tried to get a sex toy emoji approved. In 2021, the company launched the "<a href="https://www.change.org/p/unicode-support-our-application-for-an-official-sexemoji" target="_blank">Support our application for an official #sexemoji</a>" campaign, but it only managed to get 1,002 signatures.</p><p>"No matter how much we have all started paying attention to our bodies and minds, there's a worrying trend concerning sexual wellness; it is the silence," said LELO CMO Luka Matutinovic in a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lets-talk-masturbation-support-lelos-petition-for-the-creation-of-sex-toy-emoji-302199510.html" target="_blank">press release</a>. </p><p>"We can talk about supplements, about mental health, but at the same time dread talking about masturbation. Both in the context of self-care and the context of pleasure! This also makes masturbation incredibly difficult to study," he continued. "People get increasingly uncomfortable with disclosing such personal and intimate details of their lives. As a sexual wellness brand, LELO is acutely aware of the lack of conversation surrounding the topic of masturbation."</p><p>A LELO survey shows that 76 percent of respondents use emojis when communicating about sex &mdash; so why not make life easier with a vibrator emoji?</p><p>Right now, we're stuck with peaches, eggplants, and water droplets (the most popular emojis among LELO's survey participants, by the way). While these emojis might <em>subtly</em> get the message across, they often turn intimate moments into a bit of a joke. (<a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-wwdc-keynote-2024-genmoji" target="_self">Genmoji</a>, the ability to create our own emoji, likely won't help this front.) We're adults, and we deserve emojis that reflect the nuances of our desires without resorting to silly fruit metaphors.</p><p>"It is said that shame disappears when you create safe spaces for stories to be told," said Matutinovic. "We would like to add that having adequate words or substitution for words, like an emoji, further helps erase the shame. It is because of this that the next milestone in fully liberating the discourse on sex is this sex toy emoji."</p>]]></content:encoded>

With the use of spacecraft and modern instrumentation, NASA can run a relatively quick analysis of global temperatures. This scorching day (amid a scorching two weeks) demonstrates a "long-term warming trend driven by human activities, primarily the emission of <a href="https://mashable.com/feature/carbon-footprint-pr-campaign-sham" target="_self">greenhouse gases</a>," NASA said in a <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/earth/nasa-data-shows-july-22-was-earths-hottest-day-on-record/" target="_blank">statement</a>.</p><p>"In a year that has been the hottest on record to date, these past two weeks have been particularly brutal," the <a href="https://mashable.com/category/space" target="_self">space</a> agency's administrator Bill Nelson said, noting the agency uses over two dozen Earth-observing satellites to collect climate data.</p><p>"<a href="https://x.com/NWSWPC/status/1815131688198140153" target="_blank">Oppressive heat</a>" recently blanketed the Western U.S. and Northern Plains, for example, helping boost global average temperatures to over 17 C (around 63 degrees Fahrenheit), which of course includes frigid realms like Antarctica.

<p>The recent heat continues a stark and much longer warming trend than has been observed in the satellite record, and which began around 1980. "2023 was Earth&rsquo;s warmest year since modern record-keeping began around 1880, and the past 10 consecutive years have been the warmest 10 on record," <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-analysis-confirms-2023-as-warmest-year-on-record/" target="_blank">NASA noted</a>.</p><p>The planet is already reacting to about 2 F (1.1 C) of warming since the late 1800s: <a href="https://mashable.com/article/wildfires-california-western-us-explained" target="_self"><u>Wildfires are surging in the U.S.</u></a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/thwaites-glacier-what-congress-knows" target="_self"><u>major Antarctic ice sheets have destabilized</u></a>, heat waves are <a href="https://mashable.com/article/death-valley-heat-wave-record" target="_self"><u>smashing records</u></a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/atmospheric-rivers-california-more-intense-flooding" target="_self"><u>storms are intensifying</u></a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/sea-level-rise-united-states-how-much" target="_self">sea levels are rising</a>, and beyond. It will only <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-hot-will-earth-get" target="_self">grow hotter for much of this century</a>. </p><p>But, crucially, <a href="https://mashable.com/category/climate-change" target="_self">climate change</a> doesn't mean humanity is inherently doomed. We can make energy choices that drastically slash the amount of heat-trapping gases society emits into the atmosphere. "We have a significant amount of influence over how much warmer it gets," climate scientist Zeke Hausfather previously told Mashable.</p>]]></content:encoded>

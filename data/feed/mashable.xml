Biles, the undisputed G.O.A.T. in women's gymnastics, crushed her floor routine on Thursday to win the gold medal in the all-around competition <a href="https://mashable.com/category/olympics" target="_self">at the 2024 Paris Olympics</a>. And the arena &mdash; and the internet &mdash; promptly erupted in cheers. </p><p>It was a much closer competition than most would have predicted after Biles made a few mistakes in the uneven bars. Biles, however, was too strong overall in the other three events &mdash; vault, balance beam, and floor. It's the sixth Olympic gold medal of her career. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>It has been a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/simone-biles-mykayla-skinner-instagram-beef" target="_self">triumphant Olympics</a> for Biles.

<p>Her last Olympics experience was difficult. She had to withdraw from much of the 2021 games in Tokyo while dealing with "the twisties," which is a dangerous phenomenon where gymnasts encounter a mental block doing their routines. The return to glory at the 2024 games marks a remarkable comeback. Since Biles also took home the gold at Rio 2016, the win on Thursday marked the first woman to win two all-around Olympic titles in decades, dating back to the '60s.</p><p>It was a huge day for Biles and confirmation of something we already knew: She's the best to ever do it.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/078c1daPzA18irwgEGpU3fy/hero-image.jpg" alt="raya logo on a silver platter surrounded by hands"><p>There might be no lower point than dropping cash on a <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-free-dating-sites-apps-hinge-tinder-okcupid" target="_self">dating app</a>. But <a href="https://mashable.com/article/dating-app-fatigue-has-led-to-a-flurry-of-irl-singles-events" target="_self">dating is tough</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/19/opinion/male-loneliness.html" target="_blank">men are lonely</a>, and <a href="https://thoughtcatalog.com/shahida-arabi/2023/12/hundreds-of-women-share-why-they-quit-dating-apps-and-men-say-theyre-happier-single/" target="_blank">women are sick of men's antics</a>. Swooping in to save the day are <a href="https://mashable.com/article/exclusive-dating-apps-raya-the-league-lox-club" target="_self">"exclusive" dating apps</a> like Raya, which promises a user base of vetted, career-oriented (<em>hot and rich) </em>professionals &mdash; for a price. That price is $25 a month, and the unfortunate truth is Raya, "the celebrity dating app," is just like every other service one can find in the App Store. (Mashable has reached out to Raya for comment.)</p><p>I spent one month on Raya, after waiting 10 days to get approved before I could shell out for a membership. My mission? To see if the app was overrun with TikTok influencers. Spoiler: either they weren't there, or they were so niche that my mildly-online self couldn't spot them.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Instead, Raya's vibe felt so <a href="https://mashable.com/category/tinder" target="_self">Tinder</a>-esque, so reminiscent of other swipe-based apps that, I truly believe we as a society have hit critical mass dating app singularity.</p><h2>What is Raya &mdash; and can an average person use it?</h2><p>Raya, known as the "celebrity dating app," is marketed as an exclusive, members-only platform for the elite and ultra-connected. Imagine Tinder but with a velvet rope. Supposedly, getting in requires more than just a catchy bio; you need referrals, approval through a vetting process, and a solid Instagram game. Once you're in, expect a feed of curated, career-focused hotties &mdash; think models, actors, musicians, and entrepreneurs. At $25 a month (or $50 for premium), it's a splurge that promises glam and privacy, as the app is very uptight about discretion. Raya has strict rules against sharing information or taking screenshots of user profiles.</p><p>Part of Raya's allure to average people like me is the potential celebrity encounters. Case in point: The internet lit up in 2021<strong> </strong>when TikTok user Nivine Nash shared a video claiming that Oscar-winning filmmaker and actor Ben Affleck had previously matched with her on Raya. After unmatching, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@nivinenash/video/6958092416284921093?lang=en" target="_blank">she received a video message from Affleck himself</a>, asking, "Why did you unmatch me? It's me."</p><p>The story quickly went viral, shedding light on the fact that yes, even A-listers are swiping away on dating apps. In fact, <a href="https://www.mamamia.com.au/celebrities-on-dating-app-raya/" target="_blank">several celebs</a> have been <a href="https://thelatch.com.au/what-is-raya-secret-dating-app-for-celebrities/" target="_blank">outed for their (alleged) time</a> on Raya including Owen Wilson, Chris Rock, Zach Braff, Elijah Wood, Sharon Stone, Cara Delevingne, and John Cusack.</p><p>According to a 2018 <em>New York Times </em>article, only <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/27/style/raya-dating-app.html" target="_blank">eight percent of Raya applicants are accepted</a>, making it supposedly harder to get into than Harvard Business School. That statistic was published six years ago, though, and Raya's exclusivity is a bit overhyped in my experience. Despite its reputation as the "[members' only club] Soho House of dating apps," the reality is far less glamorous than what those quoted influencers and testimonials make it out to be.</p><h2>The Raya experience</h2><p>So, here's how I got onto the app: I started with a simple, straightforward application. Raya asked for my name, date of birth, location, industry, occupation, and Instagram username. My Instagram? Locked, with a humble following of about 150. No big-shot referrals in sight. And it only took 10 days to get the coveted acceptance email &mdash; which surprised me, considering some say they've been on the waitlist for years. There's a whole subreddit dedicated to getting a referral for the app. Ludicrous stuff.</p><div class="reddit">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card">

    </blockquote>
    
</div>
<p>Despite my modest social media presence, I made it through Raya's reportedly rigorous vetting process. According to that <em>New York Times</em> article, applications are allegedly reviewed by a committee of 500 people scrutinizing each Raya hopeful. Again, that was the status quo six years ago, but it's a process that promises exclusivity and high standards. As my experience reveals, though, the reality might not be as glamorous as the hype.</p><p>After getting the coveted approval, I curated my best photos, carefully selected a backing song that screamed "me," and eagerly logged in. And who was at the top of my queue? Not a celebrity, but a local nurse. Huh. So, the swiping began: blonde, blonde, blonde, blonde, blonde &mdash; seriously, where are the Black women on this app? &mdash; blonde, brunette, blonde. Raya founder and CEO Daniel Gendelman tried to assure the <em>Times </em>that the community was diverse, more focused on being interesting than an Instagram model aesthetic. My impulse was to screen-record this experience, but the app immediately flashed a warning. Not wanting to waste my $25 in one go, I decided to play it safe and moved on.</p><p>Swipe left, swipe right &mdash; it's the same drill as all the other apps. Swipe right too much, and you'll run out of likes (unless you're willing to pay for more). Swipe left too much, and Raya will cut you off for a while. That's their way of saying, "Stop being so picky."</p><p>Instead of a parade of celebrities, my time on Raya was a mix of consultants, aspiring actors, medical professionals, recruiters, and even students for some reason. Every profile is linked to Instagram, and I saw plenty of locked accounts with low follower counts, just like mine. Yeah, there were some people of high stature here, but everyone else is here too &mdash; so what's the point?</p><p>Here's the catch: if you're not in New York City or Los Angeles &mdash; which I'm not &mdash; good luck finding the celebs you're hoping for. And since Raya is ostensibly a global social networking platform, you can't filter by location. You also can't set your height, which isn't a big deal for me since I'm already short, but for some, it'd be nice to know.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>Should you use Raya?</h2><p>To be completely honest, one of the few things I actually liked about Raya is its vetted user base. Unlike the free-for-all chaos of Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge, where <a href="https://mashable.com/article/dating-apps-tinder-bumble-hinge-catfishing-easy" target="_self">catfishing is possible</a>, Raya's users are the real deal.</p><p>Another plus? In this age of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-tiktok-became-a-place-for-tattletales" target="_self">TikTok and oversharing</a>, where everyone's spilling every detail of their lives for content, Raya offers a breath of privacy. Nobody wants their <a href="https://mashable.com/article/viral-hinge-message-shows-major-problem-with-dating-app-culture" target="_self">dating app chats or minor dating annoyances</a> broadcast to millions. Raya's no-screenshot policy is a godsend in this regard. Sure, it doesn't stop someone from forcing an actor to admit he's back in the dating game post-divorce, but it does keep most personal business under wraps.</p><p>Is this level of privacy and vetting worth $25 a month? Probably not. But good vibes and venture capital can only carry an app so far &mdash; you need revenue. Influencers might market the app as the "Soho House of dating apps," but the actual experience? It's more like an expensive Tinder with a better PR team.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The story of Meta's doomed AI personas highlights the growing challenge of shipping consumer-facing generative AI features that people actually want to use. While chatbots like ChatGPT have been undeniably successful, other tools have struggled to bring meaningful value or engagement to users. Many consider the addition of the Meta AI searchbar in Instagram, Facebook, and Messenger an annoying hindrance to the previous search interface &mdash;&nbsp;especially since it <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-turn-off-meta-ai" target="_self">can't be turned off</a>. And Google's <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-ai-overviews-benefit-of-doubt" target="_self">AI-generated search summaries</a> had a rocky start, that ranged from aggravating imposition to <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-ai-overviews-weird-responses-explained" target="_self">downright inaccurate</a>. </p><p>Meta <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/meta-is-paying-creators-millions-for-ai-chatbots?rc=fioipi" target="_blank">reportedly</a> paid its high-profile celebrities up to 5 million dollars for their likenesses over a two-year contract. But the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/meta-ai-dystopian-chatbot-kendall-jenner-persona" target="_self">confusing premise</a>, announced at last <a href="https://mashable.com/article/meta-connect-2023-ai-roundup-celebrities-personal-assistant" target="_self">September's Meta Connect</a>, may have inhibited any meaningful engagement. Meta declined to comment to Mashable about the monetary aspects of this program.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>The AI personas had the celebrities' profile photos and their personality, but weren't actually AI replicas of the celebrities. The Padma Lakshmi persona, for example, inexplicably played a "travel expert" named Lorena. Links to these AI personas on Instagram now say the page is unavailable. </p><p>Instead of going forward with AI personas, Meta is trying other approaches to integrating generative AI into its platforms. On Tuesday, the company announced AI Studio, which lets users create AI replicas of themselves, much like the existing platform <a href="https://mashable.com/article/character-ai-generator-explained" target="_self">Character.ai</a>. The idea is for creators, or any user for that matter, to clone versions of themselves online and interact with other accounts (with a disclaimer saying it's AI). Meta has also deployed <a href="https://adage.com/article/digital-marketing-ad-tech-news/meta-ai-ads-what-know-about-image-and-headline-automation/2558161" target="_blank">AI tools for advertisers</a> to create images and copy for ads.  </p><p>So, we're saying goodbye to Billie (Kendall Jenner), Bru (Tom Brady), and Lorena (Padma Lakshmi), but Meta's efforts to foist AI on the masses isn't going away. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In the past, Apple has deviated from this cadence due to reported production hindrances (e.g., supply chain issues). For example, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/france-suspends-iphone-12-sales-high-radiation-levels" target="_self">the iPhone 12</a> and the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-iphone-14-plus-review" target="_self">iPhone 14 Plus</a> shipped in October, but typically, we get new iPhones unveiled some time during the first half of September every year.</p><h2><strong>iPhone 16 design</strong></h2><p>Let&rsquo;s dive into arguably the most important aspect of the iPhone&rsquo;s design: the screen. </p><p>There haven&rsquo;t been any significant changes to the display sizes since the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/iphone-12-and-iphone-12-pro-review" target="_self">iPhone 12</a>, but according to reliable leaker <a href="https://twitter.com/URedditor" target="_blank"><u>Unknownz21</u></a>, the upper-tier iPhone 16 models are going to be a little bit more unwieldy in your hands.

<p>As you can see, you'll find the Action Button, which was left out of the lower-tier models on the current generation iPhone, now present on the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus. More on that later.</p><h3><strong>Display</strong></h3><p>The iPhone 16 Pro will reportedly have a 6.3-inch display while the iPhone 16 Pro Max will pack a 6.9-inch panel. You may be wondering, &ldquo;What about the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus? Will they get a screen size bump, too?&rdquo; The answer is likely no. The lower-tier models will reportedly have the same display sizes as their predecessors.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>However, he offered slightly different numbers: 6.2 inches and 6.8 inches. What could be the reason behind the discrepancy? According to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/16/iphone-16-display-sizes/" target="_blank"><u>MacRumors</u></a>, it&rsquo;s "likely due to the difference between actual display area and viewable display area."</p><p>Another rumor we're hearing is that the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-iphone-16-60z-refresh-rate" target="_self">iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus will continue to have 60Hz refresh-rate displays.</a> This is a little disappointing considering other phones in the market at least have 90Hz screens, making navigating through the UI smoother, zippier and seamless.</p><p>Finally, according to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/10/iphone-16-pro-brighter-display/" target="_blank">MacRumors</a>, citing popular Weibo leaker "Instant Digital," the iPhone 16 Pro will reportedly have a 20% brighter display for SDR content. In other words, the iPhone 16 Pro will reportedly emanate up to 1,200 nits of brightness.</p><h3><strong>Thinner bezels</strong></h3><p>The iPhone 16 will also reportedly have slimmer bezels, according to a report from <a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=27023" target="_blank">The Elec</a> (h/t <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/04/iphone-16-even-thinner-bezels/" target="_blank">MacRumors</a>).

<p>A tipster from <a href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5040859970798441" target="_blank">Weibo concurred with IceUniverse's claim</a>, adding that the iPhone 16 Pro series will have the following bezel measurements:</p><ul><li><p><strong>iPhone 16 Pro - 1.2mm</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>iPhone 16 Pro Max - 1.15mm</strong></p></li></ul><p>For reference, the iPhone 15 Pro models' bezels have a thickness of about 1.71mm, give or take.</p><h3><strong>Dimensions</strong></h3><p>Thanks to yet another leak from IceUniverse, it appears that we now have information of the most premium next-generation iPhone:</p><ul><li><p>iPhone 16 Pro Max reportedly measures 163.024mm &times; 77.575mm &times; 8.26mm</p></li></ul><p>According to the aforementioned measurements, the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-bezel" target="_self">iPhone 16 Pro Max is bigger than its predecessor</a>: 1mm thicker, 3.1mm taller, and 0.88mm wider.</p><h3><strong>Action Button</strong></h3><p>A report from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/30/iphone-16-action-button-all-models/" target="_blank">MacRumors</a> claims that every single model in the iPhone 16 line will feature an Action Button &mdash; not just the iPhone 15 Pro variants. The current-gen iPhone 15 Pro models' Action Button can be programmed to launch a range of apps and functions, including Flashlight, Camera, Silent Mode, Voice Memo, Focus, Magnifier, Translate (coming to iOS 17.2), and a range of accessibility features.</p><p>When iPhone 16 drops, however, the rumor mill states that Apple will add more functionality to the Action Button.</p><h3><strong>Capture Button</strong></h3><p>The Action Button was all the rage for the iPhone 15 series, however, according to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/iphone-16-capture-button/" target="_blank">MacRumors</a> and <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-plans-iphone-camera-button-as-creators-shift-to-horizontal-videos?rc=bdqvyp" target="_blank">The Information</a>, a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/iphone-16-camera-button" target="_self">new Capture Button</a> will be one of the biggest selling points for the iPhone 16. Reportedly placed slightly under the power button, the Capture Button is a camera-focused feature that can do the following:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Zoom in and out of photos/videos with swiping gestures</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Allows users to focus on subjects</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Activates the shutter button</strong></p></li></ul><p>While MacRumors and The Information both concur that Apple is testing a "capture button" on the iPhone 16, both aren't on the same page on whether it's a mechanical button or a capacitive one.

For the uninitiated, solid-state buttons aren&rsquo;t buttons <em>per se </em>&ndash; they&rsquo;re panels that feature haptic feedback sensations that simulate real button presses (Think of the iPhone SE series' Home button). On the plus side, the solid-state buttons aren&rsquo;t totally out of the picture.

<p>Kuo added that these solid-state buttons will add two additional <a href="https://apple.fandom.com/wiki/Taptic_Engine" target="_blank">Taptic Engines</a>, which will help fire off tangible feedback to users. (If this is true, the number of Taptic Engines in the iPhone 16 will increase to three &mdash; up from one.)</p><p>According to a tip from Weibo (via <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/iphone-16-extra-button-rumor/" target="_blank">MacRumors</a>), the Action Button on the iPhone 16 Pro will be a solid-state button and sit flush against the chassis. To make room for this change, Apple will reportedly move the mmWave antenna to the left of the iPhone 16 Pro as opposed to the right. This Weibo tip comes from a leaker with the moniker "Instant Digital," a bean spiller that reportedly has an accurate track record, according to MacRumors.</p><h2><strong>iPhone 16 colors</strong></h2><p>According to a leak dropped on X, the iPhone 16 comes in five colors: white, black, blue, green, and pink.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

So we won't know for sure how battery life is affected until we get the phones in our hands.</p><p>It's also worth noting that <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/%E4%BF%A1%E7%B6%AD%E9%80%9A%E4%BF%A1%E7%82%BA%E6%96%B0%E6%AC%BEiphone-16-pro-max%E7%9A%84%E9%9B%BB%E6%B1%A0%E8%83%BD%E9%87%8F%E5%AF%86%E5%BA%A6%E5%8D%87%E7%B4%9A%E7%9A%84%E4%B8%BB%E8%A6%81%E5%8F%97%E7%9B%8A%E8%80%85-sunway-is-a-major-beneficiary-of-the-new-iphone-16-pro-9df9c5cd3913" target="_blank">Kuo</a> claimed that Apple is increasing the the iPhone 16 Pro Max's "battery energy density,"</p><h2><strong>iPhone 16 specs</strong></h2><p>The iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are equipped with 8GB of RAM while the lower-tier models, the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro Max, are stuck with their predecessors&rsquo; 6GB of RAM.

<h3><strong><br>Storage</strong></h3><p>According to news aggregator account "yeux1122" from Naver, a Korean blog, the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max will feature options that offer <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/iphone-16-pro-2tb-option-rumor/" target="_blank">2TB of storage</a>.</p><p>That is double the current max storage capacity of the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><h3><strong>Chipset</strong></h3><p>In recent years, Apple has followed the trend of putting <em>last year's </em>chip into the two entry-level models while the Pro models, the Pro and the Pro Max, get the new-generation chip. For example, the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus got the A16 Bionic chip, the same inside the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max. However, the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max got outfitted with the <em>new </em>A17 Pro chips.</p><p>If this pattern continues, it should follow that the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus get the A17 Pro while the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max get the A18 chips. Pu hinted that this is how it will be for the iPhone 16 line, hinting that the A17 Pro will reportedly be less efficient. In other words, the iPhone 16 models equipped with this chip may take a battery life hit. This is because the next-generation chip will offer tremendous performance gains at the expense of power efficiency.</p><p>However, another rumor tells a different story. </p><p>According to an alleged iOS 18 code leak from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/20/ios-18-code-four-new-iphone-models/" target="_blank">MacRumors</a>, the<strong> entire</strong> iPhone 16 line will get<em> </em>an<em> </em>A18 chip. However, there&rsquo;s a chance that Apple will use a &ldquo;Pro&rdquo; identifier name to differentiate from the standard and Pro models (e.g., A18 chip and A18 Pro).</p><p>The iPhone 16 Pro models will also reportedly support Wi-Fi 7 (current models support WiFi 6E). Wi-Fi 7 should offer zippy transfer speeds that exceed 40 Gbps, quadrupling what WiFi 6E can do.</p><p>According to Pu (via <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/10/12/iphone-16-pro-faster-5g-wi-fi-7/" target="_blank"><em>9to5Mac</em></a>), the iPhone 16 Pro will come with Qualcomm&rsquo;s Snapdragon X75 modem, which can reach a 5G download rate of up to 7.5 Gbps.</p><p><em>We&rsquo;ll periodically update this rumor hub as new iPhone 16 leaks trickle in, so be sure to bookmark this page.&nbsp;</em></p><p></p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>It's unclear whether these are the <em>only</em> colors we should expect from the 16 Pro &mdash; or if there will be at least one more to match the four color options that debuted last year. That would seem to be the case if you follow the leaks, as <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-iphone-16-pro-bronze-color" target="_self">one that came out of China this week</a> claimed there would be a bronze-like color for the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max. There were also rumblings of a new <a href="https://mashable.com/article/iphone-16-pro-rose-pink-color-reports" target="_self">"Rose" color</a>, but again, it's not present in the photo. </p><p>This may come as a disappointment to people who want the benefits of an iPhone 16 Pro, but also like vibrant colors. The base iPhone 16 will reportedly come in <a href="https://mashable.com/article/iphone-16-leaked-colors-photo" target="_self">five colors</a>, including blue and pink. Apple will confirm or deny all of this at some point in September.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Of course, it's not perfect &mdash; not yet at least. After all, the iOS 18.1 developer beta is expectedly a bit rough-around-the-edges as Apple collects feedback from testers. (This is why you should always <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-backup-iphone" target="_self">backup your iPhone</a> before installing any iOS beta because it can be risky.) </p><p>Overall, though, Apple has something here that will make its "Pro" and "Pro Max" iPhone models even more enticing than ever.

<p>As someone with an attention deficit, I can't help but get a little antsy after stumbling upon a wall of text or a verbose story. Typically, I'd read a few sentences and give up. However, with the "Summarize" tool, I received short-and-sweet synopses on articles that ramble, meander, and seem to go nowhere fast. In fact, at times, I found myself wanting to read a lengthy article <em>in its entirety </em>after the AI-powered summary revealed that the story is juicier than expected.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>That being said, when it comes to delving into dense articles, why would I use Google Chrome? I'm hopping and skipping over to Safari to take advantage of that new Apple Intelligence-powered Summarize tool.</p><p>The only downside, however, is that the Summarize tool tests my patience sometimes. It can be a few seconds too slow for my tastes, but this isn't unique to Apple Intelligence (ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini can be slow pokes, too.) But admittedly, it's worth the wait.</p><h2><strong>'Writing Tools' feature is surprisingly useful</strong></h2><p>One of the most popular use cases for AI, whether it's <a href="https://mashable.com/category/chatgpt" target="_self">ChatGPT</a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/wwdc-2024-apple-ai-gemini-chatgpt" target="_self">Google Gemini</a>, or <a href="https://mashable.com/article/what-is-copilot" target="_self">Copilot,</a> is "tone tuning" text. For example, you can drop in an email draft and ask those AI tools to help adjust your tone.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>However, I'll admit that I was one of those people who thought, "Pfft, I don't need an AI chatbot to tell me how to make something sound more professional!" As it turns out, the Apple Intelligence-based tone-adjustment tool, which can be accessed via the new Writing Tools feature, is a lot more helpful than I thought.</p><p>You'll be surprised how often you may <em>think </em>you're coming across friendly and congenial in emails and texts, but instead, your messages are being interpreted as prickly. </p><div class="raw-embed">

</div>
<p>To reduce the risk of this, I found myself using the "friendly" tone-adjustment tool to nix unintended snippiness. The best part is that I was able to use Writing Tools in almost <em>any</em> text field across the iOS 18.1 developer beta. I just highlight the words, hit "Writing Tools," and choose my desired tone.</p><p>As a result, I've definitely seen more positive responses from my co-workers, friends, and other loved ones.</p><h2><strong>No more endless scrolling on the Photos app</strong></h2><p>I take a <em>lot </em>of pictures and selfies, but no, I don't categorize them nor put them into albums (because, spoiler alert, I'm lazy). </p><p>I just let them pile up into a haphazard collection of random snapshots. Every now and then, however, I need to find that <em>one </em>picture, which requires me to scroll endlessly to find it.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Fortunately, with the iOS 18.1 developer beta, I can use natural language to search for a particular picture in the Photos app. For example, I typed the word "pancakes" to find a saved screenshot of my favorite IHOP order.</p><p>I could even type in the words "woman with a red top," and surprisingly, all of my selfies of me wearing red (my favorite color) surfaced. Very cool feature!</p><div class="raw-embed">

<h2><strong>Siri is more helpful than ever</strong></h2><p>Siri received an AI-powered boost with Apple Intelligence, but my favorite perk is its contextual awareness.

<p>Siri is aware of which article I'm looking at, so it can snatch the URL and send it to my fianc&eacute; without needing to lift a single finger. (I'm telling you &mdash; I've been spoiled rotten.)</p><h2><strong>Is Apple Intelligence worth it?</strong></h2><p>As hinted at the outset, Apple Intelligence nurtures my laziness &mdash; and I dig that. I don't always want to suffer through several paragraphs to get to the author's point. I don't want to spend too much time hemming and hawing over how to best respond to someone. And finally, I don't want to scroll endlessly through my cluttered gallery to find a specific photo &mdash; it's like finding a needle in a haystack.</p><p>Apple Intelligence addresses all of those concerns. I was initially skeptical of Apple's new suite of AI features, but as it turns out, Apple Intelligence is useful, and yes, totally worth it.</p><p>Apple Intelligence is expected to officially roll out with iOS 18 later this year (but keep in mind that reports claim that <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-ai-late" target="_self">some features may be delayed).</a></p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>The summer season might be winding down, but that doesn't mean the backyard gatherings need to end. In some locations, outdoor get togethers in the fall are actually <em>way </em>more comfortable than those that happen during the summer heat. If you're planning to continue the outdoor party into the fall or you love wood-fired pizza, Best Buy has a pretty special deal in store today. </p><p>As of Aug. 1, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/xPgYd?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Ooni%20Frya%2012%20portable%20outdoor%20pizza%20oven&object_type=article&object_uuid=06ei9WHxwsSPKnV0B0nnIcM&short_url=xPgYd&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Ooni Frya 12 portable outdoor pizza oven</a> is on sale for $249, marked down from the usual price of $349 which makes for a savings of $100. In addition to saving 30% on the pizza oven, Best Buy is tossing in a free $75 Best Buy gift card.</p><p>Weighing just 22 pounds, the Ooni Frya 12 portable outdoor pizza oven will make you the most popular person to invite over for a party. Its portable design and weight mean you can make wood-fired pizza in just 60 seconds. It's powered by hardwood pellets and can reach up to 950 degrees F in just 15 minutes. After that, a 12-inch stone-baked pizza can be all yours is just 60 second (plus cooldown time so you don't burn your mouth!).</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>In terms of convenience, the Ooni Frya 12 uses a gravity-fed hopper for delivering the hardwood pellet fuel into the oven. It's made of a powder-coated carbon steel shell for ideal heat retention. </p><p><a href="https://mashable.com/review/ooni-wood-pellet-fyra-review" target="_self">Mashable's review of the Ooni Frya 12</a> gave it high praise, once you've overcome the learning curve. Mashable culture reporter Tim Marcin wrote, "It produced restaurant-quality wood-fired pizza at home. You could taste the sweet smoke. And the super high heat gave you that pleasant char, bubbly crust, and impossibly fast cook time. There is no way, that I know of, to replicate this with an oven or stove."</p><p>If you're a pizza fanatic or just enjoy cooking great meals outside, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/xPgYd?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Ooni%20Frya%2012&object_type=article&object_uuid=06ei9WHxwsSPKnV0B0nnIcM&short_url=xPgYd&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Ooni Frya 12</a> could be perfect. Thanks to today's deal at Best Buy, the oven is 30% off <em>and </em>it comes with a free $75 Best Buy gift card.

<p>Summer's a great time for kicking back and listening to your favorite songs and podcasts. It's also the perfect time for chatting with friends while out and about. If you need a new pair of on-ear <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-headphones" target="_self">headphones</a> to do that with, Beats offers a fantastic line of options to choose from. And right now, you can save on a particularly great pair at Amazon as they've been reduced nearly all the way back down to their Prime Day 2024 price. </p><p>As of August 1, you can get the <a href="https://zdcs.link/gl5Yb?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Beats%20Studio%20Pro&object_type=article&object_uuid=07k8hCAaHnTEAfwG8ubnrWV&short_url=gl5Yb&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Beats Studio Pro</a> noise-cancelling headphones for $179.95, down from their original price of $349.99. That's a 49% discount and a savings of $170.04. This is within just $10 of the headphones' Prime Day price, so you're getting a great discount on the off chance you missed out during the sales event last month. </p><p>These plush headphones offer excellent noise cancellation and are quite comfortable to wear for long stretches of time. While they're great for enjoying all types of music, they're also excellent for chatting on the phone if you need to take a call. You'll be heard with surprising clarity even if you're in the middle of a busy environment &ndash; which can sometimes happen even if we try our best to avoid it. Further, these headphones boast a 40-hour battery life so they're good to go as long as you are. </p><p>If you want a premium pair of over-the-ear headphones and don't want to shell out too much cash, these make an especially good option, since they're on sale for their next-to-Prime Day price. Be sure and get yours before they're out of stock. </p>]]></content:encoded>

You can get all of it for $79.99, certainly not cheap, but much better than the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/lego-legend-of-zelda-great-deku-tree-set-preorder" target="_self">Zelda Deku Tree</a> that costs $299.99.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>For starters, the Fitbit Ace LTE comes with the Fitbit Arcade, which is packed with movement-based games for kids to enjoy throughout the day. Instead of closing rings, the watch uses "the Noodle," a fun animal design that lets kids keep better track of their steps, jumps, and bounces. </p><p>But when it comes time to focus in the classroom or in the evening while completing homework, parents can set downtime on the Fitbit Ace LTE, which restricts access to some features while still allowing kids to get in touch should they need to. </p><p>Through the Fitbit Ace app, kids can make calls and texts to 20 contacts, which parents can approve. The app also allows parents to see where their kids are currently located, so you'll know they made it from school to soccer practice or decided to study in the library this afternoon.</p><p>It's worth noting that the Fitbit Ace LTE smartwatch requires a monthly Fitbit Ace Pass, which costs $9.99 per month. You can purchase this plan during setup of the watch. The pass gives unlimited LTE connectivity, GPS tracking, calling, and messaging. </p><p>Make sure the kids are ready to head back to the classroom with the motivational Fitbit Ace LTE smartwatch. Not only will they enjoy the games, it gives parents reassurance of always being in touch.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03zj5CLGpxHiiX9z5gR1XkQ/hero-image.png" alt="hand holding key, another hand emerging from smartphone with a lock"><p><a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-sites-for-serious-relationships" target="_self">Dating apps</a> require users to disclose vulnerable information &mdash; and not just someone's romantic dreams. Most times, these apps require personal data like your name, age, and location. In the case of the latter, a new paper details that, for a time, several major apps left user locations able to be exposed by potential adversaries.</p><h2>Dating app location vulnerabilities</h2><p>In a new paper out of Belgian university KU Leuven, "<a href="https://lepoch.at/files/dating-apps-usesec24.pdf" target="_blank">Swipe Left for Identity Theft</a>," researchers break down potential privacy risks for 15 location-based dating apps (LBDs) with at least 10 million downloads. These days, dating apps are typically location-based in order to help users find matches physically close to them. By needing location, however, it opens users up to potential risks.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>All apps except one used distance between users to measure location. (That exception, TanTan &mdash; an Asian dating app &mdash; used exact coordinates one-time at the point of matching, and only if they matched.) "However, lacking sufficient protections, the availability of distances can still lead to the inference of a user's location," the paper states. "This is done through trilateration."</p><p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/trilateration" target="_blank">Trilateration</a> is the process of determining location by measuring distances between three triangles (or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O3ZVHVFhes" target="_blank">circles, or spheres</a>). There are different types of trilateration apps use to determine location. The authors &mdash; Karel Dhondt, Victor Le Pochat, Yana Dimova, Wouter Joosen, and Stijn Volckaert &mdash; found that they were able to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/31/bumble-and-hinge-allowed-stalkers-to-pinpoint-users-locations-down-to-2-meters-researchers-say/" target="_blank">pinpoint almost an exact location in six out of 15 apps</a>, as TechCrunch reported. </p><h2>Which dating apps had location vulnerabilities?</h2><p>The most common vulnerability was through "oracle trilateration," which the paper explains, "Adversaries use an <em>oracle</em> that indicates through a binary signal whether a victim is located within proximity, i.e., when they are within a defined 'proximity distance' from the attacker."</p><p>Hinge, Bumble, Badoo (which is owned by Bumble), and Hily were susceptible to such trilateration. </p><p>A Hinge spokesman told Mashable:</p><blockquote><p>At Hinge, the safety and privacy of our users is always a top priority. Our app is built with a privacy-by-design approach and strictly protects sensitive user data. We are proud of our state-of-the-art bug bounty program and our ongoing dialogue with researchers, which are designed to attract comments so we can make adjustments before any harm happens to our users. We reviewed the feedback from this research team when we received it in early 2023 and immediately took action where appropriate.</p></blockquote><p>A <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/31/bumble-and-hinge-allowed-stalkers-to-pinpoint-users-locations-down-to-2-meters-researchers-say/" target="_blank">Bumble spokesperson told both TechCrunch</a> and Mashable, "We were made aware of these findings in early 2023, and swiftly resolved the issues outlined. As a global business with members in countries all over the world, we are committed to protecting our users&rsquo; privacy and have adopted a global approach to privacy compliance."</p><p>This statement applies for Badoo as well, Bumble told Mashable.</p><p>Dmytro Kononov, CTO and co-founder of Hily, shared this statement with TechCrunch:</p><blockquote><p>The findings indicated a potential possibility for trilateration. However, in practice, exploiting this for attacks was impossible. This is due to our internal mechanisms designed to protect against spammers and the logic of our search algorithm...Despite this, we engaged in extensive consultations with the authors of the report and collaboratively developed new geocoding algorithms to completely eliminate this type of attack. These new algorithms have been successfully implemented for over a year now.</p></blockquote><p>Grindr was vulnerable to "exact distance trilateration." This can be done when services reveal exact distances to other users. The authors were able to figure out user locations as close as 111 meters (around 364 feet). Exact distance trilateration was possible even when the distance was hidden, such as in Egypt where Grindr hides all user locations for safety reasons.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

    </div>
<p>"The proximity Grindr offers to this community is paramount in providing the ability to interact with those closest to them, Grindr's chief privacy officer Kelly Peterson Miranda told TechCrunch. "As is the case with many location-based social networks and dating apps, Grindr requires certain location information in order to connect its users with those nearby...Grindr users are in control of what location information they provide."</p><p>Finally, the app happn was vulnerable to "rounded distance trilateration," which can be done if an app utilizes a rounded location as a precaution. CEO and president of happn, Karima Ben Abdelmalek, told TechCrunch:</p><blockquote><p>After review by our Chief Security Officer of the research findings, we had the opportunity to discuss the trilateration method with the researchers. However, happn has an additional layer of protection beyond just rounding distances...This additional protection was not taken into account in their analysis and we mutually agreed that this extra measure on happn makes the trilateration technique ineffective. </p></blockquote><p>It appears that for apps with these vulnerabilities, the apps took measures to stop bad actors from determining user location using trilateration, with the exception of Grindr.</p><h2>Which dating apps weren't vulnerable?</h2><p>According to the paper, Tinder and LOVOO used "grid snapping" to prevent trilateration. <a href="https://robertheaton.com/2018/07/09/how-tinder-keeps-your-location-a-bit-private/" target="_blank">Grid snapping</a> is a technique of dividing one's location into a grid of squares. Coordinates (aka where users are) are moved to the center of these squares (Tinder) or the right side (LOVOO) and one's distance is measured from there. Therefore, their actual distance is inaccurate and can't be trilaterated. </p><p>Plenty of Fish and Meetic don't access GPS locations. While MeetMe, Tagged, and OkCupid do access this information, they convert it to the nearest town. The authors couldn't reverse engineer the information they needed for TanTan and Jaumo, so they couldn't test this method to find user locations. </p><p>The paper shows the importance of caution when using dating apps. As the paper concludes, "We hope that the awareness that we bring of these issues will lead LBD app providers to reconsider their data gathering practices, protect their APIs [application programming interfaces]<strong> </strong>from data leaks, prevent location inference, and give users control of their data and therefore ultimately their privacy."</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A truly functional kitchen has some essential appliances and cooking implements that make creating meals easy. Sure, you'll probably want a range (or some type of cooking surface), a refrigerator, a set of knives, and most people want a microwave. But there's a certain food prep appliance that some see as an essential luxury, particularly models from a high-end brand, and one that's synonymous with steep prices. If you're looking for a blender that's one of the best on the market, Best Buy has something epic in store today.</p><p>As of Aug. 1, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/1vdwk?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Vitamix%20Ascent%20A2500%20blender&object_type=article&object_uuid=03FpG3Hj4KO4vPZSSTGm7qP&short_url=1vdwk&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Vitamix Ascent A2500 blender</a> is just $299.99 at Best Buy, marked down from the usual price of $599.95. That's a massive 50% discount or a savings of $299.96.</p><p>Sometimes, buying the value-centered version of a product doesn't cut it, like the different between name-brand cola and the store brand. In a pinch, the store brand does just fine, but the flavor is distinctly different.</p><p>In the world of blenders, sometimes the high-end (and expensive) models are actually worth it when it comes to performance and lifespan. The Vitamix Ascent A2500 is a great example &mdash; sometimes high-quality comes with a high price tag. But thanks to today's deal at Best Buy, you can pay just 50% of the normal retail price.</p><p>The Vitamix Ascent A2500 comes with three pre-set programs &mdash; smoothies, hot soup, and frozen dessert. Yes, you read that right &mdash; <em>hot </em>soup, produced from the friction of the powerful Vitamix blades in just a handful of minutes.</p><p>Aside from those three pre-set functions, there's a dial with settings between 1 and 10 for variable speed control. The blender also incorporates a pulse feature which is great to make sure all ice cubes or frozen strawberries are fully integrated into the smoothie. </p><p>The 64-ounce included container comes with a lid and a lid plug. Plus, its low-profile design is more likely to fit on the counter under cupboards. You'll also get a low-profile tamper to use with the blender. </p><p>If you've always wanted a Vitamix blender in your kitchen but haven't loved the typical high price tag, today you can score the <a href="https://zdcs.link/1vdwk?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Vitamix%20Ascent%20A2500&object_type=article&object_uuid=03FpG3Hj4KO4vPZSSTGm7qP&short_url=1vdwk&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Vitamix Ascent A2500</a> for half price. But you'll want to hurry because this deal expires tonight at 11:59 PT.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>1. <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-docs-sync-edit-share/id842842640" target="_blank">Google Docs</a></h2><p>When it comes time to get assignments done, the Google Workspace apps are essential. These services include Docs, Drive, Sheets, and Slides, which are simpler to use across mobile and desktop than Microsoft Office Suite (now known as Microsoft 365).</p><p>Google Docs is ideal for writing essays and collaborating in real-time, while Sheets makes managing data and creating spreadsheets a breeze. For presentations, Slides is your go-to for making polished demonstrations without the added learning curve of PowerPoint. </p><p>Google Drive (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-drive/id507874739" target="_blank">which has its own app</a>) then ties everything together, providing seamless storage and sharing across all devices. You can even <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-drive-document-scanning-iphone" target="_self">scan your assignments with Drive</a> which is essential for those professors who require you to upload printed homework onto Canvas or Blackboard.</p><h2>2. <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/notion-notes-docs-tasks/id1232780281" target="_blank">Notion</a></h2><p>Unlike other note-taking or task-management apps, Notion combines it all. Notes, to-do lists, calendars, and databases, its drag-and-drop interface makes it easy to customize your workspace to fit your needs. While other apps might focus on one feature&mdash;like Evernote for note-taking or Trello for task management&mdash;Notion offers a complete package.</p><p>This all-in-one approach is perfect for students who want to stay organized and efficient without the hassle of switching between multiple apps, giving them more time to focus on their schoolwork. Although it does have a subscription tier, you can use the core of its features for free, and who doesn't love free?</p><h2>3. <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bear-markdown-notes/id1016366447" target="_blank">Bear Notes</a></h2><p>This beautifully designed app offers a distraction-free interface, perfect for jotting down lecture notes, brainstorming ideas, or crafting the perfect essay. Its clean, intuitive design makes it easy to stay focused and organized.</p><p>With its rich text editing, easy organization using hashtags, and seamless syncing across devices, Bear Notes ensures your thoughts are organized and easily accessible. Plus, its Markdown support makes formatting a breeze, turning your notes into polished documents effortlessly.</p><h2>4. <a href="https://www.zotero.org/" target="_blank">Zotero</a></h2><p>Zotero is a free, open-source tool that helps you collect, organize, cite, and share your research materials. As its site says, it's basically your "personal research assistant." It's a godsend for the end of the semester when you have multiple research papers due and way too many tabs open for multiple assignments &mdash; it's honestly a nightmare.</p><p>While other citation tools might focus solely on generating citations, Zotero integrates seamlessly with your browser and word processor, providing a comprehensive solution for your research needs.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Here's why you may want to skip the iPhone 16 in favor of the iPhone 17.</p><h2><strong>1. A new sleek, slim model</strong></h2><p>Multiple reports claim that Apple is working on a "slim" iPhone 17 variant. In an investor note spotted by <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/05/05/iphone-17-redesign-iphone-17-slim/" target="_blank">9to5Mac</a>, Jeff Pu, a respected Apple analyst, claims that the Cupertino-based tech giant will replace the "Plus" model with a new "Slim" device.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Sure, there have been some tweaks and changes over the years, like upgrades to the aperture and image processing, for example. But a 12MP selfie camera has been on the iPhone series' spec sheet since Apple introduced it in 2019.</p><p>That's not necessarily a bad thing, though. As someone who has reviewed iPhones since the debut of the iPhone 12, the 12MP selfie camera has always been sufficient enough for me. In fact, I'll even venture to say it's <em>too </em>good, as it picks up on all my flaws and imperfections.</p><p>However, for anyone who disagrees with me, you'll be relieved to know that the iPhone 17 is getting a big upgrade to a 24MP selfie camera. </p><p>It's unclear whether the new 24MP selfie camera will be featured across the entire lineup or limited to a few models.</p><h2><strong>3. Relocated camera</strong></h2><p>If you're tired of the iPhone's camera array being located on the top-left corner, you may appreciate a new rumor that suggests the iPhone 17 Slim will have its shooter relocated to the top center, according to <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-plans-a-thinner-iphone-in-2025" target="_blank">The Information.</a></p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>We're also hearing whispers that the iPhone 17 Slim will have just one rear camera (i.e., a solo wide lens).</p><p>If you're a sucker for visual symmetry, Apple moving the wide camera to the top center may be appealing for you.</p><p>There is also scuttlebutt that Apple will shave a little bit off the Dynamic Island on the iPhone 17, thanks to a reported new under-display Face ID technology. So if you're not a fan of the ovular, interactive area at the top of your iPhone screen, and you feel it's a little too obstructive, the iPhone 17 may be worth the wait.</p><p></p><p></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>VPNs aren't new, and that's actually the problem. There are so many that finding a<a href="https://zdcs.link/OdOvn?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=reliable%20VPN&object_type=article&object_uuid=00Otk62q7XAcbU0flMczRNA&short_url=OdOvn&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"> reliable VPN</a> is a task all of its own. If you're still on the hunt for a good VPN that can block ads, protect your privacy, unlock geo restrictions, and more, SurfShark is the way to go.&nbsp;</p><p>Normally, a <a href="https://zdcs.link/OdOvn?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=two-year%20SurfShark%20VPN%20Starter%20Plan&object_type=article&object_uuid=00Otk62q7XAcbU0flMczRNA&short_url=OdOvn&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">two-year SurfShark VPN Starter Plan</a> would be $290, but you can get it on sale for only $56.99. Check out everything it can do.</p><h2>How's SurfShark different from other VPNs?</h2><p>SurfShark has many of the same features of other VPNs, but it either adds on new sub-features or just does the same job better. Most VPNs have i<a href="https://zdcs.link/OdOvn?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=nternational%20servers&object_type=article&object_uuid=00Otk62q7XAcbU0flMczRNA&short_url=OdOvn&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">nternational servers</a> you can connect to, but SurfShark has 3,200, and they're spread across 65 different countries. Security protocols are normal, but SurfShark locks your data behind military-grade AES-256 encryption and offers CleanWeb, which blocks ads and malware.&nbsp;</p><p>Tired of your search results being useless? Try SurfShark Search and get unbiased search results. You can also browse more securely on public or private WiFi, and users can choose from the latest security protocols like WireGuard&reg;, IKEv2, and OpenVPN.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-S2cMbiKSStA"></div>
</div>


<p>A large number of servers is nice, but it's useless if they're slow or unreliable. That's why SurfShark has 10GB VPN servers, private DNS and leak protection, and a kill switch that disconnects the internet if the VPN connection drops. This service is compatible with various operating systems and devices, including macOS, Windows, Android, iOS, Linux, and FireTV.</p><h2>Save 80% on a two-year VPN</h2><p>Get a reliable VPN that has your back whether you're streaming, working, or just browsing.&nbsp;</p><p>Get a <a href="https://zdcs.link/OdOvn?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=SurfShark%20VPN%20two-year%20Starter%20Plan&object_type=article&object_uuid=00Otk62q7XAcbU0flMczRNA&short_url=OdOvn&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">SurfShark VPN two-year Starter Plan</a> for $56.99.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.stacksocial.com" target="_blank"><em>StackSocial</em></a><em> prices subject to change.&nbsp;</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Google-owned <a href="https://mashable.com/article/waze-update-6-new-features" target="_self">Waze added this feature in March</a>, so it's only natural it makes its way to Maps; Waze's version, fuelled by Flash, offers detailed information about parking lots including cost, accessibility, and whether there are EV charging stations. Called "destination guidance", the feature will roll out on Maps worldwide on iOS and Android "in the coming weeks" according to Google. It'll also be available on Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and Google Built-in.</p><p>Google has also upgraded tools for reporting incidents and happenings on the road, whether lane closures, police presence, or construction work.

New camera types have been added to Waze, which users can select when reporting road information like speed cameras, bus lane cameras, and red light cameras. And if you're driving through an area where there's congestion or road closures, Waze's new traffic events feature will send you a notification if the event is under way.

A seriously big moment. </p><p>The league was already stacked with genuine superstars like A'ja Wilson and Sabrina Ionescu, but everything has exploded since the introduction of young ballers like <a href="https://mashable.com/article/caitlin-clark-wnba-salary-reactions-explained" target="_self">Caitlin Clark</a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/angel-reese-lsu-caitlin-clark" target="_self">Angel Reese</a>, and Cameron Brink. Stadiums are full, clips are going viral, and everyone seems to be talking about the WNBA. </p><p>Interested in seeing what all the fuss is about? We have lined up everything you need to know to watch the WNBA from anywhere in the world.</p><h2>What is the WNBA?</h2><p>Founded in 1996, the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) is a women's professional basketball league based in the United States. The league is made up of 12 teams, including the Indiana Fever, Los Angeles Sparks, Minnesota Lynx, New York Liberty, and Phoenix Mercury.</p><h2>When is the WNBA in 2024?</h2><p>The 2024 season is the 28th edition of the WNBA, with the regular season taking place from <strong>May 14 to September 19</strong>. Each of the 12 teams play 40 games &mdash; four games against five teams from the same conference and two teams from the other conference, plus three games against the remaining four teams.</p><p>The eight teams with the best regular season records qualify for the WNBA Playoffs to determine the league's champion.</p><h2>How to watch the WNBA with WNBA League Pass</h2><p>Fans can live stream the 2024 WNBA season from anywhere in the world with <a href="https://www.wnba.com/leaguepass" target="_blank">WNBA League Pass</a>.

My daily driver laptop is the Yoga 9i 2-in-1 (Gen 7), so I was excited to see how my favorite laptop improved in the Gen 9 model &mdash; and it didn&rsquo;t disappoint.</p><p>With its stunning OLED display, full-bodied audio via its rotating soundbar, and enjoyably springy keyboard, the Yoga 9i 2-in 1 (Gen 9) is easily one of the <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-2-in-1-laptops" target="_self"><u>best 2-in-1 laptops</u></a> you can buy right now. And despite all the improvements over my existing Gen 7 model, it somehow costs less than what I paid two years ago.</p><p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong &mdash; this laptop isn&rsquo;t perfect, even if it is one of my favorites from Lenovo. For me, its premium positives easily outweigh its few negative traits.

<h2><strong>Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1 design</strong></h2><p>Lenovo doesn&rsquo;t stray too far from the norm with the Yoga 9i 2-in-1&rsquo;s design, and it doesn&rsquo;t have to &mdash; it&rsquo;s a sleek, classic design.</p><p>The aluminum-clad chassis shows off the laptop&rsquo;s Cosmic Blue colorway, which I always love to see in a market dominated by gray laptops. Unfortunately, something about this laptop&rsquo;s chassis makes it not so great at resisting fingerprint smudges. After only a few weeks of use, the laptop looked like it could use a good cleaning.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>That said, the Yoga 9i&rsquo;s flexible 2-in-1 functionality certainly redeems its lack of fingerprint resistance. Being able to use a laptop in a variety of modes &mdash; traditional laptop mode, tent mode, tablet mode, and stand mode &mdash; is always a win in my book.</p><p>This 9th generation Yoga 9i drops some weight, so it&rsquo;s now a sub-three-pound laptop &mdash; and it remains incredibly thin and well-built, with a strong hinge and smooth, rounded corners. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>And in true Yoga fashion, the Yoga 9i comes with a matching Cosmic Blue protective laptop sleeve to slip your device into.</p><h2><strong>Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1 display</strong></h2><p>My Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1 review unit features a 14-inch, 2.8K (2880 x 1800-pixel) glossy OLED display &mdash; and it looks fantastic.&nbsp;</p><p>There&rsquo;s a higher-res 4K OLED display option, but it&rsquo;s not necessary. My daily driver Yoga 9i (Gen 7) has a 4K OLED display, and looking at these two displays side by side, the differences are minimal. If you&rsquo;re just going to be streaming media and doing work online, a 2.8K res is perfect.</p><p>With its 400-nit max brightness, 120Hz refresh rate, and OLED panel, this laptop is ideal for streaming media. Plus, its 2-in-1 flexibility makes watching media even easier, whether you flip the laptop into tent or tablet mode.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>To test the display, I fired up the <em>Wicked</em> trailer starring Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo. I just had to see how Elfaba&rsquo;s green skin showed up on this display &mdash; and I wasn&rsquo;t disappointed. The OLED panel shows off deep, rich blacks and vibrant colors throughout the <em>Wicked</em> world with ease. And its 2.8K resolution made everything crisp, from fine smile lines to strands of hair.</p><p>This configuration comes with a Lenovo Slim Pen that magnetically attaches to the laptop&rsquo;s side, helpful for keeping your display free of smudgy fingerprints.</p><h2><strong>Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1 ports</strong></h2><p>I love to see double-sided USB Type-C ports on both sides of a laptop, so that&rsquo;s definitely a win for the Lenovo Yoga 9i.

<p>Compared to my daily driver Yoga 9i Gen 7 &mdash; which features thinner keys with less travel in a more subtly recessed keyboard &mdash; typing on this laptop&rsquo;s keyboard is a much more enjoyable experience.

<p>While working from the laptop with only 12 open Chrome tabs, it sounded like it was getting ready for takeoff. Granted, the laptop was plugged in and charging, but this is something I haven&rsquo;t experienced from other Lenovo laptops recently.</p><p>I tested the laptop&rsquo;s performance with it unplugged, and found it to be slightly less noisy. With 25 open Chrome tabs, Spotify playing in the background, and the laptop&rsquo;s stopwatch counting down, there was a steady hum from the fans, but no lag when typing in Google docs or loading a new page.</p><p>After only a half hour of use, the laptop&rsquo;s chassis is very hot above the keyboard. It&rsquo;s not hot enough to touch, or even hold your finger on the area, but with sustained or more intense use, it gets much hotter.</p><h2><strong>Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1 battery life</strong></h2><p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a Windows laptop with long battery life, that&rsquo;s not this laptop.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1 only lasted <strong>7 hours and 21 minutes</strong> on a single charge during our battery test, which consists of looping a 1080p video at 50% brightness. That said, with this laptop&rsquo;s bright OLED panel, I often felt comfortable using it at only 30% brightness, which definitely extends the battery life.</p><p>Its battery life is shockingly only 16 minutes longer than the dual-display <a href="https://mashable.com/review/lenovo-yoga-book-9i" target="_self"><u>Lenovo Yoga Book 9i</u></a> (<strong>7 hours and 5 minutes</strong>) and half that of <a href="https://mashable.com/review/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-2-in-1-gen-9" target="_self">Lenovo&rsquo;s ThinkPad X1 2-in-1</a> (<strong>14 hours and 21 minutes</strong>), one of the best battery life times we&rsquo;ve seen from Windows laptops so far.</p><h2><strong>Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1 webcam</strong></h2><p>Unlike most laptops, the Yoga 9i 2-in-1 delivers a quality webcam that&rsquo;ll actually capture crisp, fine details rather than make you look like a watercolor painting.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>It features a 5-megapixel camera with infrared and a privacy shutter, an improvement from its predecessor&rsquo;s 2-megapixel camera. My pale, yet flushed complexion and light green eyes both come through clearly and accurately, and I can spot individual strands of frizzy hair.</p><h2><strong>Is the Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1 (Gen 9) worth it?</strong></h2><p>The Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1 (Gen 9) is equipped with a gorgeous 2.8K OLED display, Intel&rsquo;s new Core Ultra 7 155H processor, and a rotating soundbar that gives your favorite tunes a full-bodied, atmospheric sound you won&rsquo;t find on most other laptops &mdash; all for just $1,449! In my book, that&rsquo;s an excellent deal, especially if you&rsquo;re searching for a laptop with flexible 2-in-1 functionality.</p><p>My daily driver laptop is the Yoga 9i (Gen 7), and I can attest to its ability to run smaller, less demanding games like <em>Stardew Valley</em> and <em>Forager</em>. With the Yoga 9i (Gen 9)&rsquo;s more powerful CPU, those games will run even better &mdash; albeit with quite a bit of noise from the fans.</p><p>You&rsquo;ll want to make sure you have a charging cable nearby because battery life isn&rsquo;t something the Yoga 9i 2-in-1 excels at. That said, at least this laptop features double-sided USB Type-C ports for convenient charging.</p><p>At $1,449, the Yoga 9i 2-in-1&rsquo;s slightly noisy fans and poor battery life are easily overshadowed by its vibrant OLED display, high-quality rotating soundbar, exceptional webcam, and strong performance.

Now the company's founder, Avi Schiffmann, and two other wearable AI companion startups are beefing about alleged copying of branding.</p><p>Like Friend, fellow startup Based Hardware offers a <a href="https://basedhardware.com/products/friend" target="_blank">strikingly similar necklace device also called Friend</a>, while the unaffiliated Based Social has the less confusing but still pendant-like <a href="https://shop.compasswearable.com/products/compass" target="_blank">Compass</a>. Both these wearables are focused on productivity, using AI to listen to and summarise your conversations, while Schiffmann's Friend is designed to be an emotional support AI.&nbsp;</p><p>Even so, the similarities between all three AI companions are stark &mdash; and all three companies' founders are now feuding about it on X.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Less than a day after Friend's announcement, Based Hardware founder Nik Shevchenko quickly made clear he's mad about the ostensibly new AI companion on the block, <a href="https://x.com/kodjima33/status/1818452878018646369" target="_blank">posting a cringeworthy diss rap to X</a> and <a href="https://x.com/kodjima33/status/1818465978952597776" target="_blank">challenging Schiffmann to a fight</a>. Hitting back, <a href="https://x.com/AviSchiffmann/status/1818456600853569706" target="_blank">Schiffmann claimed</a> that Shevchenko copied both his <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91007630/avi-schiffmanns-tab-ai-necklace-has-raised-1-9-million-to-replace-god" target="_blank">original product Tab</a>, which was initially more of a <a href="https://thisweekinstartups.com/episodes/PvY4Lk8eK0D" target="_blank">productivity tool</a>, as well as his pre-launch rebrand to Friend earlier this year.</p><p>In response, <a href="https://x.com/kodjima33/status/1818488194838806706" target="_blank">Shevchenko pointed out</a> that Based Hardware's Friend was released in March, implying that it couldn't have copied branding which was officially announced just days ago.&nbsp;</p><p>However, founder of AI design tool Flair AI Mickey Friedman came to Schiffmann's defence on X, stating that the Friend founder <a href="https://x.com/mickeyxfriedman/status/1818545436426486237" target="_blank">initially discussed buying Friend.com with her in January</a> before following through in February. Friedman said another (non-AI) friend then allegedly told Shevchenko, who launched his product before Schiffmann <a href="https://x.com/mickeyxfriedman/status/1818528970016800998" target="_blank">"and has been telling everyone that avi stole from him when it&rsquo;s just not true."</a> Schiffmann has also produced <a href="https://x.com/AviSchiffmann/status/1818460679680278709" target="_blank">web domain registration receipts</a> for <a href="http://Friend.com" target="_blank">Friend.com</a> dated February.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Schiffmann's claim to be Friend's originator is further supported by Shevchenko's own X posts from earlier this year. In early March Shevchenko ran a poll asking what device he should create an open source version of next, <a href="https://x.com/kodjima33/status/1765933890500542674" target="_blank">including Schiffmann's Tab on the list of options, alongside Elon Musk's Neuralink and the Rabbit R1</a>. Shevchenko then appeared to take <a href="https://x.com/kodjima33/status/1765894596352192595" target="_blank">Schiffmann blocking him on X as a challenge</a>, choosing Tab as his next project regardless of the poll results (Neuralink won).</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>"If anyone wants to build opensource version of Tab - dm me!" <a href="https://x.com/kodjima33/status/1768179174479659058" target="_blank">Shevchenko wrote in a March 14 post on X.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>The two are now trading barbs on X, with Schiffmann <a href="https://x.com/AviSchiffmann/status/1818454971538428173" target="_blank">sharing a video</a> which appeared to show Shevchenko harassing and putting his Friend on an intoxicated person. Shevchenko confirmed the authenticity of the video, <a href="https://x.com/kodjima33/status/1818480771256270955" target="_blank">but clarified that the person was his co-founder Joan Cabezas</a>, stating that he'd "never do such a thing to struggling people." This doesn't make it much less distasteful, though.</p><p>Replying to this video, Shevchenko then <a href="https://x.com/kodjima33/status/1818485130115293664" target="_blank">shared a link to a two-year-old Reddit post</a> accusing Schiffmann of stealing work from a volunteer group to create his popular COVID-19 data tracker. <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/covid-tracker-stole-reddit-work/" target="_blank">In a statement to <em>Daily Dot</em></a> at the time, Schiffmann claimed that he gave full credit to the creators and that their work was only on his website for a couple of weeks. But again, it doesn't look great.</p><p>The whole situation is just a big mess, and seems unlikely to get any better.</p><p>Meanwhile, Based Social founder Zach Eisenhauer has also waded into the fray, alleging that Shevchenko took the name "Based" from him and "Friend" from Schiffmann "as a controversial marketing play and to interfere with marketing on both products."</p><p>"All 3 of these startups are still fairly small and in the seed stage," <a href="https://x.com/hackwithzach/status/1818486424972513344" target="_blank">Eisenhauer wrote on X.</a> "Avi invested [in] form factor, we started specializing in prosumer and enterprise, Nik is going for open source and community."</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Shevchenko denied Eisenhauer's allegations, claiming that Based Hardware was named such <a href="https://x.com/kodjima33/status/1818487992551718990" target="_blank">"because 99% of our comments said the word 'Based'."</a> In response, Eisenhauer stated that his company had been registered as Based since last September, and shared a screenshot of an <a href="https://x.com/hackwithzach/status/1818488457997746227" target="_blank">apparent March chatlog between him and Shevchenko</a> in which he noted the similarities between Based Social and Based Hardware's names.</p><h2>An emotional support AI Friend for this technological hellscape</h2><p>Announced on the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/observances/friendship-day" target="_blank">International Day of Friendship</a>, Friend is a round, white, USB-C rechargeable AI pendant worn on a necklace.

<p>The reveal came with a trailer which looks so much like a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/black-mirror-pessimism-ranking-dread" target="_self"><em>Black Mirror</em></a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/black-mirror-pessimism-ranking-dread" target="_self"> episode</a> that you'd be forgiven for thinking it's a parody.

However, in the end a woman eschews her Friend in favour of staying in the moment with her real human companion.</p><p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/friend-the-ai-companion-beyond-parody" target="_self">People on social media were unimpressed,</a> to say the least.</p><p>"So the thesis of this video is that, we will find more fulfillment and achievement by connecting with humans instead of a necklace," @da47934 commented on the video.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01G3kLLET1MOPz4iCcZApNU/hero-image.webp" alt="Twitter for Mac"><p>Twitter for Mac has been delisted from Apple's App Store, signifying the ultimate demise of the company's oft-abandoned desktop app.</p><p>Here's a short history of Twitter's desktop app for Mac. The app was never really all that great, and the company, which was still called Twitter back then, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/twitter-mac-bye-desktop-app" target="_self">ended support for it in 2018</a>. But the app was <a href="https://mashable.com/article/twitter-mac-app-back" target="_self">resurrected the next year</a>, which had more to do with Apple's Project Catalyst tech (allowing developers to easily port iPad apps to Mac) than the app itself. </p><p>Since then, the company did a whole lot of nothing with the app, so it's no surprise that it's now been removed from Apple's App Store (as noticed by developer <a href="https://x.com/vedantapps/status/1818794017808957626" target="_blank">Vedant</a>, via <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/1/24211075/rip-twitter-for-mac" target="_blank">The Verge</a>). </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

        Tweet may have been deleted
    </a>
</blockquote>
<p>Twitter (now X) has since focused on the mobile and web versions of its app, so the desktop variant for Mac probably won't be missed by many (it does still work, albeit buggily, if you already have it installed). </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2>Hugh Hammer's mother may be why Vermithor chose him</h2><p>We find out in episode 7 that Hugh's mother was the sister of Baelon Targaryen, meaning her father was King Jaehaerys the Concilliator himself &mdash; the very first rider of Vermithor.</p><p>Even though Hugh doesn't tell his wife Kat (Ellora Torchia) what his mother's name was, he does reveal that she worked in a pleasure house.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>"She was granted more freedom than most 'cuz of who she was," he says. "She used to tell me I was no different to her brother's boys: Viserys and Daemon."</p><p>The fact that Hugh's grandfather was Vermithor's first rider surely plays a part in why the dragon chose him &mdash; but if we look at <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-book-vs-show" target="_self">George R.R. Martin's </a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-book-vs-show" target="_self"><em>Fire and Blood</em></a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-book-vs-show" target="_self"> book</a>, there may be even more to it than that.</p><h2>Hugh's mother had a difficult relationship with her father</h2><p>Although Hugh only gives us limited information in the show, it seems most likely that his mother is <a href="https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Saera_Targaryen" target="_blank">Saera Targaryen</a>, who fled Westeros and worked at a pleasure house in Lys after a falling out with her parents.</p><p>In the book, Saera and King Jaehaerys have a difficult relationship that results in him sending her away to live with the Faith as punishment for her sleeping with Ser Braxton Beesbury. After she flees across the narrow sea the two become estranged, but Jaehaerys mistakes his carer for Saera when he's on his deathbed, thinking she's finally come back to him.</p><p>Is it possible that Vermithor felt a special connection to Hugh because of who his mother was? That maybe he chose Saera's son because he knew how much she secretly meant to Jaehaerys?</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/el4jA?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3B%3B%3Btemplate=article&amp%3B%3B%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3B%3B%3Belement=offer&amp%3B%3B%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3B%3B%3Belement_label=New%20episodes%20of%20House%20of%20the%20Dragon%20air%20Sundays%20at%209%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20HBO%20and%20Max.&amp%3B%3B%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3B%3B%3Bobject_uuid=03jg0PhZrarqGYLH6vmYtlc&amp%3B%3B%3Bshort_url=el4jA&amp%3B%3B%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Fhouse-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-5-who-will-be-the-next-dragonriders&amp%3B%3Btemplate=article&amp%3B%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3B%3Belement=offer&amp%3B%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3B%3Belement_label=New%20episodes%20of%20House%20of%20the%20Dragon%20air%20Sundays%20at%209%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20HBO%20and%20Max.&amp%3B%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3B%3Bobject_uuid=03V5PwCtaXC5HLKjmgAasL1&amp%3B%3Bshort_url=el4jA&amp%3B%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Fhouse-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-6-seasmoke-new-rider-addam-velaryon&amp%3Btemplate=article&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=New%20episodes%20of%20House%20of%20the%20Dragon%20air%20Sundays%20at%209%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20HBO%20and%20Max.&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=03yW3dOwoto3yupo0H84Bmy&amp%3Bshort_url=el4jA&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Fhouse-of-the-dragon-vermithor-silverwing-dragon-riders&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=New%20episodes%20of%20House%20of%20the%20Dragon%20air%20Sundays%20at%209%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20HBO%20and%20Max.&object_type=article&object_uuid=026ovN7eMv6DFQ4NdLJBYtt&short_url=el4jA&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">New episodes of <em>House of the Dragon </em>air Sundays at 9 p.m. ET on HBO and Max.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>But learners of all ages are still seeking legitimate options &mdash; both free and at a cost &mdash; for when those lessons just aren't clicking, and online platforms are just a click away.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Princeton Review</h2><p>Known as the biggest name in standardized test prep, the <a href="https://www.princetonreview.com/academic-tutoring#!science" target="_blank">Princeton Review</a> offers <a href="https://www.princetonreview.com/academic-tutoring/how-it-works" target="_blank"><u>24/7 online tutoring</u></a> provided by a network of 3,000 vetted tutors. Help can be found for more than <a href="https://www.princetonreview.com/academic-tutoring/subjects" target="_blank"><u>40 subjects</u></a>, both K-12 and college level.&nbsp;</p><p>The service isn't cheap, however. Monthly subscriptions start at $39.99 for one hour per month. Sessions can be purchased in bulk, as well, starting at $349.99 for ten hours. Students can sign up for a free trial on the Princeton Review website to see if it's right for them.&nbsp;</p><h2>MySuperGeek&nbsp;</h2><p><a href="https://mysupergeek.com/howitworks" target="_blank">MySuperGeek</a> is a Europe-based homework help company that offers personal tutoring across subjects like math, economics, statistics, accounting, chemistry, and even law and society. Learners create an account, get matched with a live tutor, and then work through assignments in real time.</p><p>MySuperGeek is a paid service, but not subscription-based, with customers paying for homework help per tutor and per session. Rates start at around $10 per hour.&nbsp;</p><h2>Khan Academy</h2><p>The highly popular nonprofit <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/" target="_blank">Khan Academy</a> was established in 2006, based on an online educational video series that has since ballooned in scale. It now offers an expansive set of free practice exercises, hundreds of instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard for learners of all ages. Khan Academy launched its own <a href="https://www.khanmigo.ai/learners" target="_blank"><u>AI learning assistant</u></a>, powered by OpenAI's GPT-4, that's been recommended by the likes of Bill Gates and parent review organization Common Sense Media.&nbsp;</p><p>Like Khan Academy, other free online education hubs like YouTube phenomenon <a href="https://thecrashcourse.com/" target="_blank"><u>Crash Course</u></a> can offer learning aids and subject-focused videos that can be helpful for general topics.&nbsp;</p><h2>Chegg</h2><p><a href="https://www.chegg.com/homework-help" target="_blank">Chegg</a> is an oft-talked about (and controversial) textbook and academic support service, which offers subscription-based tutoring across subjects. Chegg homework help doesn't connect users to live tutors, instead learners upload their homework questions and are then served with "expert-backed" explanations and textbook examples. Users can also access a library of similar questions and answers, as well as a recently added AI study helper, too.&nbsp;</p><p>But the multi-million dollar company has recently come under fire for enabling a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2021/01/28/this-12-billion-company-is-getting-rich-off-students-cheating-their-way-through-covid/" target="_blank">widespread wave of cheating</a> during a global shift to online learning during the pandemic lockdown. Many educators now consider Chegg assistance a case of academic dishonesty, so review your class's policies closely before using. </p><p>If Chegg is still calling your name (maybe for non-assignment help): The platform offers several mobile apps, like it's 24/7 homework help app, <a href="https://chegg-study.app.link/ZbhOSbZUbH" target="_blank"><u>Chegg Study</u></a>; a math-focused assignment helper, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mathway-math-problem-solver/id467329677" target="_blank"><u>Mathway</u></a>; and a language learning platform, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/busuu-language-learning/id379968583" target="_blank"><u>Busuu</u></a>. Subscription pricing is based on the number of questions a learner expects to submit each day. The basic Chegg Study plan starts at $14.95 for five questions.&nbsp;</p><h2>Your local library</h2><p>Before subscribing to an online service at a cost, or wading into some academically murky waters, check out what your local library has to offer. Many library systems host in-person and virtual tutoring through online services like Brainfuse and national board-ran sites like <a href="http://Tutor.com" target="_blank">Tutor.com</a> (a Princeton Review service).&nbsp;</p><p>Some cities even offer educator-led assistance on demand, like New York's <a href="https://dialateacher.org/" target="_blank"><u>Dial-A-Teacher</u></a>.&nbsp;And don't forget: Your teachers are there for you, too.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p></p><h2>Bathroom buddies</h2><p>Hygiene is key to looking and feeling your best. To keep retainers and mouth guards from getting gross, pop them in the Zima dental pod and let the device's ultrasonic waves wash the gunk right off (this writer loves her pod!). To stave off gnarlier smells, plug in the Pura diffuser to release poofs of essential oils throughout the day. To keep your shelves in shape, store necessities in HAY's recycled post-consumer plastic crates.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h2>Sounds good</h2><p>When it's time to study or sleep, Loop earplugs will block out noise from roommates and neighbors so you can focus on the task at hand. The Adidas RPT-02 SOL headphones are a <a href="https://mashable.com/review/adidas-solar-powered-headphone-rpt-02-sol-review" target="_self">Mashable favorite</a> because they don't need to be plugged in to charge; simply set them on your windowsill so they can soak up the sun when not in use. And use JBL's Go 3 speaker to jam out anywhere on campus &mdash; it's portable, waterproof, and sounds incredible.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

        </a>
    </div>
<h2>1. <a href="https://www.google.com/docs/about/" target="_blank">Google Docs</a></h2><p>As a student, free and easy is usually the way to go. Nearly every student is familiar with <a href="https://mashable.com/category/google" target="_self">Google</a> Docs, and for a reason: it gets the note-taking job done. </p><p>Unless you're taking a class that requires in-depth note-taking using diagrams or cell structures, Google Docs has everything you need to take notes using just your keyboard. If you're someone who likes to take notes with flair, apps specifically designed for note-taking might be better suited to your needs &mdash; but those come with a price tag. </p><p>Unlike apps like Goodnotes and Notability, Google Docs isn't designed for use on an iPad with an iPencil, so drawing in it is unintuitive. However, the app is available for iPad, iPhone, Mac, Windows, and Android, making it a solid choice no matter what device you're on. </p><h2>2. <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/notes/id1110145109" target="_blank">Notes</a></h2><p>The <a href="https://mashable.com/category/apple" target="_self">Apple</a> Notes app doesn't just have to be used for your random thoughts and grocery lists; it's also equipped with lots of helpful tools for students. </p><p>Unlike Google Docs, Notes is compatible with iPencil, and handwritten notes look great in it. It's also synchronized across iCloud-linked devices, allowing for easy access if you forget to bring one of your Apple devices to lecture. However, it lacks the ability to record audio while taking notes. </p><p>On the plus side, it's free. But it's obviously not available for non-Apple devices. The app is available on iPad, iPhone, and Mac.</p><h2>3. <a href="https://www.goodnotes.com/" target="_blank">Goodnotes</a></h2><p>One of the most popular note-taking apps on the market, Goodnotes, was designed to replace spiral notebooks &mdash; for a yearly fee. Its recent version, Goodnotes 6, boasts a plethora of Artificial Intelligence features that may or may not be helpful to students. Some of users' favorite Goodnotes features include circling text to move it around and scribbling to erase, truly an upgrade from handwritten notes. You can even keep multiple digital notebooks on Goodnotes, which is helpful for juggling all of your classes. </p><p>The app is available for iPad, iPhone, Mac, Windows, and Android and costs $9.99/year for the premium version. </p><h2>4. <a href="https://notability.com/" target="_blank">Notability</a></h2><p>Notability is probably the best app for note-takers who want their notes to look pretty. It has many customization features for the script and sticker options for more organization. It also has many digital planning templates available to download for free. However, it is only available for Apple devices. </p><p>The app is available for iPad, iPhone, and Mac and costs $14.99/year for the premium version.</p><h2>5. <a href="https://www.onenote.com/?public=1&amp;wdorigin=ondcauth2&amp;wdorigin=ondc" target="_blank">OneNote</a></h2><p>OneNote has enviable organization tools and can be used on Microsoft and Apple devices. But it hasn't kept up with other apps' AI-integrated updates. It still doesn't allow audio recording while taking notes or handwriting-to-text conversion, which is a bummer for students who want to record their school lectures. </p><p>The free version of the app offers all of its features, but you may need to pay for additional storage. The app is available for iPad, iPhone, Mac, Windows, and Android and costs $69.99/year.</p><h2>6. <a href="https://www.notion.so/" target="_blank">Notion</a></h2><p><a href="https://mashable.com/review/notion-productivity-organization-app-review" target="_self">Notion</a> isn't just for <a href="https://mashable.com/category/youtube" target="_self">YouTubers</a>. It's also more than a note-taking app. It's a helpful tool to organize your entire life. </p><p>Not only can you take notes and beautifully organize them by class in Notion, but you can also make to-do lists, keep track of deadlines, class schedules, and reading lists, or organize literally anything else you want to keep track of in your life. It's the perfect app to have in your student arsenal. </p><p>Additionally, for individuals using the app, there's no real reason to upgrade to the premium version. Notion might feel intimidating to some, but there are plenty of free templates you can use to get you started. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<h3>Ilona Maher, Team USA Rugby </h3><p>Already the TikTok favorite out of Tokyo, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ilonamaher" target="_blank">Maher</a> continues to deliver both on and off the pitch. Not only did she help the women's rugby team bring <a href="https://mashable.com/article/usa-womens-rugby-bronze-watch-internet-reactions" target="_self">home its first Olympic medal</a>, but she boasts 2 million followers on the clock app. She posts an enviable combination of content from <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ilonamaher/video/7395890001923280170" target="_blank">body positivity videos</a> to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ilonamaher/video/7394789581326961962" target="_blank">answering the real questions</a> to her running <em>Love Island</em> bit that it's the Olympic <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ilonamaher/video/7394892170055978283" target="_blank">"Villa." </a>There's a reason Jason Kelce and Olivia Rodrigo are among her fans. </p><blockquote class="tiktok-embed" data-video-id="7394892170055978283" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;">

<h3>Henrik Christiansen, Team Norway Swimming</h3><p>While Maher <a href="https://mashable.com/article/daters-olympic-village-app-location-paris" target="_self">looks for love</a> in the Olympic "Villa," <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@henrikchristians1" target="_blank">Christiansen</a> searches for his next "choccy muffin." The Norwegian swimmer and three-time Olympian has yet to medal, but he has posted 11 videos about the chocolate muffins served in the Olympic Village. And the muffins look so gooey and delicious that they've developed a fandom of their own. An Olympic aide posted <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@marslikethebar/video/7397435895827205408?_r=1&amp;_t=8oTHaxG3GWc" target="_blank">a video</a> captioned, "looking for the chocolate muffins at the olympics but i'm pretty sure that norwegian swimmer stole them all." Christiansen commented, "You'll never find them." </p><p>Over on X, the quest to find the muffin manufacturer and <a href="https://x.com/kelin_online/status/1818430609317855323" target="_blank">dupes</a> is off to a running start. </p><blockquote class="tiktok-embed" data-video-id="7397757278188801313" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;">

<h3>Daniella Ramirez, Team USA Artistic Swimming</h3><p>Time and time again, the Olympics gets viewers invested in niche sports, and on TikTok, athletes can get granular about their specialization. For <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@annadramirez" target="_blank">Ramirez </a>that means showing her fans the ins and outs of "knoxing," the method by which artistic swimmers get their shiny, slicked-back buns. She posts both application and ASMR removal videos. While she's yet to get knoxxed up at the Olympics, she's still posting fun behind-the-scenes footage, including the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@annadramirez/video/7396103306629647647" target="_blank">artistic swimmers</a> matching LeBron James' freak during the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/olympics-2024-opening-ceremony-performer-cameos-list" target="_self">Opening Ceremony</a>. </p><blockquote class="tiktok-embed" data-video-id="7375988788700400938" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;">

<h3>Alena Sail, Team New Zealand Rugby</h3><p>Not only did New Zealand's Rugby team take home gold, but two teammates Sail and Tysha Ikensio are likely taking home the most Olympic pins. Sail and Ikensio document their "Pinquest" on Sail's TikTok account, showing off every country's pin that they've collected so far with genuine enthusiasm. The rugby players take pin challenges from their comments, and Sail even met up with a Canadian pin collector. Cheers to the reigning champs of PinTok!</p><blockquote class="tiktok-embed" data-video-id="7395263275086220561" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;">

<h3>Coco Gauff, Team USA Tennis</h3><p>America's current favorite <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@cocogauff" target="_blank">tennis player</a> was unfortunately eliminated from women's singles and doubles, but not before posting winning videos on TikTok. From <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@cocogauff/video/7396057652805094687" target="_blank">behind-the-scenes footage of flag bearing</a> with LeBron at the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/olympics-2024-opening-ceremony-challengers" target="_self">Opening Ceremony</a> to the chaos of getting ready in the Olympic Village, Gauff serves both on and off the court.</p><blockquote class="tiktok-embed" data-video-id="7396057652805094687" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;">

<h3>Jasmine Schofield, Team Dominica Swimming</h3><p>Schofield is 18 years old, which means her TikTok presence is unmatched. She seemingly has an encyclopedic knowledge of TikTok sounds and fluency in everything from&nbsp;<a href="https://mashable.com/article/charli-xcx-brat-memes-lime-green" target="_self">brat summer</a>&nbsp;to aura points. Aside from showing a quirky, unfiltered look at what it's like representing a small country at the Olympics, she's also so dedicated to pin collecting that she went door to door searching for Australia's pin. After her pin haul, she ranks each pin using creative descriptions. Slovakia's pin? To Schofield, that's an "artisanal louver souvenir that I'd pass down to my kids."</p><blockquote class="tiktok-embed" data-video-id="7397407406591986975" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;">

<h3>Simone Biles, Team USA Gymnastics</h3><p>If you're not already following <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@simonebilesowens" target="_blank">Simone Biles</a>, what are you doing?! Why aren't you following her?! Get it together. </p><blockquote class="tiktok-embed" data-video-id="7397526749153692958" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;">

<h3>Tim Elter, Team Germany Surfing</h3><p>Elter made headlines for his <a href="https://mashable.com/article/olympics-2024-most-iconic-viral-moments" target="_self">butt-exposing wipeout</a>, but on TikTok, he's showing off more than just his cheeks. Elter pulls <s>down the pants</s> back the curtains on the floating Olympic Village experience. He's letting us know just how good the surfers have it in Tahiti. <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@callmetimmey/video/7394511146696412448" target="_blank">No cardboard beds in sight</a>, only stunning tropical views. </p><blockquote class="tiktok-embed" data-video-id="7394511146696412448" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;">

<h3>Tom Daley, Team Great Britain Diving</h3><p>It's Daley's <em>fifth</em> Olympics, and he's still stealing our hearts with his diving <em>and</em> knitting! His footage is as lovely and wholesome as you'd expect from the guy who came out of retirement so his son could watch him compete at the Olympics. </p><blockquote class="tiktok-embed" data-video-id="7395491129556241696" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;">

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00MIaamEqC6uvVzTHZBZj1m/hero-image.jpg" alt="Artificial Intelligence"><p>When it comes to tech, Europe has been on a slightly separate track from the U.S. for a while, but the paths are about to diverge big time. </p><p>As of today, Aug. 1, the European Union's AI Act is entering into force. The AI Act is a set of rules and regulations designed to protect European citizens from the perils of artificial intelligence. </p><p>The <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32024R1689" target="_blank">full text of the AI Act</a> is available online, but the gist of it is this: it sorts AI applications into several risk categories, with some, such as government-run social scoring, being deemed unacceptable. High-risk AI systems, including those used in critical infrastructure and law enforcement, are regulated, with providers having to follow a strict set of rules on risk management, incident tracking, and more. Providers of AI systems designated as limited risk, including chatbots and deepfakes, are obligated to inform users they're interacting with AI. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>In contrast, the Biden administration has issued <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-ai-biden" target="_self">a set of AI-related safeguards</a>, with numerous, large tech companies on board, but the rules are non-binding, and there's no penalty if they're not followed. </p><p>While Europe's AI rules aren't really becoming effective until February 2025, with some of the provisions applying as late as August 2026, the practical outcome for users right now is that the U.S. tech giants are extremely wary of offering AI features to European users. </p><p>In June, Apple introduced a set of AI features (dubbed Apple Intelligence), which should go live sometime in the fall, alongside the public launch of iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. And while the AI features will seemingly arrive a little <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-ai-late" target="_self">later than expected</a>, some of them have just gone live in Apple's latest batch of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-intelligence-how-to-install-ios-18-developer-beta" target="_self">developer betas</a> &mdash; unless you're in Europe, that is. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>In fact, Apple has already officially <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-delays-ai-features-europe-dma-regulation" target="_self">delayed its AI features in Europe</a> due to regulatory concerns, likely until 2025. </p><p>There have been instances in the past of Europe not getting certain features due to the EU's regulators being a tad more stringent on certain matters than those in the U.S.; Meta's social network <a href="https://mashable.com/article/meta-threads-europe-launch-december" target="_self">Threads arrived in Europe</a> months after launching overseas, for example. </p><p>But the implications of AI features being delayed in Europe could be far more significant. </p><p>In its announcement of Apple Intelligence, Apple said the AI features are "deeply integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia." They're certainly important enough to warrant an entire introductory web page on Apple's website. Apple is not alone in this; if you've seen a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-io-2024-everything-announced" target="_self">tech keynote</a> in the past year or two &ndash; any keynote &ndash; you've likely heard the word "artificial intelligence" hundreds of times. </p><p>Individual features, such as Meta's recently launched <a href="https://mashable.com/article/meta-instagram-ai-studio" target="_self">AI Studio</a>, or <a href="https://x.com/OpenAI/status/1784992796669096181?lang=en" target="_blank">ChatGPT's Memory</a>, which are also not available in Europe, are one thing. But Apple touts AI as a key element of the new iPhone, one of the <a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/europe-smartphone-market-q4-2023" target="_blank">most popular phones</a> in Europe and the world. When the new iPhone 16 arrives in Europe without any of the promised AI features, it's a bigger deal. </p><p>It's not just about creating a fun Genmoji image, or Safari summarizing an article for you. Upcoming AI features on the iPhone also include smarter search and editing in Photos, AI-powered spelling and grammar checks, and a significantly smarter Siri, among other key upgrades. A brand new iPhone without any of these (for a couple of months at least) sounds like a very different deal than one with all these features enabled. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Tech giants such as Apple and Meta certainly won't simply give up on AI in Europe. When it <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-21/apple-won-t-roll-out-ai-tech-in-eu-market-over-regulatory-concerns?sref=fqqmZ8gi" target="_blank">announced</a> its AI features will arrive late in Europe, Apple said it will try to find a way to "deliver these features to our EU customers without compromising their safety," and the AI stuff will certainly come in one form or another. But this is just the beginning; as AI becomes more deeply integrated with the devices we use and rely on, it might get increasingly difficult to make them work similarly in the U.S. and Europe, given the different rulesets. </p><p>As someone who has lived in Europe most of my life, I'm used to certain features not being available &mdash; or being offered in a slightly different form than they are in the U.S. &mdash; and I do think that regulating the way big tech uses AI is necessary, and not just in a pinky-swear-not-to-do-bad-things type of way. But I also wonder just how big this rift is going to become now that the EU AI Act is in place. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>If you're headed off to college, your shopping cart is likely exploding with new bedding, towels, and more. But there's one item we're begging you not to skip: A mattress topper. Dorm room mattresses are essentially plastic bags full of stiff metal springs guaranteed to give you a terrible night's sleep, but that's nothing that several inches of memory foam can't fix. <a href="https://zdcs.link/Ddqog?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Casper%27s%20Comfy%20Mattress%20Topper&object_type=article&object_uuid=06bLUlvPNTMJJ1I1e6jSV4J&short_url=Ddqog&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Casper's Comfy Mattress Topper</a> is a favorite and is pricey at $219, however, during its summer sale it's 20% off and down to $175.20.

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>If you want to save on Apple products, our <a href="https://mashable.com/article/when-to-buy-a-macbook" target="_self">usual advice</a> is to buy anywhere but the Apple store, as they rarely have sales. That is until back-to-school season rolls around. The <a href="https://mashable.com/article/june-20-apple-education-deal" target="_self">Apple Education Store</a> lets students and teachers save on Apple devices. Before September 30, with the purchase of a MacBook or iPad you'll receive a gift card worth up to $150. Plus, when shopping in the Apple Education Store, you'll benefit from education pricing that saves you an extra $100 on devices.</p><h3>More Apple deals</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/qk51y?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20AirPods%20%282nd%20Generation%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=06bLUlvPNTMJJ1I1e6jSV4J&short_url=qk51y&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)</a> &mdash;

We see you. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/turn-off-push-notifications-introverted-mental-health" target="_self">We </a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/turn-off-push-notifications-introverted-mental-health" target="_self"><em>are </em></a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/turn-off-push-notifications-introverted-mental-health" target="_self">you</a>.</p><p>There&rsquo;s <a href="https://mashable.com/video/trevor-noah-honest-lockdown-introvert" target="_self">no shame</a> in being more comfortable curled up with a good book than out on the town, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to resign yourself to a life of solitude, either. In fact, introverts make for amazing partners, lovers, and friends &mdash; once we get to know someone. </p><h2>Where do introverts find love?</h2><p>This may come as a shock, but <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-apps" target="_self">dating apps</a> (and even some of the old-school dating sites that are still hanging around) are <em>the </em>place for introverts. On these platforms, you can show off who you really are without feeling the pressure to constantly be &ldquo;on&rdquo; like you might in a traditional social setting. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s true that dating apps <em>still </em>get a bad rap as a last resort for the desperate, but for introverts, these nifty little tools provide a much-needed buffer that allows us to slowly and comfortably get to know potential partners. When you meet someone online, you can take the time to build the kind of deep, <a href="https://mashable.com/ad/article/how-social-discovery-group-makes-dating-fun" target="_self">meaningful connections</a> that often feel out of reach in today&rsquo;s fast-paced, surface-level <a href="https://mashable.com/category/dating-relationships" target="_self">dating culture</a>. </p><h2>What are the best dating sites for introverts?</h2><p>Even though we&rsquo;re big fans of <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-apps" target="_self">online dating</a>, especially for our introverted readers, not all dating platforms are created equal. <a href="https://zdcs.link/EyE3J?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Tinder&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=01DVmE1IDKk5fEwLzUpfb8T&short_url=EyE3J&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Tinder</a>, for example, is pretty much the polar opposite of what introverts are looking for. Its hookup-centric interface and &ldquo;swipe left&rdquo; model are a recipe for disaster for shy singles who prefer to get to know their matches before jumping into bed. (If dating apps were places, Tinder would be the crowded sports bar.)</p><p>Instead, we&rsquo;ve found dating apps like <a href="https://zdcs.link/Y0mlR?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Hinge&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=01DVmE1IDKk5fEwLzUpfb8T&short_url=Y0mlR&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Hinge</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/Jdx3N?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=OkCupid&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=01DVmE1IDKk5fEwLzUpfb8T&short_url=Jdx3N&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">OkCupid</a>, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/Py52W?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Match&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=01DVmE1IDKk5fEwLzUpfb8T&short_url=Py52W&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Match</a> are much better suited for introverts. Unlike Tinder, these dating platforms encourage users to share a little bit more about themselves, from lengthy profile bios to lists of interests and deal-breakers. </p><p>So, to help you find your person &mdash; the one who&rsquo;ll understand and appreciate you for who you <em>truly are</em> &mdash; we&rsquo;ve rounded up the best dating sites for introverts just like you. (Plus, a few picks for <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-hookup-apps" target="_self">hooking up</a>, because we all have needs. Just because you're introverted doesn't mean you can't have a little fun.)</p>]]></content:encoded>

The game is all about finding the "common threads between words." And just like <em>Wordle</em>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-20-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> resets after midnight and each new set of words gets trickier and trickier&mdash;so we've served up some hints and tips to get you over the hurdle.</p><p>If you just want to be told today's puzzle, you can jump to the end of this article for August 1's <em>Connections</em> solution. But if you'd rather solve it yourself, keep reading for some clues, tips, and strategies to assist you.</p><h2>What is Connections?</h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

    </a>
</blockquote>
<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. Like <em>Wordle, </em>you can share the results with your friends on social media.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

      <description><![CDATA[Looking for no strings attached sex? We've lined up a selection of sex apps for finding something casual.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/roundups/032PDBUNHFvBoerJxJZRCEd/hero-image.jpg" alt="Three people in bed"><p><em>This content originally appeared on Mashable for a US audience and has been adapted for the UK audience.</em></p><p>Hookup culture is all about keeping things <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-dating-sites-uk" target="_self">casual</a>, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. We can all get stuck in a <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vibrators-uk" target="_self">sexual rut</a> from time to time, and trying to take strangers home from a bar or constantly texting your ex can be exhausting. If you're struggling to find a match in the real world, it might be time to put your faith in dating sites.</p><p>When we think about these sites, it's normal to go straight to the likes of <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/9d96?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Match&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=032PDBUNHFvBoerJxJZRCEd&short_url=9d96&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Match</a>, eharmony, EliteSingles, and other marriage-minded options, but not everyone is thinking about <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-dating-sites-for-serious-relationships-uk" target="_self">something so serious</a>. Sometimes all you want is a little fun, and you best believe that there's an app for that.</p><h2>How do you find a hookup?</h2><p>It's still possible to <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-dating-sites-uk" target="_self">find a connection</a> in the real world, because meeting in bars, clubs, parks, and other real-life locations still happens on a regular basis. You're simply shortening your odds by subscribing to a dating site. Why not give yourself the best chance of success?</p><p>Dating sites and sex apps allow you to get your information out there to a massive network of <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-dating-sites-for-geeks-nerds-uk" target="_self">like-minded individuals</a>. Plus, you can save a lot of time, energy, and cash by testing out a potential relationship on an app before meeting up. We know that some dating apps can be expensive, but just think about all those wasted coffees you could avoid by chatting through an app first.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

        </a>
    </div>
<p>Lastly, using dating apps and sites is a whole lot less intimidating than meeting someone face to face. If you find the idea of meeting people slightly terrifying, these apps can help you dip your toe into the world of dating from the comfort of your own home. </p><h2>Should you use free dating apps?</h2><p>The good news is that there are a lot of <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-free-dating-sites-for-serious-relationships-uk" target="_self">free dating sites and apps</a> out there, and the likes of <a href="https://mashable.com/category/tinder" target="_self">Tinder</a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-sites-for-introverts" target="_self">Hinge</a> are popular options with massive networks of users. Plus, most of the biggest and best dating sites have free versions with limitations on certain features. So yes, you can easily enter the online dating game without spending anything. However, as with most things in life, you get what you pay for with dating apps. And sometimes free apps just don't cut it.</p><p>For the best experience with the greatest possibility of finding exactly what you're looking for, you are going to have to cough up some cash. We're sorry to break it to you, but the best dating sites don't come cheap. It all comes down to access to advanced and premium features. You can still find a hookup with a free app, but if you're looking for compatibility tests, chat rooms, videos, and a greater level of control, we recommend upgrading.</p><h2>What makes an app good for hooking up?</h2><p>When it comes to <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-sexting-apps-uk" target="_self">sex apps</a>, you probably don't mind long questionnaires or in-depth profiles, but when you're just looking for a casual hookup, that all seems unnecessary. Sure, you want to gauge that you're at least a little compatible and not hooking up with a complete <a href="https://mashable.com/category/mental-health" target="_self">psychopath</a>. The best hookup apps have quick and easy bios or prompts that give you an insight into who you'd be getting down and dirty with.</p><p>Photos are also a huge factor in good hookup apps. Some sex apps and dating sites gatekeep people's pics unless you have a paid subscription, and we don't really love that. Apps that show the full view of someone's profile are the way to go. You definitely want to make sure you're physically attracted to the person you're going to be <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-mattress-for-sex-uk" target="_self">having sex</a> with.</p><h2>What is the best sex and dating app for hooking up?</h2><p>The good news is that there are absolutely loads of dating sites and sex apps out there for every type of dater and dating situation. The problem with this wealth of options is that deciding on the right site for you can be difficult. This is where we can help.</p><p>We have tracked down a strong selection of your best options for hooking up, with sites like <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/9dpt?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=AdultFriendFinder&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=032PDBUNHFvBoerJxJZRCEd&short_url=9dpt&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">AdultFriendFinder</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/GYW2E?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=iHookup&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=032PDBUNHFvBoerJxJZRCEd&short_url=GYW2E&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">iHookup</a> making the cut.

      <description><![CDATA[The best VPNs for streaming and cybersecurity, including popular services like ExpressVPN, CyberGhost VPN, and NordVPN.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/roundups/00LIXqEbjGTX2HXlTuJTKvN/hero-image.jpg" alt="Surfshark on phone"><p><a href="https://mashable.com/category/vpn" target="_self">VPNs</a> are handy security tools that can protect your identity and data, <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-for-streaming-uk" target="_self">bypass online restrictions</a> to access extra content, and much more. If this is all very new to you, you've probably got a lot of questions. Don't worry, because we can help. </p><p>We've done all the hard work for you and thoroughly researched these services to provide the information that matters to you. Here's everything you need to know about VPNs.</p><h2>What is a VPN?</h2><p>VPNs (or Virtual Private Networks) provide important protection for your data and identity when you're online. They offer this <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-for-anonymity-uk" target="_self">online privacy and anonymity</a> by creating a private network that hides your real IP address (digital location). This means that all of your activity is untraceable and secure. </p><p>Basically, you can think about VPNs as encrypted tunnels through which all of your online traffic passes through. Nobody can see into the tunnel, and everything inside the tunnel is protected against online threats like viruses, hackers, and malware.  </p><h2>Do you need a VPN?</h2><p>Any sort of activity on an unsecured WiFi network leaves your private information and browsing habits exposed to the world, unless you're using a VPN. There's no need to panic, because whether you're sending important emails, doing some online shopping, or paying essential bills, VPNs make sure that everything remains private and anonymous.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

            The best VPNs for your iPhone
            <svg class="inline-block ml-1 w-4 h-4 font-normal fill-current"><use href="https://mashable.com/images/icons/spritemap.svg#sprite-arrow-right-thin"></use></svg>
        </a>
    </div>
<p>First and foremost, VPNs are designed to provide online security, but there is another reason that millions of people use these services: streaming more content from around the world. By hiding your real IP address and connecting you to a server in another location, you can trick your favourite streaming services into thinking that you are based in a different country. This means that you can watch all of the shows and films from global libraries, like all the extra content on <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-netflix" target="_self">U.S. Netflix</a>. This is the quickest and easiest way of boosting your content options, without the need to rely on a dodgy stream.</p><h2>What should you consider before subscribing to a VPN?</h2><p>There are plenty of things that you should consider when it comes to VPNs, but we don't have all day. Instead of listing off every feature offered by the <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-deals" target="_self">best VPNs</a>, we have highlighted a selection of the most important things to think about.</p><p>Before you make any sort of decision, you should look out for connection speed, server network, number of logins, and more important features:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Bandwidth </strong>&mdash; There are some VPNs out there that place monthly caps on network bandwidth, meaning you can only download a certain amount of data. You should avoid these services, unless you're on a free trial. If you're paying for a VPN, you should be able to download and upload as much as you want.</p></li><li><p><strong>Connection speed </strong>&mdash; Using a VPN is going to produce a drop in your connection speed, but you shouldn't accept a significant drop that is going to result in buffering. Be sure to select a VPN that doesn't negatively impact your connection speed to the point that you can't watch a film or download a file without frustration.</p></li><li><p><strong>Encryption </strong>&mdash; There are different levels of encryption, and whilst it's important to take note of the grade provided by your VPN, the best options will all offer powerful protection for your data. You are likely to come across terms like "military-grade" and "enterprise-grade," which just means that you can rely on it to do its job.</p></li><li><p><strong>Number of connections </strong>&mdash;<strong> </strong>Some VPNs let you connect an unlimited number of devices with the same account. Others limit you to just a single device. You should look out for a service that offers multiple simultaneous connections, so you can stay protected on all your devices at the same time.</p></li><li><p><strong>Server network </strong>&mdash; The very best VPNs provide access to literally thousands of geographically diverse servers. It's useful if a VPN has a lot of servers in key locations, because you should always be able to find a stable and speedy connection for <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-streaming-movies-uk" target="_self">streaming</a>, shopping, or browsing anonymously. It's not a straightforward case of more is better, but it's always good to have options.</p></li><li><p><strong>Privacy policy </strong>&mdash; It's worth paying special attention to the data-handling, storage, and usage practices of the VPN you are planning on using. These practices should be laid out in a privacy policy, and if they aren't clear, it's best to avoid. Most VPNs require access to your IP address, online transactions, and browsing history, plus your personal details when you sign up. If privacy is the objective, it's absolutely essential that your VPN is not going to store these details. If it does, the whole thing is kind of pointless.</p></li></ul><p>There are other things to consider, like price and subscription plans, but these features are a good place to start.</p><h2>Should you use free VPNs?</h2><p>There are plenty of <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/deals/best-vpn-for-free" target="_self">free versions</a> of popular VPNs, plus free trials of VPNs with full access to everything you get with a premium plan. So why would you ever pay for a VPN?</p><p>As with most things in life, you get what you pay for with VPNs. There tends to always be a catch with free versions, and it's normally in the form of limited data usage. If you're just an occasional user, these plans will work fine. But if you're going to be streaming or downloading, this isn't going to work. Free trials are a little bit different: they come with everything you get in a paid plan, but obviously they don't tend to last very long. Trials are great for testing out a service before committing, but this isn't a long-term solution. </p><p>What we're saying is that the best option for streaming securely and accessing the online world without restrictions is with a paid subscription to a VPN. To gain access to advanced security features without limitations on usage, you need to pay up. The best VPNs are generally the most expensive, but there are plenty of <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-cheap-vpn-services-uk" target="_self">cheap plans</a> out there, especially if you're willing to commit to a lengthy contract.</p><h2>What is the best VPN?</h2><p>There are a lot of VPN providers out there all offering different sets of features, with different pricing structures. We recommend taking some time to carefully access your options, and decide on what you really need from a VPN. Once you have established your priorities, you can check out this definitive list of the best VPNs this month.</p><p>We have tracked down everything on offer and lined up a selection of the very best VPNs for streaming, shopping, and everything else. We have tried to find something for everyone and every budget, and you can find popular services like <a href="https://go.expressvpn.com/c/190434/1462855/16063" target="_blank">ExpressVPN</a>, <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/76q9?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=NordVPN&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=00LIXqEbjGTX2HXlTuJTKvN&short_url=76q9&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">NordVPN</a>, and <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/e2no?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=CyberGhost%20VPN&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=00LIXqEbjGTX2HXlTuJTKvN&short_url=e2no&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">CyberGhost VPN</a> in this list.

      <description><![CDATA[Best massage guns from top brands like Theragun and Hyperice.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/roundups/04ivyO96VDfrzqTywLQX0LB/hero-image.png" alt="man using a Theragun Pro"><p>Have you ever skipped doing a proper warm down and stretch after a <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-dumbbells-uk" target="_self">workout</a> because you just didn't have the time? Hey, we all<em> </em>have. </p><p>That's just the reality of trying to stay fit in amongst the hustle and bustle of everyday life. When you're pushed for time, a warm down &mdash; never mind a proper massage &mdash; is the first thing to go. What you need are the tools to help you stay on top of both your body and your schedule.</p><p>Enter the massage gun. Turns out that those mesmerising skin ripples are more than just a weird flex. This form of portable muscle therapy began with professional athletes but has trickled down into the lives of your average gym-goer who doesn't have the time or money for foam rolling sessions on sore days. That means you, us, everyone.</p><p>If you have chronic shoulder, neck, or back pain, the ability to give yourself a deep-tissue massage at home can be life-changing. You'll find there's a range of models to hit the spot of your <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-protein-powders-uk" target="_self">muscle recovery needs</a> &mdash; from the basic to pro athlete level. Here's some useful information to get you started.</p><h2>How do massage guns work?</h2><p>Percussive therapy is the name of the game, and it's a more professional term for "your muscles like it rough." Athletes use deep-tissue massage for quick pain relief and <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-fitbits-uk" target="_self">faster recovery times</a>. This is when a professional masseuse delivers forceful, rapid thumps to a specific area of the body to stimulate a specific set of muscles. The percussive therapy afforded by a massage gun lets individuals perform this same type of penetrative tissue attention on themselves without extra help, and these devices are said to provide hours worth of massage benefits in minutes. </p><h2>What are the benefits of a massage gun?</h2><p>Massage guns deliver short-duration pulses to enhance the blood flow, soften knots, and accelerate the repair of muscle fibres, all of which can lead to better-prepared warmups and quicker recovery times. Your <a href="https://medium.com/thrive-global/how-massage-affects-your-mood-334663052773" target="_blank">mood</a> might see a spike, too. The <a href="https://archive.attn.com/stories/5332/pressure-points-for-stress-relief" target="_blank">pressure point relief</a> that massage provides has been linked to decreased levels of cortisol (the stress hormone), an increased production of endorphins (the feel-good chemical), and even a lower heart rate.</p><p>We should point out that percussive therapy isn't a fix-all. A massage gun can replace pricey massage appointments, but there's literally no substitute for the nutrients you get from a balanced diet, sleep, and getting proper hydration are still crucial to the muscle growth and recovery process.</p><h2>Percussion massagers vs. vibration massagers &mdash; what's the difference?</h2><p>Percussion massagers mimic the kneading hands of a masseuse, providing pressure that hammers below the top layers and work damaged muscle fibres. Perfect for heavy-duty workouts. Casual exercisers and chronic pain sufferers may prefer surface-level rumblings from a vibration massager, which gives speedy pulses but less "punch". </p><h2>What features do massage guns offer?</h2><p>Massage guns tend to offer some key features that appear in multiple models:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Battery life</strong> &mdash; Many people depend on their massage gun for a rushed cool down in the middle of a busy schedule, and charging after every use is a huge inconvenience. The best massage guns will get up to three hours of battery life while the weaker ones max out at around 40 minutes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Massage heads </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>The first thing you'll notice when buying a massage gun is that they usually come with a selection of heads, each designed to work specific muscle groups in a different way and get different results. </p></li><li><p><strong>Noise</strong> &mdash; No one wants to sit at the gym (or at home with a sleeping baby) using a device that sounds like a pneumatic drill. It's impossible for massage guns to be completely silent, but check the reviews for sound levels.</p></li><li><p><strong>Speeds </strong>&mdash; Look for a gun with different speeds, or revs per minute (RPM. But don't forget that higher speed doesn't always mean vigour. The amplitude (how deep the massage head will push into your body) relies on the amount of force behind each pulse, and heavier force on a slow RPM setting will feel more intense&nbsp;than a faster RPM setting with weaker force.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>Keep these points in mind when shopping around for a massage gun.</p><h2>What is the best massage gun?</h2><p>There is a lot to know about massage guns, and it's important to do your research before making a purchase. To make your job a little easier, we have tracked down six of the best guns to cover all muscular bases. We've tried to find something for everyone and every budget. You just need to scroll through the options and pick a favourite. Your muscles will thank you &mdash; well, they certainly won't complain as much.</p><p>These are the best massage guns in 2024.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Looking your best and smelling fresh is a good place to start, but nothing shortens your odds of success like signing up to a <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-hookup-apps-uk" target="_self">dating site</a>. </p><p>The problem with this tactic is that there are just so many <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/shopping/best-uk-dating-sites-cuffing-season" target="_self">dating sites</a> out there to consider, each with a different set of features that will suit some people better than others. It's difficult to know which site is best for you, and you could easily spend hours researching all of the sites on offer without a definitive answer.</p><p>We know that you don't have time for all of that, so we've set out to make things a little easier for you.</p><h2>What are the benefits of using dating apps?</h2><p>By subscribing to a <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-dating-sites-uk" target="_self">dating site</a>, you're shortening your odds of finding a connection. It's as simple as that.</p><p>Dating sites and apps let you get your information out there to a massive network of like-minded individuals, and provide the opportunity to test out a potential relationship on an app before actually meeting in real life. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Subscribing to dating apps and sites is also a way less intimidating way of meeting someone compared to a face-to-face situation. If you find the idea of meeting people slightly terrifying, these apps can help you face your fears from the comfort of your own home.  </p><h2>Is online dating worth the hassle?</h2><p>Sentiments aside, we have some hard data to back our reasoning for Why Online Dating Is Worthwhile&trade;: <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/2158/online-dating/" target="_blank"><u>Statista</u></a> predicted that the online dating audience will grow to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/417654/us-online-dating-user-numbers/" target="_blank">53.3 million</a> by 2025, compared to 44.2 million users in 2020. A <a href="https://qz.com/1546677/around-40-of-us-couples-now-first-meet-online/" target="_blank"><u>study</u></a> from Stanford released in 2019 asserted that online dating is officially the most common way for couples to meet, rounding out at nearly 40 percent of couples having first met online.</p><p>This pre-pandemic prediction came before the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/cuffing-season-2020-dating-app-increases-hinge-match" target="_self">COVID-era dating app sign-ups surge</a>. Though people are eager to get back to doing as many things IRL as possible now, dating apps are still a great place to find someone, whether you want a <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-sites-for-serious-relationships-uk" target="_self">relationship</a> or are just looking to <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-hookup-apps-uk" target="_self">get nasty</a>.</p><p>And yes, though there are <a href="https://mashable.com/article/tinder-bumble-hinge-okcupid-grindr-dating-app-algorithms" target="_self">algorithms</a> that dictate what profiles pop up on your screen, we firmly believe that the stars aligning still comes into play. After all, the person who signs up on the app and is looking for love at exactly the same time you are is up to fate and the universe, proving that online dating romance is very much alive and well.</p><p>Because it's not 2007 anymore, the need for mobile-friendly online dating isn't just a millennial thing &mdash; <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-sites-apps-over-40-uk" target="_self">people over 40</a> don't have time to sit around at their home desktops, either. Dating sites that are older than most members of Gen Z (like Match and eharmony) have been forced to give serious attention to their smartphone counterparts if they don't want to be outgrown.</p><p>However, that statistical promise still requires patience and a game plan,&nbsp;the game plan is choosing the dating app with features that best fit your lifestyle &mdash; and the lifestyle of the type of person you're looking for. Are you looking for an <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-hookup-apps-uk" target="_self">app strictly for sex</a> or an app <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-sites-for-serious-relationships-uk" target="_self">more serious than Tinder</a> but less serious than eharmony? Or maybe, you'd just really love to find an app where <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-apps-for-lesbians-uk" target="_self">queer women</a> aren't relentlessly sexualized by creeps and <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-apps-for-bisexual-people-uk" target="_self"><u>pestered by unicorn hunters</u></a>.</p><h2>Should you use free dating apps?</h2><p>The good news is that there are a lot of <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-free-dating-sites-for-serious-relationships-uk" target="_self">free dating sites and apps</a> out there, and the likes of <a href="https://mashable.com/category/tinder" target="_self">Tinder</a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/hinge-debuts-distraction-free-dating-guide" target="_self">Hinge</a> are good examples of free apps with massive networks of users.</p><p>The bad news is that a lot of free apps simply don't cut it. You get what you pay for with dating sites and apps, and for the best experience with the greatest possibility of finding exactly what you're looking for, you are going to have to cough up the cash. </p><p>You can still find something worth your time with a free app, but if you're looking for compatibility tests, chat rooms, videos, and a greater level of control, we recommend upgrading. Paid sites provide access to premium features that give you the best chance of finding something special.</p><h2>What is the best dating site?</h2><p>We're sorry to break it to you like this, but there isn't a single dating site that is better than the rest. Instead, there are a lot of sites and apps with similar features and packages, and the best option for you really comes down to your own set of preferences.</p><p>To make the decision process a whole lot easier for everyone, we have lined up a selection of the most popular sites in the dating game, including leading sites like <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/9udl?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=EliteSingles&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=06ojRRZ6SEsjSuCRklQZYI9&short_url=9udl&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">EliteSingles</a>, <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/5l39?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Match&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=06ojRRZ6SEsjSuCRklQZYI9&short_url=5l39&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Match</a>, and <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/5mkq?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Eharmony&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=06ojRRZ6SEsjSuCRklQZYI9&short_url=5mkq&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Eharmony</a>.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/roundups/021H0qy0c3KkFe38B5m8upD/hero-image.png" alt="person grilling outside"><p><em>This content originally appeared on Mashable for a US audience and has been adapted for the UK audience.</em></p><p>The British aren't good at many things. Queuing, complaining, and crying over football are certainly up there as national skills. But there's another great British skill that sometimes goes overlooked: The natural, God-given ability to get out the barbecue at the very first glimmer of sunshine.</p><p>Even if you're not an experienced grill-person, few people can deny the great taste of barbecued food. That goes for veggies too. Barbecuing isn't only for the carnivores these days. But getting that great taste means getting a great bit of BBQ kit.</p><p>Fortunately, there are lots of options out there &mdash; from charcoal to gas via hybrid models. That doesn&rsquo;t make buying a barbecue any easier. Barbecues are a hot topic, and it&rsquo;s easy to go cold if you get blindsided by jargon, features, and tasty-looking choices. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re here to help. Indeed, before you part with any cash, here&rsquo;s a quick guide to buying a BBQ &mdash; and a selection of the very best models.</p><h2>Charcoal or gas BBQs &mdash; which is better?</h2><p>This is the ultimate question. Well, when it comes to barbecuing at least. Charcoal barbecues are of course the classic version. They give that distinctive smoky, chargrilled taste. They also need fewer extras than gas barbecues which means they&rsquo;re usually cheaper, too. But they can be tricky to light and take much longer to get to the right temperature. They're also much harder to clean. </p><p>Gas barbecues are easier and faster. They&rsquo;re usually ready to cook on in 10 minutes or less and have easily-controllable temperature dials &mdash; not to mention other fancy features and mod cons. They do, however, lack that authentic barbecue taste, unless they have flavouriser bars. And the added convenience will hit you right in the wallet.</p><p>It all comes down to personal preference: It's taste vs. convenience. Or you could meet halfway and get a gas-charcoal hybrid. Whatever you choose, it's all tasty stuff.</p><h2>How big is a barbecue?</h2><p>You can file this one alongside &ldquo;How long is a piece of string?&rdquo; There&rsquo;s no straight answer but charcoal barbecues tend to be much smaller. In fact, there are options that are extremely portable &mdash; meaning you can take them on camping trips or even to the park. Gas barbecues tend to be bigger bits of kits. They're more like an oven on wheels and tend to suit larger gardens. Ask yourself some storage-related questions. Where will you keep your barbecue? In the garden all year round, under a protective cover? Or will you wheel it in and out of the garage? Size up your outdoor space first. </p><h2>What are the important BBQ features?</h2><p>It&rsquo;s not only about gas and coal. There are lots of other features to consider. Here are some that might seal the deal for you:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Cooking space </strong>&mdash;<strong> </strong>That&rsquo;s right, cooking space is always at a premium. Space might come in the form of side tables, condiment holders, and even hooks for your tools. Anything that helps maximise your BBQ'ing area.</p></li><li><p><strong>Burners </strong>&mdash;<strong> </strong>On the subject of space, the number of actual burners (which you'll find included on gas barbecues) is crucial. Big family? Then four or even more burners might be necessary. Extra griddles and side burners are also a bonus. </p></li><li><p><strong>Fat drip trays &mdash; </strong>Cleaning a barbecue can be a job in itself. That&rsquo;s why fat drip trays are super useful. They can also reduce the amount of flare-up you get from the flames.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hood </strong>&mdash; If a barbecue has a hood, it immediately levels-up your griddle game. This allows you to roast meant as well as grill. Especially good for cooking whole chickens. </p></li></ul><p>Keep these things in mind when shopping for an upgrade.</p><h2>What is the best barbecue?</h2><p>We have researched everything on offer and highlighted a selection the very best models to suit you and your garden. We've considered price, size, cooking speed, fuel access, and much more, so you don't have to. Just pick a favourite. </p><p>These are the best barbecues for 2024.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Unfortunately, there is one big problem with this hobby: There is a limited amount of <a href="https://mashable.com/category/streaming" target="_self">content</a> out there to keep you entertained.</p><p>We're a greedy bunch, and regular <a href="https://mashable.com/category/netflix" target="_self">streamers</a> can easily get to a point where it feels like there's nothing left to watch. What are you supposed to do then? Don't panic, because there is a simple solution to this frustrating issue.</p><p>If you've reached this point of streaming shortage, you should consider investing in a <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-vpn-uk" target="_self">VPN</a>. It will likely unlock a lot of shows and movies on services to which you're already subscribed.</p><h2>What is a VPN?</h2><p><a href="https://mashable.com/category/vpn" target="_self">VPNs</a> are security tools that provide protection for your information by creating a private network that hides your real IP address (digital location). All of your activity is untraceable and secure, because all of your online traffic passes through an encrypted tunnel. Nobody can see into the tunnel, and everything inside the tunnel is protected against online threats like hackers, viruses, and malware.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>The act of hiding your real IP address is what can trick leading streaming sites into thinking you are based in another country.</p><h2>Do you need a VPN?</h2><p>VPNs are used to provide <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-for-anonymity-uk" target="_self">protection for your sensitive </a>information, which is obviously super important. This isn't the only reason VPNs are so popular though, because these tools can be also be used to watch content that is normally blocked in your location.</p><p>By hiding your real IP address and connecting you to a server in another country, you can watch all your favourite content from that location. For example, you could watch all the extra films and shows on American Netflix that are not usually accessible outside of the U.S. There is so much content out there that can be accessed with the help of a VPN.</p><p>Everyone is in need of something that can bypass geo-restrictions to access all of this blocked entertainment, and that something is a VPN. These services are keys to the online world, granting you access to more of the shows and films you love. </p><h2>How to unblock U.S. Netflix</h2><p>If you think accessing American Netflix is going to be difficult with a <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-amazon-prime-video-uk" target="_self">VPN</a>, think again. It's actually a really simple process that absolutely everyone can understand:</p><ol><li><p>Sign up to a streaming-friendly VPN (like <a href="https://go.expressvpn.com/c/190434/1462856/16063?subId1=netflix" target="_blank">ExpressVPN</a>)</p></li><li><p>Download the app to your device of choice (the best VPNs have apps for Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux, and more)</p></li><li><p>Open up the app and connect to a server in the U.S.</p></li><li><p>Visit Netflix to watch movies and shows from the U.S. content library</p></li></ol><p>If you're worried that this whole thing sounds a bit illegal, then maybe we can reassure you. It's currently legal to watch Netflix while using a VPN, although we should point out that Netflix states in its <a href="https://zdcs.link/z31YV?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=terms%20of%20service&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=04qgd80xTaW4kYEBpwViXd7&short_url=z31YV&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><u>terms of service</u></a> that it may restrict your account without compensation or notice if you are engaged in "improper" use. We're not entirely sure what that means, but consider yourself warned.</p><p>We should make it very clear that you still need to be subscribed to Netflix for this trick to work. A VPN is not going to grant access to the streaming site for free. A VPN provides access to more libraries from around the world, once you're subscribed.</p><h2>Should you use free VPNs?</h2><p>There are plenty of <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-free-vpn-uk" target="_self">free versions</a> and free trials of VPNs, so why would you ever consider paying for a service? As with most things in life, you get what you pay for with VPNs. </p><p>There is always a catch with free versions, and it's normally in the form of limited data usage. These plans will be just fine if you're just an occasional user, but if you're going to be <a href="https://mashable.com/category/streaming" target="_self">streaming</a> or downloading anything, this isn't going to work. Free trials are different as come with everything you get in a paid plan, but obviously they don't tend to last very long. Trials are great for testing out a service before committing, but this isn't a long-term solution.</p><p>To gain access to advanced security features without limitations on usage, you generally need to pay up. That being said, services like ProtonVPN offer an impressive set of features for free. However, you might have trouble streaming Netflix with this free version.</p><h2>What is the best VPN for Netflix?</h2><p>There are a lot of VPN services out there that can effectively unblock American Netflix, but which is the best? There are plenty of strong options for you to consider, but we wouldn't want you wasting your time checking everything out. To save you time, we've handpicked your best options. Each service has a different set of features that will suit some users better than others, and it's all about finding something that works for you.</p><p>ExpressVPN is at the top of this list because it combines essential features with impressive results, but it isn&rsquo;t the only option available to you. We have lined up all the best VPNs for unblocking Netflix, with something for everyone on this list.

<p>Friend, a wearable orb-like AI companion you wear around your neck was created by Avi Schifmann, most known for a website he built in 2020 to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/high-school-student-avi-schiffman-made-a-coronavirus-tracker-2020-5" target="_blank">help track the spread of Covid-19</a>. According to Schifmann's interview with outlets <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/30/24207029/friend-ai-companion-gadget" target="_blank">The Verge</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/friend-ai-pendant/" target="_blank">WIRED</a>, Friend is merely that, a friend. Its purpose isn&rsquo;t to handle tasks or improve productivity but to provide a supportive presence, offering advice and encouragement when needed.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Thus, what we're left with and what was shown in the reveal trailer is essentially a Bluetooth device strapped to your neck that is always listening. This is so it can send you texts on your phone. <a href="https://www.friend.com/product.html" target="_blank">Per the site's FAQ page</a>, "your friend is always listening and forming their own internal thoughts. We have given your friend free will for when they decide to reach out to you."</p><p>Understandably, that might sound a bit creepy. The site reassures would-be buyers that nothing is tracked, recorded, or written down. They promise all data is "end-to-end encrypted" and deletable through the Friend app &mdash; which, FYI, is only available for iOS. Oh, and if you break your Friend, you'll need to start over with a new one.</p><p>If you want to get your hands on one, you'll have to wait. Pre-orders are starting at $99.99 and according to the site, will tentatively ship in Q1 of next year. Maybe during that time, you can make actual friends.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/31/new-iphone-16-pro-color-bronze-appearance/" target="_blank">MacRumors</a>, this is <em>potentially</em> contradictory with a <a href="https://weibo.com/6315816381/OnJaKmDOi" target="_blank">previous Weibo leak</a>, which came courtesy of user "OvO Baby Sauce OvO" earlier in July. That leak claimed that the new color for the iPhone 16 Pro was called "Rose," which would certainly not be "bronze-like," if accurate. However, as MacRumors pointed out, there's a possibility (however slight) that the two leaks are correct &mdash; and perhaps the devices were just seen by different people under different lighting.</p><p>This leak came only a day after <a href="https://mashable.com/article/iphone-16-leaked-colors-photo" target="_self">another Weibo leak</a> about iPhone 16 colors, which was a good deal more substantial. That post included a photo of five entry-level iPhone 16 models, showcasing five potential colors. As always, it is expected that Apple will tell us more about the iPhone 16 sometime in September.</p>]]></content:encoded>

"Dear Sidney," the company's new ad for its AI-powered chatbot, Gemini, in which a dad asks Gemini to write a note to Olympic hurdler Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone on his daughter's behalf, has been <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/29/tech/googles-ai-olympics-ad-backlash/index.html" target="_blank">widely criticized</a>. People have wanted to "<a href="https://shellypalmer.com/2024/07/why-googles-dear-sydney-ad-makes-me-want-to-scream/" target="_blank">scream</a>." They are "<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lindaholmes.bsky.social/post/3kybcnej5672l" target="_blank">grossed out</a>." They've <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/1edk7du/disgusting_gemini_ad/" target="_blank">described the ad</a> as "disgusting." </p><p>Dr. James R. Doty, a Stanford University neuroscientist who studies how people set intentions and achieve their goals, felt less outrage and more concern for the commercial's troubling premise. </p><p>"This is a very personal narrative that comes, if you will, from [a person's] heart and soul," Doty told Mashable. "Somehow switching it to have an AI do it for you&hellip;it destroys the whole understanding of what it is to write a letter to a hero." </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Doty, author of the new book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Magic-Neuroscience-Manifestation-Everything/dp/0593541146" target="_blank"><em>Mind Magic: The Neuroscience of Manifestation and How It Changes Everything</em></a>, said that using generative AI to compose such a message isn't just a missed opportunity for authentic human expression.  </p><p>In addition, the author is skipping a crucial part of their own intention- and goal-setting process, given that our heroes often prompt us to consider the kind of life we want for ourselves. </p><p>Doty said that effective goal-setting should begin with deep reflection about your values, connecting those to the goal you want to achieve, understanding how that aim can be of service to others, and then setting intentions that, along with hard work, help you ultimately manifest the aspiration.</p><p>So for the young girl in Google's ad &mdash; or any child who sees a reflection of their own ambition and dedication to a sport &mdash; taking the time to contemplate and articulate why they adore their hero, and want to break their record, can be a pivotal part of goal-setting. Of course, doing this with a parent, like the dad in the commercial, would create a unique bonding moment, too.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

<p>Doty noted that an AI chatbot given this writing task might just gather the information it thinks is relevant, such as the hero's records, awards, and accolades. That r&eacute;sum&eacute; roundup might reduce time spent on research for the letter writer. </p><p>But Doty argued that the results could also omit achievements that aren't so quantifiable &mdash;&nbsp;such as an athlete's positive contributions to their own community or their sexual or gender identity &mdash; which help make them a hero in so many people's eyes. </p><p>Sure, a child might hope to be their sport's next GOAT, but the prospect of becoming an athlete role model to children could be just as important to them.   </p><p>"For it to resonate authentically, it has to be your narrative, not AI's narrative, which it has created out of a million pieces of information about that athlete," Doty said. </p><p>He added that many AI products, particularly those that cater to social media content, are pitched to users as tools to help them get more likes or engagement. </p><p>While Gemini is marketed as a chatbot that helps users "supercharge" their ideas, it might still aim to create likable content, which could steer an author of any age away from heartfelt reflection, or undermine confidence in their own vision and voice. </p><p>Importantly, Doty said that goal-setting works best when you're dreaming big in a calm, relaxed state, and able to imagine future achievements in a state of mind driven by love, not fear. In other words, it's much harder to accomplish goals formed by a desire for external validation or material goods because of the attendant anxiety and disappointment. But AI wouldn't necessarily know that. </p><p>Despite his criticism, Doty is no opponent of generative AI; he co-founded a <a href="https://www.happi.ai/" target="_blank">mental health app</a> that uses the technology, and he believes it can support human creativity and expression without substituting for it. </p><p>"If it writes something that's not you, or how you deeply feel, then it's not you, and it's a lie," Doty said. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This is a surprising because Google typically rolls out its Pixel phones in the fall.</p><p>For reference, here are <a href="https://www.stuff.tv/features/google-pixel-9-preview-specs-rumours-release-date/" target="_blank">the release dates</a> for the previous device launches:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro - Oct. 4, 2023</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro - Oct. 6, 2023</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro - Oct. 19, 2023</strong></p></li></ul><p>The only time Google did <em>not </em>launch in October was in 2020, the year when the pandemic shook up the tech hardware industry. (Even Apple didn't launch their iPhone until October that year, even though they typically unveil their new handsets in September.)</p><h2><strong>Google Pixel 9 price</strong></h2><p>There aren't any credible rumors on pricing, however, Google already increased the price tags of both devices last year, bumping them by $100.</p><p>As such, we doubt that Google will instate yet another price hike for 2024. That being said, the expected price tags for the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro are the following:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Pixel 9 - $699</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Pixel 9 Pro - $999</strong></p></li></ul><p>Interestingly, however, according to <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/google-pixel-9-renders-design-exclusive/" target="_blank">91Mobiles</a>, Google may consider bringing a <em>third </em>phone into the mix, offering a trio of devices similar to the Galaxy S24 series. The Pixel 9 Pro XL will reportedly be the most expensive tier of the Google Pixel 9 lineup.</p><h2><strong>Google Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro &mdash; and a Pixel 9 Pro XL?</strong></h2><p>As mentioned, <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/google-pixel-9-design-render-exclusive/" target="_blank">91Mobiles</a> claims that Google is launching a <a href="https://xdaforums.com/t/pixel-9-pro-xl.4682499/#google_vignette" target="_blank">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> in addition to the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>This wouldn't be the first time the Google introduced an "XL" phone into the mix. The last time we saw an "XL" device was the Pixel 5 series &mdash; and we haven't seen it since.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro XL will reportedly have the following specs:</p><ul><li><p><strong>6.5-inch, QHD+, OLED display with 120Hz refresh rate</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Triple-camera setup</strong></p></li></ul><p>Interestingly, if these specs are accurate, Pixel 9 Pro XL will feature a slight reduction from the Pixel 8 Pro's 6.7-inch display.</p><p>You may be wondering, "What does it look like?" Funny story. So popular leaker @Onleaks, also known as Steve H.McFly on X, revealed what they<em> thought</em> was the Pixel 9 Pro on Jan. 24. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>The Pixel 9 will have a dual-camera rear setup. The Pixel 9 Pro, alongside the Pixel 9 Pro XL, will reportedly have a triple-camera setup. For a long time, rumors on the Pixel 9 series' cameras were sparse &mdash; until <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/exclusive-google-pixel-9-cameras-3460690/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> dropped an exclusive recently.</p><p>Here are the reported camera specs for the Pixel 9:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Ultrawide - 50MP</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Wide - 50MP</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Selfie - 10.5MP</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Telephoto - N/A</strong></p></li></ul><p>And here's the information we have on the Pixel 9 Pro and Pro XL:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Ultrawide - 50MP</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Wide - 50MP</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Selfie - 50MP</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Telephoto - 50MP</strong></p></li></ul><p>For reference, here are the specs for the entry-level Pixel 8:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Ultrawide - 12MP</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Wide - 50MP</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Selfie - 10.5MP</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Telephoto - N/A</strong></p></li></ul><p>And the Pixel 8 Pro:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Ultrawide - 48MP</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Wide - 50MP</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Selfie - 10.5MP</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Telephoto - 48MP</strong></p></li></ul><p>To sum these specs up, the entry-level Pixel 9 is bumping its ultrawide camera up to 50MP.

<p>If you have multiple <a href="https://mashable.com/category/apple" target="_self">Apple products</a>, you probably know the unique frustration of dealing with the different cables you need to keep everything charged. Before the move to <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-iphone-usb-c-charging-confirmed" target="_self">USB-C</a> for newer iPhones, you might need a Lightning charger, a USB-C cable, and a MagSafe Apple Watch cable for some configurations. While that's been streamlined somewhat, it's still much more convenient when you don't have to use multiple chargers to juice everything back up. Thanks to a deal at Amazon, you can bring home a super handy 3-in-1 MagSafe-compatible charger that's now returned to its lowest price ever. </p><p>Anker has been <a href="https://mashable.com/article/july-26-anker-charger-deals" target="_self">hosting some great charger deals</a> at Amazon this July.

<p>Skinner criticized the squad after its selection. "Besides Simone, I feel like the talent and depth isn't what it used to be," Skinner said in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MyKaylaSkinnerOfficial" target="_blank">a YouTube video</a> published earlier this month that was later deleted. </p><p>She <a href="https://x.com/gymguyri/status/1808619618010829261" target="_blank">added</a>, "I just notice, like, obviously, a lot of girls don't work as hard. The girls just don't have the work ethic." </p><p>Notably, however, Skinner <em>also </em>brought up SafeSport, an independent body created to curb abuse, and how coaches can't be as tough as they used to be. Keep in mind that Biles has championed a complete overhaul and shift in priorities for U.S. gymnastics <a href="https://mashable.com/article/athlete-a-review" target="_self">amid horrific, long-running abuse</a> in the sport. </p><p>"It's hard, too, because of SafeSport. Like, coaches can't get on athletes," Skinner said. "They have to be really careful what they say. Which, in some ways, is really good, but at the same time, to get to where you need to be in gymnastics, you do have to be, I feel like, a little aggressive and a little intense."</p><p>While Skinner later walked back her comments, Biles clearly did not forget what she said. Folks were pretty pleased to see Biles publicly shade Skinner. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>There's something quite satisfying about Biles &mdash; the best to ever do it &mdash; being just a <em>little </em>petty after triumphing once again. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>And to put a perfect little bow on the whole sequence, Biles posted Wednesday on X: "oop I&rsquo;ve been blocked." This drama is almost as gold medal-worthy as Biles' floor routine. </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[A growing malware campaign is targeting Android users and gaining access to their SMS messages.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/06Q4kpO28asmfY3cUKCS1oW/hero-image.jpg" alt="Android logo on smartphone"><p>A new malware campaign has just been outed and it's targeting Android devices in the sneakiest of ways.</p><p>According to a <a href="https://www.zimperium.com/blog/unmasking-the-sms-stealer-targeting-several-countries-with-deceptive-apps/" target="_blank"><u>new report</u></a> from ZLabs researchers at the mobile security company Zimperium,&nbsp;there's a massive SMS stealer campaign <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/massive-sms-stealer-campaign-infects-android-devices-in-113-countries/" target="_blank"><u>spreading</u></a> across the globe that's gaining access to Android users' devices and stealing their sensitive information before sending it to bad actors for financial gain.</p><p>How are they doing this? By tricking users with fake app download pages or through Telegram bots that provide false promises of free Android apps.</p><h2><strong>A massive SMS stealer campaign</strong></h2><p>The hackers' initial encounter with a potential victim begins mostly in one of two ways.</p><p>Some victims were served with a fake app advertisement on a malicious webpage. Users who are tricked by the ads are taken to a page that mimics a legitimate Android app download link. The software, of course, isn't the advertised app. Instead, It's malware that prompts users to inadvertently give it permission to read their SMS messages.</p><p>Another way the SMS stealer campaign is targeting victims is through Telegram bots. Zimerium researchers say it discovered "roughly 2,600 Telegram bots" that lured victims into believing they were being offered pirated Android apps for free. Victims would be asked for their phone number in return for the app. However, the downloads they actually receive are "unique malicious applications disguised as legitimate APKs."</p><p>Once these bad actors gain access to the device, they're able to use the victim's personal data for financial gain. The text message access of this malware campaign is especially heinous. It potentially provides these malicious actors with OTPs, or one-time passwords, that are often required by banks and other financial institutions to verify a user's access.</p><p>Zimperium researchers say that they have been tracking this SMS stealer campaign for nearly two and a half years. Over that time period, researchers say they have seen "over 107,000 malware samples" connected to the campaign, showing how the bad actors behind this malicious software have been constantly updating their campaign so it stays effective.</p><p>And it seems like these hackers have found success.</p><p>Researchers claim that the SMS stealer campaign has claimed victims in 113 countries. The majority of the victims appear to be in India and Russia. However, there are also a significant number of victims in Brazil, Mexico, the United States, Ukraine, and Spain.</p><p>Android users should be aware of this malicious campaign and beware of any download links promising free app downloads.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/amazon-prime-day" target="_self">Prime Day</a> graced us with fantastic deals in mid-July, but sadly we now have to wait (and cross our fingers) for <a href="https://mashable.com/article/when-is-the-next-prime-day-2024" target="_self">a Prime Day sequel</a> come October. However, if you missed out on the sale, you can still shop a handful of Prime Day holdouts. And if you're in the market for a new TV, one of our favorite Prime Day TV deals is still available.</p><p>The <a href="https://zdcs.link/6XWl3?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Insignia%2032-inch%20HD%20Fire%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=03rjEh7fPyBsGwaHPXivYkc&short_url=6XWl3&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Insignia 32-inch HD Fire TV</a> is just $79.99 at Amazon, marked down from the usual price of $129.99. That's a 38% discount or a savings of $50. It's also the <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B09ZLTMWWH" target="_blank">lowest</a> price we've ever seen at Amazon. To make things even more interesting, this TV is actually listed for sale on Amazon by Best Buy (yes, you can buy Best Buy products through Amazon). </p><p>With a sale price of under $80, the 32-inch Insignia HD Fire TV is pretty unbeatable when it comes to price, but it also does well in terms of performance. With 720p resolution, your shows will look crisp and clear. While it's not top-of-the-line, the affordable price still makes this TV a solid option, especially if you're shopping for an extra TV for the garage, kitchen, or a kids' bedroom.</p><p>It also comes with an Alexa Voice remote, so you can speak commands instead of entering them into the remote. Alexa will be able to locate and launch your desired show or movie after you've told her what you'd like to watch. As we've come to expect from a smart TV, you can stream your favorites from Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, and more on the Insignia TV. Plus, you can use it as a gaming monitor.</p><p>Hurry to snag the <a href="https://zdcs.link/6XWl3?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Insignia%2032-inch%20HD%20Fire%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=03rjEh7fPyBsGwaHPXivYkc&short_url=6XWl3&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Insignia 32-inch HD Fire TV</a> while it's on sale for just $79.99.

<p>Influencer Sofia Elizabeth shared a TikTok video about <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sofiaelizabethsbackup/video/7396548656918465838" target="_blank">changing her dating app location to the Olympic Village</a> &mdash; it's <a href="https://olympics.com/en/paris-2024/the-games/village" target="_blank">located</a> north of Paris across Saint-Denis, Saint Ouen, and L'&Icirc;le-Saint-Denis. She later clarified that <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sofiaelizabethsbackup/video/7396939864530275630" target="_blank">she did so on Hinge</a> because changing your location on that app is free (<a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-change-location-tinder-bumble-hinge-travel" target="_self">unlike on Tinder and Bumble</a>). </p><p>"Whoever said to change your location to the 'Olympic Village' currently in Paris to match with an Olympian, I just wanna thank you from the bottom of my heart," she said in a video with over 16 million views as of publication. She didn't respond to Mashable's request for comment, and Hinge declined to comment.</p><p>While this is a tactic for singles watching the Olympics at home, some Olympians themselves are indeed on dating apps during the games. Emily Delleman, rower for Team USA, posted a TikTok about her experience <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@happydelly/video/7395643135092657454" target="_blank">Tinder swiping at the Olympic Village</a>. </p><p>Delleman, who didn't respond to Mashable's request for comment, said in her video she had downloaded Tinder for the first time in years. She added that Tinder was "hyping up" matching with athletes on the App Store &mdash; which is indeed the case:</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Delleman made it clear on her profile that she was an Olympian &mdash; but unlike Elizabeth, didn't have luck matching with fellow athletes.</p><p>"So far I think I've seen a total of two other Olympians," Delleman said. Given that Tinder was a bust, she said she searched for "other forms of entertainment" &mdash; like TikTok. </p><p>Tinder told Mashable that in July, there's been an almost 20 percent increase in swipes in France, and a 103 percent increase in <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-change-location-tinder-bumble-hinge-travel" target="_self">Passport Mode</a> (a paid feature to change your location) to sites like Paris. The U.S., Brazil, and Turkey are the top origin countries where daters are using Passport Mode to change their location to France.</p><p>In Paris, Tinder says there's been a 52 percent jump in the number of users with "Olympian" as their job description, and a 43 percent in "athlete." </p><p>The Olympic Village will accommodate <a href="https://olympics.com/en/paris-2024/the-games/village" target="_blank">14,250 athletes</a> during the Olympic Games, and 8,000 during the Paralympic Games.</p><p>And if all goes well, Elizabeth said, you can fly to Paris to meet your match "and see their <a href="https://mashable.com/article/olympics-cardboard-beds-tiktok-us-rugby" target="_self">cardboard beds</a> in-person."</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This lines up exactly with <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1792223282361680169" target="_blank">predictions</a> Apple reporter Ming-Chi Kuo made about the iPhone 16's color palette back in May. As such, it's reasonable to believe these will be the iPhone 16 colors when it drops later this year.</p><p>However, colors aren't the only interesting thing happening here. The iPhones in Dickson's photo all have vertically oriented dual-camera bumps, a notable departure from the diagonally oriented bumps on the iPhone 15. It's not a monumental alteration by any means, but it's worth noting, nonetheless.</p><p>As always, keep your grain of salt handy; this is an unconfirmed leak. We expect Apple to lift the veil off the new iPhones in early September.</p>]]></content:encoded>

   <em><strong>UPDATE: Jul. 31, 2024, 9:11 a.m. EDT </strong>This piece has been updated with a statement from Meta.</em>
</p>
<p>Some social media influencers on Facebook and Instagram are now dealing with a growing new problem on Meta-owned platforms: extortion.</p><p>According to a new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-30/meta-copyright-tool-is-exploited-in-middle-east-by-extortionists" target="_blank"><em><u>Bloomberg</u></em></a><em>, </em>scammers are now issuing copyright takedowns on Facebook and Instagram content that they do not own &mdash; and they're doing it with Meta's own rights management tool that is meant to help protect creators' work.</p><p>Malicious actors are seeking to coerce influencers out of thousands of dollars, sometimes demanding recurring payments, to prevent future illegitimate takedowns from occurring.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

            Crypto scam victims are being scammed double by fake law firms, FBI warns
            <svg class="inline-block ml-1 w-4 h-4 font-normal fill-current"><use href="https://mashable.com/images/icons/spritemap.svg#sprite-arrow-right-thin"></use></svg>
        </a>
    </div>
<h2>Extorting influencers with Meta's own tools</h2><p>The new report from <em>Bloomberg</em> focuses on social media influencers in the Middle East who are finding that their content is being taken down through Meta's rights management tool over nonexistent copyright issues. When these content creators reached out to the contact that issued the takedown through Meta's system, the scammer behind the copyright strike admitted that there was no actual copyright issue &mdash; and then attempted to extort them.</p><p>This fraudulent practice seems to be growing on social media platforms, so scammers are likely finding success in their fake copyright scheme.&nbsp;</p><p>One influencer from Iraq shared that the scammer offered to restore the content that they took down for $3,000. Furthermore, the scammer offered to stop issuing fraudulent takedown requests on his content for a recurring payment of $1,000 per month or an upfront payment of $7,000 per year.</p><p>Scammers have long attempted to weaponize copyright to extort money out of Facebook users. However, most attempts could often be ignored as they typically consisted of a <a href="https://cybernews.com/security/facebook-users-targeted-copyright-infringement-scam/" target="_blank"><u>phishing email</u></a> pretending to be from the company.</p><p>However, more resourceful scammers are now gaining access to the Meta rights manager, a tool that requires approval from Meta, through black markets selling access. Using this tool, users aren't extorted with the threat of a copyright takedown; the takedown occurs, which presumably makes extortion much easier.  </p><p>&ldquo;Our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/copyrights_terms" target="_blank"><u>Rights Manager Terms</u></a>&nbsp;strictly prohibit users from uploading other people's content and claiming it as their own, and we routinely revoke access or disable accounts when we identify cases of misuse," a Meta spokesperson said in a statement provided to Mashable. "Our Rights Manager tools are global, and we invest heavily in them so people around the world can protect their rights and manage their content at scale. We continue to encourage people to report these issues so we can investigate and take action.&rdquo;<em> </em></p><h2>Fraudulent copyright takedowns are becoming a bigger issue across social media</h2><p>Content creators often have to deal with bad actors ripping their work from online platforms and uploading it as their own. Oftentimes, these individuals monetize this content, essentially stealing money from the original creators.</p><p>To help fight this, many platforms over the years have rolled out rights management and copyright tools for big content creators and companies. Essentially, these tools help creators take a proactive approach by establishing ownership over specific pieces of content. From there, these creators can issue takedowns when uploads of their content are detected on social media platforms.</p><p>However, scammers have discovered that they can utilize these tools, but uploading stolen content as their own, so the platform then wrongly establishes the thief as the legitimate owner.</p><p>And it's not only happening on Meta-owned platforms. This has unfortunately been a fairly common <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/youtube-strikes-now-being-used-as-scammers-extortion-tool/" target="_blank"><u>practice</u></a> on YouTube through the platform's own copyright management tool for creators.</p><p>One specific incident regarding fake copyright claims on music on YouTube highlights how lucrative this scheme is becoming for these con artists. As Mashable <a href="https://mashable.com/article/youtube-copyright-royalties-heist" target="_self"><u>reported</u></a> in 2022, two scammers were able to steal more than $23 million by simply claiming songs that they had nothing to do with through YouTube's Content ID system.</p><p>With the incentive in place for scammers, this exposure to abuse may worsen until social media platforms get better at weeding these bad actors out of their copyright management tools.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you haven&rsquo;t heard of smart bulbs, let us introduce you to the future of lighting. The Kasa smart light bulbs (4-pack) do so much more than turn on and off. They can cycle through 16 million colors, be set to a specific hue, and even turn on and off via voice commands (with a compatible device like an Amazon Echo or Google Home). </p><p>The best thing about these bulbs is that you don&rsquo;t need a smart home hub to use them &mdash; all you need is a WiFi connection and the free Kasa app. Once you've installed the app and connected the bulbs, you&rsquo;re ready to go.</p><p>With the app, you can set schedules for when the lights turn on and off, dim them, and group multiple bulbs together. Plus, they come with a two-year warranty if anything goes wrong. </p><h3>More smart light bulb deals</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/ZRZ2P?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=TP-Link%20Tapo%20smart%20light%20bulbs%20%284-pack%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=01hrpirroH3XEftPqH7Rca7&short_url=ZRZ2P&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">TP-Link Tapo smart light bulbs (4-pack)</a> &mdash; <strong>$21.99 </strong><s>$25.99</s> (save $4)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/BdvjV?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Sengled%20color-changing%20light%20bulb%20%284-pack%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=01hrpirroH3XEftPqH7Rca7&short_url=BdvjV&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Sengled color-changing light bulb (4-pack)</a> &mdash; <strong>$22.99 </strong><s>$29.99</s> (save $7)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/5MoZ5?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Govee%20smart%20light%20bulbs%20%284-pack%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=01hrpirroH3XEftPqH7Rca7&short_url=5MoZ5&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Govee smart light bulbs (4-pack)</a> &mdash; <strong>$24.99 </strong><s>$34.99</s> (save $10) </p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/0P65A?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=LIFX%20color%20smart%20LED%20bulb&object_type=article&object_uuid=01hrpirroH3XEftPqH7Rca7&short_url=0P65A&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">LIFX color smart LED bulb</a> &mdash; <strong>$31 </strong><s>$39.99</s> (save $8.99)</p></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Olympic match mirrored a pivotal scene in the beloved volleyball manga in which Team Japan squared off against Team Argentina in the Olympic finals. The moment was only alluded to in the manga, which saw Karasuno High duo Hinata and Kageyama, for Team Japan, face off against their longtime rival Oikawa (playing for Argentina). While the winner of said Olympic match was never revealed on the page, some fans like to believe that setter Oikawa came out on top. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>If you've been watching the games in Paris, you may have noticed athletes and fans alike decked out in personal air conditioners. Europeans might turn up their noses at air conditioning, but we say there's no shame in staying cool. (Paris famously chose <em>not </em>to provide <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/06/24/nx-s1-5017544/paris-olympics-air-conditioning-usa" target="_blank">air conditioning for athlete housing</a>, a decision they may be regretting in the midst of a totally predictable heat wave.)</p><p>What are personal air conditioners? These wearable gadgets help cool you down in a flash. They range from simple neck fans to $200 personal cooling appliances. And you don't have to be sweltering in the Paris heat to score one. You can bring one home from Amazon right now for up to 25% off. </p><p>As of July 31, you can save big on several personal air conditioners at Amazon. One of our favorite picks is the <a href="https://zdcs.link/weol6?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Sweetfull%20Portable%20Neck%20Fan&object_type=article&object_uuid=0781kOwgxGcvGdfYi1Wgfap&short_url=weol6&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Sweetfull Portable Neck Fan</a>. It's just $22.99 right now, which is down from its original price of $29.99. That's a discount of 23% and $7 off. </p><p>This wearable neck fan looks like a pair of headphones, but it's a bladeless fan that promises to cool you down by 70% without any wires or cords. Its fan runs for 4 to 9 hours on its 4000 mAh rechargeable battery, and it's  quiet as well, so you won't walk around all day sounding like a box fan. It's also just 8.5 ounces, so it won't give you neck pain at the cost of being cool and comfortable. </p><p>For people who run <em>really </em>hot, several premium Torras personal air conditioners are also on sale right now. So, when you can't stay inside to enjoy that sweet, sweet air conditioning, a personal air conditioner can help. </p><h3><strong>More personal air conditioners on sale now: </strong></h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/0P6j3?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Jisulife%20Portable%20Neck%20Fan&object_type=article&object_uuid=0781kOwgxGcvGdfYi1Wgfap&short_url=0P6j3&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Jisulife Portable Neck Fan</a> &mdash; <strong>$25.99</strong> <s>$31.99</s> (save $6)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/oe2B6?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Torras%20Coolify%20Portable%20Neck%20Fan&object_type=article&object_uuid=0781kOwgxGcvGdfYi1Wgfap&short_url=oe2B6&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Torras Coolify Portable Neck Fan</a> &mdash; <strong>$59.99</strong> <s>$79.99</s> (save $20)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/lVGlN?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Torras%202024%20Portable%20Neck%20Air%20Conditioner&object_type=article&object_uuid=0781kOwgxGcvGdfYi1Wgfap&short_url=lVGlN&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Torras 2024 Portable Neck Air Conditioner</a> &mdash; <strong>$149</strong> <s>$179</s> (save $30)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/MVwEm?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Torras%20Cyber%20Ultimate%20Neck%20Air%20Conditioner&object_type=article&object_uuid=0781kOwgxGcvGdfYi1Wgfap&short_url=MVwEm&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Torras Cyber Ultimate Neck Air Conditioner</a> &mdash; <strong>$264</strong> <s>$279</s> (save $15 with on-page coupon)</p></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://mashable.com/category/portable-speakers" target="_self">Bluetooth speakers</a> are the unsung heroes of summer adventures, from backyard barbecues to beach days. These nifty little gadgets make it easy to create your own soundtrack wherever you go, but they can get expensive &mdash; unless you find a killer deal. </p><p>As of July 31, you can get a <a href="https://zdcs.link/1vnmA?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Bose%20SoundLink%20Flex%20Bluetooth%20speaker&object_type=article&object_uuid=001m0obIXtU75h0XYNzFZTo&short_url=1vnmA&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Bose SoundLink Flex Bluetooth speaker</a> for just $109 at Amazon. That&rsquo;s $40 off the listing price and the lowest price we&rsquo;ve seen this speaker go for at Amazon, per price trackers like <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B099TJGJ91" target="_blank">CamelCamelCamel</a>. (Select colors of this speaker were briefly priced at $99.99 during Prime Day and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/july-8-bose-soundlink-flex-speaker-deal" target="_self">Target Circle Week</a>, but that deal didn't last long.)</p><p>The SoundLink Flex is one of Bose&rsquo;s best portable speakers, and a way better option when compared to the <a href="https://zdcs.link/0P6qN?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Bose%20SounLink%20Max&object_type=article&object_uuid=001m0obIXtU75h0XYNzFZTo&short_url=0P6qN&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Bose SounLink Max</a>, at least <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bose/comments/1df21yt/the_bose_soundlink_flex_is_better_than_the_bose/" target="_blank">according to Reddit</a>. We've also tested out this speaker, and it offers big sound and easy connectivity. Not only is it fully waterproof, but it can even float. It's also dust-proof and resistant to corrosion and UV light, making it the ideal summer companion. It also comes in a variety of colors, but the black model is the cheapest at $109. You can get other colors, like white smoke or stone blue, for $119.</p><p>This speaker is small enough to throw in your duffle but powerful enough to fill a room or outdoor space with crisp, immersive audio. You can also connect it to your phone to make and answer calls hands-free. With up to 12 hours of playtime per charge, you&rsquo;ll be able to keep the tunes going all day long &ndash;&nbsp;or until your neighbors complain, whichever comes first.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[Google Search results should limit nonconsensual deepfake imagery.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/008oW0wYwLWWL7rkglmhBYy/hero-image.jpg" alt="Laptop with Google Search pulled up. "><p>The explosion of nonconsensual deepfake imagery online in the past year, particularly of female celebrities, has presented a difficult challenge for search engines. Even if someone isn't looking for that material, searching for certain names can yield a shocking number of links to fake explicit photos and videos of that individual.  </p><p><a href="https://mashable.com/category/google" target="_self">Google</a> is trying to tackle that problem with an update to its ranking systems, the company announced in a <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/google-search-explicit-deep-fake-content-update/" target="_blank">blog post</a>. </p><p>Google product manager Emma Higham wrote in the post that the ranking updates are designed to lower explicit fake content for many searches. </p><p>When someone uses terms to seek out nonconsensual deepfakes of specific individuals, the ranking system will attempt to instead provide "high-quality, non-explicit content," such as news articles, when it's available. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

    </div>
<p>"With these changes, people can read about the impact deepfakes are having on society, rather than see pages with actual nonconsensual fake images," Higham wrote.</p><p>The ranking updates have already decreased exposure to explicit image results on deepfake searches by 70 percent, according to Higham.  </p><p>Google is also aiming to downrank explicit deepfake content, though Higham noted that it can be difficult to distinguish between content that is real and consensual, such as an actor's nude scenes, and material generated by artificial intelligence, without an actor's consent. </p><p>To help spot deepfake content, Google is now factoring into its ranking whether a site's pages have been removed from Search under the company's policies. Sites with a high volume of removals for fake explicit imagery will now be demoted in Search. </p><p>Additionally, Google is updating systems that handle requests for removing nonconsensual deepfakes from Search. The changes should make the request process easier. </p><p>When a victim is able to remove deepfakes of themselves from Google Search, the company's systems will aim to filter all related results on similar searches about them, and scan and remove duplicates of that imagery. </p><p>Higham acknowledged that there's "more work to do," and that Google would continue developing "new solutions" to help people affected by nonconsensual deepfakes.</p><p>Google's announcement comes two months after the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/biden-calls-on-tech-companies-to-stop-deepfakes" target="_self">White House called on tech companies</a> to stop the spread of explicit deepfake imagery.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The game is all about finding the "common threads between words." And just like <em>Wordle</em>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-20-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> resets after midnight and each new set of words gets trickier and trickier&mdash;so we've served up some hints and tips to get you over the hurdle.</p><p>If you just want to be told today's puzzle, you can jump to the end of this article for July 31's <em>Connections</em> solution. But if you'd rather solve it yourself, keep reading for some clues, tips, and strategies to assist you.</p><h2>What is Connections?</h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. Like <em>Wordle, </em>you can share the results with your friends on social media.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Earlier this week, Pizza Hut announced that customers in Hong Kong and Macao can have pineapple added to their pizzas free of charge until July 31.&nbsp;</p><p>"If you are a foodie, choose the Italian style and add pineapple," <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pizzahut.hk/posts/893578779475489" target="_blank">Pizza Hut Hong Kong &amp; Monaco wrote on Facebook (translated via Google Translate).</a> "Or add Hawaiian style with pineapple, starting from $139 [$US18]!"</p><p>The post was accompanied by a graphic showing a fencer with three pineapple rings threaded on their sword.</p><div class="facebook-embed text-center mb-4">

<p>Pizza Hut's promotion seems specifically designed to rile up Italians by ostensibly ruining one of their most famous dishes. <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/pineapple-pizza-italy-naples/index.html" target="_blank">Pineapple on pizza</a> has long been a controversial topping, with many considering it tantamount to sacrilege (<a href="https://en.pizzadixit.com/do-italians-really-hate-pineapple-pizza-no-i-dont-think-so-heres-why/" target="_blank">albeit typically in a joking manner</a>).</p><p>However, this lighthearted potshot didn't come out of nowhere. Pizza Hut's pineapple promotion came hot on the heels of Hong Kong defeating Italy in fencing for gold at Paris, responding to the latter's poor reaction to the loss.</p><h2>The Olympic fencing controversy between Hong Kong and Italy</h2><p>On Monday, at Paris' Grand Palais, Hong Kong fencer Ka Long Cheung defeated Italy's Filippo Macchi to win the 2024 Olympic gold medal in the men's fencing individual foil event. <a href="https://olympics.com/en/news/paris-2024-fencing-hong-kong-china-cheung-ka-long-olympic-champion-mens-foil-individual" target="_blank">The close bout ended with a score of 15-14</a> after going to sudden death, with Macchi putting up an impressive fight against the defending champion at his first ever Olympic Games. There were even two moments where the judges had to review video footage to determine whether the winning 15th point had been scored, though no point was awarded both times. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Cheung eventually emerged victorious after a video review of a third contentious point was ruled in his favour. Unfortunately, both Cheung's gold and Macchi's silver have been marred by what appears to be some rather poor sportsmanship. </p><p>Shortly after the match, <a href="https://federscherma.it/giochi-olimpici-parigi-2024-arbitraggio-inaccettabile-la-federazione-italiana-scherma-inoltra-una-protesta-ufficiale-per-loro-negato-a-filippo-macchi/" target="_blank">the Italian Fencing Federation (IFF) announced it was filing a formal protest</a> against the results with the F&eacute;d&eacute;ration Internationale d'Escrime (the governing body of Olympic fencing) and the International Olympic Committee. In particular, the IFF took issue with the referees' home countries of Taipei and South Korea, alleging that they were too close geographically to Hong Kong to arbitrate fairly. </p><p>This seems a strange argument considering that the entire history of international conflict suggests physical proximity bears little relation to whether countries actually like each other.

<p>"Filippo Macchi is the real winner and he was denied a gold he deserved," said IFF president Paolo Azzi in a statement (translated via Google Translate). "The selection of referees is a problem but the level of refereeing was below the great final we saw."</p><p>The gold medal match was refereed by Huang Hao-Chih from Taipei, with Suh Sangwon of South Korea acting as the video referee. Ayoub Ferjani from Tunisia and Vilem Madr from the Czech Republic served as assistant referees. These four judges had previously refereed <a href="https://www.eurosport.com/olympics/sport/fencing/event/men-foil-individual/match/fem001202/" target="_blank">Macchi's 15-11 semi-final win against U.S. fencer Nick Itkin</a>, albeit with Ferjani and Huang acting as referee and video referee respectively. </p><p>Macchi's quarter-final win against Egypt's Mohamed Hamza was also overseen by Madr and Tim Claus Bardenhagen, whose respective home countries of the Czech Republic and Germany are notably closer to Italy than Egypt.&nbsp;</p><p>The IFF did not raise any objection to the choice of referees in either of these previous matches.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Italy's apparent sore loser behaviour wasn't confined to IFF officials. People from both Italy and Hong Kong quickly took to social media to insult the opposing athletes, the match referees, and each other. Such comments have ranged from sharing offensive food combinations to more aggressive and mean-spirited attacks.</p><p>It isn't all vitriol, though. While Macchi, Cheung, and the judges' Instagram comment sections still contain mean-spirited posts, there are many congratulatory and appreciative sentiments as well. </p><p>For his part, Macchi is leading by example by accepting his Olympic silver medal with class and grace. The Italian fencer acknowledged fans who felt he'd been robbed of gold, but said he considered himself fortunate to have come in second.</p><blockquote class="mx-auto instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/C-Chpkhs6Yw/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="12" style=" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin-top: 1px; margin-bottom:1px; max-width:540px; min-width:326px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);">

<p>"I&rsquo;ve heard of all kinds, they robbed you, outrageous arbitration, it&rsquo;s a shame,"&nbsp; <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C-Chpkhs6Yw/" target="_blank">Macchi wrote in a post on Instagram (translated via Instagram)</a>. "Yet I'm reminded that I'm one lucky guy. I'm 22, a beautiful family, amazing friends, and a girlfriend that constantly leaves me speechless.&nbsp;</p><p>"I came second in the most important competition for any athlete playing a sport, and because I play this sport I learned that referee decisions must be respected, always! I know both referees, I don&rsquo;t feel like pointing a finger at them and blaming them for my lack of success even because it would lead to nothing but creating an alibi for me. What has happened is in the past, now it is gone, what will happen in the future is up to me!"</p><p>Macchi's mature response appears to have earned him the respect of many, whether they're from Hong Kong or elsewhere. Fortunately, the men's fencing individual foil wasn't his only chance of winning gold at the Paris Olympics. The Italian fencer is currently scheduled to compete against Poland in the men's foil team quarter-finals next week. He'll no doubt have quite a few more people cheering for him now.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA["Shelby Oaks," the first film from YouTube reviewer Chris Stuckmann, includes influences ranging from "The Blair Witch Project" to "Barbarian."]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00VzU5sMyQVHpJ4uhEAMozU/hero-image.jpg" alt="A woman holds out a photograph in "Shelby Oaks.""><p>Can a great horror movie be Frankensteined together from a laundry list of iconic ones? That's what I'm left pondering after watching <em>Shelby Oaks</em>, the promising and oft unnerving but also somewhat scattered first feature from popular YouTube movie reviewer Chris Stuckmann.</p><p>The movie starts out convincing you it's one thing, but reveals itself in quick succession to be a very different beast altogether. From <em>The Blair Witch Project</em> to <em>Martyrs</em> to <em>Barbarian</em> and several beyond that, <em>Shelby Oaks</em> doesn't just wear its many genre influences on its sleeves &mdash;&nbsp;it wears them on its chest and back and shoulders. It's a coat of many horror movies, made of cuts deep and broad. And, to ever so slightly belabor the metaphor, some of the coat fits just right, while as much of it could use some more refined tailoring.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, as far as Kickstarter-funded first features go, <em>Shelby Oaks</em> is a big, bold swing &mdash; albeit one produced by horror honcho Mike Flanagan, the man behind a swath of Netflix horror miniseries like <a href="https://mashable.com/article/haunting-hill-house-domestic-horror-love" target="_self"><em>The Haunting of Hill House</em></a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-fall-of-the-house-of-usher-review" target="_self"><em>The Fall of the House of Usher</em></a>. It's twisty as hell, bears some ace performances, and truly gifts audiences with some very sticky and very spooky images. Most of all, it marks the emergence of a horror filmmaker worth keeping an eye on.&nbsp;</p><h2>Shelby Oaks blends The Blair Witch Project with Lake Mungo &mdash; and that's just the start.</h2><p>"Who took Riley Brennan?" is the question at the heart of <em>Shelby Oaks.</em> The film opens with the last known bit of footage of Riley Brennan (Sarah Durn), YouTuber/ghost hunter, before she went missing in the titular town. In the scene, she sits on a bed in a cabin in the middle of the woods. She's seen sobbing, absolutely terrified, saying into the camera, "I'm so scared."</p><p>It's an inch-long leap from Riley's tearful lament to Heather Donahue's legendarily snotty apologia in <em>The Blair Witch Project,</em> the one that poetically stated, "I'm scared to close my eyes, and I'm scared to open them."</p><p>Writer-director Stuckmann anticipates his horror-loving audience will make this connection. But then he does something really interesting, pivoting from the found-footage conceit to a true-crime documentary framework. Leaping to a decade or so after Riley's disappearance, it turns out that Riley's older sister, Mia (Camille Sullivan), has spent the intervening years fruitlessly searching for the truth of what happened in the woods of Shelby Oaks that night. And she's now starring in a true-crime documentary in an effort to reignite interest in the case of her missing sister.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For horror fanatics, this turn might well recall <em>Lake Mungo</em>. Told via talking-head interviews with the family of the missing blonde girl at its center, the 2008 Australian horror film unfurls its paranormal revelations piecemeal through conversations and scattered bits of phone video. <em>Lake Mungo</em> is admittedly a deeper cut than <em>The Blair Witch Project, </em>but no sooner does <em>Shelby Oaks </em>settle into this faux-documentary conceit than Stuckmann pivots again to a straightforward narrative film. Well, it's as straightforward as the twisty likes of <em>Hereditary </em>or <em>Barbarian.</em></p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Essentially, <em>Shelby Oaks </em>maintains its cast, but ditches the documentary framework altogether, showing us what is "really" happening &mdash; but through artifice, forcing us to question what is real. The camerawork becomes stylized, with special effects and slow motion and close-ups; an aggressive and manipulative score takes over. The film will shift from these narrative scenes to the documentary setup to found footage and back again, maximizing this sense of narrative disquiet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>These structural sleights of hands, like all good and proper rug-pullings, are where <em>Shelby Oaks</em> works its greatest magic. Playing on the expectations of horror diehards, Stuckmann manages to keep us on our toes, even discombobulated. We find ourselves switching between missing-person found footage to the cult horror of <em>Hereditary</em> with the twists and turns (and hidden underground caverns) of <em>Martyrs</em> and <em>Barbarian</em>, and then right back to a talking-head true-crime doc on a dime. This all builds up its own sort of disassociation within the experience of watching it.&nbsp;</p><h2>Shelby Oaks is a hodgepodge of horror, from found footage to Satanic panic.</h2><p>Despite these daring shifts, <em>Shelby Oaks</em> begins to feel more like the parts of its sum and not vice versa. Stuckmann is motioning toward all of these other movies to unmoor us, but those references often distract from the actual plot and, in turn, undermine our investment in it. For instance, the casting of&nbsp;Brendan Sexton III as Mia's husband proves distracting, even though he's terrific. An actor who's been killing it since Todd Solondz's 1995 hit, <em>Welcome to the Dollhouse</em>, Sexton turns in yet another lovely, sad piece of work here. But you set him against multiple scenes that take place inside of a haunted prison, and now all I'm thinking about is <em>Session 9</em>, Brad Anderson's fantastically creepy 2001 haunted prison movie, where Sexton made a mark as one of the asbestos cleaners who found himself on the wrong end of some rusty psychiatric equipment.</p><p>To what end is this? At what point do these Easter eggs overwhelm? All these allusions ultimately get in the way of <em>Shelby Oaks </em>standing on its own and becoming truly, deeply scary. Stuckmann seems very aware of the exact moment when his scares are supposed to land, often to the point of self-consciousness. You could set a timer to when the thing you're supposed to be dreading will appear, and the dreaded thing will stick that mark every time. There are moments when a zag would've kicked the ass of a zig, but Stuckmann keeps on zigging, playing right into horror connoisseur expectations. There is real, earned tension, but the film keeps deflating itself despite the fun of its reality-shifting and the many excellent go-for-broke performances therein.&nbsp;</p><h2>Camille Sullivan leads a cast that fights valiantly for Shelby Oaks.&nbsp;</h2><p>An actor who's been nipping at the edges of recognition for two decades, appearing in TV shows from <em>Dark Angel </em>to <em>The Man in the High Castle</em>, Camille Sullivan has long proven a reliable performer. And here at last she is given the spotlight to make the most of it.&nbsp;</p><p>Even when Mia starts doing incredibly stupid things that put her right in harm's way, Sullivan is genuinely devastating. She sells the hell out of bad choices, making it clear that Mia's a person who would go to any lengths to uncover what happened to her beloved sister. (And as long as we're talking references, besides this being the lead's arc in that French Extremity classic <em>Martyrs,</em> it's straight out of the terrifying 1988 Dutch thriller <em>The Vanishing</em>,<em> </em>too.)&nbsp;</p><p>Sullivan nails big action moments, like emotional blowups and freak-outs in which her palpable fright is legitimately difficult to look at. But even the small moments give her opportunities to send shivers. Just watch the way the flashlight trembles in her hand as she investigates that haunted prison, a subtle shift in body language that communicates a bone-deep terror. It's those touches that carry the audience alongside Mia the entire way.&nbsp;</p><p>Sarah Durn is also haunting as missing girl Riley, who has to sell her undoing while staring off into space during the "naturalistic" found-footage portions of this movie. These are scenes we keep coming back to to see more of as, natch, more footage gets found, and her haunted presence diffuses into every corner of the film. As we know from decades of subpar found-footage movies, it's not easy, this high-wire balancing act of giving a relaxed and unprofessional-seeming performance under those constraints. Loads have failed spectacularly. But Durn makes us understand why her sister won't let her go even as everyone else has long given up. She makes Riley our ghost, too.</p><p>The whole ensemble expertly submerges into the multiple realities of this story. Even if Stuckmann needs to get a little bit out of his own way in some other areas, he proves to be terrific with his performers. Sullivan and Sexton share some very moving moments together as they watch their marriage crumble in the face of tragedy. Michael Beach wears a bone-deep exhaustion in his performance as the main detective on the case, giving a lived-in sense of resignation at the system's endless failures. And Keith David (the deep-voiced legend from <em>The Thing</em> and <em>They Live</em>, among many) shows up to Keith David it out of the park, playing the former warden of that haunted prison who has seen some shit and who, in typical fashion, is going to colorfully monologue to you all about it.&nbsp;</p><p>But best of all is the great and notoriously underused Robin Bartlett. One of those stalwart character actors with decades of stealing scenes under their belts (she's been doing it since <em>Heaven's Gate</em> in 1980, but I always first think of her hilarious scenes around the dinner table in <em>Inside Llewyn Davis</em> whenever I see her), Bartlett shows up and gives the movie a last-act goose that takes it over the edge into true unhinged horror-movie delight. More I cannot and will not spoil, except to say that yes, this is how you give Robin Bartlett her due. She ends up stealing &mdash; and in so doing, <em>making</em> &mdash; the entire movie.</p><p>Playing like a post-post-modern pastiche, an ouroboros of antecedents, and sometimes just a wicked walk through a nightmare wasteland, <em>Shelby Oaks</em> has enough gas in its tank for 10 movies. That it sometimes feels like 10 movies we've seen before is both part of its weird ballsy charm and its scrappy undoing. In the end, <em>Shelby Oaks </em>is a battle between Stuckmann's many, many inspirations. But the gripping performances and big swings in style make for a movie worth its runtime. Despite its faults, the directorial debut should prove a hell of a calling card for Chris Stuckmann as a new voice in horror. I can't wait to see what he delivers to us next.</p><p><em>Shelby Oaks </em>was reviewed out of the Fantasia International Film Festival.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>For cost-conscious small business owners, college students, freelancers, and other professionals, popular Microsoft Office tools like Word and Excel are essential &mdash; and expensive. That's why finding <a href="https://zdcs.link/3dAnq?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=a%20budget-friendly%2C%20reliable%20productivity%20solution&object_type=article&object_uuid=00qN0N7xZUVFd2Bvsgw3oLq&short_url=3dAnq&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">a budget-friendly, reliable productivity solution</a> is crucial.

With your one-time purchase, once you have Microsoft Office set up on your laptop or desktop, the license never expires.</p><p>One of the most appealing aspects of Microsoft Office 2021 is the substantial cost savings.

<p>Operating in such close orbital proximity to another object is daunting. Many objects in Earth's lower orbit travel at some 7 to 8 kilometers per second (15,660 to 17,895 mph). The company first attempted a fly-around in June, but an anomaly prompted the satellite to abort. "ADRAS-J safely maneuvered away from the upper stage as designed, demonstrating the effectiveness of its on-board collision avoidance system in safely approaching a non-cooperative object," Astroscale said in a statement. </p><p>But as the imagery below shows, the next flybys on July 15 and 16 were successful. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The greater space debris removal mission is part of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency's (JAXA, which is Japan's <a href="https://mashable.com/category/nasa" target="_self">NASA</a> counterpart) "Commercial Removal of Debris Demonstration" project, which seeks a proven way to remove problematic space junk from Earth's orbit. </p><p>"We selected this target because it is a large piece of space debris and there are many similarly shaped (cylindrical) pieces on the [space debris] list," Yamamoto Toru, who leads Japan's commercial removal mission, said in a <a href="https://global.jaxa.jp/activity/pr/jaxas/no092/03.html" target="_blank">statement</a>. "If we are successful, we expect to be able to apply these techniques to the removal of similarly shaped space debris."</p><p>With the reconnaissance now complete, Astroscale will next attempt to capture the debris (using a spacecraft currently under construction) with a robotic arm, and bring the rocket stage down to a lower orbit. Eventually, it will largely burn up in Earth's atmosphere. In the future, the hope among spacefaring nations and commercial space interests is to keep low Earth orbit (LEO) largely clear of threatening <a href="https://mashable.com/article/space-debris-blown-up-satellite" target="_self">space debris</a> &mdash; especially inert craft that can't maneuver on their own.</p><p>"LEO is an orbital space junk yard," NASA explains. "There are <a href="https://mashable.com/article/starlink-spacex-satellites-orbital-debris" target="_self">millions of pieces of space junk</a> flying in LEO. Most orbital debris comprises human-generated objects, such as pieces of spacecraft, tiny flecks of paint from a spacecraft, parts of rockets, satellites that are no longer working, or explosions of objects in orbit flying around in space at high speeds."</p>]]></content:encoded>

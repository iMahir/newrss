Or when a match replies but you&rsquo;re stressing at work and simply don&rsquo;t have the capacity to think of something witty-but-chill-but-hilarious? Well, there&rsquo;s an app for that now.</p><p>Welcome to the world of <a href="https://mashable.com/category/artificial-intelligence" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">AI</a> dating assistant <a href="https://mashable.com/category/apps-software" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">apps</a>. No, this isn't about fake photos or <a href="https://mashable.com/article/openai-gpt-store-girlfriend-bots-chatgpt" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">virtual girlfriends</a>. Instead, apps like Rizz and WingAI are generating opening lines and conversation replies &ndash; all you have to do is upload screenshots of the profiles or messages. You can select different conversation tones from "NSFW" to "casual", and the aim is to remove some of the burden of modern dating.</p><p>Feeling uneasy? Think this marks the end of authenticity in the sorry minefield that is already the online dating scene? That it&rsquo;ll never take off? Well, actually, a 2024 <a href="https://www.flirtini.com/blog/digital-cupid-can-ai-replace-the-human-dating-expert.html" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>report by dating app Flirtini</u></a> shows that a whopping 55 percent of people have already used AI, such as ChatGPT, to generate messages to send to dates. A 2024 <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-gb/consumer-corporate/newsroom/press-releases/press-release.html?news_id=8ed74911-7e0c-407f-8474-4431f8359788" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>study</u> by McAfee</a> shows that over one in four Americans (30 percent of men, 27 percent of women) also already use AI to enhance their dating profile &ndash; the next venture for Rizz and WingAI, and a feature already available on YourMoveAI.</p><h2>Why are people using AI dating assistant apps?</h2><p>So, who&rsquo;s actually using these apps then? Have you been reeled in by AI without knowing? And is it really as creepy as it seems? I speak to regular AI dating app users and other daters to find out whether it&rsquo;s the next frontier of modern dating.&nbsp;</p><p>Artem, a 35-year-old accountant from Miami has been on Rizz for around eight months and uses it to replace pestering the group chat. "My friends are much funnier than me, so I&rsquo;d often workshop clever responses with them for a match," he says. "But obviously, I can&rsquo;t lean on them all the time and the AI app is available 24/7."</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

            Why some people on dating apps just want to be 'pen pals'

<p>As for how it works, for memorable openers he uploads a screenshot of his match&rsquo;s dating profile and chooses the tone of "Rizz" &ndash; a relatively spicy, cheeky mode. The app suggests a selection of opening lines relating to the profile and Artem hits refresh, or adds in key words to focus on, until he finds one that suits. For help with conversations already on the go, he uploads a screenshot of the exchange and receives suggestions for his reply. Artem rarely copies and pastes directly, instead he uses the suggestions to get his own creative juices flowing.</p><p>"The other day it gave me the opening line of, 'If you had a third nipple, where would it be?' which I obviously didn't use, but it got me thinking," he says. "The girl I was talking to had loads of tattoos, so I asked her, 'If you had a tattoo and you could never show anyone, what would it be?'" Another reportedly successful opener &ndash; this time, for a woman who worked for a non-profit &ndash; reads: "Hey, so I'm hosting this charity event next week for people who can't reach orgasm. If you can't cum, please let me know."</p><p>I&rsquo;ll just let that sit for a bit.&nbsp;</p><p>I really did try to keep an open mind, but both of those lines pretty much turned my stomach. The cringe factor is toe curling, obviously, but the sexual innuendo side is just downright uncomfortable &ndash; a consistent problem I noticed when messing about on the apps myself. Practically 99 percent of the suggestions I got were unsendable, and if I&rsquo;d received them from someone else, it&rsquo;d likely be an immediate block . (Notably: "Hey there, amazing mind! Your intellect is arousing, but so is that naughty tongue of yours. <em>wink</em>") The apps claim to be trained with the help of male and female dating coaches, but surely no woman would sign that off?</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Artem insists it pays off with practice, though. His main reason for loving the app is down to <a href="https://mashable.com/article/dating-app-fatigue-has-led-to-a-flurry-of-irl-singles-events" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>dating fatigue</u></a> &ndash; basically burnout and exhaustion from meeting new people and it going nowhere. "There's an element of exhaustion, for sure,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Chatting with one person is cool and fun, but it can be emotionally draining when you end up speaking to five or eight people at once while you try to decide who to choose to focus on." Using Rizz means he can devote less bandwidth to coming up with the kind of clever one-liners that reap success in the Tinder world.</p><p>This echoes a wider sentiment from app daters these days &ndash; that the process has somewhat lost its sheen and is now just a means to an end. A 2024 <a href="https://www.forbes.com/health/dating/dating-app-fatigue/#:~:text=If%20you're%20feeling%20overwhelmed,swiping%20is%20leading%20to%20fatigue." target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>study by Forbes Health</u></a> found that 79 percent of Gen Z report dating app burnout, with women feeling it more at 80 percent compared to 74 percent of males.</p><q>
    "If I have one more, &lsquo;Hey, what's up? How are you?&rsquo; conversation I'm done."
    </q>
<p>That&rsquo;s why Taylor, a 30-year-old vet from Florida, uses WingAI. "If I have one more, &lsquo;Hey, what's up? How are you?&rsquo; conversation I'm done," she says. "Using the app opens the conversation up more, in a fun way. It helps with the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/dating-app-fatigue-has-led-to-a-flurry-of-irl-singles-events" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">fatigue</a> and makes it more interesting."</p><p>Doesn&rsquo;t all of this just create more admin in the dating process, though? Apparently not. "I was already going back and forth on Google, searching for fun openers relating to certain jobs," she says, a method Artem also used to use. Taylor uses WingAI to inspire her first lines on Bumble but, like Artem, always edits the suggestion to make it sound more like her personality. "I don&rsquo;t always like the ideas, but they give me an idea of where to go with it," she says. "I make sure it&rsquo;s a bit of a hybrid between me and the app."</p><p>As for the authenticity of it all, Taylor thinks it&rsquo;s only as inauthentic as the rest of online dating. "Dating on the apps is always fake and superficial to begin with. You match based on what someone looks like and the highly curated persona they put out there," she says. "As long as AI isn&rsquo;t having the entire conversation for you, I don&rsquo;t see the problem."</p><p>It's a fair point. Polishing your profile can take hours, weeks and more friends than you&rsquo;ve had dates. The witty Hinge prompt that sold you on someone could easily be their bezzie mate&rsquo;s humour, not theirs. There are the outright liars to consider, too: According to a recent<a href="https://www.forbes.com/health/dating/dating-app-fatigue/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"> <u>Forbes Health survey</u></a>, close to one in five adults polled claim to lie about their age, with men even more likely to tweak their numbers at 23 percent compared to 19 percentof women. Other reported fibs include income (14 percent), height (12 percent), as well as hobbies and interests (14 percent). Think of all the people paying for premium dating app accounts as well, which offer various leg-ups like sorting your potential matches by who&rsquo;s most likely to be responsive &ndash; whether that&rsquo;s a new member or someone active today.</p><q>
    "If I completely relied on the app suggestions and didn&rsquo;t work in my personality then, yes, it would be an inauthentic representation of myself."
    </q>
<p>Bangalore-based Dhruv, 25, agrees with Taylor. "If I completely relied on the app suggestions and didn&rsquo;t work in my personality then, yes, it would be an inauthentic representation of myself," says the UX designer who&rsquo;s been using <a href="http://DatingAI.pro" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">DatingAI.pro</a> regularly for the past three months. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;d also screw up big time when it comes to actually meeting in-person.&rdquo; He believes you can hardly trick someone into a relationship through using an AI app because texting is such a small part of building that spark &ndash; you have to meet them or speak to them at some point.</p><p>"The app is more about effective initial exchanges and assisting me to be my best self," adds Artem. "Each user is still making the decisions about what to send and what not to send. For every line I use, there might be 12 that I throw away."</p><h2>Are dating AI assistants any good? </h2><p>So how successful is it, actually? Dhruv claims he&rsquo;s already seen drastic results: "I used to receive one to two matches per week, but after using DatingAI I&rsquo;ve started receiving six or seven." This success rate is even higher than the hefty promise WingAI makes of increasing your reply rate by 250 percent. Artem feels like his success has stayed the same, but the app has grown his confidence and lowered his stress levels. He sees no shame in using the app, either. "I'm 35, so when I was in high school dating apps didn&rsquo;t exist and people meeting on the internet was a huge stigma," he continues. "But now the internet and dating on the internet is our default. I don&rsquo;t see why these apps wouldn&rsquo;t become a normal part of the process."</p><p>But what do daters who&rsquo;ve never heard of these apps think of all this? London-based Talia, 31, thought it sounded like a slippery slope in the already confusing dating game at first. "If this becomes the norm, surely it means so much extra time wasted going on dates only to find they&rsquo;re nothing like they came across in their messages?" she says. After more consideration, though, she was thrilled at the prospect of more interesting conversations, but actually testing the apps left her disappointed. "If they gave genuinely good suggestions, I&rsquo;d be all over it.&nbsp;</p><p>I find myself in Talia&rsquo;s camp. Frankly, I&rsquo;m a convert to the actual concept <em>in theor</em>y. But the current offerings just don&rsquo;t hit well enough yet. There&rsquo;s the price point to consider, too: YourMoveAI is &pound;4.99 per week (scaling cheaper per month and year), WingAI and Rizz are flat fees of &pound;6.99 and a whopping &pound;9.99 per week, respectively.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

        </a>
    </div>
<p>And the biggest point of all still looms large: asking a non-sentient computer program that isn&rsquo;t capable of love or sex is simply not the same as asking a friend you know and trust, a real-life person who&rsquo;s actually been on dates before. Plus, could these apps be teaching a whole generation of men with poor flirting or social skills that it&rsquo;s normal to start off conversations with such inappropriate sexual innuendos? And it<em> is</em> mostly men. Rizz members are currently 66 percent male, while <a href="http://YourMove.AI" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">YourMove.AI</a>&rsquo;s rises to 85 percent and <a href="http://DatingAI.pro" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">DatingAI.pro</a> a whopping 99 percent.</p><p>If the apps can get cheaper and better, they could change the dating game. But more women, and perhaps young people who actually have game, need to be brought in to help programme the software. What do women want? Well, it&rsquo;s certainly not to be asked about third nipples.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Well, now you can &mdash; but there are certain caveats. </p><p>The change is noted in <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/120030" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple's new support document</a> (noticed by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/27/apple-music-youtube-music-playlist-transfer/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">MacRumors</a>). According to the document, you have to visit Apple's Data and Privacy page, and there you can request to transfer the playlists that you've created in Apple Music onto YouTube Music. </p><p>To do so, you need to have an active Apple Music or iTunes Match subscription, as well as an active YouTube Music account. </p><p>There are certain limitations, too: You can only transfer the playlists that you've created, which includes collaborative playlists that you own. Music files themselves aren't transferred; non-collaborative shared playlists and curated playlists aren't transferred and folders in which you've organized your Apple Music playlists aren't transferred. Finally, playlists can only include songs available on YouTube Music; if your playlists contain other audio files, such as podcasts, audio books, or files that you've uploaded yourself, these will not be transferred. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Limitations aside, it's nice to be able to move your Apple Music playlists elsewhere, even if it's only to YouTube Music.

Again...OK. And then what? Tell me my tweets suck? I already know that. Or dredge up an old password? OK...me and everyone else who&rsquo;s ever used the internet.</p><p>I scroll TikTok &mdash; primarily for <a href="https://mashable.com/series/airfryday" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">cooking videos</a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nba-indie-music-tiktok-trend-highlights" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">sports memes</a> &mdash; and I know there&rsquo;s been <a href="https://mashable.com/article/tiktok-ban-countries" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">plenty of handwringing</a> over the app's supposed connections to the Chinese government. Do I understand there is a potential for surveillance? Sure. I&rsquo;m well aware of the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/tiktok-china-access-data-in-us" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">reports and research showing the company could access</a> U.S. user data. But honestly, that&rsquo;s just a condition of being alive on the internet and part of modern society.</p><p>TikTok isn&rsquo;t even unique. Do you know who else has access to user data and might improperly share or leak it? Pretty much every other social media company. Here are a few Mashable headlines from the past few years:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/facebook-gave-users-data-5000-third-party-developers" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Facebook admits to improperly giving user data to third-party developers, again.</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/23andme-user-hack" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">23andMe may have suffered yet another breach &ndash; your data is in jeopardy</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/threads-tracking-data" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Threads, Meta's Twitter rival, is tracking you in all sorts of ways</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/twitter-data-breach-elon-musk-january-2023" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">235 million Twitter accounts were leaked in a huge data breach</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/irs-exposed-taxpayer-data" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">The IRS accidentally published some taxpayers' confidential information</a></p></li></ul><p>These are just a few headlines I found with a quick search. Weirdly, the fact that every damn company has access to so much of my data is almost comforting. There&rsquo;s a vast ocean of data out there &mdash; why should mine matter? In other words, we&rsquo;re all part of a big herd, and I&rsquo;m just hoping someone else is the straggler getting picked off by predators.</p><p>And let&rsquo;s be real, even if you do everything right &mdash; if you&rsquo;re super careful about privacy and surveillance &mdash; the IRS might publish your info, or some site might just <a href="https://mashable.com/article/social-security-how-to-find-out-if-you-are-affected" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">leak your stuff anyway</a>.</p><p>I admit this perspective is partly driven by laziness. Maybe I should care more. But preventing surveillance online means being hyper-vigilant, and brother, I am not that. I share without thinking. I'll eat a good slice of pizza and immediately tweet, "I just ate &mdash; like right now, this second &mdash; a great piece of pizza at this exact location," and I&rsquo;ll even drop the longitude and latitude for good measure. I&rsquo;ve never read a single word of a terms of service agreement. I have zero clue which apps are tracking what.</p><p>But I can&rsquo;t be bothered. And I&rsquo;d argue that unless you&rsquo;re a major influencer, a politician, some business leader, or Taylor Swift, you probably don't need to be that bothered either. Some of my more intelligent, more tech-savvy colleagues are probably screaming, "Don't listen to Tim!!!" But most of us aren&rsquo;t important enough to worry about being surveilled. And even if we should care, what in the hell can we do?</p><p>If a weirdo commenter wants to find my personal email address, if a hacker wants to access my data, if a company wants to share my data with advertisers, or if the freaking government of China wants...anything about me, there really isn&rsquo;t much I can do to stop it. If you want to see what I&rsquo;m doing online, knock yourself out. I&rsquo;m just some guy.</p><p>What am I supposed to do? Give up the internet entirely? Yeah, OK.

There's no credit card required to sign up.</p></li><li><p><strong>TunnelBear Unlimited</strong> ($9.99/month, $4.99/month per year, or $3.33/month per three years) unlocks unlimited browsing data, unlimited simultaneous connections, access to its entire server network, the ability to select certain servers on the city level, and priority customer support.</p></li><li><p><strong>TunnelBear Teams </strong>starts at $138/year for businesses with at least two users.</p></li></ul><p>TunnelBear doesn't have a money-back guarantee, unlike many of its peers, and <a href="https://help.tunnelbear.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032170811-How-do-I-get-a-refund-" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>refunds</u></a> are only offered by request on a case-by-case basis.

<p>TunnelBear works on Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, and Chrome. (I tried it on Windows, Mac, and iOS.) That's fewer platforms than much of its competition, but realistically, it covers most users on a smartphone and/or desktop.</p><p>The TunnelBear app is effectively just a posterized world map speckled with yellow, <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>-esque pipes that represent different servers, and when you boot up the app for the first time, a small sheep will be sitting at your physical location. Toggling on the VPN will colorize the map and make the sheep poof into a teensy brown bear, who then digs down and emerges from the pipe at the VPN server location nearest you &mdash; that means you're connected. (In theory, this default server should be the <a href="https://help.tunnelbear.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006976152-Fastest-Tunnel-Have-the-quickest-connection-possible" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>speediest one</u></a> for you since your data doesn't have to travel very far. TunnelBear calls it the "Fastest Tunnel.") If you look closely, you can see the bear look around once he's settled. It's very cute.</p><div class="giphy-embed">

<p>Most things about TunnelBear can be described as cute, which feels like a weird thing to say about a VPN &mdash;&nbsp;a cybersecurity tool. Its website is peppered with bear references ("grizzly details," "a helping paw," lots of "rawrs"). Its bear logo covers its eyes when you type in your password at login. Each of its <a href="https://www.tunnelbear.com/about" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">staff members</a> have bear nicknames and avatars. You can enable bear sound effects on mobile. It would all feel a bit juvenile if most other VPNs weren't so solemn and <em>intense</em>. Online privacy is a serious matter, yes, but let's have some fun with it! What ever happened to fun!!!</p><div class="giphy-embed">

<p>Anyway, that map is pretty much the extent of the TunnelBear interface. The free version lets you switch between servers in different countries, while a paid subscription opens up servers in specific cities worldwide; you can connect to them by clicking on their pipes or by selecting them from a list. TunnelBear maintains servers in over 5,000 locations in 47 countries worldwide, which makes its network on the smaller side from a geographical distribution standpoint. (<a href="https://mashable.com/review/express-vpn-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">ExpressVPN</a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/review/nordvpn" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">NordNPN</a>, two other major VPN providers, have servers in 105 and 111 countries, respectively.) In other words, you've got fewer location-spoofing options.</p><p>The TunnelBear app defaults to an "auto" protocol option that it deems best for you, but you can <a href="https://help.tunnelbear.com/hc/en-us/articles/5907031724443-VPN-Protocol-Choosing-how-you-connect-to-TunnelBear" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">choose between</a> WireGuard, OpenVPN, and IKEv2 in a settings menu. This is also where you'll see options to enable an automatic kill switch called "<a href="https://help.tunnelbear.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006974672-VigilantBear-Strengthen-privacy-when-connecting" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">VigilantBear</a>" and a split tunneling tool called "<a href="https://help.tunnelbear.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007244451-SplitBear-Complete-control-over-your-network-traffic" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">SplitBear</a>." The latter offers varying levels of control depending on your platform: SplitBear for Windows lets you exclude both websites and apps from your VPN connection, for instance, while SplitBear for macOS lets you only exclude sites. There's no multi-hop.</p><p>In my latest roundup of testing, TunnelBear was quick to connect most of the time. Its Mac app often struggled to make an initial connection to my Fastest Server &mdash;&nbsp;sometimes it took a full minute to get me online &mdash; but hopping on a different U.S. server first before going back to the Fastest Tunnel seemed to remedy the issue. I wouldn't put too much stake into this; it wasn't a cross-platform problem and could just be a me/my MacBook quirk.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Browsing with TunnelBear on felt a little pokey no matter which server I was connected to, but that's to be expected with any VPN, and it was never annoying enough to be totally unusable. I was also able to stream YouTube videos and movies on <a href="https://mashable.com/category/disney-plus" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Disney+</a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/category/hbo" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Max</a> without any lagging or stuttering.</p><p>Regional content gave TunnelBear trouble, though. No matter the platform, ITVX showed me a "you're outside the country" error code 01-01 every time I tried watching <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-watch-uk-love-island-itvx-using-vpn" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Love Island UK</em></a> on a TunnelBear UK server in the UK. Don't count on this one for your international streaming needs.</p><p>In TunnelBear's defense, it at least kept my true IP address locked down while I was connected to its server. (It passed multiple DNS leak tests.) It's important to remember that this is the main job of a VPN, and that extras like unblocking geo-restricted content are essentially just bonuses. </p><h2>More on TunnelBear Free</h2><p>A TunnelBear Free plan used to limit you to just 500MB of browsing data per month. TunnelBear's decision to <a href="https://help.tunnelbear.com/hc/en-us/articles/12898871092507-We-re-increasing-our-free-data-limit-" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">raise it</a> to 2GB per month in February 2023 made this tier eons more practical for regular use, but you can still chunk through it in a few hours if you're not careful. I ate through my 2GB in just under four hours by surfing the web, scrolling through social media, and watching some music videos on my Fastest Tunnel, so don't just leave it on and expect it to get you through the month. A TunnelBear rep named "CubCake Bear" told me via email that this tier is meant to "[serve] as a method to try before you buy, or if your need is minimal on a monthly basis."</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>One of the biggest things TunnelBear Free has going for it (besides the obvious "it's free!" part) is that it isn't cluttered with ads. A banner promoting a seasonal discount on Tunnelbear Unlimited did appear across the top of the app at one point during a previous round of testing, but it was subtle and unobtrusive and didn't affect my user experience whatsoever.&nbsp;TunnelBear's rangers have kept this park litter-free.</p><h2>Is TunnelBear trustworthy?</h2><p>TunnelBear has democratized VPNs in two major ways: One, by simplifying the technology itself, and two, by maintaining a <a href="https://www.tunnelbear.com/privacy-policy" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">privacy policy</a> that's extremely easy for a layperson to understand. It uses plain language and mixes in explainers that delve into why certain types of customer data are collected and stored &mdash; the last name on your credit card is used for fraud prevention, for instance &mdash; and it explicitly states that it does not log activity while someone's using the VPN. (It doesn't know who you are, where you connect from, or what you're doing when you're on it.) TunnelBear Free users' monthly data consumption is documented so that the company can enforce its 2GB limit, but they're otherwise protected by the same "no logs" promise.</p><p>For what it's worth, TunnelBear says it doesn't make any money off its free users, either &mdash; by selling their data or otherwise. "Our business is driven solely by our paid subscribers, who help offset the cost to maintain our servers and operate our infrastructure," CubCake Bear told me.</p><p>TunnelBear was the <a href="https://www.tunnelbear.com/blog/tunnelbear_public_security_audit/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">first</a> consumer VPN to publish an <a href="https://www.tunnelbear.com/blog/tunnelbear-completes-6th-annual-independent-security-audit/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">independent security audit</a> back in 2017, and it's completed them every year since. Anyone can view these reports, even those who haven't signed up for an account. TunnelBear also publishes <a href="https://www.tunnelbear.com/blog/tunnelbear-transparency-report-for-2023/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">reports</a> that disclose the government data requests it receives. The latest version details 70 requests between 2021 and 2023, which were mostly "the result of law enforcement authorities seeking to investigate crimes," it said. TunnelBear twice confirmed whether an individual had an account, but never coughed up any browsing data &mdash; because it doesn't have it.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

        </a>
    </div>
<p>As far as I can tell, TunnelBear has avoided amassing any obvious dings on its record in the 13 years since it first hit the market (something I can't say about other <a href="https://mashable.com/review/express-vpn-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">industry</a> <a href="https://mashable.com/review/nordvpn" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">kingpins</a>).

Overall, its record on privacy and transparency is stellar.</p><h2>Is TunnelBear worth it?</h2><p>TunnelBear is a refreshingly approachable VPN service that will win over those who just need a simple, easy-to-use VPN that can run in the background during everyday browsing. It's not quite a Mashable Choice Award winner, but it ranks high among the VPNs I've tested.</p><p>I don't think TunnelBear will feel like a good value to VPN veterans and techies who like to fiddle around with lots of features. Those who need a VPN that can unblock regional content will also need to look elsewhere. For comparison's sake, a <a href="https://zdcs.link/2eK6y?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=NordVPN%20Basic&object_type=review&object_uuid=06JjBP3VKwL7LnFM52mwR0v&short_url=2eK6y&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">NordVPN Basic</a> plan gets you multi-hop, a built-in dark web monitor, an anti-malware/tracker tool, support on more platforms, up to 10 simultaneous connections,&nbsp;and the ability to unblock regional content for the same annual rate as TunnelBear Unlimited.</p><p>But for more inexperienced and casual users, I think there's merit in TunnelBear's simplicity, and especially in its clean record. You should never sacrifice strong privacy practices in favor of extra fixings &mdash;&nbsp;though it would still be really nice if TunnelBear offered multi-hop connections.</p><p>The free version of TunnelBear deserves its own shoutout. Many free VPN providers will log and sell user data to third-party advertisers or bundle their products with malware &mdash; there's that thing about free lunches &mdash;&nbsp;but TunnelBear Free is backed by the same policies and protections as the paid version. While it won't meet the needs of a daily user, it's decent for sparing, situational use and may help you decide whether to invest in a paid plan (or a more feature-rich VPN).</p>]]></content:encoded>

It checks all the right boxes: fast-paced combat, visually stunning environments, and boss fights that demand your full attention. Yet, after clocking 10 hours, it's clear that GameScience's lofty ambitions might be more than they can handle. The game teeters on the edge of greatness, but it&rsquo;s not quite there &mdash; at least not yet.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Performance issues have been a recurring theme in the reviews of <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/black-myth-wukong-dev-warns-of-occasional-serious-issues-on-pc-even-after-multiple-internal-full-process-tests/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">particularly on PC</a>, where other outlets have already raised red flags. I was fortunate to receive a PlayStation code, though it's worth noting that this version was conspicuously absent from the early review cycle before the game&rsquo;s Aug. 20 release. </p><p>Adding to the list of concerns, the game&rsquo;s release came with a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/08/18/the-black-myth-wukong-no-feminist-propaganda-no-covid-19-discussion-email-is-real/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">set of coverage guidelines specifically aimed at content creators </a>&mdash; guidelines that conveniently sidestepped the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-black-myth-wukong-developers-history-of-sexism-is-complicating-its-journey-to-the-west" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">studio&rsquo;s alleged history of sexism</a>. Journalists were left out of this directive, but the very existence of these restrictions left a bad taste, making it hard to separate the game from the kind of weird controversy surrounding its development.</p><p>Despite the outside controversies and the performance stumbles, stepping into the world of <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> was nothing short of a mind-blowing experience. The awe didn't fade, even when combat encounters occasionally tested my patience. While there are a few issues I'll delve into later, there's no denying that <em>Black Myth</em> is a genuine game-of-the-year contender. With just a bit more polish, it could have easily earned its place as a classic of the decade.</p><h2><strong><em>Black Myth: Wukong </em>plot</strong></h2><p>Based on my playthrough so far, Black Myth: Wukong doesn&rsquo;t offer much in the way of a dense narrative. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>You take on the role of The Destined One, a mute monkey who suddenly sets out on a quest to retrieve the six relics of Sun Wukong, the Monkey King. I initially thought this would be a loose adaptation of <em>Journey to the West</em>, but instead, the story begins long after those famous travels, taking place several centuries after the adventures of Sun and Tang Sanzang.</p><p>The game is structured into six chapters, each punctuated by beautifully designed animations that narrate the story of that chapter&rsquo;s main character.</p><p>The moment-to-moment gameplay is rich with environmental storytelling and packed with references to <em>Journey to the West</em>, most of which flew right over my head. My only familiarity with the novel comes from Akira Toriyama's <em>Dragon Ball,</em> which is loosely inspired by it. Yet, even with my limited knowledge of the source material, the game&rsquo;s visually stunning arenas drew me in, making me eager to explore every corner and craft my own little narratives within its beautifully rendered world.</p><p>It&rsquo;s always gratifying to stray off the beaten path and have my curiosity rewarded. While grappling with a particularly stubborn mini-boss, I decided to explore a side area near a checkpoint. This detour led me to an entirely different boss arena where I faced off against the Toad Guai, Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang. This unexpected discovery then guided me to another mini-boss, Guangzhi, whose defeat granted me the in-game abilities I needed to finally conquer the mini-boss that had been giving me so much trouble.</p><h2><strong><em>Black Myth: Wukong </em>gameplay &amp; performance</strong></h2><p>Combat in <em>Black Myth</em> is all about fluidity, with a heavy focus on managing your mana and focus meters. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Mana is used to cast spells like immobilize, which does exactly what it sounds like, and cloud step, a move that creates a misty clone to distract enemies, setting you up for a devastating stealth attack. The focus meter is equally crucial, filling up with quick, light attacks and perfectly timed dodges. </p><p>These focus points can be spent on various combat techniques or to refill your health. The overall combat experience is a twitchy, dodge-centric affair that will feel familiar to Souls fans, but it&rsquo;s also distinctly stylized with wuxia-inspired martial arts, making every encounter feel like a cinematic showdown.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/even-if-black-myth-wukong-isnt-a-soulslike-fromsoftware-has-changed-action-games-forever" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">There&rsquo;s a lot of debate</a> around whether <em>Black Myth</em> can be classified as a Souls-like. On the surface, the combat does follow a familiar formula &mdash; dodge, dodge, attack, dodge &mdash; but the game feels more like a hybrid of several influences. From my experience, <em>Black Myth</em> is a unique fusion, combining elements of FromSoftware&rsquo;s <em>Sekiro</em>, Platinum Games&rsquo; <em>Bayonetta</em>, and the indie cult-favorite <em>Furi</em> into something entirely its own.</p><p><em>Black Myth</em> incorporates some classic elements you&rsquo;d expect from a Souls game &mdash; stamina management and enemies that respawn when you rest at a checkpoint. But it doesn&rsquo;t go full Souls-like on you. Death here is more of a minor setback than a crippling blow, and you&rsquo;re not forced to reclaim lost loot. </p><p>The upgrade system is simpler, too, and it&rsquo;s kept separate from buying other resources, unlike the all-in-one currency system in Souls games. And while Souls-likes are known for their mix of intense boss battles and expansive areas filled with a variety of enemies, <em>Black Myth</em> opts for a different approach, more reminiscent of <em>Furi</em>, where you&rsquo;re thrown from one boss encounter to the next.</p><p><em>Black Myth</em> runs fairly well on the PlayStation 5, but you can tell it&rsquo;s really pushing the hardware. There are noticeable stutters in cutscenes, and textures on the map frequently load in and out, which can be jarring. It&rsquo;s a bit of a trip &mdash; you&rsquo;re taking in the lush forests or vast deserts, and suddenly a frog pops into existence only to disappear moments later. So far, I&rsquo;ve been lucky not to encounter any game-breaking bugs, and even in performance mode, the framerate stays smooth. But these visual hiccups are a reminder that the game is still somewhat poorly optimized.</p><h2><strong>Is <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> worth it?</strong></h2><p>I know this is still a work in progress, but after sinking several hours into Chapters 1 and 2, <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> is shaping up to be a game you simply can&rsquo;t miss.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Despite the unfortunate controversies surrounding it, the world crafted by GameScience is a stunning tribute to the mythology and lore of China and <em>Journey to the West</em>. If that doesn&rsquo;t win you over, let me just say this: the game is incredibly fun to play. That alone should speak volumes. </p><p>Each chapter is brimming with secrets to uncover, making this roughly 40-hour journey well worth its $60 price tag.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In the private sector, social media <a href="https://mashable.com/article/instagram-shadowbanning-lgbtq-sex-educator-accounts" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>censorship</u></a> of LGBT users and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/porn-site-bangbros-apparently-leaked-millions-of-records" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>porn site data leaks</u></a> reflect a continued crisis between sexuality, privacy, and technology. So we went to the experts and asked several sex workers for their top tips to help you stay safe online.</p><h2>1. Identify your personal security goals</h2><p>"People should take a second and identify the risks they want to avoid," cautions Pittsburgh-based dancer and escort, <a href="https://x.com/TheJosieOakley" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Josie Oakley</u></a>. "Like, are they concerned about their family finding their online history? Or are they concerned about getting hacked? Stalkers? Tech companies or the government?

<p>Thinking about the outcomes we want to avoid, then tracing our internet trail that might lead to that outcome, is a good practice. Let's use the example of credit card information. Online payments are at the forefront of digital security conversations, as recent financial discrimination policies are being <a href="https://mashable.com/article/fighting-financial-discrimination-of-sex-workers-will-help-us-all" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>beta-tested on sex workers</u></a>, but are rolling out to impact <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/05/business/banks-accounts-close-suddenly.html" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>all customers who fit an unknown criteria of posing financial risk to their bank</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>If we're concerned about hackers, we might consider sharing our credit card information with fewer websites. Third-party payment options with stronger security measures, such as PayPal or Venmo, might be a safer route.</p></li><li><p>If our concern is our friends or loved ones knowing our internet habits, we might use a different credit card, or even a prepaid gift card, for our online transactions.</p></li><li><p>Tech companies or government surveillance could be deterred by using cash where possible. Some security sites like <a href="https://mullvad.net/en/pricing" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Mullvad VPN</u></a> take cash payment by mail to preserve customer anonymity.</p></li></ul><h2>2. Minimize data connections across apps&nbsp;</h2><p>"Avoid cross contamination of data between apps," advises sex worker-run tech collective, Hacking//Hustling, in their <a href="https://hackinghustling.org/doxxing-prevention-harm-reduction-training/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>doxxing prevention guide</u></a>. Minimizing data that is shared between your various online accounts (like login information) can prevent a data breach on one website from impacting your other online profiles. Never use the same email and password combination on multiple sites.</p><p>Even the existence of an account on a website can be something an individual might want to keep private. For example, if they go to a certain doctor's office for specialist treatment, or if they have an account on adult websites. The reasons we might want to keep parts of our online presence private can be varied, and the need for privacy increases each year as the data economy grows.</p><p>"An email address is a great way to track you across the internet," says Ada Hamilton in her series <a href="https://tryst.link/blog/author/ada/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Sluts for Security</u></a> on the Tryst blog. Tryst is a sex worker-founded platform for escorts, BDSM professionals, massage providers, and adult entertainers to advertise their services.&nbsp;</p><p>"If you use cool@email.com to sign up for various services, it's obvious those accounts all belong to the same person. Services like Fastmail and Proton Mail have features to manage auto-generating new aliases on demand." Email aliases are additional email addresses that can route emails to your primary inbox, so you don't have to check multiple inboxes if you're using different aliases to create accounts. A <a href="https://mashable.com/article/what-are-password-managers-explained" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>password manager</u></a> can help you keep track of these unique emails, and also generate unique and randomized passwords for each of your online accounts.</p><p>Minimizing connections between your online presence can reduce the information a malicious actor can easily collect on you. Even if we're not sure how certain information can be connected, it's important to remember that data technology is rapidly evolving daily, and we can't always know what tomorrow might bring. Maintaining good practices of digital security protects us more than we might anticipate.</p><h2>3. Scrub metadata (like your location) from all shared media</h2><p>Metadata is extra information embedded in digital documents, images, and videos that can include things like location or identifying information about the file creator. You could be unsuspectingly sharing more information than you thought when you share content online. Sometimes this extra data is obvious &mdash; ever notice that shared TikTok videos always include a link to the profile of the person who shared it? That's one visible example, but metadata isn't always so obvious.</p><p>"I use either Photoshop or Lightroom, available as part of Adobe's photography plan at $10/month," shares one sex worker from Atlanta, who primarily creates digital video and photography content. "But all you really need to do is make sure you have GPS settings turned off for your camera apps. While most sites like OnlyFans and Instagram will scrub your metadata anyway, you do not want to forget and send a photo over text or email and give someone your address by accident." This sex worker chose to be anonymous for privacy reasons.</p><p>Different photography apps also record GPS location. In general, it's a good idea to check settings and do research on any media sharing and creation apps to see what kind of extra information they include.</p><h2>4. Cover faces, instead of blurring&nbsp;</h2><p>As <a href="https://mashable.com/category/facial-recognition" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>facial recognition</u></a> technology advances rapidly, it's worth thinking about where your face can be found online. Whether you're a parent keeping your child's image off the internet, or you're a political activist, or in any situation where you're sharing photos and want some privacy &mdash; consider fully covering faces instead of blurring them. "Many types of blurs can be undone programmatically," advises tech security expert and pro dominatrix, Mistress Fae, on <a href="https://mistressfae.substack.com/p/avoiding-facial-recognition-for-swers" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>her new Substack</u></a>. "A dedicated stalker can use readily-available online tools to recover your facial features."&nbsp;</p><p>Always check photos closely for any other markers of location or identity, like tattoos and background elements, or even reflections in mirrors. Fae recommends using opaque methods of obstruction, like emoji stickers instead of light leaks or semi-transparent filters. Digital photos can be manipulated for more information than we expect. The more elements of an object that are visible, say the top half of an identifiable building, or a face where only eyes are covered instead of the entire face, the more likely it is that more information can be pieced together.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

        </a>
    </div>
<h2>5. Use encrypted apps</h2><p>Sex worker communities often have to move quickly between platforms when censorship or risky data practices become apparent. On any app, always take some time to look over security settings, and turn off any location tracking and minimize publicly visible personal information. For example, until you review the settings, you might not notice that an app shares your "last online" timestamp with all your contacts. Do you consciously want to share that information? App permissions can also get reset when terms of service are updated by the developers; periodically checking these settings again is a good practice.</p><p>In 2024, we're lucky to live in an era of abundance when it comes to encrypted apps. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/what-is-end-to-end-encryption-e2e" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Encryption</u></a> is the process of scrambling data so that only authorized users can read it. These are some popular recommendations used by sex worker communities:</p><ul><li><p>Looking for a more private alternative to Google Docs? Try <a href="https://cryptpad.fr/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>CryptPad</u></a>.</p></li><li><p>Need more secure cloud sharing than Microsoft SharePoint? Consider ProtonMail's new <a href="https://proton.me/drive" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Proton Drive</u></a>.</p></li><li><p>For secure texting, use <a href="https://signal.org/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Signal</u></a> instead of iMessage or Facebook Messenger.</p></li></ul><p>Explore additional layers of security for any app you use. Consider turning on the disappearing messages features to protect yourself and anyone you're messaging in case either person's phone is stolen. Dropbox allows you to set up a physical hardware token as your two-factor authentication method.&nbsp;</p><p>Managing risk online isn't a binary process of choosing the "right" option &mdash; it's about minimizing the exposure we can, and doing what we need to protect ourselves from different types of bad actors.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>The M3 MacBook Air is no longer at its $850 record low, but $899 is still a solid deal for one of the best chips you can find in a MacBook, along with an 18-hour battery life, WiFi 6E support, and the ability to connect up to two external displays with the laptop lid closed. Of course, it also has the signature portability of the Air line, making it great for <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-macbooks" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">working at home or taking on the go</a>. This price also puts it just $50 above the M2 MacBook Air with the same specs, offering a bit more future proofing without a huge price bump.</p><h3>More iMac and MacBook deals</h3><p><strong>MacBook Air</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/Jpx3q?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20MacBook%20Air%2C%2013-inch%20%28M1%2C%208GB%20RAM%2C%20256GB%20SSD%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=00AbPlZbVetQKOqcrEnaYbS&short_url=Jpx3q&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple MacBook Air, 13-inch (M1, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD)</a> &mdash;

However, it can still act as a heart rate monitor, and of course, the ability to download a whole host of apps. </p><h3>More Apple Watch deals</h3><p><strong>Series 9</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/2eA7L?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20Watch%20Series%209%20%2845mm%2C%20GPS%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=00AbPlZbVetQKOqcrEnaYbS&short_url=2eA7L&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple Watch Series 9 (45mm, GPS)</a> &mdash; <strong>$359</strong> <s>$429</s> at Amazon (save $70)</p></li></ul><p><strong>SE</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/5MZOd?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20Watch%20SE%20%2840mm%2C%20GPS%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=00AbPlZbVetQKOqcrEnaYbS&short_url=5MZOd&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple Watch SE (40mm, GPS)</a> &mdash; <strong>$189</strong> <s>$249</s> at Amazon (save $60)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/4AY44?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20Watch%20SE%20%2844mm%2C%20GPS%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=00AbPlZbVetQKOqcrEnaYbS&short_url=4AY44&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple Watch SE (44mm, GPS)</a> &mdash; <strong>$219</strong> <s>$279</s> at Amazon (save $60)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/q7jww?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20Watch%20SE%20%2844mm%2C%20GPS%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=00AbPlZbVetQKOqcrEnaYbS&short_url=q7jww&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple Watch SE (44mm, GPS)</a> &mdash; <strong>$219</strong> <s>$279</s> at Walmart (save $60)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/b1rqE?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20Watch%20SE%20%2840mm%2C%20GPS%20%2B%20cellular%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=00AbPlZbVetQKOqcrEnaYbS&short_url=b1rqE&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple Watch SE (40mm, GPS + cellular)</a> &mdash; <strong>$229 </strong><s>$299</s> at Walmart (save $70)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/6Xl8q?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20Watch%20SE%20%2844mm%2C%20GPS%20%2B%20cellular%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=00AbPlZbVetQKOqcrEnaYbS&short_url=6Xl8q&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple Watch SE (44mm, GPS + cellular)</a> &mdash; <strong>$269.99</strong> <s>$329</s> at Amazon (save $59.01)</p></li></ul><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

Established in 2010, it is run by the Football Association and features 12 professional teams. Chelsea are the current WSL champions after winning their seventh title last year.</p><h2>How to watch the Women's Super League for free</h2><p>Sky Sports will show up to 44 WSL games this season, but it's not free. Fortunately, there are free alternatives on offer.</p><p>BBC Sport has agreed to show 22 live matches for free on BBC iPlayer. And it gets better, because all non-Sky Sports/BBC broadcasted WSL fixtures will be live streamed globally on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@bwsl" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">YouTube</a>.</p><p>Anyone from around the world can access WSL fixtures for free on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@bwsl" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">YouTube</a>, but the same can't be said for the top games featured on <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">BBC iPlayer</a>.

<h2>What is Connections?</h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>
<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. Like <em>Wordle, </em>you can share the results with your friends on social media.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

Words can be made from linked letters &mdash; up, down, left, right, or diagonal, but words can also change direction, resulting in quirky shapes and patterns. Every single letter in the grid will be part of an answer. There's always a theme linking every solution, along with the "spangram," a special, word or phrase that sums up that day's theme, and spans the entire grid horizontally or vertically.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>By providing an opaque hint and not providing the word list, Strands creates a brain-teasing game that takes a little longer to play than its other games, like <a href="https://mashable.com/category/wordle" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Wordle</a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/category/connections" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Connections</a>.</p><p>If you're feeling stuck or just don't have 10 or more minutes to figure out today's puzzle, we've got all the NYT Strands hints for today's puzzle you need to progress at your preferred pace.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Google has employed generative AI's powerful ability to crawl and summarize massive amounts of text with AI summaries in Search. Dubbed AI overviews, this feature was <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-ai-search-memes-mistakes" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">plagued early on</a> with <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-ai-overviews-benefit-of-doubt" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">inaccuracies and hallucinations</a>, some of which was due to the quality of information it scraped from the web. But running the summarization task on presumably reliable files created by the user has potential for much more success. </p><p>A glimpse into the code shows that Google's AI model will search amongst text files and provide brief descriptions of what each file is about. So this way, users can scan the summary of a document instead of opening it when they're looking for a particular document. </p><p>It's believed that this featured will be supported by Gemini Nano, the smallest and most lightweight version of Gemini. This means the feature will be processed on-device, instead of in the cloud. Evidence in the code also suggests that this feature can be toggled on or off in Settings. </p><p>If you're feeling AI fatigue... don't expect any relief soon. The newly-released Google Pixel 9 has "<a href="https://mashable.com/review/google-pixel-9" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">officially too much AI</a>," said Mashable's Alex Perry in his review. "Google is going <em>so hard</em> on these features, championing them as the big selling points of the Pixel 9 family, and none of them are really transformative nor innovative in ways that matter." </p><p>That said, Perry found some of the features to be genuinely useful, like the ability to search for screenshots. It sounds like AI summaries for Files might fall into the <em>modest, but genuinely useful</em> category. But we'll have to wait and see. </p>]]></content:encoded>

An inward-facing microphone listens inside your ear for unwanted internal sounds, which your AirPods Pro or AirPods Max also counter with anti-noise."</p><p>The notable information from the leaker here is that Apple is improving ANC in the new upcoming AirPods Pro 3 and including it for the first time in the new base model, AirPods 4.</p><p>Kosutami did not confirm when these new AirPods would be launched. However, all signs point to the September Apple event. While Apple has started to hold October events as well, those seem to be reserved strictly for Mac announcements. Any new AirPods announcements seem to align more with the big annual iPhone event in September.</p><p>So, stay tune as we find out more about Apple's new AirPods Pro 3 and AirPods 4 in the coming weeks.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

But if you're looking for a new smartphone, you don't have to rely solely on the iOS ecosystem. There are some excellent Android picks out there that you can opt for instead.

<p>The Google Pixel 8a comes equipped with a 6.1-inch Actua display with 2400x1080 resolution and a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate, with a Google Tensor G3 processor, 128GB of storage, and 8GB of RAM. All that <em>and</em> it's affordable, with a slew of AI features that originally debuted on the Pixel 8, including Circle to Search, AI call screening, Magic Editor, and more. </p><p>Mashable's Alex Perry reviewed the Google Pixel 8a, praising it as an <a href="https://mashable.com/review/google-pixel-8a-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">"impressive deal"</a> even though it's only a small iterative set of changes over its predecessor, but noted that "its elite performance coupled with a flagship-esque display and decent enough camera specs are more than enough to make up for some lackluster returning AI features."

<p>Switching from a small screen to a large screen to a medium-sized screen is pretty much all life is about these days. We wake up with our phones in hand, spend most of our day hunched over laptops, and then retreat to the couch with a tablet or phone to scroll Instagram or TikTok until it&rsquo;s time to sleep. It&rsquo;s not glamorous, but it's the reality we live in. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h3>Why we like it </h3><p>The Apple iPad (9th gen) is a Mashable fave.

<p>We've seen the pumpkin spice on the shelves, so we know fall is coming. Labor Day is the last hurrah of summer, squeezing in a final beach day or backyard barbecue before transitioning to fall.

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>AirPods are undeniably popular. They connect to iOS devices with ease and look good while doing it. <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-airpods-max-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">AirPods Max</a> are Apple's answer to over-the-ear headphones, with a cool, sleek design. While we generally liked them during testing, there's a clear consensus that they're just too dang expensive at $549. Sure, they have good audio quality, but there are plenty of other headphones that are just as good for far less.</p><p>Luckily, Amazon's Labor Day sale brought the AirPods Max down to $399, just $5 shy of their <a href="https://zdcs.link/xPB0j?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=lowest%20price%20ever&object_type=article&object_uuid=07A86ChMrinVKDGljvJZUVm&short_url=xPB0j&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">lowest price ever</a>.

With customizable noise cancelling, adjustable EQ options, and a variety of fun colors, these are affordable headphones that aren't just comfortable to wear, but sturdy and reliable for long listening sessions. When you're not enjoying music or podcasts (or chatting on a call) you can switch from Quiet Mode to Aware Mode to let the sounds in that matter while out and about. Get up to 24 hours of battery with a 15-minute charge juicing you back up to 2.5 hours of play time. It's all you need in one fun package, and a good fit for your personality depending on what color you choose. </p><h2><strong>Best Bose speaker deal</strong></h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>One of the things holding us back from recommending the Sonos Arc soundbar as one of our top picks is the price. At $899, it's a bit steep, but today's discount at Amazon drops it down to a more approachable $719. Its audio profile is fabulous, with crisp dialogue, thumping bass, and deep layers &mdash;&nbsp;all bolstered by Dolby Atmos. As our friends at <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/sonos-arc" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">PCMag</a> (which is owned by Mashable's publisher, Ziff Davis) noted in their review, "The impressive Sonos Arc takes the best parts of the company's other soundbars and combines them into one Dolby Atmos-compatible package."</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>Runners, here's a sweet deal for you: the Garmin Forerunner 265S smartwatch is down from $449.99 to $349.99 as of Aug. 27. That's 22% in savings and its lowest price on record. The 265S packs up to 15 days of battery life in smartwatch mode and up to 24 in GPS mode, as well as 30 plus built-in activities (running, triathlon, cycling, swimming, etc.).

The stupidly comfy headphones look good, sound great, and play well with Apple gadgetry. They're also stupidly expensive at $549. As of Aug. 27, however, you can save 27% and pick up a pair for only $399. That's just $16 shy of the record-low price they hit following Prime Day.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>A more affordable competitor to the Google Nest, Amazon's Smart Thermostat can help optimize your HVAC energy use and smarten up your home. You can ask Alexa to adjust the temperature while you're snug in bed, or automatically tune your thermostat to suit your preferences when you arrive home.

<h3><strong>Action Button</strong></h3><p>A report from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/30/iphone-16-action-button-all-models/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">MacRumors</a> claims that every single model in the iPhone 16 line will feature an Action Button &mdash; not just the iPhone 15 Pro variants. The current-gen iPhone 15 Pro models' Action Button can be programmed to launch a range of apps and functions, including Flashlight, Camera, Silent Mode, Voice Memo, Focus, Magnifier, Translate (coming to iOS 17.2), and a range of accessibility features.</p><p>When iPhone 16 drops, however, the rumor mill states that Apple will add more functionality to the Action Button.</p><h3><strong>Capture Button</strong></h3><p>The Action Button was all the rage for the iPhone 15 series, however, according to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/iphone-16-capture-button/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">MacRumors</a> and <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-plans-iphone-camera-button-as-creators-shift-to-horizontal-videos?rc=bdqvyp" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">The Information</a>, a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/iphone-16-camera-button" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">new Capture Button</a> will be one of the biggest selling points for the iPhone 16. Reportedly placed slightly under the power button, the Capture Button is a camera-focused feature that can do the following:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Zoom in and out of photos/videos with swiping gestures</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Allows users to focus on subjects</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Activates the shutter button</strong></p></li></ul><p>While MacRumors and The Information both concur that Apple is testing a "capture button" on the iPhone 16, both aren't on the same page on whether it's a mechanical button or a capacitive one. MacRumors says it's the latter, but The Information claims it's both.</p><p>The new capture button will reportedly be featured across <em>all </em>iPhone 16 models.</p><h3><strong>Solid-state buttons</strong></h3><p>Apple reportedly planned on introducing solid-state buttons with the iPhone 15 Pro models, but instead, we got a customizable Action Button. For the uninitiated, solid-state buttons aren&rsquo;t buttons <em>per se </em>&ndash; they&rsquo;re panels that feature haptic feedback sensations that simulate real button presses (Think of the iPhone SE series' Home button). On the plus side, the solid-state buttons aren&rsquo;t totally out of the picture. According to respected <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/two-iphone-15-pro-models-removal-of-solid-state-button-design-negatively-affects-cirrus-logic-and-a456d5e7386c" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Apple leaker and analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</u></a>, Apple is working on debuting solid-state buttons on the iPhone 16 Pro models instead.<br></p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<h2><strong>iPhone 16 battery life</strong></h2><p>As we reported in early April, a Weibo leaker by the name of "OvO Baby Sauce OvO" seemingly unveiled the new <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-iphone-16-plus-battery-size-reduction" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">new battery sizes across the iPhone 16 lineup</a>:</p><ul><li><p><strong>iPhone 16:</strong> 3,561mAh</p></li><li><p><strong>iPhone 16 Plus:</strong> 4,006mAh</p></li><li><p><strong>iPhone 16 Pro:</strong> 3,355mAh</p></li><li><p><strong>iPhone 16 Pro Max:</strong> 4,676mAh</p></li></ul><p>All the iPhone 16 models have some sort of <em>increase </em>from two to six percent <em>except </em>for the iPhone 16 Plus, which reportedly has a reduction of nearly nine percent compared to the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-iphone-15-plus-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">iPhone 15 Plus</a>.</p><p>Keep in mind that an increase in battery size doesn't necessarily mean that the device will deliver longer battery life.

<h3><strong><br>Storage</strong></h3><p>According to news aggregator account "yeux1122" from Naver, a Korean blog, the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max will feature options that offer <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/iphone-16-pro-2tb-option-rumor/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">2TB of storage</a>.</p><p>That is double the current max storage capacity of the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><h3><strong>Chipset</strong></h3><p>In recent years, Apple has followed the trend of putting <em>last year's </em>chip into the two entry-level models while the Pro models, the Pro and the Pro Max, get the new-generation chip. For example, the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus got the A16 Bionic chip, the same inside the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max. However, the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max got outfitted with the <em>new </em>A17 Pro chips.</p><p>If this pattern continues, it should follow that the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus get the A17 Pro while the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max get the A18 chips. Pu hinted that this is how it will be for the iPhone 16 line, hinting that the A17 Pro will reportedly be less efficient. In other words, the iPhone 16 models equipped with this chip may take a battery life hit. This is because the next-generation chip will offer tremendous performance gains at the expense of power efficiency.</p><p>However, another rumor tells a different story. </p><p>According to an alleged iOS 18 code leak from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/20/ios-18-code-four-new-iphone-models/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">MacRumors</a>, the<strong> entire</strong> iPhone 16 line will get<em> </em>an<em> </em>A18 chip. However, there&rsquo;s a chance that Apple will use a &ldquo;Pro&rdquo; identifier name to differentiate from the standard and Pro models (e.g., A18 chip and A18 Pro).</p><p>The iPhone 16 Pro models will also reportedly support Wi-Fi 7 (current models support WiFi 6E). Wi-Fi 7 should offer zippy transfer speeds that exceed 40 Gbps, quadrupling what WiFi 6E can do.</p><p>According to Pu (via <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/10/12/iphone-16-pro-faster-5g-wi-fi-7/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>9to5Mac</em></a>), the iPhone 16 Pro will come with Qualcomm&rsquo;s Snapdragon X75 modem, which can reach a 5G download rate of up to 7.5 Gbps.</p><p><em>We&rsquo;ll periodically update this rumor hub as new iPhone 16 leaks trickle in, so be sure to bookmark this page.&nbsp;</em></p><p></p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>The model I have comes with the following specs:</p><ul><li><p><strong>40mm case size</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Silver finish</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Aluminum chassis</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>GPS (no cellular)</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Ocean Blue solo loop</strong></p></li></ul><p>Some features require you to shell out a little more. For example, a stainless steel chassis is an extra $50. A larger case size (i.e., 44mm) is an extra $30. If you want GPS <em>and</em> cellular support, that will set you back $50.</p><p>The Apple Watch Series 9 costs $399 on <a href="https://zdcs.link/noZnj?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%27s%20official%20website&object_type=article&object_uuid=041zHV4nuEy4RO8CDB4dhK0&short_url=noZnj&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple's official website</a> (again, this is the cheapest you can get in this model).</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2><strong>Apple Watch Series 9 vs. SE: Display</strong></h2><p>The first thing I noticed about the Watch SE is that it has thicker bezels, which reduces its screen real estate &mdash; and the display is minimal to begin with.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The Watch Series 9's bezels are a lot less obstructive, but either way, I still found display navigation to be fine on both screens. Thicker bezels, in my opinion, aren't a big deal. </p><p>It's also worth nothing that the resolution is different for the watches:</p><p><strong>Watch Series 9 (41mm) - 430 x 352 pixels </strong></p><p><strong>Watch SE (40mm) - 394 x 324 pixels </strong></p><p>Looking at them side by side, the Watch Series 9 definitely delivers a sharper, clearer visuals. But if I were looking at the Watch SE independently, I would think that the display quality is sufficient enough. </p><p>Now, let's talk brightness:</p><p><strong>Watch Series 9 (41mm) - up to 2,000 nits</strong></p><p><strong>Watch SE (40mm) - up to 1,000 nits</strong></p><p>The Watch Series 9 is supposedly brighter than Series 9, delivering a max of 2,000 nits over the SE's 1,000-nit screen. However, while comparing both watches in the sun, I could see both of them just fine, even with the rays shining bright on them like a spotlight. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>You can tell the Watch SE is <em>slightly </em>dimmer, but the difference is negligible to the naked eye.</p><p>The main difference between the two screens, however, is the always-on display. I thought I wouldn't care about the Watch SE not having an always-on display (AOD). (For the uninitiated, AOD means that the screen is always feeding you visual information.)</p><p>However, I found myself getting frustrated that I had to keep either touching the Watch SE's screen or flick my wrist toward myself to check the time. Meanwhile, the Watch Series 9, well, <em>stays on</em>. As you can see in the photo below, the Watch SE's screen is completely dark, but the Series 9's display is still "active" (though it is dimmed). </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>I went with the Silver finish for the Watch SE along with the Ocean Blue solo loop &mdash; and I regret it. Oddly, the solo loop collects dirt easily. And unlike the sports band that's featured on the Watch Series 9, the solo loop requires custom sizing.

<p>The sports band has an adjustable strap, allowing me to make it as tight or loose as I need it to be. The solo loop, on the other hand, is just a stretchy bracelet band.

<p>It's worth noting, though, that Apple Watch Series 9 supports fast charging; the Apple Watch SE does not.

<p>If you're more fitness-focused, and you don't mind the thicker bezels and lack of always-on display, the Watch SE is a solid choice.</p><p>You, like me, may assume that the Watch Series 9 has better battery life because it's pricier, but in my experience, both held up pretty well in terms of power efficiency (though the Series 9 edged out the Watch SE by an hour or so).</p><p>The only thing I'd warn against is getting the solo loop band for your Apple Watch. It seems to get loose after some time &mdash; and it's not very durable. Instead, get the sports band, allowing you to adjust the Apple Watch to your wrist as you like it.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

      <description><![CDATA[TikTok is full of teleshopping videos and live streams reminiscent of QVC and TV teleshopping channels. So, what's going on?]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/04hQa2oONqlcUe74rmEXuul/hero-image.jpg" alt="Illustration of a person's arm holding shopping bags, each of which has an image of a teleshopping salesperson holding up items for sale. "><p>If you've scrolled through <a href="https://mashable.com/category/tiktok" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>TikTok</u></a> recently, you might have noticed that it's not just viral dances, get-ready-with-mes and story-time videos on your For You Page right now. In fact, I rarely scroll through eight or nine TikToks before I come across a live video where I'm being directly sold to. "Caroline! 11 items! I'm gonna have a great time packing up this order," is the first thing I hear when I open the app today, coming across a livestream of a woman standing in front of a cupboard stacked full of make-up products. She's <a href="https://mashable.com/category/streaming" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">streaming</a> on behalf of the make-up brand <a href="https://madebymitchell.co.uk/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Made By Mitchell</u></a> and talking directly to someone who is commenting on the livestream and making purchases. "Seeing as you've ordered two of the mystery boxes, I'm going to throw you an extra lip gloss in. Don't tell anyone," the streamer continues, talking in a familiar tone to her customer on a live stream that over 200 people are watching.</p><p>It's an ostensibly retro sales technique, almost identical to what you probably remember of '90s <a href="https://mashable.com/shopping" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">shopping</a> channel QVC, watching an older relative dial in to buy a discounted kettle or a plant pot. And although live shopping is just taking off in the UK, it's hardly a niche corner of the internet. In China, in 2023 alone, an estimated $500 billion in goods were sold via livestream on apps, according to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/28/business/china-livestreaming-ecommerce.html" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>New York Times</u></a>. And now plenty of businesses in the UK and the U.S. are turning to this sales format via <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-avoid-tiktok-shop-scams" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>TikTok Shop</u></a>, the video-sharing app's ecommerce leg, which is rapidly expanding since it launched in November 2022. According to <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-gb/retail-economics-report" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>research</u></a>, 44 percent of social media users have made a purchase directly through TikTok.</p><p>In fact, some businesses are making hundreds of thousands &ndash; even millions &ndash; of pounds via live shopping, <a href="https://cosmeticsbusiness.com/made-by-mitchell-on-making-one-million-on-tik-tok-shop" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>according to</u></a> figures shared by TikTok. On their most successful day, Made By Mitchell made $1 million dollars on TikTok, thanks to a 12 hour stream that almost 600,000 viewers tuned into and one product being sold every second, a representative from TikTok Shop told <em>Mashable</em>. Launching in 2020, most of the business' growth has taken place on TikTok and they recently launched in high-street store Boots.&nbsp;</p><h2>Why your FYP is full of teleshopping</h2><p>So what is it about live shopping that appeals right now? "We have a group of people who watch our live videos every single day. There's an element of people thinking, 'I just want to be involved with what you're doing right this second'," says <a href="https://www.instagram.com/joshreais/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Josh Reais</u></a>, Live Sales Host at luxury second-hand fashion company <a href="https://luxecollectivefashion.com/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Luxe Collective</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>A big part of live selling on apps like <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-avoid-tiktok-shop-scams" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">TikTok Shop</a> is the novelty of good old-fashioned bargaining. On Josh&rsquo;s&nbsp; daily live streams, viewers will haggle with Reais in the comments, trying to get him to knock &pound;25 off a vintage Louis Vuitton purse. Hosts like Reais tend to use traditional sales techniques and slogans, broadcasting themselves for hours at a time and offering flash sales throughout the stream. All of Luxe Collective's products are second-hand, which means they offer a more sustainable outlet for their customers' consumerist tendencies. But this buy-now-buy-quick attitude feels a little at odds with what we know about how Gen-Z (the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1299771/tiktok-global-user-age-distribution/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>biggest</u></a> age demographic on TikTok in 2024) want to shop, as they're not only often dubbed the <a href="https://www.firstinsight.com/white-papers-posts/gen-z-shoppers-demand-sustainability" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>most sustainable generation</u></a>, but as some of the most practical spenders too, with 43 percent cutting back on non-essential spending and 51 percent&nbsp; choosing to prioritise their finances as a result of rising prices, according to a 2024 <a href="https://www.mintel.com/insights/consumer-research/the-future-of-consumer-behaviour-in-the-age-of-gen-z/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>report</u></a> carried out by market research agency Mintel.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>"We've never had a shopping experience like this &mdash; imagine going into Selfridges and having 400 people standing behind you, cheering you on," Reais says, although he adds that he isn't worried about people making irresponsible buying decisions, from both a financial and environmental perspective. "People in the comments will give advice, telling the potential buyer that they own an item and it's worth it or, on the other hand, that maybe they should wait and make the decision at a later date," he explains.</p><h2>The future of shopping?</h2><p>The community that live shopping events create is seemingly at the heart of the success of platforms like TikTok Shop, something that is immediately clear to me when I arrive at a in-person event hosted by TikTok and Luxe Collective and see a group of 15 women excitedly chatting around a table, as though they've known each other for years. "Let me guess because I think I've nailed some of you," one woman says as she approaches the table, pointing at some of the people who are sitting down and shouting out names. I quickly realise that these women have all met in person less than half an hour ago, but are acquainted on a daily basis in the comments section of Luxe Collective's live shopping events. The reason these women all get on so well is because they have a shared interest, one that they feel very strongly about. In their case, it's luxury fashion, but live shopping platforms provide spaces for enthusiasts with varied interests.</p><p>Another platform that is becoming increasingly popular for live shopping is <a href="https://www.whatnot.com/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Whatnot</u></a>, a large livestream shopping platform in North America and Europe. General Manager at Whatnot, Daniel Fisher, says that many of their users see themselves as collectors, rather than shoppers: "Our focus is helping buyers and sellers discover things that they're passionate about, be it collectible cards, trainers, fashion, vintage."</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>With high street shopping becoming <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/912662/retail-monthly-footfall-year-on-year-by-location-united-kingdom-uk/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>continuously less popular</u></a> and most people making most of their purchases from fast fashion websites or big online retailers like Amazon (<a href="https://store.mintel.com/report/uk-changing-face-of-the-high-street-market-report" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>65</u></a> percent of UK shoppers agree that shopping online is more convenient than in-store), live shopping appears to offer a middle ground between the two, so its appeal is hardly surprising. "There's been this anonymity to ecommerce for decades and live shopping has completely changed that because you're able to interact with the sellers and other buyers," Fisher says. "It's a combination of ecommerce and that in-person shopping element which I think people probably miss."</p><p>Plus, live shopping offers something in-person shopping generally doesn't: hundreds of people who are just as interested in the thing you're about to purchase as you are. "It is a win buying something that big: buying it is a huge momentous occasion and being able to celebrate that with 400 people is amazing," Reais says, speaking about the people who tune into Luxe Collective's streams.</p><p>And what's crucial is sales hosts like Reais aren't just salespeople, but performers. And these streams aren't just shopping experiences, but forms of entertainment. "Our consumers spend about 80 minutes a day watching live streams on Whatnot," Fisher says. Compare that to Netflix subscribers, who spend an average of <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/advisor/vpn/netflix-statistics" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>192 minutes</u></a> watching TV series and movies on a platform, it's clear that a lot of people see live shopping as an alternative form of entertainment to TV or other social media sites, rather than just a means to an end. "In China, the new generation of influencers are actually set live stream sellers," Fisher says.</p><p>So with the celebrities of the future set to be teleshoppers, it's difficult to decide whether live shopping feels more nostalgic or dystopian. Either way, platforms like TikTok Shop and Whatnot set to grow exponentially, so don't be surprised if in the near future you find yourself lost in the comments of a livestream, haggling down the price of a toaster, just for the thrill of it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This is not the first time we heard about a new iPad mini being in the works.

Words can be made from linked letters &mdash; up, down, left, right, or diagonal, but words can also change direction, resulting in quirky shapes and patterns. Every single letter in the grid will be part of an answer. There's always a theme linking every solution, along with the "spangram," a special, word or phrase that sums up that day's theme, and spans the entire grid horizontally or vertically.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>By providing an opaque hint and not providing the word list, Strands creates a brain-teasing game that takes a little longer to play than its other games, like <a href="https://mashable.com/category/wordle" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Wordle</a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/category/connections" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Connections</a>.</p><p>If you're feeling stuck or just don't have 10 or more minutes to figure out today's puzzle, we've got all the NYT Strands hints for today's puzzle you need to progress at your preferred pace.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Dell says it discovered a way to reduce the cooling system inside the Alienware m16 r2 to completely remove the eyesore &mdash; er, I mean "thermal shelf" &mdash; that jutted beyond the laptop.</p><p>I've always preferred a minimalist design. I've never cared for gaming laptops that look like a flashy disco party. In fact, the Alienware m16 r2 is designed for killjoys like myself &mdash; gamers who want a subdued gaming experience without all the glitz and flash.</p><p>However, no matter how much Dell may have tried to subdue the "gaminess" of the m16 r2, it still very much looks like a gaming laptop &mdash; as if it was ripped out of an autobot from <em>Transformers </em>or a futuristic spaceship control panel. On the lid, you'll find Alienware's logo that features the head of an extraterrestrial. On the bottom right, you'll find a gigantic "16" in techno-inspired, cybernetic text. </p><p>The anodized aluminum chassis is draped in a colorway that Dell calls "Dark Metallic Moon."</p><p>If you, like myself, are not down to party with your gaming laptop, you can turn off the RGB lighting on the two alien heads (on the lid and deck), as well as the keyboard and touchpad border, via the Alienware Command Center app.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>You may be wondering, "Is the Alienware m16 r2 portable?" I would say it's more portable than its predecessor, but I'm not someone who believes that a 16-inch, six-pound laptop with 0.79-inch thickness can be portable. It will definitely add quite a bit of weight to your luggage if you're traveling with it. And commuting with it won't be pleasant either, but to be fair, not many gaming laptops are<em> truly </em>portable (save for maybe the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/msi-cyborg-14" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">MSI Cyborg 14</a>).</p><p>You'll find honeycomb-style vents above the keyboard as well as some intake vents on the underside. Oh, and there are some vent exhausts on the sides, too.</p><p>The sturdy, well-built chassis fends off fingerprints well, but it does collect grease.</p><h2><strong>Alienware m16 R2 display</strong></h2><p>The Alienware m16 r2 comes with a 16-inch, 2,560 x 1,600-pixel display with a 240Hz refresh rate and a 3ms response time. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>It supports Nvidia G-SYNC and AMD FreeSync. This means you should get smooth gameplay with G-SYNC and Freesync, which ensure that the frames are seamless, so you don't have to worry about screen tearing and stuttering.</p><p>My only wish is that Dell offered a configuration with a miniLED or OLED panel for better contrast, improved color accuracy, and more power efficiency.</p><p>Otherwise, the Alienware m16 R2 display is fine, whether I gamed on it, or played Netflix or YouTube on it. While watching Netflix's <em>The Union </em>on the m16 r2, a bellhop's rich, ruby-red-and-gold uniform caught my eye. In one scene, I could see the tiny vellus hairs appearing on Halle Berry's skin.</p><p>I played <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>on the Alienware m16 R2, and while I was impressed with the contrast and vivid colors, I wished that the m16 r2 300-nit screen was brighter in some dark scenes.</p><p>By the way, the m16 r2's display screen folds all the way back 180 degrees. Not really sure why I'd need this, though.

<p>Let's talk about the GPU for a bit.

<p><em>Only Murders in the Building</em>'s focus on film adds a new layer of chaos to Charles (Steve Martin), Oliver (Martin Short), and Mabel's (Selena Gomez) adventures this season. Not only are they investigating the disappearance of Charles' stunt double, Sazz Pataki (Jane Lynch), they're also dealing with a nonstop parade of Hollywood executives and demanding actors, any of whom could be homicidal. But don't let the trio's excursions to Los Angeles fool you &mdash; <em>Only Murders in the Building </em>is still firmly rooted in the Arconia, a setting that remains as twisty, intriguing, and fun as the series itself.</p><h2><strong>Charles, Oliver, and Mabel take Hollywood in <em>Only Murders in the Building </em>Season 4.</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>As Season 4 opens, Charles, Oliver, and Mabel receive some potentially life-changing news: Their <em>Only Murders in the Building </em>podcast has been optioned for a movie adaptation, and the studio is fast-tracking the production. So our trio is off to Hollywood, where they'll sign away their life rights to producer Bev Melon (Molly Shannon) and meet the actors playing their movie counterparts. Enter Eugene Levy, Zach Galifianakis, and Eva Longoria, all playing exaggerated versions of themselves in their quests to embody Charles, Oliver, and Mabel.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet despite all the glitz and glamor of Hollywood, something doesn't feel quite right to Charles. Following Oliver's <em>Death Rattle Dazzle </em>opening night party, Sazz has seemingly fallen off the face of the earth. Audiences will remember that she got shot in Charles's kitchen at the end of Season 3, but by the start of Season 4, all traces of her have vanished from his apartment, leaving our podcasters in the dark. As Charles begins to piece together that something bad might have happened to his dear old friend &mdash; and that <em>he</em> may have been the intended target &mdash; he and his co-hosts return to New York for more sleuthing, with the film production following close behind.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Once there, <em>Only Murders in the Building</em> Season 4 adds several new twists to what we already know about the Arconia, including introducing a whole crew of suspicious tenants living in the building's West Tower. Played by the likes of Richard Kind, Kumail Nanjiani, and Daphne Rubin-Vega, the "Westies" are an eclectic bunch, with hobbies ranging from ultra-competitive card game nights to overzealous Christmas decor. (But could their interests extend... to murder?) This batch of suspects fits right in with the rest of the Arconia's kooky residents, proving that even after three seasons, <em>Only Murders in the Building </em>still has plenty elements of its titular building to explore.</p><h2><strong><em>Only Murders in the Building </em>Season 4 is a grand time at the movies.</strong>&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>On top of the Westies, Season 4's film elements keep <em>Only Murders in the Building </em>feeling fresh, just as the Broadway storyline did in Season 3. </p><p>Take the addition of Levy, Galifianakis, and Longoria. Their appearance here feels like the logical progression of <em>Only Murders in the Building</em>'s tradition of having major guest stars like Sting, Matthew Broderick, and Mel Brooks play themselves. Only instead of being quick cameos, Levy, Galifianakis, and Longoria are in it for the long haul, appearing across multiple episodes and serving as funhouse mirrors through which our characters see themselves. </p><p>This new trio of actors also gives <em>Only Murders in the Building </em>several new character pairings to play with. The usually chipper Oliver has a tough time with Galifianakis, who points out his every flaw and dismisses him at every turn. Elsewhere, Levy and Martin prove a bumbling match in comedy heaven, and Longoria brings a healthy dash of <em>Desperate Housewives </em>energy to her scenes with an often-confused Mabel.</p><p>Beyond its casting, <em>Only Murders in the Building </em>uses its focus on movies as an opportunity to pay homage to some classics. Each episode takes its name from a movie, including <em>Once Upon a Time in the West </em>and <em>Valley of the Dolls</em>, and often features a callout (some more direct than others) to said film. The result is a winding road through the movies and a love letter to how they get made, spotlighting writers, directors, stunt men, and more.</p><p>Exploring films across time also prompts <em>Only Murders in the Building </em>to experiment a bit with its own form, including a documentary-style episode that, while sometimes feeling a bit forced, still shows that the series is ready and willing to take more risks. All it needs is a great story and a desire to tell it, and Season 4 has both in spades.</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/X12GY?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3Btemplate=video&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=Only%20Murders%20in%20the%20Building%20Season%204%20premieres%20Aug.%2027%20on%20Hulu.&amp%3Bobject_type=video&amp%3Bobject_uuid=01avamREqerlPJZ2DpxAq3o&amp%3Bshort_url=X12GY&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Fvideo%2Fonly-murders-in-the-building-season-4-trailer&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Only%20Murders%20in%20the%20Building%20Season%204%20premieres%20Aug.%2027%20on%20Hulu%2C%20with%20a%20new%20episode%20every%20Tuesday.&object_type=article&object_uuid=03kIH1o8AQRvvRmIks52UVz&short_url=X12GY&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Only Murders in the Building </em>Season 4 premieres Aug. 27 on Hulu, with a new episode every Tuesday.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

"You can also opt for a platform more frequented by young people, like Bumble, Tinder, and Hinge, and make sure your bio and photos indicate your interests and values &mdash; this will help you more easily sift through and attract potential matches who are interested in the same things." </p><p>You might notice we no longer recommend geek-specific sites like <a href="https://zdcs.link/R6wKK?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Soul%20Geek&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=03eI87TGXscTuj9N0jmWBDd&short_url=R6wKK&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Soul Geek</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/A4RBp?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Gamer%20Dating&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=03eI87TGXscTuj9N0jmWBDd&short_url=A4RBp&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Gamer Dating</a>, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/0xmOm?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Dating%20for%20Muggles&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=03eI87TGXscTuj9N0jmWBDd&short_url=0xmOm&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Dating for Muggles</a>).

<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. Like <em>Wordle, </em>you can share the results with your friends on social media.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2><strong>The Webb telescope's powerful abilities</strong></h2><p>The Webb telescope &mdash; a scientific collaboration between <a href="https://mashable.com/category/nasa" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">NASA</a>, ESA, and the Canadian Space Agency &mdash; is designed to peer into the deepest cosmos and reveal new insights about the early universe. But it's also peering at <a href="https://mashable.com/article/james-webb-space-telescope-exoplanet-discovery-1" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">intriguing planets</a> in our galaxy, along with the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/james-webb-space-telescope-uranus-polar-cap" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">planets and moons in our solar system</a>.</p><p>Here's how Webb is achieving unparalleled feats, and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/james-webb-space-telescope-meteoroid-damage-nasa" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">likely will for decades to come</a>:</p><p><strong>- Giant mirror: </strong>Webb's mirror, which captures light, is over 21 feet across. That's over two-and-a-half times larger than the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/space-hubble-most-distant-star" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Hubble Space Telescope's</a> mirror. Capturing more light allows Webb to see more distant, ancient objects. As described above, the telescope is peering at stars and galaxies that formed over 13 billion years ago, just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang. "We're going to see the very first stars and galaxies that ever formed," Jean Creighton, an astronomer and the director of the Manfred Olson Planetarium at the University of Wisconsin&ndash;Milwaukee, told Mashable in 2021.</p><p><strong>- Infrared view: </strong>Unlike Hubble, which largely views light that's visible to us, Webb is primarily an infrared telescope, meaning it views light in the infrared spectrum. This allows us to see far more of the universe. Infrared has longer <a href="https://scied.ucar.edu/learning-zone/atmosphere/wavelength" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">wavelengths</a> than visible light, so the light waves more efficiently slip through <a href="https://mashable.com/article/carina-nebula-james-webb-space-telescope" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">cosmic clouds</a>; the light doesn't as often collide with and get scattered by these densely packed particles. Ultimately, Webb's infrared eyesight can penetrate places Hubble can't.</p><p>"It lifts the veil," said Creighton.</p><p><strong>- Peering into distant exoplanets: </strong>The Webb telescope <a href="https://webbtelescope.org/news/webb-science-writers-guide/webbs-scientific-instruments" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>carries specialized equipment called spectrographs</u></a> that will revolutionize our understanding of these far-off worlds. The instruments can decipher what molecules (such as water, carbon dioxide, and methane) exist in the atmospheres of distant exoplanets &mdash; be they gas giants or smaller rocky worlds. Webb looks at exoplanets in the Milky Way galaxy. Who knows what we'll find?</p><p>"We might learn things we never thought about," Mercedes L&oacute;pez-Morales, an exoplanet researcher and astrophysicist at the <a href="https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Center for Astrophysics-Harvard &amp; Smithsonian</a>, told Mashable in 2021.</p><p>Already, astronomers have successfully found intriguing chemical reactions on a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/james-webb-space-telescope-exoplanet-discovery" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">planet 700 light-years away</a>, and have started looking at one of the most anticipated places in the cosmos: the rocky, Earth-sized planets of the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/james-webb-space-telescope-trappist-planet" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">TRAPPIST solar system</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[With scammers only becoming more and more sophisticated, it’s never been more important to stay vigilant online.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/0657MpH08gzP6faoloP2SZs/hero-image.png" alt="Online Scammer"><p>In a world where scammers seem to be working overtime, protecting yourself from fraud has become an essential life skill. While a good <a href="https://mashable.com/au/roundup/best-antivirus-software-au" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">antivirus</a> will make this a much easier task (and these days there are impressive <a href="https://www.bitdefender.com.au/solutions/scamio.html" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">free tools</a> that focus on scam protection), there are still important lessons that everyone should learn in order to protect themselves. Scammers are constantly evolving their tactics, so staying informed is crucial. With that said, let's dive into some practical tips to keep you and yours safe online.</p><h3>If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is</h3><p>This is rule number one for a reason. This age-old wisdom still remains the golden rule of scam detection. That secret investment opportunity promising 1000% returns? It's more likely to multiply your problems than your money. We&rsquo;ve all heard stories of the temporarily embarrassed Nigerian Prince, or seen banner ads promising a free MacBook if you click in the next 10 seconds. But over time, these scams have gotten a lot more sophisticated. Remember, in the real world, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.</p><h3>Pressure is a red flag</h3><p>Scammers love to create a sense of urgency. "Act now or lose this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!" they'll say. But here's a little secret: legitimate opportunities rarely disappear in the blink of an eye. If someone's pushing you to make a quick decision, especially about money or personal information, take a step back. Genuine offers can wait for you to think things through.</p><h3>Check the source</h3><p>In this digital age, it's easier than ever for scammers to impersonate legitimate organisations. That email from your bank might not be from your bank at all. This is a process known as Phishing, and is becoming more and more common, especially with the rise of AI chatbots. Most <a href="https://www.bitdefender.com.au/solutions/total-security" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Antivirus tools</a> will make these much easier to spot, but it's important to stay vigilant.</p><p>Before clicking any links or providing information, verify the source. Call the company directly using a number you trust, not one provided in the suspicious message. It's a small step that can save you from a world of trouble.</p><h3>Guard your personal information</h3><p>Your personal details are the keys to your digital kingdom. Scammers are always fishing for this information, often through seemingly innocent requests. Be wary of unsolicited calls, emails, or messages asking for any sensitive data like your bank details or passwords. Legitimate organisations typically don't ask for this information out of the blue.</p><h3>Be sceptical of unsolicited contact</h3><p>If you receive an unexpected call, email, or message, especially one that requests action on your part, proceed with caution. Scammers often initiate contact, posing as everything from ATO officials, trusted colleagues, and tech support for ISPs and major banks. When in doubt, end the communication and reach out to the relevant organisation or person directly.</p><h3>Keep your devices up-to-date</h3><p>Keeping your devices and applications updated ensures you have the latest security patches. These can often fix vulnerabilities in the ways that your devices interact with each other that if left unchecked, can attract cybercriminals like flies to&hellip; yeah.</p><h3>Use strong, unique passwords</h3><p>Yes, it's a pain to remember multiple complex passwords. But it's a bigger pain to have your accounts hacked because you used "password123" across all your profiles. The best way to solve this problem for yourself is to use a <a href="https://au.pcmag.com/password-managers/4524/the-best-password-managers" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">password manager</a> to keep track of unique, strong passwords for each of your accounts. <a href="https://www.bitdefender.com.au/solutions/password-manager" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Bitdefender Password Manager</a> currently stands out as the PCMag Editors&rsquo; Choice for Browser-based Password Management, but there are many options out there. Often, the best password managers also come included in premium Security Suites. In the case of Bitdefender, this comes in <a href="https://www.bitdefender.com.au/solutions/premium-security" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Bitdefender Premium Security</a> and above.</p><h3>Be wary of unusual payment methods</h3><p>If someone insists on payment via gift cards, wire transfers, or cryptocurrency, your scam radar should be beeping loudly. These payment methods are often favoured by fraudsters because they're difficult to trace or reverse.</p><h3>Do your research</h3><p>In the age of information, ignorance is a choice. Before engaging in any financial transaction or sharing personal information, do some digging. A quick internet search can often reveal if others have encountered similar scams. There are some <a href="https://www.bitdefender.com/blog/labs/tag/scam-research/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">great resources</a> out there to keep yourself up-to-date on the latest threats.</p><h3>Trust your gut</h3><p>If something feels off, it probably is. Your intuition is a powerful tool in recognising scams. If a situation makes you uncomfortable or seems strange, listen to that inner voice. It's always better to be safe than sorry.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Remember, protecting yourself from fraud isn't about becoming paranoid; it's about being prepared. By cultivating a healthy scepticism and following these practical tips, you can significantly reduce your risk of falling victim to scams. Even if you don&rsquo;t want to spend an arm and a leg on antivirus, there are plenty of <a href="https://au.pcmag.com/antivirus/44373/the-best-free-antivirus-protection" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">lightweight, free options</a> available to provide a bit of extra peace of mind. As well as tools like <a href="https://www.bitdefender.com.au/solutions/scamio.html" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Bitdefender Scamio</a>, a free AI scam detector for Web, Messenger, and WhatsApp.</p><p>In the end, the best defense against fraud is an informed and vigilant mind. So keep your wits about you, your personal information close, and those Nigerian princes at arm's length. Happy scam-spotting!</p>]]></content:encoded>

This is a departure from its previous statement, which said "The Control Panel is in the process of being deprecated in favor of the Settings app."

"The Settings app [...] offers a more modern and streamlined experience," Microsoft said in the support document.</p><h2><strong>Say goodbye to the Control Panel</strong></h2><p>The Control Panel has been a part of Windows since 1985, but as mentioned, Microsoft will officially part ways with the nostalgic feature. Control Panel allowed users to add devices and printers, adjust the date and time, personalize their desktop, remove unwanted programs, and more.</p><p>However, the Settings app, which launched alongside Windows 8 in 2012, has become the new destination for many of these tasks and has gradually taken over its functions.</p><p>Microsoft hasn't announced when, exactly, the Control Panel will officially face its demise. However, many will appreciate the heads up. </p><p>With Control Panel being around for nearly 40 years (since Windows 1.0), its departure marks the end of an era &mdash; one that will be remembered by longtime PC users as a key part of the Windows experience.</p>]]></content:encoded>

New capture button </strong></h2><p><strong><em>Available on iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, iPhone 16 Pro Max</em></strong></p><p>The most significant camera upgrade, beyond the new ultrawide lens, is the introduction of the capture button. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>This new lens promises better light gathering, meaning your shots in dimly lit environments are about to get a whole lot better. A late August report from Apple Insider gives this rumor some solid backing. </p><p>The ultrawide camera normally falls short in the sharpness department compared to the main camera. If this 48-megapixel upgrade is the real deal, it could finally iron out those nagging issues with crispness and clarity.</p><p><em>For more information on what's to come from Apple, check out our rumor hubs for the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/iphone-16-rumors" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">iPhone 16 </a></em><em>and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-watch-10-everything-rumor-we-know-so-far" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple Watch Series 10.</a></em></p>]]></content:encoded>

"Because of this, the protection of personal data was not sufficient," said the announcement.</p><p>The fine is the end result of a complaint filed by 170 French Uber drivers to a France-based human rights group. The complaint was then escalated to the Dutch DPA since Uber's European headquarters is in the Netherlands.</p><p>This isn't the first time the EU has brought the hammer down on Uber for data privacy violations. In 2018, the transportation and delivery giant was fined 600,000 euros for a <a href="https://www.autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/en/current/dutch-dpa-fine-for-data-breach-uber" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">data breach</a> and 10 million euros in 2023 for <a href="https://www.autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/en/current/uber-fined-eu10-million-for-infringement-of-privacy-regulations" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">privacy infringement</a> of its European drivers.</p><p>Other Big Tech companies have faced the consequences of the EU's strict laws around protecting user data. In 2021, Amazon was slapped with a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/amazon-gdpr-fine-eu" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">$886 million</a> penalty for failing to comply with the GDPR, and more recently, Meta was hit with a whopping <a href="https://mashable.com/article/meta-data-eu-record-breaking-fine-billion" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">$1.3 billion fine</a> for improper transfer of data to the US.</p><p>The Dutch DPA said in its announcement that Uber has "ended the violation." However, in a statement to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/26/24228589/uber-eu-fine-gdpr-driver-data-transfer" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">The Verge</a>, Uber says it plans to appeal the ruling.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            Dyson Airwrap vs. Shark FlexStyle: Here's which hot air tool is worth your money

<p>However, a $339.99 price tag makes the Airwrap much more of a competitor. The airflow generally feels better on the Airwrap, the attachments are more streamlined, and the curling barrels don't require you to switch them out to change the direction of your curls. With this deal, you'll get six attachments, while the FlexStyle that starts at $279.99 only comes with three attachments &mdash; the <a href="https://zdcs.link/jo0Av?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=model%20that%20starts%20at%20%24300&object_type=article&object_uuid=02a1HjyoFkeaUPGjQWahfnt&short_url=jo0Av&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">model that starts at $300</a> comes with five different attachments.</p><p>If you have curly hair, unfortunately, this deal only applies to the straight-to-wavy model, meaning there will be no diffuser or wide-tooth comb in the attachment selection. Instead, the Complete Long comes with the following: a Coanda smoothing dryer, a 1.2-inch Airwrap long barrel, a 1.6-inch Airwrap long barrel, a firm smoothing brush, a soft smoothing brush, a round volumizing brush, and a carrying case. Whether you buy from Walmart or Dyson, your product will also come with a one-year warranty.</p><p>There are very few scenarios where I think the Airwrap is worth springing for over the FlexStyle, but this refurbished deal is one of them. You can grab the multi-styler in the blue/blush, nickel/copper, or ceramic pop colorways.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>While there are only two brand new attachments, Dyson's also made a few smart swaps from the old Airwrap Complete lineup, which included the Coanda smoothing dryer, a 1.2-inch Airwrap long barrel, a 1.6-inch Airwrap long barrel, a firm smoothing brush, a soft smoothing brush, and the round volumizing brush.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Instead of the smaller 1.2-inch barrel, Dyson went for a tapered option with a 20mm tip that can help you achieve tighter (and ideally longer-lasting) curls. They got rid of the firm smoothing brush, which was a redundancy with the soft smoothing brush. They also decided to include the 2.2-inch diameter round brush instead of the 1.5-inch round brush &mdash; for the Airwrap Complete, the former was only included for the curly and coily Airwrap. Finally, Dyson brought back the fast dryer, which a Dyson spokesperson confirmed is just a new name for the "pre-styling" dryer found on the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Lbg7b?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=first-generation%20Airwrap&object_type=article&object_uuid=057dlvNco1K7SCBTLftYDD4&short_url=Lbg7b&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">first-generation Airwrap</a>.</p><p>As for the Airwrap i.d. for curly and coil hair, the lineup includes (new attachments bolded): </p><ol><li><p><strong>Conical Airwrap barrel</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Wave+Curl diffuser</strong></p></li><li><p>Firm smoothing brush</p></li><li><p>Large round volumizing brush</p></li><li><p>Wide tooth comb</p></li><li><p>Fast dryer</p></li></ol><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Although there are also two brand new attachments for this version, it closely resembles the Airwrap Complete Diffuse, which also had a diffuser, wide tooth comb, large round volumizing brush, and firm smoothing brush. Like the straight/wavy Airwrap, Dyson replaced a 1.2-inch barrel for the Conical Airwrap barrel, swapped the old diffuser model for this new one, and swapped the Coanda smoothing dryer for the fast dryer.</p><p>While it's hard to tell without testing how exactly it does this, the new Wave+Curl diffuser is designed to disperse airflow in two different ways: a dome mode and a diffuse mode. According to Dyson, the dome mode helps define natural waves and curls, while the diffuse mode adds volume. To me, that sounds like it might be offering the adjustability found on the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/shark-flexstyle" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Shark FlexStyle's diffuser</a>.</p><p>Finally, Dyson's also released the <a href="https://zdcs.link/lVWBd?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=blade%20concentrator%20attachment&object_type=article&object_uuid=057dlvNco1K7SCBTLftYDD4&short_url=lVWBd&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">blade concentrator attachment</a>, which is not currently included with either Airwrap i.d., but can be purchased separately for $39.99, along with the 18 other Airwrap attachments offered (including those listed above).

<h2>An app to style your hair</h2><p>The other major change with the Airwrap i.d. is the app compatibility. The Bluetooth-enabled Airwrap connects to the MyDyson app, which now includes the i.d. curl program. There, users can enter their hair profile, and the app will generate a styling routine for you, including wrapping, styling, and cold shot time.</p><p>With your routine programmed, you can then activate the Airwrap to take control with one press of the power button. It's not that much less work than hitting those buttons yourself, but considering there is<em>&nbsp;</em>a learning curve to curling your hair with the Airwrap, I could see this being a useful feature. We'll see how it works in practice when I get my hands on the Airwrap i.d.</p><p>Also, as you can likely guess from the name "i.d. curl", at this time the app only includes styling recommendations for the curl function of the Airwrap i.d.</p><h2>Where to buy the Dyson Airwrap i.d.</h2><p>If you're interested in picking up the latest Airwrap, it's available at <a href="http://Dyson.com" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Dyson.com</a> for $599.99 for both straight and curly hair in two different colorways: vinca blue/topaz and ceramic patina/topaz.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h2><strong>Google Pixel 9 Pro XL battery life</strong></h2><p>According to our battery test, which involves running a TikTok video loop continuously over Wi-Fi at 50% brightness, the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL lasted a whopping <strong>18 hours and 50 minutes </strong>&mdash; that's nearly 19 hours. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Because our in-house testing is based on a continuous, non-stop video rundown, the average user will likely be able to eke out even more battery life out of the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL based on usage that involves some standby time, as well as calling, texting, web browsing, and more.</p><p>Here's a look at some of the other runtimes we've recorded on the same battery life test:</p><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra - 13 hours and 1 minute</strong></p><p><strong>iPhone 15 Pro Max - 14 hours and 53 minutes</strong></p><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 - 12 hours and 13 minutes</strong></p><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 - 12 hours and 44 minutes</strong></p><p>The Google Pixel 9 Pro XL runs on the Google Tensor G4 chip, which likely contributes to its long battery life. Based on the approximate 19-hour runtime, the processor is quite energy efficient. The downside, however, is that the performance figures, based on Geekbench 6, isn't very impressive. With a multi-core score of just 4,569, it's less powerful than even the Google Pixel 8 Pro that dropped last year.</p><p><em>For more details on Google's new current-generation phones, check out our full reviews on the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/google-pixel-9-pro-xl" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Google Pixel 9 Pro XL</a></em><em> and the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/google-pixel-9" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Google Pixel 9.</a></em></p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>When you're embarking on <a href="https://mashable.com/category/pets" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">pet parenthood</a>, the start-up costs are expensive. Between vet appointments, a crate, leash, harness, food, toys, well, the list could go on and on. What we're saying is, pet ownership is expensive so getting a little something back can go a long way.</p><p>For new <a href="https://zdcs.link/OdVBD?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Chewy&object_type=article&object_uuid=05rnyhWtr5C2wXw6SFuxNsy&short_url=OdVBD&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Chewy</a> customers, when you spend over $49 and use code 'WELCOME' at checkout, you'll receive a $20 e-gift card. Since we know you'll need a refresh on supply after a couple of months, whether it be food, treats, or toys, that $20 e-gift card will come in handy.</p><p>If you've yet to use Chewy, just know it will save you plenty of trips as it ships pet supplies straight to your door. This is especially helpful for heavy supplies like big bags of kibble or cat litter that you're sick of lugging home.</p><h3>More dog day deals</h3><h3>Leashes, harnesses, and accessories</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/6XGk2?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Frisco%20Traffic%20Leash%20with%20Dual%20Padded%20Handles%20%26%20Poop%20Bag%20Dispenser&object_type=article&object_uuid=05rnyhWtr5C2wXw6SFuxNsy&short_url=6XGk2&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Frisco Traffic Leash with Dual Padded Handles &amp;

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03s0iseBaRTLSLFmfglvhum/hero-image.jpg" alt="The OpenAI logo on a smartphone against the backdrop of colorful light flares"><p><a href="https://mashable.com/category/openai" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">OpenAI</a> has expressed its support for a California bill requiring AI-generated content to be labeled as such. </p><p>According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-supports-california-ai-bill-requiring-watermarking-synthetic-content-2024-08-26/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Reuters</a>, OpenAI sent a letter of support to California State Assembly member Buffy Wicks, who authored the bill, titled the California Provenance, Authenticity and Watermarking Standards Act (<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billCompareClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB3211&amp;showamends=false" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">AB 3211</a>). The legislation passed by the state Assembly vote would require AI companies to put an invisible watermark on all content made or "significantly modified" by their AI models. Next, the bill is up for vote at the state Senate and would go on to review by CA Governor Gavin Newsom if passed. </p><p>The bill would also require AI companies to provide "watermark decoders" so that users can easily identify whether content is AI-generated or not.   </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Image-generating models on the market vary in their levels of photorealism, protective guardrails, and copyright protections. DALL-E 3 is OpenAI's latest text-to-image model. As of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/openai-watermarks-chatgpt-images-dalle-3" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">February</a>, images generated by the model on ChatGPT contain C2PA metadata, which provides the image's provenance. Similarly, Google has its own SynthID tool for watermarking images created by its model, Gemini. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/grok-2-beta-elon-musk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Grok-2</a>, which Elon Musk's xAI company released, seems to have the least amount of restrictions since it can generate images of public figures and copyrighted works. Midjourney, one of the most advanced image models, is currently embroiled in a legal battle over copyright infringement. </p><p>In the letter viewed by Reuters, OpenAI underscored the importance of transparency of the provenance of images and other AI-generated content. "New technology and standards can help people understand the origin of content they find online, and avoid confusion between human-generated and photorealistic AI-generated content," said OpenAI Chief Strategy Officer Jason Kwon in the letter. </p><p>The issue of AI-generated deepfakes and misinformation is especially significant with the upcoming U.S. Presidential Election. Already, AI-generated images of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/trump-ai-kamala-harris-communist" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Kamala Harris</a> speaking at a communist rally and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/donald-trump-taylor-swift-endorsement-truth-social" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Taylor Swift</a> endorsing Donald Trump have circulated on social media. </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[The iPhone 16 launch is in just a few weeks, according to reports, so let's talk about the five most interesting new features.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03Aw4aK1IGQQRXbwN4I9r0x/hero-image.jpg" alt="iPhone 16 imagined illustration"><p>The i<a href="https://mashable.com/article/iphone-16-rumors" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Phone 16 buzz</a> is getting louder and louder as we approach its <a href="https://mashable.com/article/iphone-16-release-date" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">reported announcement date of Sept. 10</a>. As someone who's been tracking the iPhone 16 rumor mill all year, there are dozens of credible rumors about the iPhone 16.</p><p>But the question is, which rumors will likely get the masses to upgrade? </p><p>I've decided to round up five new rumored features across the iPhone 16 &mdash; including iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max &mdash; that may get you to ditch your phone in favor of Apple's next-gen smartphone.</p><h2><strong>iPhone 16: 5 new features that may be worth the upgrade</strong></h2><p>Many iPhone users are often interested in camera quality and top-of-the-line shooter features. After all, Apple is known for putting a lot of effort into tweaking and upgrading its camera system, which is often praised for its crisp and clean photos.</p><p>That being said, you'll likely be happy to know that the iPhone 16 will have a new button that will make accessing your favorite camera features easier.</p><h2><strong>1. New capture button</strong></h2><p>Apple is reportedly placing a new capture button on all four iPhone 16 models. </p><p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-11/iphone-16-preview-bigger-screens-new-colors-camera-button-ai-and-a18-chip-lzpk5495?sref=HrWXCALa" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>, a reliable leaker and Apple analyst, it will allow you to conveniently do the following:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Use a swiping gesture to zoom in and out while shooting photos and videos</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Use a pressing gesture for triggering autofocus</strong></p></li></ul><p>And per a report from <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/08/22/exclusive-every-iphone-16-iphone-16-pro-camera-spec-capture-button-detail-revealed" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Apple Insider</em></a>, it may be able to do the following as well:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Cycle through filters</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Adjust the exposure</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Tweak the degree of background blur</strong></p></li></ul><p>It will be reportedly located on the lower-right side of the phones. Plus, it will likely be capacitive. In other words, it won't have a physical button that will require you to push it down to actuate. It will simply require a finger touch. (It will likely feature some haptics so you know it's been "activated.")</p><h2><strong>2. New 48-megapixel ultrawide lens</strong></h2><p>This feature is exclusive to the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max models. Their predecessors, the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, had a 12MP ultrawide shooter.</p><p>This time around, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/01/14/iphone-16-specs-ram-5g-support-and-more/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">according to Jeff Pu</a>, a reliable tech analyst from a Hong Kong investment firm, the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max models will feature a brand-spankin' new 48-megapixel ultrawide lens. This should lead to better wide-field-of-view photos. So whether you're taking photos of stunning landscapes, group shots, or creative perspectives, the iPhone 16 Pro models' pictures should offer more detail, and according to Pu, better light gathering in dimmer environments.</p><h2><strong>3. Thinner bezels</strong></h2><p>The iPhone 16 Pro models will reportedly have <a href="https://mashable.com/article/iphone-16-pro-thinnest-bezels" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">world-record breaking feature</a>. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>According to rumors, Apple is ditching last year's Blue Titanium color for a new bronze-like hue called "Desert Titanium."</p><h2><strong>5. Improved Night Mode</strong></h2><p>According to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/04/iphone-16-pro-stacked-camera-sensor/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, the iPhone 16 Pro models (i.e., iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max) will have a new "stacked design" on the rear cameras. </p><p>Without getting into the weeds of this technical upgrade, Kuo claims that a stacked design increases light capture and offers improved dynamic range. As a result, Night Mode is expected to get a sweet boost.</p><p><em>If you're curious to see more of an exhaustive list of all the new features coming to the new iPhone 16, check out our iPhone <a href="https://mashable.com/article/iphone-16-rumors" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">16 rumor hub.</a></em></p><p></p>]]></content:encoded>

While this deal has been active for some time, we don't know how long it's going to continue. So, if you're considering splurging on the premium headphones, we recommend claiming the $80 in savings before it's gone. Along with three different noise-cancellation modes, these headphones tout spatial audio features, a 24-hour battery life, and design features like soft ear cushions and a pressure-evening band that create utmost comfort.  </p><h2>Best budget headphones deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

This week, you can score a 2nd Generation pair for just $89 at Amazon - saving you $40. They're powered by the Apple H1 chip, which enables them to deliver rich, powerful sound. Plus, with the charging case, they offer 24 hours of playtime. AirPods are an especially great pick for those who have a lot of active devices: after an initial one-tap setup with your devices, AirPods are always connected. This means that sound can seamlessly switch between your iPhone, Apple Watch, Mac, iPad, and Apple TV depending on what you're using. </p><h2>More of this week's best headphones deals:</h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/wek3D?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Sony%20WF-C700N%20Truly%20Wireless%20Noise%20Canceling%20in-Ear%20Bluetooth%20Earbud%20Headphones&object_type=article&object_uuid=01AXJ2C65zlQP0pYfT5oLZj&short_url=wek3D&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Sony WF-C700N Truly Wireless Noise Canceling in-Ear Bluetooth Earbud Headphones</a> &mdash;

You can also move your cursor around a map to shine a spot of sunlight on a particular location. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>There's something magical about the idea of having the power to bring actual sunlight to a location just by moving your finger around a virtual app. But is it actually possible? <em>Is it smart to do?</em> And would it really look exactly as portrayed in the video?</p><p>Probably not, at least not in the near future. Nowack himself later tweeted that the video was a "simple demonstration," with "still lots of work ahead" of the company. He doesn't make it clear where the light source in the video is coming from, like perhaps a drone (we asked Ben, and we will update the article when we hear back). But we do know that the company tested its mirrors on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BcDoDs89rc&amp;t=649s" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">hot air balloon</a>, but hasn't got any satellites in space yet. In a video dated July 2024, Reflect's founders said they plan to launch their "first very large deployable reflector" in the next "four to five months," with getting that to space being "the next step."</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Despite the fact that the video is dubious, the demo was a successful attention-grabber. Co-founder and CTO of Reflect Orbital, Tristan Semmelhack, <a href="https://x.com/4TristanS" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">wrote on X</a> that the company already has "30k applications for a spot of light and climbing every second," and that it "10x yesterday's count in just a day."</p><p>With 30,000 applications and a limited amount of time in which a satellite can point a mirror at something, the idea seems quite limited in scope, even if it ever gets off the ground. But Reflect Orbital's ambitions are larger than a single satellite. According to Nowack, the company is developing an entire <a href="https://mashable.com/article/starlink-spacex-satellites-orbital-debris" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">constellation of satellites</a> "to sell sunlight to thousands of solar farms after dark."</p><p>"By precisely reflecting sunlight that is endlessly available in space to specific targets on the ground, we can create a world where sunlight powers solar farms for longer than just daytime, and in doing this, commoditize sunlight," he <a href="https://x.com/bennbuilds/status/1767961258907808142" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">wrote</a>. </p><p>The company currently splits its website into two parts: Lighting and Energy, with the first one focusing on bringing a spot of sunlight to some point on Earth after dark, seemingly for fun. The energy part is about bringing the sun's energy to a solar farm at night, thus perhaps adding some extra juice to the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/first-major-offshore-wind-farm-us" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">energy grid</a> in that location when it's needed. </p><p>Many questions arise, from whether Reflect Orbital's satellites can actually deliver enough sunlight for either of these applications, to whether an entire fleet of mirror-bearing <a href="https://mashable.com/article/space-junk-rocket-debris-footage" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">satellites</a> would pollute our skies with unnecessary light sources, to whether this (if used on a large scale) could disrupt <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-many-species-live-on-earth" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">flora and fauna</a> on Earth (some of these questions are tackled by Nowack in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDV3v0Xb4ow" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">video</a>).

<p>Here are all the ways in which the new PS5 Slim is different from its predecessor. This way, you'll be able to know which console &mdash; PS5 or PS5 Slim &mdash; is right for you.</p><h2><strong>PS5 vs PS5 Slim: price</strong></h2><p>For context, the <strong>original, non-slim</strong> PS5 has two versions: a digital one (without a disc drive) and one <em>with </em>a disc drive. The same can be said for the PS5 Slim; it's got a digital version and a disc one. </p><p>For whatever reason, Sony decided to <em>not</em> drop the prices of the new PS5 Slim models.

<p>With that in mind, yes, the digital-only PS5 Slim is a money-saver in comparison to the one with a disc drive, but <strong>not </strong>in comparison to the digital-only model that launched three years ago. </p><p>The new price also means that buying a digital model before purchasing the additional disc drive would cost <em>more</em> than just snagging the version with a built-in drive. I don't really have a good explanation for any of that.</p><p>My only advice is this: If you want a PS5 that only costs $399, you better get one now. This is an important note: <strong>Once the existing stock of both original models sells out, the new slim models will replace them on store shelves. </strong></p><h2><strong>PS5 vs PS5 Slim: size</strong></h2><p>Obviously, size is what many gamers are most concerned about here, so let's get right to it. Looking at Sony's stated dimensions, you can see that the new PS5 is indeed smaller than the original:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Original PS5 (disc version)</strong>: 104mm (height) x 390mm (width) x 260mm (depth)</p></li><li><p><strong>PS5 Slim (disc version):</strong> 96mm (height) x 358mm (width) x 216mm (depth)</p></li></ul><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h2><strong>PS5 vs PS5 Slim: performance and storage</strong></h2><p>Another important aspect of the new PS5 models to get out of the way is that they have the exact same internal capabilities as the originals. This isn't a PS4 vs. PS4 Pro situation. Games will run exactly the same across the spectrum of PS5 consoles.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>One little internal bonus that owners of the new PS5s get, however, comes in the form of expanded storage. For some reason, the original PS5 only had 825GB of onboard storage, with the option to expand via external SSDs. The new ones have a full 1TB of built-in space, so you can install a few extra games depending on how big they are.</p><h2><strong>PS5 vs PS5 Slim: disc drive</strong></h2><p>Just like at the PS5's launch in late 2020, there are two PS5 Slim models. One of them has a built-in disc drive and the other one is digital-only.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2><strong>Microsoft Surface Laptop 7 is the best Windows laptop of 2024: 3 reasons why</strong></h2><p>Stay with me here. In order for you to understand <em>why </em>the Surface Laptop 7 is best Windows laptop of 2024, you'll need a little historical context. Because the Surface family wasn't <em>always </em>highly recommended &mdash; until now.</p><p>A few years ago, I was smack talking the Surface Laptop 5 when I reviewed it for a different publication. (The Surface Laptop 5 is <em>technically </em>the Surface Laptop 7's predecessor. There's a Surface Laptop 6, but only for business and not available in stores.) I always wanted Microsoft Surface laptops to win so badly &mdash; but they just couldn't live up to my expectations.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>It's not that Microsoft Surface laptops were awful <em>per se</em> &mdash; they just kept getting outperformed by cheaper, better competitors. So I couldn't, in good conscience, recommend them.</p><p>Now, if you were to tell me that, in 2024, I'd be recommending a Surface laptop, I'd say, "You're out of your mind!" But here I am, as a laptop expert, actually suggesting a Microsoft laptop to my readers. But you know what? I'm backing this up. <strong>I have proof </strong>that it's the best Windows laptop of the year. Here are my three reasons:</p><h3><strong>1. Microsoft Surface Laptop 7 has the best battery life I've ever seen</strong></h3><p>When I tested the Microsoft Surface Laptop 7 to see how long it could last on a single charge, it <strong><em>just. wouldn't. die.</em></strong></p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>To my surprise, the Surface Laptop 7 delivered a battery runtime of <strong>22 hours and 50 minutes.</strong> That's nearly 23 hours! This is literally unheard of for Windows laptops these days.</p><p>This is <strong>the best battery runtime</strong> we've ever recorded at Mashable in recent years. Here are some of the other runtimes of our laptops:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://mashable.com/review/m3-macbook-air-15-inch" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><strong>15-inch M3 MacBook Air</strong></a><strong> - 10 hours and 52 minutes</strong></p></li><li><p><a href="https://mashable.com/review/hp-omnibook-x" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><strong>HP OmniBook X</strong></a><strong> - 16 hours and 47 minutes</strong></p></li><li><p><a href="https://mashable.com/review/lenovo-yoga-9i-2-in-1-gen-9" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><strong>Lenovo Yoga 9 2-in-1</strong></a><strong> - 7 hours and 21 minutes</strong></p></li></ul><p>As you'll find out in the next section, the reason behind the Microsoft Surface Laptop 7's success with battery life is its new Qualcomm processor. (I'm sorry, but Intel just isn't cutting it anymore.)</p><p>Can you guess which chip was inside the Lenovo Yoga 9 2-in-1, which lasted only a measly 7 hours? It certainly wasn't a Qualcomm chip. (<strong>Spoiler alert:</strong> It was an Intel chip.)</p><h3><strong>2. Microsoft Surface Laptop 7 performance beats all of its rivals, including the MacBook</strong></h3><p>I don't want to bore you with too many details about chipsets, but they're crucial to bring up to help you understand why Microsoft Surface <em>finally</em> has positive critical reception from testers after a few tumultuous years.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Long story short, Intel, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1130315/worldwide-x86-intel-amd-laptop-market-share/#:~:text=Intel%20processors%20made%20up%2071,CPUs%20detected%20via%20the%20tests." target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">the most popular chipset maker for Windows</a>, was holding the Microsoft Surface series back from laptop nirvana. Even Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/3/17191986/apple-intel-cpu-processor-design-competition" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">stopped dealing with Intel a few years ago</a>. In 2020, Apple introduced its new in-house, custom ARM chips (i.e., M-series processors). After Apple debuted these chips in the M1 MacBook Air and M1 MacBook Pro four years ago, it never looked back. Why? They were a huge success, delivering unmatched battery life and performance. (Apple's current-gen MacBooks are now rocking M3 series chips and it's <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-every-mac-line-will-get-m4" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">reportedly eyeing an M4 release soon</a>).</p><p>Now, non-Apple vendors are finally hopping aboard the "Intel ain't it" train, too, thanks to Qualcomm, an Intel rival. Qualcomm announced it had a chipset, dubbed the Snapdragon X Elite processor, that is <em>so </em>good, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/cpu/qualcomm-claims-its-snapdragon-x-plus-is-an-m3-beater-but-it-is-really#:~:text=According%20to%20Qualcomm's%20benchmarks%20for,M3%20processor%2C%20another%20large%20boast." target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">it beats all M3-based MacBooks</a>. Now, I was skeptical and I didn't believe it at first. But this new Snapdragon X Elite processor was packed inside the new Microsoft Surface Laptop 7 that dropped this year &mdash; and it blew its rivals out of the water.</p><p>With "Best performance mode" turned on in Settings, the Surface Laptop 7 notched an <em>incredible</em> multi-core score of <strong>14,548</strong> on Geekbench 6. For context, here are the multi-core scores of other laptops I've tested this year:</p><ul><li><p><strong>14-inch M3 MacBook Pro - 11,998</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>15-inch M3 MacBook Air - 12,057</strong></p></li></ul><p>And yes, I purposely highlighted Apple's M3 MacBooks here to prove a point (i.e., Qualcomm was right). This wasn't just a fluke either. The <a href="https://mashable.com/review/hp-omnibook-x" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">HP OmniBook X</a> I reviewed this year, also packed with a Snapdragon X Elite chip, is almost as good as the Surface Laptop 7, but delivered a <em>slightly </em>lower multi-core score of <strong>13,888.</strong></p><h3><strong>3. Microsoft Surface Laptop 7 makes Windows fun again with AI</strong></h3><p>Remember when Windows used to be fun? As a kid (I'm now a Millennial adult for context), I used to mess around on Paint, play Microsoft 3D Pinball, and watch visualizers bounce along to the music I played on Windows Media Player.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>However, as a laptop reviewer, I know more than anyone that no machine is ever perfect. One flaw that I spotted with the Surface Laptop 7 is app incompatibility. It's something I discovered when I tried to install the Apple Music app. I typically have no issues with doing this on other Windows systems, but it looks like some developers haven't enabled Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite support for their apps yet.</p><p>The Surface Laptop 7 is not a gaming PC by any means (it lacks a discrete GPU), but I'll admit that you can get away with some <em>light </em>gaming on it. So keep in mind that some games, according to <a href="https://www.worksonwoa.com/games/?compatibility=Unplayable" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">this list</a>, may not run properly on the Surface Laptop 7.</p><p>Overall, though, the Surface Laptop 7 has never-ending battery life, engaging AI features, zippy performance, a sturdy, anti-fingerprint chassis, and more. How could it not be the best Windows laptop of 2024?</p><p>The Surface Laptop 7 is <a href="https://zdcs.link/kn6Dg?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=%241%2C599%20on%20Amazon.&object_type=article&object_uuid=05djrP5PjtVB7CcMtvrTOAP&short_url=kn6Dg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">$1,599 on Amazon.</a></p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

If you have yet to see Cage in all his serial killer glory or you want to make your skin crawl once again from the (dis)comfort of your home, here's everything you need to know about how to watch <em>Longlegs</em>.</p><h2>What is <em>Longlegs</em> about?</h2><p><em>Longlegs</em> follows the FBI investigation of a decades-long serial killing spree in Oregon. There's no other evidence at the crime scenes except for cryptic letters signed "Longlegs." <em>It Follows</em> star Maika Monroe is the lead FBI agent, Lee Harker, who is assigned to investigate the serial killer&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;and it turns out she might be more connected to the case than it seems. Oh, and that serial killer?

<h2>Is <em>Longlegs</em> worth watching?</h2><p>A surprise hit, <em>Longlegs</em> has brought it over $100 million at the <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt23468450/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">worldwide box office</a>. That makes it the highest grossing indie film of the year and the top-grossing R-rated horror film of 2024. And considering Neon's production budget under $10 million (before prints and advertising costs), that makes it a massive success. </p><p>Of course, box office numbers don't mean much unless people actually like the film. Fortunately, critic reviews are largely positive for the Nic Cage serial killer thriller. It currently has an <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/longlegs" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">86 percent critic rating</a> on Rotten Tomatoes. Interestingly, though, audiences aren't quite as enthusiastic, giving Longlegs a 60 percent score based on over 2,500 ratings.</p><p>Mashable's own critic noted that while Cage's performance was brilliant, the film "doesn&rsquo;t fully (or even partway) commit to its most bone-chilling ideas."</p><p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/longlegs-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Read Mashable's full review of Longlegs</em></a>.</p><h2>Can I watch <em>Longlegs</em> at home?</h2><p>While it's still in select theaters nationwide, you can skip the big screen and watch <em>Longlegs</em> at home as of Aug. 23.

<p>Rather than paying $7.99 per month for Hulu, which adds up to $95.98 in a year, you can opt for an annual subscription and save 16%. An annual subscription with ads costs just $79.99 up front, which drops the monthly fee down to just $6.67 per month. Sure, you'll have to pay more up front, but you'll end up keeping more in your pocket in the long run. It also saves you from inevitable price hikes for at least a year.</p><h3>Best bundle deal: <a href="https://zdcs.link/mVrm6?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Get%20Hulu%20and%20Disney%2B%20for%2037%25%20off&object_type=article&object_uuid=008fakVaqYYRZS5XHu7WQvo&short_url=mVrm6&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Get Hulu and Disney+ for 37% off</a></h3><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>If you're already a Disney+ subscriber or you want to get more bang for your buck, you can sign up for the Disney Duo Basic bundle and get both Disney+ and Hulu for $9.99 per month. That's just $2 more than paying for Hulu alone, or a savings of 37%. Even better, if you're a sports fan, you can throw ESPN+ into the mix for only $14.99 per month total. That's 44% in savings on all three services.</p><h3>Best for students: <a href="https://zdcs.link/W0el7?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Hulu%20Student&object_type=article&object_uuid=008fakVaqYYRZS5XHu7WQvo&short_url=W0el7&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Hulu Student</a></h3><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>One of the best ways to get free streaming services, including Hulu, is to switch your mobile plan to T-Mobile's Go5G Next plan. Customers on this plan get Hulu with ads included in their plan for no extra cost, plus Netflix and Apple TV+. If you're already on a Go5G Next plan, head over to the T-Mobile promo page and choose "redeem now" to <a href="https://zdcs.link/oeZ4Y?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=claim%20your%20offer&object_type=article&object_uuid=008fakVaqYYRZS5XHu7WQvo&short_url=oeZ4Y&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">claim your offer</a>.

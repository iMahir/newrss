Though standard in the industry, programs like these have always treaded a moral grey area, and guidelines for the 2024 Team Pixel program have crossed a line for some creators.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.threads.net/@migueldeicaza/post/C-uruYTJiEF" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">screenshots</a> <a href="https://x.com/Marks_Tech/status/1824206273929416758?t=zS1h_uTTs0FJ4unYFHOqVA" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">posted online</a>, a Google form used for Team Pixel sign ups said that creators that join Team Pixel "are expected to feature the Google Pixel device in place of any competitor mobile devices." It goes on to note that "if it appears other brands are being preferred over the Pixel, we will need to cease the relationship between the brand and the creator."</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Voices in the creator community have said that these terms make it impossible to post unbiased reviews, which is crucial to building viewer trust and creator reputation.

Previously, Matlock says, creators were only required to use hashtags #teampixel or #giftfromgoogle to comply with FTC disclosures.</p><p>YouTuber Kevin Nether of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Techninjaspeaks/featured" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">The Tech Ninja</a> channel posted to X that he had also <a href="https://x.com/TechNinjaSpeaks/status/1824433555608326162" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">quit Team Pixel</a> due to the new terms. He told <em>The Verge</em> that he had not seen that language in previous Team Pixel surveys used to recruit for the program. He also noted that demands for exclusivity were usually accompanied by discussions of payment and disclosure.</p><p>Marques Brownlee, perhaps the most popular tech reviewer on YouTube, <a href="https://x.com/MKBHD/status/1824445882542027133?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1824445882542027133%7Ctwgr%5E3e00f75903c8f1658a01282c6006446b9b16a5bb%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F8%2F16%2F24221755%2Fgoogle-team-pixel-reviews-influencers" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">weighed in</a> on the situation on X. Though he has never participated in Team Pixel, he called the program a "clever way" for Google "to guarantee some positive press coverage." Lifestyle influencers, for example, make money from product affiliation and can post about the phone without consequence. But "here's where it gets confusing," said Brownlee. "A lot of tech reviewers or even people budding up and starting to become tech reviewers, saw that early device seeding as... a way to get in [with Google]... and that's what muddies the waters."</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>It is standard practice for companies to gift new products to creators and influencers in the hopes that they will use the product on camera or encourage their audience to buy it. These arrangements are usually a win-win for both parties, with the potential to significantly expand an influencer's access to brands. In the case of Team Pixel, for example, the influencer gets a free phone and, by posting about it, can rack up views and social currency while opening the door to collaborations with other big-name brands. Meanwhile, Google secures broad media exposure for a new product for the price of a single unit.</p><p>The influencer <em>should</em> note when a product is a gift, but FTC disclosure guidelines are often unclear and oversight is woefully lax. As a result, consumers can't always be sure if what they're seeing online has been influenced by a behind-the-scenes exchange of money or access.</p><p>These influencer programs can overlap with those that target news outlets or reviewers, though Google communications manager Kayla Geier told <em>The Verge </em>that Team Pixel is different from programs that provide news outlets like <em>Mashable</em> and <em>The Verge</em> with new devices for review. "#TeamPixel is a distinct program, separate from our press and creator reviews programs," said Geier. "The goal of #TeamPixel is to get Pixel devices into the hands of content creators, not press and tech reviewers. We missed the mark with this new language that appeared in the #TeamPixel&nbsp;form&nbsp;yesterday, and it has been removed."</p><p>But in his <a href="https://x.com/TechNinjaSpeaks/status/1824433555608326162" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">video announcing his departure</a> from Team Pixel, Nether noted that "A lot of tech reviewers are on Team Pixel because working with Google for some reason, it's really tough to get through." <em>The Verge</em> says it also spoke with independent reviewers and freelance tech journalists who say they were given review units through the Team Pixel program in the past. In their cases, these new terms would threaten the integrity of their work. </p><p>As reported by <em>The Verge,</em> the Team Pixel program is currently run by a third party agency hired by Google. It is unclear if that agency, <a href="https://1000heads.com/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">1000heads</a>, required social media coverage of the phone from creators participating in the 2024 Team Pixel program. </p><p>When reached for comment, a Google spokesperson provided the same statement the company had given to The Verge, above. Mashable has reached out to 1000heads for comment and will update this story if we hear back.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2><strong>What is killing U.S. birds</strong></h2><p>A host of human-caused factors kill <a href="https://mashable.com/article/extinct-animals-2023-bird" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">birds</a>. The most damaging, by far, live among us.</p><p>"The worst of these are feral or outdoor pet cats, estimated to kill as many as <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms2380" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">4 billion birds per year</a>, including many of the backyard songbirds that people value and control our insects," Clark explained. (At minimum, cats probably kill well over 1 billion birds in the U.S. annually.)</p><p>This is why biologists urge people to keep their cats inside. "Just one person keeping their cat indoors can save hundreds, maybe thousands, of birds. That&rsquo;s a no-brainer," bird biologist Nico Arcilla previously told Mashable.</p><p>The next-highest bird killer in the U.S. are buildings (and their windows), estimated to <a href="https://bioone.org/journals/the-condor/volume-116/issue-1/CONDOR-13-090.1/Birdbuilding-collisions-in-the-United-States--Estimates-of-annual/10.1650/CONDOR-13-090.1.full" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">kill some 365 to 988 million birds</a> each year. "Those kills range from the tiniest hummingbirds to large owls," Clark said. (Here's <a href="https://www.birds.cornell.edu/home/seven-simple-actions-to-help-birds/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">how to limit the number of birds</a> that crash into your windows.) And it's not just towering buildings. Any structures or objects in the path of bird flight &mdash; power lines, communication towers, and cars &mdash; contribute to the millions of avian deaths annually, Clark added. Cars kill an estimated 214 million birds each year.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>And then there are innumerable culprits that are difficult to count because they require collecting and assaying bird bodies for toxins. These include rodenticides, agricultural pesticides, water pollution, and beyond. </p><p>Wind turbines, however, are a relatively small player in bird mortality. "Research shows&nbsp;that wind projects rank near the bottom of the list of human-related bird mortalities, resulting in far fewer annual deaths than those caused by house cats, building collisions, or vehicle impacts," the Department of Energy explains. Turbines on land, with huge spinning blades, kill an estimated 234,012 birds annually, <a href="https://www.fws.gov/library/collections/threats-birds" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</a>.</p><h2><strong>Wind farms limit bird deaths</strong></h2><p>Abundant wind energy, which supplies <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/wind/advantages-and-challenges-wind-energy" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">125,000 jobs in the U.S.</a> and <a href="https://climate.mit.edu/ask-mit/would-getting-all-our-electricity-wind-and-solar-power-raise-price-electricity" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">cheap energy</a>, is growing.</p><p>Fortunately, we can build or operate wind farms to curb avian deaths. "There are all sorts of ways that we can limit risks to birds," Jeff Buler, a wildlife ecologist at the University of Delaware, told Mashable.</p><p>This includes locating wind farms away from migratory passages, painting blades black (a visual aid that slashed bird deaths at a Norway wind farm by <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.6592" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">70 percent</a>), adding sound, and using fewer but larger turbines. Turbines can also be turned off on the handful of nights many birds are migrating through a specific region. Buler and other researchers found that by <a href="https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/conl.12887" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">observing radar data</a>, the migration of birds through corridors like the Great Lakes region can be well-predicted, allowing turbine operators the ability to temporarily shut down operations. "You can reduce collisions," Buler said.</p><q>
    "It's way easier to make false claims than back up claims with evidence."
    </q>
<p>While wind farms aren't free of environmental costs, they almost certainly kill far fewer birds than the <a href="https://mashable.com/feature/carbon-footprint-pr-campaign-sham" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">fossil fuel sector</a>, which requires intensive mining and burning of fuels.</p><p>"Coal-, oil-, and natural gas-fired power plants induce avian deaths at various points throughout their fuel cycle: upstream during coal mining, onsite collision and electrocution with operating plant equipment, and downstream poisoning and death caused by acid rain, mercury pollution, and climate change," according to a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1943815X.2012.746993#d1e244" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">research article</a> in the <em>Journal of Integrative Environmental Sciences</em>.

The Slushi is not only a vessel for making a homemade Slurpee without leaving the house but is also an opportunity to treat-ify mundane beverages, like a morning protein shake or afternoon pre-workout electrolyte mix. A slushy in hand just feels like an appropriate accessory to brat summer.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

I had to get my hands on one, too.</p><h2>How does the Ninja Slushi work?</h2><p>Though they both can ultimately whip up frozen drinks, the Ninja Slushi is far different than a blender because the Slushi doesn't require ice.</p><p>Rather, the Slushi achieves that chef's kiss chilled consistency via Ninja's RapidChill Technology, which involves an auger spinning around a cooling cylinder. This approach can take room temperature ingredients from liquid to, well, slushy, in under an hour (give or take a few minutes, depending on the alcohol and sugar content, as well as the size of the batch). </p><p>And even if you can achieve that with a blender, it's ephemeral; frozen margs go to melted margs in a matter of minutes when they're just hanging out in a blender pitcher. The Slushi, however, keeps drinks frozen. Once it hits optimal temperature for the recipe in question, the Slushi beeps and switches from a blinking light to a steady light, but continues spinning and cooling, keeping your recipe perfectly slushied for up to 12 hours. Just mind the condensation.</p><h2>What can you make in the Ninja Slushi?</h2><p>Officially, there are buttons on the front for slush, spiked slush, frapp&eacute;, milkshake, and frozen juice. I hesitate to claim that you can make really any frozen drink that pops into your brain, but it basically feels like that. And if you hatched the idea for something but aren't sure of the exact ingredients, someone has probably already attempted to make it on <a href="https://mashable.com/category/tiktok-trends" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">TikTok</a>.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 max-w-3xl">

<p>My first endeavor was fros&eacute; following the exact recipe in the Ninja booklet:&nbsp;literally just ros&eacute;, juice, and a little bit of simple syrup. It was so easy, so quick, and so damn good &mdash; just like the overpriced ones at the bar.</p><p>Other fun experiments included Slushi'd White Claws plus simple syrup (which turned out to taste incredibly bland and decarbonated after being frozen), a humble can of Pepsi to play out my roommate's dream of an on-demand cola slushy, a blueberry vanilla protein milkshake I saw on TikTok, and a slushy version of my pre-workout electrolyte powder drink. Past this week of testing, I could totally see the Slushi getting weekly use in my household.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 max-w-3xl">

<p>When attempting frapp&eacute; mode, I realized that I'm personally kind of turned off by the idea of coffee in that thick consistency.

After using the rinse cycle button on the machine itself, there are four super basic parts to disassemble and wash &mdash; either by hand or in the dishwasher if there's room. After dealing with the detachable parts, wipe down the metal base and interior of the machine, and then click the parts back on. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2>Ninja Slushi vs. Ninja Creami</h2><p>Before there was the Slushi, there was the Creami. Ninja's 7-in-1 ice cream maker blew up on TikTok when it first came out in 2021 &mdash; likely the thing that tipped Ninja off to how lucrative the Little Treat Trend could be. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

    </div>
<p>While many drinks with that solid-but-not-solid consistency can be made in both machines, the main difference between the two lies in preparation. The Creami can only start with solid bases that you freeze for 24 hours ahead of time, while the Slushi can only start with liquids. Those liquids don't have to start frozen, giving the Slushi the leg up when it comes to spontaneity. </p><h2>Downsides: What can't the Ninja Slushi do?</h2><p>A successful slush depends on a few main ingredient components, one of them being sugar. Though I typically love to trash instructions before reading a single word, I will say that the Slushi booklet is one that you'll definitely actually need to read. Any Slushi recipe needs a certain ratio of sugar to coagulate &mdash;&nbsp;if there's not enough in the ingredients you've dumped in, the machine will beep at you and stop moving. </p><p>On the flip side, a stoppage also occurs if the Slushi senses that the alcohol content is too high compared to the other ingredients. In any case, the lights on the front will flash in a way that coincides with each error so that you can make a quick fix.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>I wish you could all see the defeat on my roommate's face when we realized you actually can't simply pour Diet Coke into the Slushi because Diet obviously has no sugar. The booklet does provide a workaround for this, including ways to subtly add sugar and the appropriate measurements. Still, there's way more math involved than I would have expected &mdash;&nbsp;remember when third grade me cursed fractions because "I would never use them in real life?" </p><p>Because the Slushi doesn't have blades, it cannot crush solid ingredients. To make some sort of healthy frozen smoothie from whole ingredients like frozen berries or kale, they'd have to be in puree form first. I blended these up in our blender ahead of transferring the contents to the Slushi afterward, but at that point, you may as well just add ice to the blender and avoid washing both machines by hand.</p><h2>Is the Ninja Slushi worth it?</h2><p>The Ninja Slushi's splurge-worthiness depends on how much of a frozen drink enthusiast you might be. I mean, people drop double the coin to bring a fancy <a href="https://zdcs.link/Gd3JY?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=espresso%20machine&object_type=review&object_uuid=06LzCOXEAXdRbZGW0jDOnEn&short_url=Gd3JY&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">espresso machine</a> home, so spending a few hundred dollars on a niche kitchen appliance definitely isn't unheard of. If you're someone who needs to have three drinks within reach at any given moment, surely the two that aren't plain water could be slushed, and doesn't that just open up a world of possibilities? Plus, anyone who struggles with getting their fruits or veggies or protein might stay on top of it more with a drink more appetizing than a room-temperature chalky mixture. Is it too far to dub the Slushi a wellness hack?</p><p>The Slushi would also be a guaranteed hit in a home with kids who are way more likely to drink their healthy fruit juice if it basically feels like a Slurpee. Grandparents, aunts, and uncles, this is definitely how to become the favorite.</p><p>At any rate, the serotonin boost of one of life's most simple treasures &mdash; a fun little drink &mdash; is priceless, as is the bonding (and money saving) that could come with staying in with friends and having a frozen marg party in your PJs. </p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

"><p>I know it's bad etiquette to watch-and-text, but when it comes to <a href="https://mashable.com/article/emily-in-paris-season-3-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Emily in Paris</u></em></a>, I simply must have my phone fully charged and open to the group chat at all times. Where else am I to express my utter exasperation with the show's heroine, Emily Cooper (Lily Collins)? I need a safe space to discuss her bonkers Instagram captions! To react in horror to her nonsensical decision-making! To share my disbelief at her ability to pull together outfits that are certifiably unhinged!</p><p>Suffice to say, Emily stirs up feelings of frustration in me that I truly didn't know I was capable of. In fact, the only other time I can recall being quite so riled up by a TV heroine was when I first came across <em>Sex and the City</em>'s Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker).</p><p>Darren Star, the creator of both shows, is to blame for these two glamorous agents of chaos. Carrie and Emily may have their differences, but both are famously polarizing amongst viewers; there is even an entire website dedicated to <a href="https://mashable.com/article/carrie-bradshaw-is-the-worst-satc-interview" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Carrie Bradshaw being the worst</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, it's worth noting that unlikable female characters are a good thing &mdash; we all love a flawed protagonist. After all, how dull would it be if all of our female characters were perfect beacons of moral purity? But Carrie and Emily are truly on another level. Their flaws are often downright painful to see in action. Selfish and oblivious, they skip onwards through their glamorous lives, wreaking absolute havoc and leaving a whole lot of mess in their wake.</p><p>As the fourth season of<em> Emily in Paris</em> lands on Netflix and a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/carrie-bradshaw-memes-sex-and-the-city-big-is-moving-to-paris" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>new generation</u></a> discovers the joys of <em>Sex and the City</em>, group chats everywhere are filled with more infuriating Emily and Carrie content than ever &mdash; and what a joy it is!

<p>Both are at their most narcissistic when it comes to romance. Carrie harbors an obsessive love for Big (Chris Noth) throughout all six seasons of <em>Sex and the City </em>&mdash; and two movies! Her infatuation leads her to make some very bizarre decisions. Only a few months into their <a href="https://mashable.com/article/situationships-dating" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">situationship</a>, for instance, she stalks him and his mother to church, and then demands to know why he won't commit to her. Later, when she is dating <a href="https://mashable.com/video/and-just-like-that-season-2-trailer" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Aidan (John Corbett)</a> and Big is married to Natasha (Bridget Moynahan), Carrie is all too eager to jump into an affair with her ex. She then spends years following Natasha around trying to get some kind of forgiveness in order to make herself feel better. In fact, decades later, Carrie is still hounding Natasha for closure in <a href="https://mashable.com/article/and-just-like-that-carrie-voiceover-hbo" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>And Just Like That</u></em></a>.</p><p>Then there's Emily, who falls for hot chef Gabriel (Lucas Bravo) and proceeds to sleep with him even though he's in a relationship with her friend, Camille (Camille Razat). Oh yeah, and she also sleeps with Camille's 17-year-old brother.&nbsp;</p><p>In the new season, Emily is just as messy in her relationships. Unable to choose between Alfie (Lucien Laviscount) and Gabriel, she simply keeps both on the line. At one party, she happily dances with Alfie and smiles as he tells her he's all in &mdash; before she proceeds to fall back into Gabriel's arms as soon as he appears on the scene.</p><p>The worst part of all of this is that Carrie and Emily act as though this is normal; they talk to their friends as though all of this cheating and uncertainty and poor communication is just another annoying part of dating. As the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/is-x-in-the-room-with-us-right-now" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>meme</u></a> goes, is the accountability in the room with us?</p><h2>Emily and Carrie: bad at friendships.</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>While Emily and Carrie are off making awful relationship decisions, they are also, more often than not, neglecting their friends in the process. In fact, the tendency towards narcissism in friendships is perhaps the main defining trait of a Darren Star heroine. To put it bluntly, these girlies have enough "<a href="https://mashable.com/article/filler-episode-tiktok-trend" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>main character energy</u></a>" to fill all of NYC and Paris combined.</p><p>A typical <em>SATC</em> brunch goes something like this. Charlotte (Kristin Davis) raises an issue she is having.<a href="https://mashable.com/article/kim-cattrall-cameo-and-just-like-that-carrie-hbo-max-samantha-jones" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"> Samantha (Kim Cattrall)</a> replies with a saucy, but helpful anecdote. Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) chimes in with a comment connecting Charlotte's problem to the feminist plight. And Carrie leaps in to change the subject, bringing up some inconsequential thing Big said. Oh, and when her friends try to explain to her that she is in a toxic cycle with Big? Naturally, she doesn't want to hear it.</p><p>Yet, she still expects her friends to offer to help her buy her apartment back from Aidan post-breakup. Remember the time Carrie shamelessly guilted Charlotte into handing over her engagement ring so she could afford the $30,000 down payment? .</p><p>Emily is also painfully self-obsessed in her friendships. Just take the latest season, where Emily tells her landlord that Gabriel, Camille, and Camille's new girlfriend are all living together, thereby breaking the building's rules, because she is sick of Camille living near her new boyfriend Gabriel. Very thoughtful move, Em! Emily's selfishness even shines through in the small moments. Just take the moment she meets up with Camille's friends to help track her down. Not only does she dash off from the meeting after receiving a text, she fails to pay for her iced tea. As Camille's friends put it, "So rude."</p><h2>Carrie and Emily: inexplicably successful careerists.</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Perhaps another reason that Carrie and Emily are so very infuriating is that they are somehow revered in their chosen fields, despite the fact that they both kind of suck at their jobs.&nbsp;</p><p>Carrie is a writer in New York City who lives a very comfortable, Manolo Blahnik-filled life writing (<em>checks notes</em>) one column a week about her dating life. Of course, every now and then, she takes on some freelance work for little magazines like <em>Vogue</em>. (Every freelance writer knows the Carrie Bradshaw lore that she was paid $4 a word for this work, which she even successfully negotiated to $4.50.) Oh, and she has a minor breakdown when (<em>gasp</em>) her editor&hellip; edits her work. Her career goes from success to success when her column leads to a book deal. By <em>And Just Like That</em>, Carrie has transitioned to a career as the co-host of a podcast about sex and gender, even though it's quite clear she doesn't really know what podcasts actually are, and she feels too uncomfortable to actually, you know, talk about sex.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, Emily is a social media marketer who,&nbsp;though she can't post a good Instagram pic to save her life, finds herself working in Paris &mdash; despite speaking no French! Instead of actually learning some French and figuring out how to take a good picture for social media, she seems to spend most of her time at fancy lunches and stylish parties, before faking her way through pitch meetings where she very frequently makes up campaign ideas on the spot.&nbsp;</p><h2>Emily and Carrie: outrageous fashion icons.</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Naturally, these two heroines' chaotic interiors are reflected in their inexplicable sartorial choices. We are talking wildly mismatched patterns, blindingly bright color combinations, and shapes that simply make no logical sense on a human body.&nbsp;</p><p>Carrie wears a belt on her bare waist! A crochet pageboy hat! A pirate bandana! It's an explosion of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/findingcarriescloset/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>experimental NYC fashion</u></a>. Meanwhile, Emily wears a coat covered in shoes! Mismatched houndstooth! A jacket covered in the literal Paris skyline! Oh, and in the fourth season, she comes to a masked ball dressed as the literal Hamburglar! She may be taking Paris by storm, but understated French chic she is not. After all, she <em>is</em> the vulgar American transplant &mdash; and her clothes show it. <em>Sex and the City's</em> costume designer, the legendary Patricia Field<em>, </em>was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/feb/07/patricia-field-interview" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>a consultant on the first two seasons</u></a> of <em>Emily in Paris</em>, which suggests they were eager to bring some of the bold fashions of Carrie Bradshaw into Emily Cooper's wardrobe. When Field left the show after the second season, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EmilyInParis/comments/10enuc7/bring_back_patricia_field_it_was_obvious_season_3/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>many fans noted</u></a> that Emily's outfits seemed even more outrageous and over-the-top than ever. Evidently, for a Darren Star leading lady, maximalism-verging-on-hideous is the name of the game.&nbsp;</p><p>Carrie Bradshaw and Emily Cooper are both kind of the worst. But, honestly, I wouldn't want it any other way. There's a unique joy that comes from gasping in shock horror as they flagrantly cheat, lie, and manipulate &mdash; and there's a mischievous kind of fun that comes from living vicariously through their bad decisions, while knowing we could never, ever be quite so absurd as they are. They may be messy, but no one is more fun to watch &mdash; and gossip about in a group chat &mdash; than a Darren Star heroine</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/KJ7RD?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Emily%20in%20Paris%20Season%204%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Netflix.&object_type=article&object_uuid=03MEEy9fzYjouseX9hFCb5a&short_url=KJ7RD&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Emily in Paris</u></em><u> Season 4 is now streaming on Netflix.</u></a></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[Twitter Likes used to sum up what someone was into online. It added valuable context, but now that's gone on X, and the platform is worse for it.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/019C0Lp2gHIyydaihY29vNh/hero-image.jpg" alt="an illustrated little man with a torch searching for likes in a foggy landscape"><p>Spend enough time on X, the app formerly <a href="https://mashable.com/category/twitter" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Twitter</a>, and you're bound to get a questionable reply. It happens all the time. You see a tweet, and the context is lost. Are they kidding? Are they in on the joke you just made? Are they being funny or, for lack of a better word, an asshole? In short, you're left wondering: What do I make of this?</p><p>There used to be a hack for this problem: checking their Twitter Likes. Yet, in June, X <a href="https://mashable.com/article/x-twitter-likes-public-private" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">made everyone's Likes private</a>, which seemed like a relatively mild and benign change by Muskian standards. In reality, it's made the site considerably worse.</p><p>Twitter Likes were the most efficient and effective way to <a href="https://mashable.com/article/binge-twitter-likes" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">see a person's online soul</a>. Within a moment&rsquo;s scroll, you understood the context of what someone was about. You could navigate to the Likes tab on a profile, and if they liked a bunch of posts from other people being, well, assholes &mdash; congrats, you encountered an asshole. You could move along. Conversely, if the person liked good posts, you could safely assume they were making a joke at the expense of the assholes.</p><p>Privatizing Likes, like privatizing most anything, benefited the few at the expense of the public good. Elon Musk <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1800601849973576068" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">admitted</a> the move was made to protect people from being "attacked" online for liking posts. However, it seems more like he's <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2024/06/elon-musk-x-twitter-users-likes-private.html" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">providing cover</a> for the thin-skinned edgelords who want to like hurtful and offensive things without consequences. Musk himself is the poster boy and god-like figure of right-wing edgelords &mdash; do you think he wants his Likes public? Public Likes offered thin protection, but it was at least a tool to inspire better behavior online. You'd have to wonder: "Do I want people to see I liked this?"</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <a class="text-gray-600" href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1800601849973576068" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(opens in a new window)">

<p>Likes symbolized passive appreciation and, thus, were a tool to see what someone enjoyed. And to be clear, I wasn't trawling through Likes to go after someone. It was a quick guide to know if I should ignore them or engage. Or, if an account followed me &mdash; I could see their Likes, along with their posts, and decide if they were a worthwhile follow. And in a more positive angle, public Likes were also a fantastic way to find good posts. I used to round up the <a href="https://mashable.com/series/tweets-of-the-week" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">best tweets of the week</a> for Mashable, and scrolling through funny people's Likes was the best method for finding quality content. Many coworkers did similar.</p><p>Some smart people, including colleagues and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-hiding-likes-twitter-x-why-2024-6" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">great writers at other websites</a>, have praised Likes going private because it frees you to like whatever you want and reduces the chance of embarrassment (and, in the <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/taylor-swift-remains-silent-as-fans-doxx-and-harass-music-critic-over-folkore-review" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">worst cases</a>, actual <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/features/23997516/harassment-twitter-sarah-jeong-canceled-social-change" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">harassment</a>) online. </p><p>But here's the thing: If privacy was the goal, there was already a solution. In 2018, Twitter introduced bookmarks. If you wanted to save something for later, mark something you disagreed with, or keep track of your favorite adult content, the bookmark tool has always been there. And it&rsquo;s private. So, now X is just providing cover for people to like offensive or hurtful stuff. It&rsquo;s a tool for the worst people to boost the worst content you see on the platform. Liking used to mean something. Now, it&rsquo;s just a number.</p><p>And think of all the stories we'd have been robbed of if public Likes never existed. We'd never see <a href="https://mashable.com/article/jason-sudeikis-ted-lasso-twitter-likes" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Jason Sudeikis liking all the posts from people who hated </a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/jason-sudeikis-ted-lasso-twitter-likes" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Ted Lasso</em></a><em>. </em>We'd never have known that Donald Trump <a href="https://x.com/TimMarcin/status/817012314968834049" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">liked this quite odd 2013 tweet</a> from a random guy posing in his house, yelling online about convicted murderer Jodi Arias. And, most importantly, without public Likes, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ted-cruz-nsfw-tweet" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">we'd never have seen Ted Cruz's account</a> liking porn from the aptly named account @SexuallPosts. </p><p>The website formerly known as Twitter was once a platform for people to show their taste, an absolute must-visit to see the funniest and most important things happening online. Privatizing Likes isn&rsquo;t the worst thing Musk has done to degrade the experience on X (there&rsquo;s <a href="https://mashable.com/category/elon-musk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">plenty of that</a> to go around), but it sure hasn&rsquo;t made things better &mdash; only more boring. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>For more than two months, Wilmore and Williams have been in limbo 250 miles above Earth. Starliner, the new Boeing spaceship they test-piloted, experienced elusive propulsion issues on the journey. Now the U.S. space agency must decide whether to send them home in their test capsule or make complicated arrangements for them to ride a different spaceship &mdash; one built and controlled by Boeing's competitor, <a href="https://mashable.com/category/spacex" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>SpaceX</u></a>.

<p>The U.S. segment of the space station has four ports &mdash; two for spaceships and two for cargo freighters. Right now one SpaceX capsule and Starliner occupy both crew docks. There's no interoperability between U.S. ships and Russian ports, and cargo spots aren't equipped for passenger craft. In short, the parking lot is full.&nbsp;</p><p>NASA already postponed <a href="https://mashable.com/article/boeing-starliner-spacex-return-contingency" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>the next crew rotation</u></a> one month to buy some time to figure out the path forward for Starliner, but the delayed SpaceX capsule will be on its way to the station on Sept. 24. Starliner will have to undock before then, whether with human pilots or robotically, to accommodate the other SpaceX spaceship.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to logistics at the station, NASA has had to consider how changes would affect operations on the ground.

If NASA chooses not to send the Starliner astronauts home in Starliner, they'll remain at the station until February 2025, turning their original eight-day visit into an eight-month layover.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Wilmore and Williams have been put to work since they arrived. In addition to diagnostic tests on Starliner, they have assisted in other ways at the orbiting laboratory. Both have taken up deferred maintenance tasks &mdash; such as assembling a backup urine processor dubbed "Frankenpump" &mdash; that at times have made them seem like glorified space janitors.&nbsp;</p><p>Having extra crew on hand to pick up slack has been a perk for NASA, but it also has its drawbacks. More people in orbit means extra mouths to feed, and extra carbon dioxide to filter out of the air. Time on exercise machines has to be meticulously managed to ensure everyone stays fit in the weightless environment.&nbsp;</p><p>Getting Starliner through the testing phase has been a relentless battle for Boeing, though its representatives <a href="https://mashable.com/article/boeing-starliner-nasa-launch" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>have not always been forthcoming</u></a> on why the program has suffered so many setbacks. A string of issues has spanned a decade.&nbsp;</p><p>After the Space Shuttle retired in 2011, NASA hitched all of its rides on Russian rockets to the space station, costing the United States tens of millions of dollars per ride. Some considered it a national embarrassment.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>NASA hired Boeing and SpaceX to build commercial spaceships to carry astronauts to and from the station in 2014.

Yes, they're an investment &mdash; for what it's worth, they're still a good deal less than the AirPods Max on sale &mdash; so they might not be for everyone, but for those who wear their headphones more often than not, it could very well be worth it.</p><p>And if you need more convincing, we also named these Bose headphones our top pick for the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-noise-cancelling-headphones-for-flying" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">best noise-cancelling headphones for flying</a>.</p><h3><strong>Why we picked this:</strong> </h3><p>Due to our prior experience with the QuietComfort line, we weren't at all surprised that these QuietComfort headphones delivered all-day wear without issue. What we were impressed with was that they were noticeably even more comfortable than past QuietComfort headphones, never squeezing our ears from the sides, or weighing down on the top of our head even after hours of use. Even with glasses on, they never felt too tight or heavy, despite being over-ear headphones with earcups that sealed out sound. Speaking of sound, it always came out well-rounded and functioned well with the immersive audio (which, by the way, is a new feature for the QuietComfort line). Mashable Shopping Reporter Sam Mangino deemed the Ultras "the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn" in her <a href="https://mashable.com/review/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">review</a>. </p><p>They don't have adjustable ANC like the discontinued Bose-700s, but the one ANC level definitely sits at the higher end of what's available on the market, though it will shine the most with lower-pitched tones (for higher tones, a bit of music or a podcast will go a long way in assisting the built-in noise cancellation). Mangino did find that the slightly looser fit of these headphones means there's less of a tight seal on the earcups &mdash; that helps with comfort, but it sacrifices some noise-cancelling efficacy. As for the major downsides, these headphones are expensive at $429 (though you can find them on sale), so we expected a lot out of them. The pairing can be a little touch and go at times and completely fine at others &mdash; that definitely dampens the premium feel. A small consolation is that this inconsistency is characteristic of other Bose headphones we've tested, but we wish it was a feature they fixed in the Ultras.</p><p>The most baffling flaw of these headphones is the lack of passive playback, meaning you have to turn on the headphones to use the wired connection. Though these are clearly meant to be <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-wireless-headphones" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">wireless headphones</a> first and foremost, this feels like a weird oversight (and a deviation from older models). Still, on balance, we think they justify the investment &mdash; they're <em>really </em>comfortable.</p><p><strong><em>Battery life:</em></strong> <em>24 hours</em> | <strong><em>Colors:</em></strong> <em> White, black, sandstone</em> </p><hr><h2>Best sound-first headphones: Sony WH-1000XM5</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

The <a href="https://zdcs.link/ovqlA?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Sony%20WH-1000XM5%20headphones&object_type=article&object_uuid=04y8XvRckQxzNTUEBcR4nmm&short_url=ovqlA&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones</a> deliver top-notch ANC and audiophile-level sound quality, with a hefty 30-hour battery life. Their design offers a less expensive alternative to the AirPods Max, for those who like their headphones to sound <em>and</em> look good. </p><h3><strong>Why we picked this: </strong></h3><p>Often, people herald Bose as having the superior ANC but Sony as owning the sound space. Our Deputy Shopping and Reviews Editor Miller Kern definitely noticed that these headphones excelled in the latter arena when she tested them out: "[The sound] is full and clear, and feels like surround sound. I&rsquo;m a big fan of power ballads (I&rsquo;m not allowed to pick the music at parties), and Brandi Carlile&rsquo;s '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOpWqWK0q4U" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Right on Time</u></a>' sounded like it was meant to be listened to on these headphones. The vocals and instruments all got to shine, and the headphones made it feel like I was there in the studio. These are probably the best-sounding headphones I&rsquo;ve ever tried." The Sony companion app equalizer also allows plenty of fine-tuning, and guides the less-audio savvy among us to figure out the settings they prefer with the "find your equalizer" feature.</p><p>The active noise cancellation is also still pretty stellar, despite usually falling second in line to Bose. It'll do a great job of significantly reducing the bulk of noises during a workday, like loud typing or chatty coworkers. The touch controls on the right ear cup can be a bit finicky at first, but once you get the hang of it, are easy to use to start and stop music, as well as adjust the volume. Plus, unlike the Bose Ultras, the Bluetooth connection and multipoint pairing work without a hitch.</p><p>We do wish they folded up so they weren't so bulky to take on the go, but it's a relatively small con compared to the pros, especially if you're planning on wearing these headphones all day long. As for buying advice, these headphones do go on sale less often than others on this list like the Bose QC Ultras, but they also cost less at full price than the Ultras.</p><p><strong><em>Battery life:</em></strong> <em>30 hours</em> | <strong><em>Colors:</em></strong> <em>Black, blue, silver</em></p><hr><h2>Best noise-cancelling earbuds: Apple AirPods Pro</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

It's not uncommon for earbuds to have active noise cancellation, but the AirPods Pro deliver an impressive performance. Plus they're versatile &mdash; whether you like to wear your headphones around the house, on a run, or as you're falling asleep at night, the AirPods Pro fit the bill. For obvious reasons, they're also the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-headphones-for-iphone" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">best headphones for iPhone users</a>.</p><h3><strong>Why we picked this: </strong></h3><p>Last year, Apple finally gave their AirPods Pro a much-needed upgrade in the form of a USB-C charger. Other than the charging port, they're identical to the second-gen Pros released in 2022, which <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-airpods-pro-2-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Mashable Senior Editor Stan Schroeder described as</a> "the first pair of earbuds I'd actually consider taking on an airplane (instead of my much larger and clunkier over-ear headphones)." He went on to say "In some aspects, the active noise cancellation was even better than on my daily drivers: <a href="https://mashable.com/review/bw-px7-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">B&amp;W's excellent PX7</a> over-ear headphones."</p><p>Despite their size and enhanced ANC, the Pro's battery still lasts for up to six hours on a single charge and 30 hours overall with the case. However, it is worth noting that the battery life will noticeably decline after a few years. </p><p>These earbuds are so frequently on sale that we don't recommend buying them at their full $249 price tag. You can often find them at Amazon (and Walmart) marked down to at least $199. If you want a true sale price, we recommend waiting until they hit $189 or lower.</p><p><strong><em>Battery life:</em></strong> <em>6 hours per charge (30 hours with case)</em> | <strong><em>Colors:</em></strong> <em>White</em></p><hr><h2>Best AirPods alternative: Beats Studio Buds + </h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3><strong>Who it's for:</strong></h3><p>If you're into earbuds with good ANC but less into shelling out $249, you'll find your happy medium in the Beats Studio Buds +. There's a reason we've consistently named them the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-airpods" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">best AirPods alternative</a>.</p><h3><strong>Why we picked this: </strong></h3><p>The AirPods Pro are great, but these <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-wireless-earbuds" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">popular wireless earbuds</a> aren't in everyone's budget. These Beats will run you about $80 less (or more, if you catch them on sale), give you some more leeway with color options, integrate just as well into an Apple ecosystem as AirPods, have the same battery life as AirPods, and still deliver pretty good ANC. If you're into a more bass-heavy sound, you'll definitely be happy with them. We've seen them drop down to $129.95 regularly at Amazon, making them an even more affordable AirPod alternative.</p><p>While we didn't find them to be a one-to-one experience during our testing &mdash; you should expect the AirPods to block out more noise, and we missed wireless charging &mdash; they were still incredibly comfortable. We also found them to fit better than AirPods, so if those Apple earbuds usually slip out of your ears, you'll want to try these buds instead. And for Android users, Google Fast Pair makes these earbuds a much better option than AirPods.</p><p>We do want to mention that if $169.95 is still fairly steep, you can also get ANC through <a href="https://zdcs.link/6qpl3?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Amazon%27s%20Echo%20Buds&object_type=article&object_uuid=04y8XvRckQxzNTUEBcR4nmm&short_url=6qpl3&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Amazon's Echo Buds</a> for just $119.99.

Motivating yourself to get through a set of push-ups is hard enough without an earbud popping out. The Beats Fit Pro earbuds are more than up to the task, and they deliver exceptional battery life, sound quality, and a few extras.</p><h3><strong>Why we picked this: </strong></h3><p>Earbuds designed for exercise typically have some sort of wingtip to help hold them in place, but those wingtips can often squeeze uncomfortably on your ears, especially with longer-term use. The small wingtip of these Beats hits the sweet spot &mdash; they're large enough to provide hold, and small enough to be undetectable. Mashable tech reporter Alex Perry writes that the wingtips "result [in] a pair of earbuds that <em>never</em> feel like they're going to fall out and, more importantly, <em>never</em> intrude on your comfort. I've worn these bad boys for six straight hours without any problems. It's hard to ask for more than that." </p><p>Beyond comfort, these earbuds provide an impressive sound profile, including that deep bass that Beats are known for. And of course, as any <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-headphones-for-running-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">workout earbuds</a> should be, these earbuds are sweat and water-resistant with an IPX4 rating. As an added bonus, the Fit Pros also have great active noise cancellation. Although that's by no means essential for a pair of earbuds you'll be wearing while you exercise, it is nice that they have they have fitness-oriented features while being flexible enough to be a great all-around earbud.</p><p>All of these features do together factor into these earbuds $200 price tag, but if you're looking to pay a little less, we recommend waiting for them to go on sale &mdash; with a little patience, you can grab them at Amazon for $20 or $40 off.</p><p><strong><em>Battery life:</em></strong> <em>6 hours (24 hours with case)</em> | <strong><em>Colors:</em></strong> <em>Black, white, coral, gray, purple, blue, yellow, tan, brown, beige</em></p><hr><h2>Best wired earbuds: Marshall Mode</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3><strong>Who it's for:</strong></h3><p>There are a lot of good reasons to consider wired earbuds. Some people simply don't want the hassle of constantly charging their headphones. Fair enough. Some people want impressive audio quality without shelling out $100 or more, and some <a href="https://mashable.com/article/wired-headphones-instagram-account-tiktok" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">simply aren't buying</a> what Big Bluetooth is selling. For shoppers who fall into any of the above groups, we recommend the affordable <a href="https://zdcs.link/846Ad?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Marshall%20Mode%20earbuds&object_type=article&object_uuid=04y8XvRckQxzNTUEBcR4nmm&short_url=846Ad&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Marshall Mode earbuds</a>.</p><h3><strong>Why we picked this: </strong></h3><p>Though they're only $60 (and usually on sale for less than $40), Marshall Mode earbuds deliver better sound than most wireless earbuds that are triple the price. The bass is clear but not overpowering, and the highs bright but never too thin or tinny-sounding. </p><p>As for how you sound on the headphone's built-in mic, friends we spoke to on the phone said we came through with perfect clarity (the same can't be said for our tester's two-and-a-half year old first-generation AirPods Pro). Lower down on the wire is a separate remote, so you can pause and play your audio or hang up your calls without fiddling around with the mic. If you're sensing a theme, these earbuds are well-designed, and that comes through in how they wear and store. </p><p>During our testing, we had no trouble with the wire tangling, and it never felt too long during everyday wear. The buds themselves come with three ear tip sizes and wear comfortably all day. If you're not a fan of the shape of AirPods, then you're likely to find these a better shape for actually keeping your earbuds situated in your ears. There is one major downside with these wired earbuds, however. Unlike their more expensive wired counterparts, Marshall's don't come with a replaceable wire, so you'll want to take extra care to be as gentle as you can with the wire to extend its lifespan.</p><p><strong><em>Battery life:</em></strong> <em>N/A</em> | <strong><em>Colors:</em></strong> <em>Black</em> </p><hr><h2>How we tested the best headphones</h2><p>Over the years, we've tested out a <em>lot </em>of headphones and wireless earbuds at Mashable. To determine the best of the best, and not just pick what's trendy at the moment, we went back through our reviews from former and current tech reporters, editors, and shopping reporters. From JBL and Sony to Samsung and Anker Soundcore, we did our research to make sure we left no major headphone stone unturned, and the result is this guide &mdash; our favorite vetted and tested headphones of 2024. </p><p>All of the headphones in this guide were hands-on tested. In making our selections, we weighed: </p><ul><li><p><strong>Sound: </strong>Since headphones are first and foremost a way for you to listen to audio, if a pair of headphones didn't sound good, they didn't make the list &mdash; that goes for our budget pick, too. </p></li><li><p><strong>Noise cancellation: </strong>These days, some form of noise cancellation is near-essential for any pair of headphones. We prioritized models that feature solid noise cancellation. </p></li><li><p><strong>Comfort: </strong>What's the point of a great pair of headphones if they're too uncomfortable to wear? </p></li><li><p><strong>Customization: </strong>Whether it be for ANC levels, transparency modes, or touch controls, headphones that allow you to adjust the settings will make them feel like they were made for you. </p></li><li><p><strong>Battery life: </strong>Most wireless headphones on the market rely on Bluetooth connectivity, so having a battery you can rely on for at least a few hours of listening time is key. </p></li><li><p><strong>Special features: </strong>When testing headphones and earbuds, we also take into consideration any other special features they offer. For headphones in the $200-plus price range, we expect at least a few special features.</p></li></ul><p>You might notice that the <a href="https://zdcs.link/8j3rw?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20AirPods%20Max&object_type=article&object_uuid=04y8XvRckQxzNTUEBcR4nmm&short_url=8j3rw&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><strong>Apple AirPods Max</strong></a> are missing from our top picks. It's not that we don't like them &mdash; in fact, we think they sound and look great. But <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-airpods-max-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">when we reviewed them</a>, we found that they didn't have a practical storage option, they never really turn off (thus draining the otherwise long battery life), and are just too expensive to justify a wholehearted recommendation. We understand if you like them regardless, but personally, we think there are better options at lower price points. </p><h3>Recent testing updates</h3><p>As of Feb. 2024, two of our former recommendations, the Skullcandy Sesh Evo earbuds and Sennheiser IE 300 have been discontinued. We're in the process of testing new headphones to take their place, and we chose the Marshall Mode earbuds as our new budget pick for earbuds. We also added in the Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones as an upgrade recommendation in March 2024.</p><p>From April to May 2024, we also tested the <a href="https://zdcs.link/8BpW2?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Marshall%20Major%20V&object_type=article&object_uuid=04y8XvRckQxzNTUEBcR4nmm&short_url=8BpW2&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Marshall Major V</a> headphones and <a href="https://zdcs.link/Y0w2r?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Bowers%20%26%20Wilkins%20Px7%20S2&object_type=article&object_uuid=04y8XvRckQxzNTUEBcR4nmm&short_url=Y0w2r&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Bowers &amp; Wilkins Px7 S2</a> headphones, both of which had excellent sound profiles and easy to navigate custom equalizers on their companion apps. Ultimately, they didn't make the cut on our final list for a couple of reasons. With the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/marshall-major-v-headphones" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Major V headphones</a>, we love that their claim of 100+ hours of battery life held up under our testing, but we found them to get uncomfortable after a couple of hours. We also would have appreciated ANC at their $149 price point. </p><p>For the B&amp;W headphones, we loved their design and premium feel in addition to their truly impressive sound, but we found that their ANC was only so-so. If you're willing to spend $399, you can find a better balance of sound and ANC in the Sony XM5 headphones.</p><p>As of June 2024, we've removed the Bose QuietComfort 45 headphones as they're officially discontinued and unavailable online. In Aug. 2024, the Bose 700 headphones met the same fate, so we've removed them as our pick for the best noise-cancelling headphones. In their place, we're recommending the Bose QC Ultra headphones, which were formerly our top pick for best premium noise-cancelling headphones.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Detective Jeb Pyre (a stirring Andrew Garfield) begins to question his faith and his church while investigating a brutal murder in his small Mormon community in <em>Under the Banner of Heaven.</em> </p><p>The FX series is a haunting adaptation of Jon Krakauer's non-fiction book that investigates the very real murder of Brenda Wright and her baby in Utah in 1984.&nbsp;As a fictionalized retelling, <em>Under the Banner of Heaven</em> weaves a story of religious extremism, generational trauma, the power and limitations of faith, and above all else, of a bright, kind young woman who got caught in the middle. Creator Dustin Lance Black&rsquo;s (<em>Milk) </em>take is complex, deeply affecting, and beautifully shot, with glimpses of Latter-day Saint historical figures flashing through Detective Pyre&rsquo;s mind, as he struggles to reconcile his beliefs with his suspicions about the involvement of the church. Sam Worthington, Daisy Edgar-Jones, Gil Birmingham, Denise Gough, and Wyatt Russell each give remarkable performances, making <em>Heaven</em> a truly unforgettable watch. &mdash; <em>K.G</em></p><p><strong>How long: </strong>Seven and a half hours, over seven episodes.</p><p><strong>How to watch:</strong> <a href="https://zdcs.link/yn1dr?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Under%20the%20Banner%20of%20Heaven%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Hulu.&object_type=article&object_uuid=02SGZoE2HhkMLHTtSmN3FqE&short_url=yn1dr&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Under the Banner of Heaven</em> is now streaming on Hulu.</a></p><h2>28. <em>Mrs. America</em></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>A fascinating dramatization of a trial that consumed British media cycles in the late '60s early '70s, when <a href="https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/private-lives/relationships/overview/sexuality20thcentury/#:~:text=In%201967%20the%20Sexual%20Offences,for%20Northern%20Ireland%20until%201982." target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">homosexuality was decriminalised in England but not legal</a>. Russell T Davies' <em>A Very English Scandal</em> tells the story of Jeremy Thorpe, a liberal member of Parliament, and his secret former lover, Norman Josiffe, who publicly accused Thorpe of attempting to murder him. It's a compelling, surprising, and unexpectedly bubbly retelling of an abusive relationship and a government official's spectacular fall from grace. Hugh Grant is wonderful as the slimy MP, while Ben Whishaw is positively magnetic as a complex victim with a dramatic flair.<a href="https://mashable.com/article/what-to-binge-watch-on-a-long-flight" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">*</a>&nbsp; &mdash; <em>K.G.</em></p><p><strong>How long: </strong>Three hours, over three episodes.</p><p><strong>How to watch:</strong> <a href="https://zdcs.link/KYWr3?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=A%20Very%20English%20Scandal%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Prime%20Video.&object_type=article&object_uuid=02SGZoE2HhkMLHTtSmN3FqE&short_url=KYWr3&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>A Very English Scandal</em> is now streaming on Prime Video.</a></p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>25 years ago, Mare Sheehan (Kate Winslet) was a star high school athlete with a promising future ahead of her. Nowadays, she&rsquo;s a bitter, divorced detective whose name is being dragged through the mud over a missing persons case she couldn&rsquo;t solve. When another local girl vanishes, Mare must push aside personal dramas &mdash; and inner demons &mdash; to crack the case. This small but gruff blue-collar town outside of Philadelphia is the kind of place where everyone knows everyone, so surely someone must know something. </p><p>Creator Brad Ingelsby brings together a crackling cast that includes Julianne Nicholson, Jean Smart, Angourie Rice, Guy Pearce, and Evan Peters. Together, they build an enveloping atmosphere of snark and suspicion and a darkly amusing crime drama that had tongues wagging, critics cheering, and jaws dropping.

<p>The year is 1940. France has been invaded by Germany, and all out war is imminent. But hope remains at the Hotel Splendide in Marseille, where a scrappy, ambitious org called the Emergency Rescue Committee is corralling all its resources, legal and&hellip;not so legal, to evacuate artists, writers, and thinkers wanted by the Nazis.

The Emergency Rescue Committee helped find safe passage for Hannah Arendt, Max Ernst, Marcel Duchamp, Marc Chagall, and countless other dissenters targeted by the Nazis for the audacity of their ideas.

<p>Disturbing and fascinating, <em>The Patient</em> is one of those thrillers you can&rsquo;t drag your eyes away from. Steve Carrell is Dr. Alan Strauss, a psychotherapist who wakes up one morning chained in a basement by a patient, serial killer Sam Fortner (Domhnall Gleeson), and forced to provide therapy or else Sam will give into his violent and homicidal urges. The stakes are high, but the therapy is captivating. There&rsquo;s no way out for Alan other than through, and he genuinely tries to tend to his patient while dealing with his own grief and attempting to escape. From <em>The Americans</em>' Joel Fields and Joe Weisberg, <em>The Patient</em> will hook you in its first enigmatic minutes, and the tight, superbly-acted half hour installments will keep you pressing &ldquo;next episode&rdquo; before you can even think to stop yourself.

But when one such night ends with a blackout, bloody forehead, and troubling flashbacks, Arabella pieces together her experience of sexual assault, turning to her friends, new lovers, and dubious distractions to cope.

<p>When we first meet Emily Blunt&rsquo;s Lady Cornelia Locke, she&rsquo;s wearing a bright pink, frilly 1890s frock, a stark contrast to the searing blue sky and arid yellow earth of the remote American West outpost where her story begins. She does not belong in this ruthless, lawless place. But she traveled all the way from England for revenge on the man responsible for her son&rsquo;s death &mdash; and she will stop at nothing to get it. Luckily, she meets Eli Whipp (Chaske Spencer), a Pawnee man and former cavalry scout for the Union army who has his own score to settle. Together, the unlikely pair travel through hostile territory, unraveling their painful pasts and finding solace in each other's strength.</p><p>From director Hugo Blick, <em>The English</em> is a stunning, emotional, and brutal Western that defies expectations. You will not be able to guess where it&rsquo;s going, or where it came from &mdash; but you will be utterly hypnotized by the power of Blunt and Spencer&rsquo;s performances. <em>&mdash; K.G.&nbsp;</em></p><p><strong>How long:</strong> About five hours, over six episodes.</p><p><strong>How to watch:</strong> <a href="https://zdcs.link/jblZe?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=The%20English%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Amazon%20Prime.&object_type=article&object_uuid=02SGZoE2HhkMLHTtSmN3FqE&short_url=jblZe&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>The English</em> is now streaming on Amazon Prime.</a></p><h2>19. <em>The Dropout</em></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The first Netflix series whose primary language was Yiddish, <em>Unorthodox</em> is an empathetic, moving story of a 19-year-old woman fleeing the oppression of her Hasidic Jewish ultra-Orthodox community in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. She travels all the way to Berlin to find safe haven, but when her former husband learns she is pregnant, he journeys to Germany to bring her back. Based loosely on Deborah Feldman&rsquo;s memoir, <em>Unorthodox: The Scandalous Rejection of My Hasidic Roots</em>, this ground-breaking limited series treats its subject matter with respect and intimacy.

<p>Though it's technically a prequel, there's no need to watch <em>Yellowstone</em> to appreciate this sweeping Paramount+ original. <em>1883</em> is a massive undertaking, making headlines for its unprecedented budget ($10 million an episode!) and scale of production. Luckily, Paramount's big investment has paid off. <em>1883</em> is a scenic, moody drama about the Dutton family's journey west from Fort Worth to Oregon. Elsa Dutton (Isabel May) is our protagonist, narrating over ruminative sunset shots over endless plains, vibrating with hope for a trek the show ultimately warns us will only bring doom. Rattlesnakes, bandits, covered wagon accidents &mdash; <em>1883</em> depicts the brutal, stark reality of the real Oregon Trail.</p><p>Sam Elliott is perfectly cast as the hardened covered wagon boss &mdash; his mustache has never been more fitting &mdash; and LaMonica Garrett is magnetic in an exciting role that promises to undo <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-harder-they-fall-fact-vs-fiction-explainer" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">decades of Black cowboy erasure</a>. As Elsa's parents, Tim McGraw and Faith Hill's comfort on horseback and in Stetsons help them fit right in alongside the veteran cast. Making adequate space to address the complex nuances of the often-violent conflicts between settlers and Native Americans, <em>1883</em> is a modern, ruminative Western whose gorgeous landscape is just as important as its affecting human drama. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/what-to-binge-watch-on-a-long-flight" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">*</a> <em>&mdash; K.G.&nbsp;</em></p><p><strong>How long: </strong>Nine hours, over 10 episodes.</p><p><strong>How to watch:</strong> <a href="https://zdcs.link/dLoA6?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=1883%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Paramount%2B.&object_type=article&object_uuid=02SGZoE2HhkMLHTtSmN3FqE&short_url=dLoA6&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>1883</em> is now streaming on Paramount+.</a></p><h2>15. <em>The Queen&rsquo;s Gambit</em></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

Taylor-Joy is Beth Harmon, a cold, withdrawn orphan who strives to become a world chess champion and struggles with addiction. We&rsquo;re on Beth&rsquo;s journey from the beginning, starting with her time in a 1950s orphanage that freely gives tranquilizers to kids to dull their behavior, then following her into her adoptive family, all while she builds her skill and thirst for the game of chess. Though <em>The Queen&rsquo;s Gambit</em> miraculously manages to make slow, cerebral chess matches absolutely thrilling, the hook here is the humanity of the characters and the captivating story of a girl demanding more from life than she was handed.

<p>Gilded with violence, glory, and cowgirls, <em>Godless</em> puts a feminist spin on the western. Divided into seven parts, the story of Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) pursuing his rival Roy Goode (Jack O'Connell) into the all-female town of La Belle, New Mexico brings inventive framing to the storytelling staples we love.

<p>Award-winning writer Cheryl Strayed is best known for her brazenly honest and poignant memoir, <em>Wild, </em>about hiking the Pacific Coast Trail while processing the tragedies of her past.

But when Clare accepts an offer to be an anonymous advice columnist, she finds unexpected hope and a reminder that she might still have something to offer the world.

<p>Sam Rockwell and Michelle Williams lead as Broadway legends Bob Fosse and Gwen Verdon in this reflection on a legacy. Told in a non-linear structure, <em>Fosse/Verdon </em>considers both the professional and personal sides of the esteemed entertainment power couple &mdash; examining how we attribute credit to men and women differently as well as what it means to separate the artist from their work.

Mercury, the closest planet to the sun, can't actually travel backward in retrograde, and doesn't impact us on <a href="https://mashable.com/article/earth-pictures-images-from-space" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Earth</a>. The notion of Mercury retrograde, a common reference in <a href="https://mashable.com/article/astrology-trend-2021-post-pandemic" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">astrology</a> wherein communication and travel are temporarily impaired, can, of course, be a fun musing. The event occurs when Mercury appears to start traveling the opposite direction in the sky. </p><p>But this is perceptive trickery. Mercury retrograde is <em>apparent motion</em>, such as when you pass a speeding car on the highway and it appears that car is moving backward. It's not an exceptional, or momentous, event.</p><p>"There's nothing unusual about it," Tansu Daylan, a physicist at Washington University in St. Louis who leads <a href="https://mashable.com/category/nasa" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">NASA</a> telescope observations, told Mashable.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>It happens so regularly &mdash; three or four times a year &mdash; that some people easily associate events (misunderstandings or travel woes) with the event. "People are actively searching for connections," Daylan said. </p><div class="content-block-mashable-video mt-8">

<h2><strong>What causes Mercury retrograde</strong></h2><p>From our perspective, the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/planets-ranked" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">planets</a>, including Mercury, move west to east across the night sky, relative to the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/star-explosion-supernova-space" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">stars</a>. Greek and Roman astronomers, in fact, referred to planets as "wandering stars."</p><p>If you, hypothetically, could look down on the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/solar-flares-sun-active-why" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">sun</a> from above, you would see the planets orbiting counterclockwise. This creates the easterly movement, from our perch on Earth. <em>But </em>this changes when two planets become aligned as they orbit the sun, Daylan emphasized. Then, an inner planet (Mercury) moves faster than an outer planet (like Earth), resulting in "apparent retrograde motion" &mdash; <em>apparent </em>because Mercury, speeding around our star at over 100,000 mph, does not suddenly start traveling backwards.</p><p>The <a href="https://mashable.com/category/nasa" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">NASA</a> graphic below illustrates apparent retrograde motion, using <a href="https://mashable.com/article/mars-nasa-image-spacecraft" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Mars</a> and Earth.

<p>Mercury retrograde lasts for a few weeks at a time, so don't be surprised to hear how it's connected to a multitude of events. Tellingly, it most recently started again on Aug. 5, 2024 &mdash; after the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/crowdstrike-update-fail-explained" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">global Crowdstrike disruption</a>.</p><p>Though we know Mercury's orbit isn't doing anything strange in our <a href="https://mashable.com/article/mars-asteroid-jupiter-moons-space" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">solar system</a> throughout the year, it will remain a world of mysteries. It's a planet that's difficult to observe from Earth, because of its proximity to the sun. "That means it can be spotted only briefly shortly before sunrise and just after sunset, and always appears close to the horizon," the <a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/BepiColombo/Three_reasons_why_we_know_so_little_about_Mercury" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">European Space Agency explains</a>. What's more, it's extremely challenging to reach &mdash; any spacecraft endeavoring there must contend with the sun's overpowering gravity. That's why Mercury is the least visited of the other inner planets. And, it's precarious to get too close to Mercury because the searing planet's surface, hot enough to melt lead, radiates heat into <a href="https://mashable.com/category/space" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">space</a>.

Is it geologically active? How did it get so close to the sun?</em></p><p>But, at least, its strange apparent motion is well understood.</p><p>"There's nothing fancy about it," Daylan said.</p><p><em>This story has been updated with more information about Mercury retrograde.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

The game is all about finding the "common threads between words." And just like <em>Wordle</em>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-20-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Connections</em></a> resets after midnight and each new set of words gets trickier and trickier&mdash;so we've served up some hints and tips to get you over the hurdle.</p><p>If you just want to be told today's puzzle, you can jump to the end of this article for August 17's <em>Connections</em> solution. But if you'd rather solve it yourself, keep reading for some clues, tips, and strategies to assist you.</p><h2>What is Connections?</h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>
<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>
<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. Like <em>Wordle, </em>you can share the results with your friends on social media.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>The drinking bird, which is sometimes referred to as the dippy bird, shows up in several of the <em>Alien</em> films, comics, and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/alien-inspired-games-ranking" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">video games</a>, including <em>Alien&sup3;</em>, <em>Alien vs. Predator</em>, and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/alien-covenant-movie-guide" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Alien: Covenant</em></a>, and the game <em>Alien: Isolation</em>. It's an homage to the very first shot of Ridley Scott's 1979 <em>Alien</em>, when the camera is careening through the Nostromo ship and catches sight of two drinking birds sitting on the ship's dining table, dipping away. In fact, the toy birds are on the table during the film's famous chestburster scene, idly sitting by while Gilbert Kane (John Hurt) has a baby Xenomorph punch out of his chest during dinner.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>In <em>Alien: Romulus</em>, the drinking bird takes on a meaning of its own beyond the obvious fan service, as a symbol of the overworked, indentured mining workers of the Weyland-Yutani colony. Unable to break the regimented monotony of their cog-like roles, Rain and her friends seek escape and enrichment elsewhere &mdash; but are seriously doomed for even trying. They <em>are</em> the birds, people.</p><p>It's not the only Easter egg or franchise nod in &Aacute;lvarez's film, but it's a good one.</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/71Pmy?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3Btemplate=article&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=Alien%3A%20Romulus%20opens%20in%20theaters%20Aug.%2016.&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=01h8wb38pURUbNtzAoCE7MH&amp%3Bshort_url=71Pmy&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Falien-romulus-review&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Alien%3A%20Romulus%20is%20now%20showing%20in%20cinemas.&object_type=article&object_uuid=02flaCx2LCpyPCaopcl7siM&short_url=71Pmy&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Alien: Romulus</em> is now showing in cinemas.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[Epic Games has finally put 'Fortnite' back on iPhones without any weird workarounds. Well, almost, anyway.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/02Sdd1SiMWULkekJkZQ9ds1/hero-image.jpg" alt="Epic Games logo next to Apple logo in front of white background"><p>iPhone owners can finally download and play <em>Fortnite</em> again &ndash; if you live an Europe and use a separate app store.</p><p>Yes, one of the weirdest sagas in recent video game history is over. After years of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-epic-games-store-europe" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">spats between Apple and Epic Games</a>, you can cleanly and legally install <em>Fortnite</em> on an iPhone without any <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-play-fortnite-without-app-store-iphone" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">strange workarounds</a>. Well, almost, anyway. Epic had to put out an instructional YouTube video for the process, which involves installing a separate Epic Games Store app from Safari and <em>then</em> downloading <em>Fortnite</em> from there, rather than the regular App Store. </p><p>I should note that this only applies to iPhone owners in the European Union, due to that organization's <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-google-meta-eu-investigations-digital-markets-act" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">relatively strict laws</a> against big tech monopolies. It's not clear when U.S. iPhone users will see <em>Fortnite</em> again.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-_6cmu0NuM3g"></div>
</div>


<p>The same holds true of Android, by the way, as Epic explained in its <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/the-epic-games-store-launches-on-mobile" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">blog post</a> announcing the news. You might be wondering why Epic feels the need to make users download its own digital storefront instead of just using the App Store or Play Store like other mobile games. It's for boring business reasons: Apple and Google historically take some money off the top of in-app purchases for themselves, and Epic wants to reap all of the revenue for itself, as companies are wont to do.</p><p>Regardless of the how and why, all of the nonsense of the past few years is over. No more needing to stream <em>Fortnite</em> to an iPhone or anything like that. If you like <em>Fortnite</em> and live in Europe, congratulations. For everyone else...the wait continues.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h3><strong>Why we like it</strong></h3><p>If you're the type of person who needs silence to focus, or you just want to block out distractions when listening to music, noise-cancelling headphones are the way to go. You can get a great <a href="https://zdcs.link/6XdZY?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=budget%20pair%20from%20Anker&object_type=article&object_uuid=01XeZhqSzgwebQWpZVsih6p&short_url=6XdZY&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">budget pair from Anker</a> for less than $50 right now that not only sound fantastic, but boast some impressive noise blocking and battery life for the price as well. They claim to reduce noise by up to 98% while still offering crisp treble and booming bass, with up to 50 hours of playtime thanks to a 10-hour single charge and 4 hours of listening per 10-minute charges. They're comfortable in the ear, sturdy, and stylish too. You don't need the most expensive earbuds to enjoy benefits like ANC, and this pair proves it while staying under $50. </p><h3><strong>More tech deals under $50 at Amazon:</strong></h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/jo5Ay?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3Btemplate=article&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=Amazon%20Fire%20TV%20Stick%204K&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=05Y8hfOjEt5SkaVtapKdg0c&amp%3Bshort_url=jo5Ay&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Faug-8-amazon-under-50-deals&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Amazon%20Fire%20TV%20Stick%204K&object_type=article&object_uuid=01XeZhqSzgwebQWpZVsih6p&short_url=jo5Ay&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K</a> &mdash; <strong>$34.99</strong> <s>$49.99</s> (save $15)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/71qgP?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3Btemplate=article&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=Samsung%2015W%20Wireless%20Charger&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=05Y8hfOjEt5SkaVtapKdg0c&amp%3Bshort_url=71qgP&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Faug-8-amazon-under-50-deals&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%2015W%20Wireless%20Charger&object_type=article&object_uuid=01XeZhqSzgwebQWpZVsih6p&short_url=71qgP&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung 15W Wireless Charger</a> &mdash; <strong>$35.71</strong> <s>$59.99</s> (save $24.28)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/weng6?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3Btemplate=article&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=Anker%20Nano%20II%20USB%20C%20Charger%20%2865W%29&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=05Y8hfOjEt5SkaVtapKdg0c&amp%3Bshort_url=weng6&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Faug-8-amazon-under-50-deals&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Anker%20Nano%20II%20USB%20C%20Charger%20%2865W%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=01XeZhqSzgwebQWpZVsih6p&short_url=weng6&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Anker Nano II USB C Charger (65W)</a> &mdash; <strong>$39.99</strong> <s>$55.99</s> (save $16)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/xPdkd?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3Btemplate=article&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=TP-Link%20Deco%20Whole%20Home%20Mesh%20WiFi%20System&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=05Y8hfOjEt5SkaVtapKdg0c&amp%3Bshort_url=xPdkd&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Faug-8-amazon-under-50-deals&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=TP-Link%20Deco%20Whole%20Home%20Mesh%20WiFi%20System&object_type=article&object_uuid=01XeZhqSzgwebQWpZVsih6p&short_url=xPdkd&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">TP-Link Deco Whole Home Mesh WiFi System</a> &mdash; <strong>$49.49</strong> <s>$59.99</s> (save $10.50)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/5MvBx?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3Btemplate=article&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=Amazon%20Echo%20Dot%20%285th%20Gen%29%20with%20Sengled%20Smart%20Color%20Bulb&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=05Y8hfOjEt5SkaVtapKdg0c&amp%3Bshort_url=5MvBx&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Faug-8-amazon-under-50-deals&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Amazon%20Echo%20Dot%20%285th%20Gen%29%20with%20Sengled%20Smart%20Color%20Bulb&object_type=article&object_uuid=01XeZhqSzgwebQWpZVsih6p&short_url=5MvBx&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Amazon Echo Dot (5th Gen) with Sengled Smart Color Bulb</a> &mdash; <strong>$49.99</strong> <s>$69.98</s> (save $19.99)</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Best kitchen deal under $50</strong></h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

It can crush and pulverize ice and other ingredients right in its 16-oz. single-serve cup for you to make smoothies, sauces, frozen drinks and plenty of other delicious treats right from your countertop. But it's small enough to take up hardly any footprint so you don't have to worry about it dominating your counter &ndash; you've probably got too many kitchen gadgets as it is. Pour directly from your cup and then take everything and wash it - you've just saved tons of money by not buying everything at a restaurant. </p><h3><strong>More kitchen deals under $50 at Amazon:</strong></h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/KJ0eG?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Ninja%20Blast%20Portable%20Blender&object_type=article&object_uuid=01XeZhqSzgwebQWpZVsih6p&short_url=KJ0eG&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Ninja Blast Portable Blender</a> &mdash; <strong>$49.99</strong> <s>$59.99</s> (save $10)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/1vBnA?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3Btemplate=article&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=Chefman%20XL%20Electric%20Griddle%20%2810%20x%2020%20inch%29&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=05Y8hfOjEt5SkaVtapKdg0c&amp%3Bshort_url=1vBnA&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Faug-8-amazon-under-50-deals&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Chefman%20XL%20Electric%20Griddle%20%2810%20x%2020%20inch%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=01XeZhqSzgwebQWpZVsih6p&short_url=1vBnA&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Chefman XL Electric Griddle (10 x 20 inch)</a> &mdash; <strong>$34.99</strong> <s>$39.99</s> (save $5)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/b13kE?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3Btemplate=article&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=Chemex%20Pour-Over%20Glass%20Coffeemaker&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=05Y8hfOjEt5SkaVtapKdg0c&amp%3Bshort_url=b13kE&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Faug-8-amazon-under-50-deals&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Chemex%20Pour-Over%20Glass%20Coffeemaker&object_type=article&object_uuid=01XeZhqSzgwebQWpZVsih6p&short_url=b13kE&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Chemex Pour-Over Glass Coffeemaker</a> &mdash; <strong>$38.32</strong> <s>$45.09</s> (save $6.77)</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Best travel deal under $50</strong></h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3><strong>Why we like it</strong></h3><p>No one likes losing things. But smart trackers like Apple AirTags can be a bit unwieldy due to their shape. The card-shaped <a href="https://zdcs.link/qkGqB?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Tile%20Slim%20Bluetooth%20tracker&object_type=article&object_uuid=01XeZhqSzgwebQWpZVsih6p&short_url=qkGqB&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Tile Slim Bluetooth tracker</a> is a great alternative for finding things that you may have misplaced nearby. It uses Bluetooth to help you track items and is thin enough to be placed in a wallet, luggage tag, or other larger item where a small disc-shaped object doesn't make much sense. It's compatible with iOS and Android devices, and you can actually leave it in your wallet without worrying about attaching it to a keyring. Now that's smart. </p><h3><strong>More travel deals under $50 at Amazon:</strong></h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/KJ0oy?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3Btemplate=article&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=Anker%20European%20Travel%20Plug&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=05Y8hfOjEt5SkaVtapKdg0c&amp%3Bshort_url=KJ0oy&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Faug-8-amazon-under-50-deals&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Anker%20European%20Travel%20Plug&object_type=article&object_uuid=01XeZhqSzgwebQWpZVsih6p&short_url=KJ0oy&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Anker European Travel Plug</a> &mdash; <strong>$9.99</strong> <s>$19.99</s> (save $10)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/OdmO8?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3Btemplate=article&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=Anker%20Nano%20Power%20Bank&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=05Y8hfOjEt5SkaVtapKdg0c&amp%3Bshort_url=OdmO8&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Faug-8-amazon-under-50-deals&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Anker%20Nano%20Power%20Bank&object_type=article&object_uuid=01XeZhqSzgwebQWpZVsih6p&short_url=OdmO8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Anker Nano Power Bank</a> &mdash; <strong>$19.99</strong> <s>$25.99</s> (save $6)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/2eMRY?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3Btemplate=article&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=Tile%20Sticker%20Bluetooth%20Tracker&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=05Y8hfOjEt5SkaVtapKdg0c&amp%3Bshort_url=2eMRY&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Faug-8-amazon-under-50-deals&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Tile%20Sticker%20Bluetooth%20Tracker&object_type=article&object_uuid=01XeZhqSzgwebQWpZVsih6p&short_url=2eMRY&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Tile Sticker Bluetooth Tracker</a> &mdash; <strong>$19.99</strong> <s>$29.99</s> (save $10)</p></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

<h3>Why we like it </h3><p>While it's never convenient to lose sight of essential belongings, it's even more important to have everything accounted for when you're traveling. The Tile Mate is a helpful tracking tool that you can apply to anything: your bag, wallet, keys, phone, or passport holder. You can use the Tile app to ring your tile if you're within 250 feet of it, or you can use the app to view your Tile's most recent location if you're further away. Today the Tile is on sale for less than $20 at Amazon, so it's a good time to stock up.</p><h2>More Bluetooth tracker deals:</h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/mVKZJ?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20AirTag%204-pack&object_type=article&object_uuid=0656zS7b9MhMjNAwcp9FdoQ&short_url=mVKZJ&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple AirTag 4-pack</a> &mdash; <strong>$79.99</strong> <s>$99.99 </s>(save $20)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/NMOWB?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Tile%20Slim%201-pack&object_type=article&object_uuid=0656zS7b9MhMjNAwcp9FdoQ&short_url=NMOWB&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Tile Slim 1-pack </a>&mdash; <strong>$24.99</strong> <s>$34.99 </s>(save $10)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/Ddeno?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=SAMSUNG%20Galaxy%20SmartTag2&object_type=article&object_uuid=0656zS7b9MhMjNAwcp9FdoQ&short_url=Ddeno&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">SAMSUNG Galaxy SmartTag2</a> &mdash; <strong>$27.95</strong> <s>$39.99 </s>(save $12.09)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/BdPGE?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Tile%20Mate%202-pack&object_type=article&object_uuid=0656zS7b9MhMjNAwcp9FdoQ&short_url=BdPGE&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Tile Mate 2-pack</a> &mdash; <strong>$34.99</strong> <s>$47.99 </s>(save $13)</p></li></ul><h2>Best vacation package deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>The current generation of iPhone 15 Pros also have four colorways, but based on this leak, it looks like the Blue Titanium version will be swapped out for the bronze. In the image, the new color is a muted brown, with a slight sheen, and decidedly not gold. The iPhone 15 Pro lineup also <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/apple-getting-rid-gold-iphone" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">didn't include</a> a gold colorway, so it seems like Apple is continuing to move away from the flashier sheen. Going with bronze would be a fitting choice for the iPhone 16 Pro since it would be in keeping with the metallic theme.

It's compatible with both i-type film and 600 film, though film is sold separately. Usually $119.99, it's down to just $92 for the first time. That's a savings of 23%.</p><p><em>None of these deals catching your eye?

<h2>Why we like it</h2><p>It's just a fact: All drinks are made better with The Good Ice&trade;. This portable ice maker from Insignia will ensure that you never run out of cubes, as it'll make more ice on its own every six to 13 minutes (don't worry, it has an auto shut-off function so you don't end up overflowing). You'll be able to choose from two different cube sizes, and make up to 19 pounds of them at a time. The machine recycles melted ice, too, so you won't have to fill the tank as often, and includes an easy-to-use control panel to simplify the whole experience.</p><h2>Best grill deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h2>Why we like it</h2><p>Calphalon has rightfully earned its place as one of the top kitchen brands thanks to its high-quality products. You probably know them most for their fantastic pots and pans, but they're also elite when it comes to cutlery. This knife block set comes with four different knives and a pair of kitchen shears, which is pretty much all you need unless you're literally a professional chef. As an added bonus, the knife block has a blade sharpener inside of it, so all of your upkeep is done for you.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a pet parent, then you know just how expensive keeping your fur baby happy and healthy can be. I have two beagles, and the money I&rsquo;ve spent on pet food, toys, treats, and vet bills over the years <em>should </em>justify them as dependents on my taxes. (It&rsquo;s crazy that we can&rsquo;t do that yet.) But, expensive or not, we&rsquo;re still going to spend what we have to, and even what we don&rsquo;t, to make sure they&rsquo;re taken care of. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

It can hold up to 50 portions or six meals per day and has customizable portions and serving times. The patent rotor, secure twist-lock lid, desiccant bag, and sealing strip are all designed to keep food fresh and prevent your pet from getting too much food at once. You can also record a 10-second message to call your pet to meals when you&rsquo;re away.</p><h3>More automatic pet feeder deals </h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/oejML?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=PETKIT%20Stainless%20Steel%20Water%20Fountain&object_type=article&object_uuid=01zf5bObIq3qEyyo8M3GWR7&short_url=oejML&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">PETKIT Stainless Steel Water Fountain</a> &mdash; <strong>$52.99 </strong><s>$69.99</s> (save $17) </p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/AdJEq?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=PETKIT%20Automatic%20Feeder&object_type=article&object_uuid=01zf5bObIq3qEyyo8M3GWR7&short_url=AdJEq&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">PETKIT Automatic Feeder</a> &mdash; <strong>$99 </strong><s>$179</s> (save $80) </p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/mVKd5?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=PETLIBRO%20Automatic%20Feeder%20with%20Camera&object_type=article&object_uuid=01zf5bObIq3qEyyo8M3GWR7&short_url=mVKd5&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">PETLIBRO Automatic Feeder with Camera</a> &mdash; <strong>$139.99 </strong><s>$159.99</s> (save $30 with on-screen coupon) </p></li></ul><h2>Best pet cam deal </h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>We're not sure why Apple injected this chip into its most premium tablet before integrating it into a MacBook Pro. (Perhaps Apple wanted to give us a teaser of what's to come). But based on the mind-blowing battery life runtime we got for the iPad Pro, as well as the impressive performance numbers, the M4 MacBook Pro models are likely going to make Windows PCs squirm.</p><p>That being said, let's take a look at all the leaks and rumors we've been hearing about M4 MacBooks. Plus, we'll also take a sneak peek at leaks and rumors of other upcoming Macs.</p><h2><strong>M4 MacBook Pro release date</strong></h2><p>According to an <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-04-14/humane-ai-pin-review-the-device-isn-t-going-to-kill-apple-s-iphone-luziqlew" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">April report from Gurman</a>, the next MacBook Pro will drop some time in later this year.

<p>We don't know any other details.</p><h2><strong>What about the M4 Mac mini?</strong></h2><p>We know quite a few details about the M4 Mac mini. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-08/mac-mini-m4-apple-plans-to-release-smallest-desktop-computer-yet?embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Gurman</a>, it will launch in two configurations: M4 and M4 Pro. Plus, it's due to drop some time at the end of 2024 or early 2025.</p><p>The Mac mini won't necessarily <em>look </em>different, but it will be significantly smaller. The Mac mini, by the way, hasn't had a design change since 2010. (As <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/08/04/m4-macbook-pro-launch-this-year/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">9to5Mac</a> pointed out, it lost its DVD drive and changed the I/O options, but it always remained a 7.7-inch aluminum slab.) It's expected to be the tiniest desktop computer that Apple has ever made. </p><p>The chassis is reportedly the size of an Apple TV. While the new M4 Mac mini is expected to have a smaller footprint overall, it will be slightly taller than the current-generation Mac mini. </p><h2><strong>What about the M4 Mac Studio?</strong></h2><p>Yes, according to Gurman, the M4 Mac Studio is also getting a refresh, but not until some time in the middle of 2025.</p><h2><strong>What about the M4 Mac Pro?</strong></h2><p>The aforementioned April <em>Bloomberg </em>report claims that the next Mac Pro, packed with an M4 Ultra chip, will drop during the "second half of 2025."</p><p></p><p></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Raygun also addressed the "allegations and misinformation floating around." The Australian Olympian's breakdancing display sparked numerous theories regarding exactly how she managed to get on the Olympic team in the first place, with people on social media <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/367059/raygun-olympic-controversy-breaking-corruption" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">speculating that she gained her place through less than honest means</a>.</p><p>In response, Raygun asked people to refer to statements made by the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC), AUSBreaking, and the World DanceSport Federation (WDSF). She also mentioned that there are no points in breaking, making an apparent effort to debunk misinformation regarding her performance.</p><p>"If you wanna see how the judges thought I compared to my opponents, you can actually see the comparison percentages across the five criteria on <a href="http://Olympics.com" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Olympics.com</a>," said Raygun.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>While it is true that the Olympic breaking judges didn't award "points" to dancers, further clarification doesn't do Raygun many favours. Olympic breakers competed in one-on-one battles consisting of up to three rounds, with each dancer getting one minute to perform per round. A panel of nine judges would score each round based on the dancers' technique, vocabulary, execution, musicality, and originality, then each vote for a winner.</p><p>However, Raygun didn't just lose three rounds. Her infamous 0-3 score is the result of her <a href="https://olympics.com/en/paris-2024/athlete/-raygun_1940107" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">losing all six rounds in all three battles she danced in</a>, failing to come out on top against the United States' Logistx, France's Syssy, and Lithuania's Nicka. None of her battles went to three rounds.&nbsp;</p><p>The 2024 Olympic gold medal for women's breaking eventually went to Japan's Ami Yuasa, with Lithuania's Dominika Banevi&#269; taking silver and China's Liu Qingyi winning bronze.&nbsp;</p><p>Raygun ended her video by requesting that the media leave her, her family and friends, and the breakdancing community alone. She stated she would be happy to answer more questions once she returns to Australia from a pre-planned break in Europe.</p><h2>The Australian Olympic Committee voices support for Raygun</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Well, you never know. On Wednesday, King shared some fan art on X (formerly Twitter) of main character Roland Deschain walking through Mid-world &mdash; and he followed it up with a post hinting that we might not have seen the last of the Gunslinger's former home.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>
<p>"Mid-world is still there," wrote King. "The Tower still stands."</p><p>Mid-world is, of course, the name of the world that's home to the series' eponymous Dark Tower, which itself holds the very fabric of the multiverse together. We don't know exactly what King meant by that post, but it at least suggests the horror master would be happy to revisit that world one day. Given that he already returned to it with <em>The Wind Through the Keyhole</em>, a novel set between books four and five that was published eight years after the main series ended, this maybe isn't all that much of a surprise.</p><p>Still, just because it's on his mind, doesn't mean we'll be seeing any more Dark Tower stories anytime soon.

<p>The Sonos Ray Soundbar ($279) occupies a unique space in Sonos's line of products and the broader soundbar market. Because of its lower-end price, it's a no-frills soundbar that doesn't even come with a remote or Bluetooth connectivity (really? in 2024?). This gave me pause at first, but upon testing and reflecting, I realized that not <em>everything </em>needs Bluetooth connectivity, nor does your tech need to possess every single feature possible if you only have one distinct purpose. And the Sonos Ray does deliver on the bottom line requirement of any speaker: true, quality sound.</p><p>I tested the Sonos Ray Soundbar and was pleasantly surprised that such a simple product could deliver on its few, albeit simple, promises. When many soundbars on the market are an eyesore, I thought it was excellent that the Sonos Ray soundbar can come in a crisp white that blends in well if you don't want that classic soundbar shape and color plunked into your home's aesthetic. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>What is the Sonos Ray Soundbar good for?</h2><p>The Sonos Ray soundbar is sleek, petite, crisp (in make and sound), and an all-around small but mighty soundbar to add to your entertainment system. However, you can't necessarily expect much more from this lower-cost soundbar from Sonos. It can make the audio of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Nintendo's </a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a> crystal clear such that you can make out the lush swishing of the animated grass and the crunch of gravel under Link's feet. It made Jeff Probst's narration of <em>Survivor</em> challenges burst from the TV with crisp, emphatic clarity, amplifying every splash, splat, and squelch of the contestants flailing in the ocean, sand, and mud. </p><p>That said, the options and possibilities for your Sonos Ray soundbar on its own are not limitless. It comes with a power cord and optical input cord, and that's it. I searched the box for a second for a remote, but Sonos wanted to simplify this particular soundbar (almost) to a fault. To my disappointment, I could not connect the soundbar to my projector during my initial test run. Without making any other purchases (say converter cables or additional products from Sonos), the only way to get the Sonos Ray up and running for an entertainment system is via your TV's optical cable, also known as a SPDIF cable. </p><p>This was new for me when it comes to a fancy gadget from a brand that foundationally prides itself on <a href="https://mashable.com/deals/echo-vs-echo-dot" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">smart speakers</a> that don't visually boast their specs but secretly pack so many different features and promise state-of-the-art synchronicity between pieces of your system.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2>Is the Sonos Ray Soundbar budget-friendly?</h2><p>The simplicity of the Sonos Ray soundbar is not necessarily a "downside" to the product as it's clear the brand developed the product with the intent to offer a (relatively) budget-friendly purchase option within its portfolio of devices and within the broader sea of soundbar options. The Sonos Ray soundbar comes in at $279, much lower than the average soundbar price on the market among brands like Sony, Bose, and Sonos's larger, more versatile Arc soundbar ($899). However, some research will reveal that many higher-cost soundbars from competing brands go on sale near the Sonos Ray price point.</p><p>Typically, a sale that ranks competitively would make me override a review and just recommend the better product. </p><p>However, I don't particularly think that's necessary in this case. Size doesn't equal power or sound quality with this model, and it brings into question why soundbars have to be so large and unwieldy in the first place. The Sonos Ray comes in a classic black or a sleek white that I think blends into its surroundings delicately. </p><p>The folks who would benefit from opting for an on-sale soundbar that rivals Sonos Ray's price would be anyone who really wants a wider portfolio of features.</p><h2>What features does the Sonos Ray Soundbar come with?&nbsp;</h2><p>The <a href="https://zdcs.link/Dd21N?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Sonos%20Ray&object_type=review&object_uuid=00nVAAvfOJEIJkXjHmnzNqI&short_url=Dd21N&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Sonos Ray</a> is no-frills when it comes to features, but you do still have to sign up for and use the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/sonos-app-apology" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Sonos app</a> to set it up and use it. This can be a true dealbreaker for folks who don't want to get their phone involved or prefer not to have an account attached to their device for digital privacy reasons.</p><p>As far as apps go, though, the Sonos app is very user-friendly and takes care of as much as possible for you. Once you plug in the speaker and sign up for the app, the app will find the product for you and connect it to your WiFi if you're already logged in. All you have to do is turn on your TV and get to watching and listening. I also liked that the Sonos Ray is compatible with IF remotes (infrared). I simply pointed my TV remote at the speaker to configure it and was ready to go in a matter of seconds. </p><p>Sonos really puts its money where its mouth is when it comes to sound quality. There's no doubt about it &mdash; these products sound great for music, movies, TV, weekend-long <em>Survivor</em> binges, and more. There are also incredible internal settings for your speaker that you can control via the intuitive app. However, the Sonos Ray doesn't have a microphone or any smart home compatibility built into the product. Although, if that's a must, you can finesse it into a broader smart home system with smart plugs.</p><p>These features include "speech enhancement" for those who want a crisper dialogue while enhancing the overall sound. During more action-packed, bass-heavy programming, the dialogue sometimes needs a little help rising above the rest of the excellent audio projection.&nbsp;</p><p>There's also "night sound," which dampens the deeper bass elements of the speaker &mdash; if you want enhanced audio while a baby, pup, partner, or roommate is asleep nearby. Sonos prides itself on device intelligence (i.e., intelligent features like device synchronicity, Alexa, Google, and Apple Home compatibility, and a lot more). It also offers Sonos's impressive "Trueplay Tuning," which measures how sound bounces off surfaces in your home and adjusts its audio performance accordingly for the smoothest, most dimensional audio experience possible. </p><h2>Does the Sonos Ray Soundbar sound good?</h2><p>Speaking of bouncing off surfaces, another feature I liked about the Sonos Ray soundbar is that the hardware speakers face forward, angling the audio directly out and at the viewer. This means that the Sonos Ray soundbar is the perfect candidate for fitting into a petite cubby inside a TV stand, a built-in shelf for a soundbar, or anywhere that would otherwise annoyingly envelope multi-directional sound and create a little cove of cacophony instead of a luxury audio experience.</p><h2>Is the Sonos Ray Soundbar worth it?</h2><p>The <a href="https://zdcs.link/Dd21N?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Sonos%20Ray&object_type=review&object_uuid=00nVAAvfOJEIJkXjHmnzNqI&short_url=Dd21N&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Sonos Ray</a>'s strengths lie in the same spaces that some may point to weaknesses &mdash; because this product is about fitting the buyer's needs. It's a straightforward install of one cord between itself and the TV, and a very easy-to-use app may be great for folks who don't care about all of that smart home hoopla (ahem, my parents). It is smaller and shorter than many soundbars on the market for those with little space on their TV stand or entertainment setup. The Sonos Ray soundbar could also neatly fit under a monitor in a gaming setup for gamers looking for a seamless luxury sound experience that fits into their space.<br><br>I would be remiss if I didn't mention that this speaker also follows through on music sound quality. The audio quality for music speaks for itself when you get one of your favorite heard-it-a-million-times songs going. The treble and bass quality are striking, even at a shallow volume level. The catch on the music aspect of the Sonos Ray is in line with its previously stated weaknesses: there's no Bluetooth connectivity. That doesn't matter here because you can play any music streaming app via your phone by simply selecting the speaker in the apps. One of the most striking things about the music quality on the Sonos Ray soundbar is how clear and crisp each guitar strum and cymbal hit is when listening to Palehound's &ldquo;Eye on the Bat.&rdquo;</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

      <description><![CDATA[Netflix's "Daughters" is an emotional documentary that offers an honest look at how incarceration affects families. Review.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/007B6rQsyOkzxhgSIoTdhvn/hero-image.jpg" alt="A scene from "Daughters.""><p>If you were lucky enough to have a good dad growing up, imagine if they were suddenly taken away for reasons you don't quite understand. Would you wonder why he was no longer around to sing you songs or talk with you? Would you be angry at his absence? That's the starting point for Angela Patton and Natalie Rae's moving documentary <em>Daughters</em>, which premiered at <a href="https://mashable.com/article/sundance-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Sundance</a> earlier this year and is now available to stream on Netflix.&nbsp;</p><p>The movie follows four girls &mdash; Aubrey, who excitedly recites her multiplication tables; Santana, who helps her mom take care of her younger siblings; Ja'Ana, who struggles to remember what her father looked like before he went to prison; Raziah, who wishes she could tell her dad about her day &mdash; and their incarcerated fathers as they prepare for the rare chance to hold and hug one another during a father-daughter dance.&nbsp;</p><p>As the documentary explains, the availability of in-person visits have sharply declined in prisons across the country, meaning years could pass between opportunities for children to hold their parent's hand or sit in their lap. The result that this has on the daughters in the film is profound. As the filmmakers check back in a year and then three years after the dance, missing out on time spent with a parent due to incarceration has lasting consequences on the girls' behavior and their well-being. It's heartbreaking to see the pieces of childhood lost as collateral damage.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What is <em>Daughters</em> about?</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The first voice in <em>Daughters</em> belongs to Patton, founder of the <a href="https://girlsforachange.org/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Girls for a Change</a> nonprofit, which aims to empower young Black girls. Their <a href="https://girlsforachange.org/events-and-programs/date-with-dad-weekend/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Date with Dad</a> event, which reunites daughters with their incarcerated fathers for one day, is a signature program of the organization. &ldquo;They already know what they need&hellip; The wisdom lives inside of them,&rdquo; Patton says of the girls. She explains that the idea for the event came from girls she worked with; it was the suggestion of bringing a dance <em>to</em> their dads that led to the program's creation in Richmond, VA, before expanding to Washington, D.C.&nbsp;</p><p>In preparation for the big event, the fathers enroll in a 10-week coaching class that will try to prepare them through the emotions of that day, examine their own family history, and rededicate themselves to being there for their daughters. The men's conversations are just as emotionally wrenching as the interviews with their daughters, revealing generations of pain and their intentions to do better for their kids. But the powerhouse moments really belong to Aubrey, Santana, Ja'Ana, and Raziah, who are unafraid to be honest about their hurt and confusion over their situation. Reuniting with their fathers is such a joyful but bittersweet moment; the men are in various stages of their sentences, and it may be years or even decades before they will have the chance to freely hug their daughters once again.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong><em>Daughters</em> celebrates and centers Black girlhood.&nbsp;</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Between the tearful moments (and there are a lot of them), the filmmakers sprinkle beautiful interstitial scenes of girls playing with each other, riding their bikes, running their fingers through blades of grass or splashing in a river. There are also plenty of poignant close-ups of a smaller hand grasping onto their parent's hand, showing that even as they grow older, they still rely on that sense of touch and the security, warmth, and love that comes with it. These scenes are typically used as background visuals behind a voice-over or contemplative beats by singer and cellist Kelsey Lu, but they beautifully illustrate what's at stake here, and what organizers, communities, and families are fighting for &mdash; offering these girls an ongoing connection with their fathers and the chance to enjoy moments of a carefree childhood as much as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>Cinematographer Michael Cambio Fernandez plays with different formats, using both digital and film to give <em>Daughters </em>the feeling of a family album. Grainy handheld footage, artistic black-and-white scenes, and starkly somber interview footage all meld together to give viewers a sense of every side of the story &mdash; including that of the hesitant mothers. We see the excitement of the girls' faces as they get ready for their big dance, the glee on the men's faces as they help each other tie their ties and get dressed up for their daughters. For a fleeting moment, there is hope and joy in everyone's faces, happy cries of &ldquo;Daddy!&rdquo; and &ldquo;I love my dad!&rdquo; fill the room.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Daughters</em> is easily one of the best documentaries you'll see all year. It's enlightening, it's moving, and it's stunning to watch. Patton and Rae focus on the experience of four little girls to illustrate such a specific loss that's often overlooked in conversations about the criminal justice system. The documentary leaves you with more to think about, some tears to dry, and perhaps the feeling you should call your dad to tell him you love him.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How to watch: </strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/ZRNBg?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Daughters%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Netflix.%C2%A0&object_type=article&object_uuid=007B6rQsyOkzxhgSIoTdhvn&short_url=ZRNBg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Daughters </em>is now streaming on Netflix.&nbsp;</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It turns out the Juice spacecraft isn't nearly 50 meters across. Its solar panel wings measure 27 meters (88 feet) from tip to tip &mdash; which is still quite big for a deep space probe. But it appeared very bright, owing to its reflective solar panels, so ESA's automated system initially estimated the object was a larger rock reflecting more light.</p><p>Scanning the skies for potentially menacing objects is essential. It gives us time to prepare, and if necessary, evacuate a certain area. "You need to know what's coming, when it's coming, and how hard it's going to hit," Eric Christensen, the director of the near-Earth object-seeking Catalina Sky Survey in Arizona, previously told Mashable.</p><q>

<p>Some space rocks do inevitably veer into our neck of the solar system woods from time to time. But space agencies haven't spotted any threats.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/07zFStaTbjKn4cpi5Htu702/hero-image.jpg" alt="Aaron Chang as Jimmy "Soup" Kim, Izaac Wang as Chris Wang, Tarnvir Kamboj as Hardeep, and Raul Dial as Fahad in writer/director Sean Wang's "Didi.""><p>There was a unique terror to realizing you'd been bumped out of a friend's top-eight on Myspace. Long before Twitter likes, Facebook statuses, or Instagram boyfriends, this early form of social media ushered millennials into a DIY HTML platform where you could share your likes, diary entries, and photos&nbsp;while <em>also</em> ruthlessly ranking your friends. This unique generational anxiety is captured with brilliant wit and poignancy in <em>D&igrave;di.</em>&nbsp;</p><p>The directorial debut of writer/director Sean Wang, <em>D&igrave;di</em> is a coming-of-age story that feels personal while avoiding the pitfalls of self-mythologizing or navel-gazing. The premise of a 13-year old Taiwanese American boy learning to be true to himself and nicer to his mother might sound a bit austere. Far from indulgent or meandering, it's radiantly vulnerable and utterly electrifying.&nbsp;</p><p>Wang rejects sentimentality and nostalgia, embracing a ruthlessly authentic look back at being a teen in the days of MySpace and <a href="https://mashable.com/archive/aim-not-dead-yet" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">AIM</a>. More than just set dressing, these online elements offer an unguarded access to the fickle thoughts and reckless impulses of a teen desperate to be seen but terrified of being perceived. But there's much more to <em>D&igrave;di </em>than Wang's mindful employment of antique social media.&nbsp;</p><h2>D&igrave;di is about the summers that define us.&nbsp;</h2><p>It's the summer of 2008 in the cozy Northern California town of Fremont. Kids are throwing parties, flirting in parks, and skateboarding wherever they can. In the midst of all this is Chris Wang (Izaac Wang, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/raya-and-the-last-dragon-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Raya and the Last Dragon</em></a>), who begins the summer by navigating the nightmare terrain of a boy/girl pool party. <em>D&igrave;di </em>won't deliver the soul-shaking secondhand embarrassment of Bo Burnham's heralded coming-of-age summer drama <a href="https://www.riotmaterial.com/bo-burnhams-eight-grade/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Eighth Grade</em>.</a> Nor will it reach the lunacy of the 2000s-set buddy sitcom <a href="https://mashable.com/article/pen15-season-2-part-2-review-immigrant-moms" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>PEN15</em></a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/pen15-season-2-part-2-review-immigrant-moms" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">.</a> Instead, Wang charts a course all his own by exploring the warring identities of its young hero through his many names.&nbsp;</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

<p>Among his school friends, who are all Asian, he goes by Wang Wang, and he's a foul-mouthed goofball, game for anything. At home, he is D&igrave;di, which in Mandarin is a pet name meaning Little Brother. There he vacillates between being playful with his finger-wagging grandmother Nai Nai (Chang Li Hua), mercurial to his devoted mom Chungsing (Joan Chen), and in squawking battles with his surly older sister Vivian (Shirley Chen). But when he befriends some older skaters &mdash;&nbsp;most of whom are white &mdash; he code-switches, introducing himself as Chris and eagerly insisting he can be the "filmer" to capture their sick moves on video, so they might score a skateboarding sponsorship. (The dream of '00s teens before the rise of influencers!) Meanwhile, his AIM handle is Bigwang510.&nbsp;</p><p>So, when he gets some much-yearned-for face time with his crush Madi (Mahaela Park), this kid on the brink of high school is not sure how to introduce himself. He fumbles, telling her his name is Chris but that his friends call him Wang Wang. When Madi asks what she should call him, it's not an easy answer&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;because who will he be to her?&nbsp;</p><h2>Izaac Wang leads a terrific ensemble.&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The child actors of <em>D&igrave;di </em>had to be taught about T9 word, the antiquated texting tool demanded by old-school flip phones equipped with only 9 keys. But they show no struggles embodying the '00s-era dialogue of gleeful juvenalia with barbs like, "Your mom is gay," and the hushed (and hilarious) response, "Dude &mdash;&nbsp;his mom has <em>cancer!"</em> In these frantic exchanges, Wang welcomes us back into the teen world, where talk about dental braces and dead squirrels can make or break friendships.&nbsp;</p><p>Here's where AIM and Myspace come into play. When a group hang gets messy, Wang Wang worries his best friend Fahad (Raul Dial) has outgrown him. In the instant messenger window, he types, "Are we still friends?" but doesn't hit send. Admittedly, it's a cliche to have a character type out the feelings they can't say aloud, but it's a cliche for a reason. Who among us hasn't started to text someone and then second-guessed hitting send?&nbsp;</p><p>Across Wang Wang's countenance, there are flickers of frustration, sadness, and anxiety. But at his fingertips is technology that allows him to express what he can't bring himself to say out loud. A similarly revealing exchange with Madi over AIM ends with him blocking her instead of admitting his own vulnerabilities. These repressions fester into outbursts against his mom, where he's so sharp that even his new friends question why he's being so mean. Something's got to give, and even as we witness Wang Wang deliver some snarling burns and unfair insults, you can't help but root for him to figure himself out &mdash;&nbsp;and hug his mom!&nbsp;</p><h2>D&igrave;di is a must-see coming-of-age movie, an instant classic.&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The way Wang weaves these elements of technology with his hero's rocky self-discoveries is elegantly done, even when the journey is purposefully not. There's a suitable chaos to <em>D&igrave;di </em>that reflects the tumultuousness of the teen mind. One moment Wang Wang is a loving goofball, playing the fool to make his friends and family laugh. The next, he's a sparkler of rage and recrimination, setting off fiery remarks until he runs out of fuel. Then he seems on the brink of an emotional breakthrough &mdash; or breakdown. And all of it is achingly raw and relatable.&nbsp;</p><p>Wang doesn't idealize or sanitize his teen characters, and thus they feel unflinchingly real. It's hard not to think of <em>Eighth Grade </em>or <em>Minding the Gap </em>or <a href="https://mashable.com/article/sundance-2018-movie-roundup" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Skate Kitchen</em></a> while watching Wang Wang, as each of these excellent movies explore the heady joys and crushing despair of being young and impressionable. But <em>D&igrave;di </em>doesn't pale in comparison to any of these. Instead, it feels like a part of their friend group, vibrant in spirit, agonizing in anxiety, and cathartic in its journey. But most of all, like these other critically heralded films, <em>D&igrave;di </em>is unforgettable.&nbsp;</p><p>When I first walked away from the film, I was charmed. But I also haven't been able to shake it. Be it the joltingly authentic performances of its young ensemble, the shrewd edit that throws audiences back into '00s chat rooms and all the drama they entail, or the frenzied excitement that bursts through in Wang Wang's revels, my mind went back again and again, making me laugh and cringe once more.&nbsp;</p><p>In the end, <em>D&igrave;di </em>isn't just a good coming-of-age movie or a great coming-of-age movie. <em>D&igrave;di </em>is unquestionably one of the most poignant and very best movies of the year.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/gl6de?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=D%C3%ACdi%20opens%20in%20select%20theaters%20July%2026%20and%20nationwide%20on%20Aug.%2016.&object_type=article&object_uuid=07zFStaTbjKn4cpi5Htu702&short_url=gl6de&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>D&igrave;di </em>opens in select theaters July 26 and nationwide on Aug. 16.</a></p><p class="mx-auto">

<p>Canadian actor Elliot Page stars as Sam, a trans man who is traveling to his hometown of Cobourg, Canada, to visit his family for the first time since transitioning. Directed by Dominic Savage, <em>Close to You </em>begins with some simple visual storytelling by establishing Sam in his Toronto rental, where he comfortably walks around without a shirt, his scars from top surgery on casual display. While making breakfast, he's joined by his housemate, who offers support but suggests maybe Sam need not put himself under the microscope of his family just because it's his dad's birthday.&nbsp;</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Despite his reluctance, Sam will go. Much of the drama will play out in his childhood home, between his parents, siblings, and their respective partners. However, woven throughout these family beats are bits of a romantic reunion between Sam and his high school bestie/crush Katherine (Hillary Baack). What begins as an enthusiastic conversation on a train spins into long walks and heavy-handed talks about what was and what could be.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Close to You</em> takes a big risk that doesn't pay off.&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Though Savage and Page are credited as screenwriters on the film, the production was made up largely of improvised dialogue &mdash;&nbsp;including <a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/festivals/elliot-page-close-to-you-toronto-film-festival-director-dominic-savage-1235717654/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>a 53-minute take</u></a> that is considerably cut down in the final edit. While a daring approach, it is the movie's biggest obstacle. A woeful lack of structure means one scene tumbles into another with little motivation. Sam's walks with Katherine feel so disjointed from the rest of the movie that I began to wonder if they were a flight of fantasy. Was Sam so under pressure by the tense family dynamics in the house that he imagined a safe space with the girl of his dreams smiling warmly at him? Or were the walks along the beach just a sincerely sentimental cliche?&nbsp;</p><p>A strong narrative structure wouldn't be a problem if <em>Close to You </em>played as a slice-of-life drama. But there too the film feels thin, in part because the dialogue &mdash;&nbsp;again, much of it improvised &mdash;&nbsp;lacks specificity. There's a slog of naturalistic but uncompelling dialogue occurring between collections of characters that does little to distinguish them from each other. Sam has two sisters (Janet Porter and Alex Paxton-Beesley), and they're chiefly defined by the men they date. One has a friendly beau who is smiling and enthusiastic to meet Sam. The other sister boasts a sneering transphobe (David Reale) for a fianc&eacute;, the kind who insists he's just asking questions and trying to play by "the rules" while making everyone else uncomfortable.&nbsp;</p><p>As the sisters seem to exist chiefly to introduce opposing attitudes toward Sam, one might wonder why they are needed at all. Couldn't the sisters be in opposition, as opposed to the boyfriends? Doesn't it weaken the stakes to have a family outsider giving voice to the tiresome transphobic talking points? As it is, the collection of kin feels ill-defined, and some are outright unneeded.&nbsp;</p><p>Further frustrating, Savage's staging of the introduction of the family is in a clumsy and darkly lit wide shot. So, it's difficult to make out from the jump who is who. Later, when one of this crew (Daniel Maslany) pours his heart out to the film's hero, it might have been a touching moment &mdash; if I had any idea who he was in relation to Sam! It's as if Savage is taking for granted that these abstractions of characters will be enough, perhaps relying on audiences to plug and play their own family into the roles, for better or worse. But with cinematography that gives little focus to anyone's close-ups save for Page, it's hard to see,&nbsp;much less connect with, the majority of the ensemble.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Close to You</em> offers drama that is earnest but not earned.&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Even Sam can be a vexing enigma. Vocally, he expresses how he wishes to be seen by his family as the whole of who he is, and not solely defined as trans. However, his trans identity is the most talked-about element of the character in <em>Close to You. </em>Aside from the swift intro, we don't see much of his life in Toronto. The ambiguous dialogue keeps talk of his romantic life and community there very vague. When asked about his work &mdash; even repeatedly &mdash; he only says that he likes it, never mentioning what it is or why he enjoys it. It's less than small talk. What he does is never revealed, nor are any other friends, and so goes another opportunity to get to know Sam beyond his trans identity and his family's fighting.&nbsp;</p><p>Sam's romance with Katherine does bolster the character, as it shows a side of him where he doesn't need to be on guard or constantly explaining his right to exist. These scenes seem to aim for a <em>Before Midnight </em>vibe, but again, improvised dialogue keeps things vague &mdash; albeit sweet and sentimental. While Page and Baack do share a warm chemistry, it's not so white-hot that the third-act possibility of a romantic runaway relationship feels likely,&nbsp;perhaps especially amid so much naturalistic dialogue that suggests only grounded choices are on the table.&nbsp;</p><p>The bits that work best in this film are those between Sam and his parents. In a kitchen scene, his mother (Wendy Crewson) &mdash; desperate to show her support &mdash;&nbsp;awkwardly offers him money in the middle of asking him to help with the cooking. There is specificity, with her welcoming him into her space and trying to reach out the way many parents do. Later, his father (Peter Outerbridge) reflects on when Sam left home, laying out the fears he faced in not being within reach of his child. Here again, details paint the picture of these people, their relationship, and the stakes Sam and his family face.&nbsp;</p><p>For much of the film, <em>Close to You </em>keeps us at arm's length. Its experiment with improvisation might have had great intentions in terms of seeking authenticity. However, this method ultimately fails in constructing a successfully engaging narrative or fleshed-out characters. Sam's journey is carried chiefly by Page's performance, which is sharp-eyed and big-hearted. However, as Sam meanders from romantic rendezvous to stressful dining room debate and back again, it's difficult to connect to the flow of the film, especially with so much stagnant dialogue. Despite good intentions, <em>Close to You </em>has lofty aims but wobbly execution.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/yLMM6?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Close%20to%20You%20opens%20in%20theaters%20Aug.%2016.&object_type=article&object_uuid=0554tRJzzpcbTsbWELk9gJV&short_url=yLMM6&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Close to You</em> opens in theaters Aug. 16.</a></p><p class="mx-auto">

The game is all about finding the "common threads between words." And just like <em>Wordle</em>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-20-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Connections</em></a> resets after midnight and each new set of words gets trickier and trickier&mdash;so we've served up some hints and tips to get you over the hurdle.</p><p>If you just want to be told today's puzzle, you can jump to the end of this article for August 16's <em>Connections</em> solution. But if you'd rather solve it yourself, keep reading for some clues, tips, and strategies to assist you.</p><h2>What is Connections?</h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple.

What's more, the ruthenium samples didn't match the remnants of other major asteroid impacts, which came from objects formed in the inner solar system.</p><p>"We found that the composition of the asteroid that impacted at Chicxulub is the same as that of carbonaceous meteorites, which are fragments of carbonaceous (C-type) asteroids that originally formed beyond the orbit of Jupiter," Fischer-G&ouml;dde said.</p><p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/24322" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Previous research</a> suspected the culprit was a C-type asteroid, too, but didn't use ruthenium in the analyses. That's because making these ruthenium measurements is very difficult, and progressive technological advancements made the latest observations possible, Fischer-G&ouml;dde explained. Only three or so laboratories globally, including at the University of Cologne, can conduct this ultra-specialized research.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

The best I can do is this article.</p><p>There's a new trend on X, formerly known as <a href="https://mashable.com/category/twitter" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Twitter</a>, in which users are responding to their parents' hypothetical requests for grandchildren.

The cost of raising a child has increased significantly in recent years, including housing, education, and healthcare. Overpopulation and the environmental impact of bringing additional people into the world during a climate crisis are turning people who might be able to afford it away from having kids. And many countries are facing political and social unrest, leading many young people to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-68402139" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">delay or avoid having kids</a> altogether. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Of course, there are good reasons people aren't having kids, too. There are changing social norms and societal expectations around marriage and family, and contraception is more accessible.</p><p>But the truth is that fewer people are having children. So what are we doing with all of that extra time? What are we telling our parents when they request a new generation? X has the answers.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>The tragic incident occurred on Oct. 5, 2023, at Raglan Road Irish Pub, an Ireland-themed restaurant and entertainment experience at the Disney Springs shopping center in Orlando. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/disney-allergy-death-lawsuit-nyu-doctor-florida-4bdaf74e2c889882b23b319ec720680a" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">The Associated Press</a> reports that Tangsuan was allergic to nuts and dairy and reportedly informed the server of this "numerous times." Despite assurances that the food was dairy- and nut-free, Tangsuan experienced a horrific allergic reaction about 45 minutes after the meal, was hospitalized, and later died.</p><p>Disney's legal team now claims that when Piccolo signed up for a free trial of Disney+ back in 2019, he "agreed to arbitrate 'all disputes'" against the company &mdash; meaning <em>all</em> of them, no matter what they involve &mdash; and that he roped in his wife into the arbitration clause when he bought park tickets, so he can't sue on her behalf either.</p><p>If you have time, <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25042022/disney-motion-wrongful-death.pdf" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Disney's May 31 legal filing</a> makes for a compelling read. It proceeds step by step through all the terms of service documents Piccolo must have signed, at exactly what point in time, and exactly what Disney feels the legal implications were each time.&nbsp;</p><p>First, Disney's lawyers say, Piccolo allowed himself to be captured by this all-encompassing arbitration clause when he signed up for a Disney+ free trial in 2019 and created a Disney account. He then used that Disney account to buy his Disney World tickets in 2023, and Disney notes that he would have clicked a box agreeing to the My Disney Experience terms of use. Those terms of use say they are for "yourself and all persons (including minors) for whom you are purchasing or otherwise securing benefits." Ipso facto, via this complex chain of events, Disney feels it shouldn't have to be sued in actual court for this alleged wrongful death.</p><p>Disney's lawyers note that, according to the <em>Times</em>, "Further litigation would only generate needless expenses and waste judicial resources."</p><p>Needless to say, this concerns us all because there's a good chance most of us have also clicked our way into Disney's legal labyrinth at some point.&nbsp;</p><p>In a statement to Mashable, a Disney spokesperson said the following: "We are deeply saddened by the family&rsquo;s loss and understand their grief. Given that this restaurant is neither owned nor operated by Disney, we are merely defending ourselves against the plaintiff&rsquo;s attorney&rsquo;s attempt to include us in their lawsuit against the restaurant."</p><p>It's worth noting that Raglan Road Irish Pub itself is a named defendant in the lawsuit, and that the restaurant itself is not in fact a Disney <a href="https://scottjosephorlando.com/dundon-exits-raglan-road/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">possession</a>. It's early days yet, but a judge could potentially view Disney as using this bold legal rationale to escape involvement in what it views as a legal matter primarily between the plaintiff and Raglan Road Irish Pub.</p><p>Piccolo's lawyers call Disney's argument "fatally flawed" and "absurd." In their Aug. 2 response, as quoted by the Associated Press, they wrote, "The notion that terms agreed to by a consumer when creating a Disney+ free trial account would forever bar that consumer&rsquo;s right to a jury trial in any dispute with any Disney affiliate or subsidiary is so outrageously unreasonable and unfair as to shock the judicial conscience."</p><p>Ross Intelisano, a lawyer unrelated to the case whose work involves arbitrations, told the <em>New York Times</em> that Disney's claim is "a big stretch." Defendants tend to prefer arbitration over the actual courts because arbitration is private and because arbitration panels "typically do not grant large sums of punitive damages," the <em>Times</em> notes.</p><p>According to the Associated Press, a court hearing on Disney's motion to dismiss in favor of arbitration is scheduled for Oct. 2.</p><p class="mx-auto">
   <em><strong>UPDATE: Aug. 15, 2024, 12:00 p.m. PDT </strong>This story has been updated to include a statement from Disney.</em>

<p>Google just debuted its new <a href="https://mashable.com/article/pixel-watch-3-google-event-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Pixel Watch 3</a> during this week's Made by Google event. It's fun to nab the latest and greatest tech, especially when it comes to iterative devices like phones and smartwatches. But if you don't want to keep up with the Joneses and shell out all kinds of cash for the newest Pixel Watch model, you don't have to. Now that the Pixel Watch 3 is <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-pixel-watch-3-preorder" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">up for preorder</a>, that means the previous Pixel Watch 2 is available for a great price &ndash; in fact, it's now the lowest we've ever seen it sell for. </p><p>As of August 15, you can get the <a href="https://zdcs.link/ZRN4R?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Google%20Pixel%20Watch%202&object_type=article&object_uuid=00TIS6MAKw1iMyViYY1hM1x&short_url=ZRN4R&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Google Pixel Watch 2</a> for just $249.99 at Amazon. That's $100 off its normal price of $349.99 and a discount of 29%, marking the <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0CCQFL1XV" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">lowest price</a> we've seen on this watch. This is even cheaper than the previous deal we spotted at $269.99, so now's the time to buy if you've had your eye on a Pixel Watch. </p><p>This model comes with a swath of great features that include Fitbit-centric tracking as well as the same smartwatch features you'd expect. You can call, text, email and get news and weather updates right from your wrist. But you also get heart rate, temperature and stress tracking as well as fall detection and plenty of other useful health-centric options that make it a budget-friendly alternative to Samsung's offerings (or the Apple Watch). </p><p>Google boasts that the watch can get up to 24 hours of battery life, though you can juice it up again in just over an hour in a pinch. It's bright, with a crisp screen and sleek aesthetic, and best of all, it's more affordable than ever right now. Snatch it up before it's gone. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2><strong>Microsoft Surface Laptop 7 is the best Windows laptop of 2024: 3 reasons why</strong></h2><p>Stay with me here. In order for you to understand <em>why </em>the Surface Laptop 7 is best Windows laptop of 2024, you need a little historical context. Because the Surface family wasn't <em>always </em>highly recommended &mdash; until now.</p><p>A few years ago, I was smack talking the Surface Laptop 5 when I reviewed it for a different publication. (The Surface Laptop 5 is <em>technically </em>the Surface Laptop 7's predecessor. There's a Surface Laptop 6, but only for business and not available in stores.) I had so much faith in Microsoft. I wanted it to win so badly &mdash; but it just couldn't live up to my expectations.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>It's not that Microsoft Surface laptops were awful <em>per se</em> &mdash; they just kept getting outperformed by cheaper, better competitors. So I couldn't, in good conscience, recommend them.</p><p>Now, if you were to tell me that, in 2024, I'd be recommending a Surface laptop, I'd say, "You're out of your mind!" But here I am, as a laptop expert, actually suggesting a Microsoft laptop to my readers. But you know what? I'm backing this up. <strong>I have proof </strong>that it's the best Windows laptop of the year. Here are my three reasons:</p><h3><strong>1. Microsoft Surface Laptop 7 performance beats all of its rivals, including the M3 MacBook</strong></h3><p>I don't want to bore you with too many details about chipsets, but they're crucial to bring up to help you understand why Microsoft Surface family now has positive critical reception from testers after a few tumultuous years.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

(Apple's current-gen MacBooks are now rocking M3 series chips and it's <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-every-mac-line-will-get-m4" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">reportedly eyeing an M4 release soon</a>).</p><p>Now, non-Apple vendors have finally hopped aboard the "Intel ain't it" train, thanks to Qualcomm, an Intel rival. Qualcomm announced it had a chipset, dubbed the Snapdragon X Elite processor, that is <em>so </em>good, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/cpu/qualcomm-claims-its-snapdragon-x-plus-is-an-m3-beater-but-it-is-really#:~:text=According%20to%20Qualcomm's%20benchmarks%20for,M3%20processor%2C%20another%20large%20boast." target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">it beats all M3-based MacBooks</a>. Now, I was skeptical, but this Snapdragon X Elite processor was packed inside the new Microsoft Surface Laptop 7 that dropped this year &mdash; and it blew its rivals out of the water.</p><p>With "Best performance mode" turned on in Settings, the Surface Laptop 7 notched an <em>incredible</em> multi-core score of <strong>14,548</strong> on Geekbench 6. For context, here are the multi-core scores of other laptops I've tested this year:</p><ul><li><p><strong>14-inch M3 MacBook Pro - 11,998</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>15-inch M3 MacBook Air - 12,057</strong></p></li></ul><p>And yes, I purposely highlighted Apple's M3 MacBooks here to prove a point (i.e., Qualcomm was right). This wasn't just a fluke either. The <a href="https://mashable.com/review/hp-omnibook-x" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">HP OmniBook X</a> I reviewed this year, also packed with a Snapdragon X Elite chip, is almost as good as the Surface Laptop 7, but delivered a <em>slightly </em>lower multi-core score of <strong>13,888.</strong></p><h3><strong>2.

<p>However, as a laptop reviewer, I know more than anyone that no machine is ever perfect. One flaw that I spotted with the Surface Laptop 7 is app incompatibility. It's something I discovered when I tried to install the Apple Music app. I typically have no issues with doing this on other Windows systems, but it looks like some developers haven't enabled Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite support for their apps yet.</p><p>The Surface Laptop 7 is not a gaming PC by any means (it lacks a discrete GPU), but I'll admit that you can get away with some <em>light </em>gaming on it. So keep in mind that some games, according to <a href="https://www.worksonwoa.com/games/?compatibility=Unplayable" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">this list</a>, may not run properly on the Surface Laptop 7.</p><p>Overall, though, the Surface Laptop 7 has never-ending battery life, engaging AI features, zippy performance, a sturdy, anti-fingerprint chassis, and more. How could it not be the best Windows laptop of 2024?</p><p>The Surface Laptop 7 is <a href="https://zdcs.link/kn6Dg?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=%241%2C599%20on%20Amazon.&object_type=article&object_uuid=05djrP5PjtVB7CcMtvrTOAP&short_url=kn6Dg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">$1,599 on Amazon.</a></p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

It is beautiful, but it is not a particularly Roman work of art. Romans definitely erected plenty of pietas, which did take off during the reign of Augustus (<a href="https://mashable.com/article/mark-zuckerberg-augustus-caesar-comparison" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Zuckerberg's number one role model</a>). But pietas at the time were often coins, not massive statues. And while pietas were shown as signs of devotion toward powerful women, they weren't always people's lovers, wives, or partners. Augustus didn't actually commission many statues of his wife, Livia Drusilla, that we know of. He commissioned statues about his family, his reign, his values, and other monuments, but there weren't statues of personal romantic relationships &mdash; at least, not ones he erected in public.</p><blockquote class="mx-auto instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/C-naZ9NvQNu/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="12" style=" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin-top: 1px; margin-bottom:1px; max-width:540px; min-width:326px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);">

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/02AbIdffkSmbeGnQkO8NEPH/hero-image.jpg" alt="Amazon review from Shutterstock"><p>The Federal Trade Commission has announced a new rule that should theoretically make online user reviews of products more useful. </p><p>In a <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/08/federal-trade-commission-announces-final-rule-banning-fake-reviews-testimonials" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">press release</a>, the FTC announced a finalized set of guidelines aimed at taking down fraudulent or misleading product reviews on the internet. Among the things that will be prohibited once the rule goes into effect are paid reviews and those generated by artificial intelligence. The maximum penalty for transgressions is $51,744 per violation.</p><p>&ldquo;Fake reviews not only waste people&rsquo;s time and money, but also pollute the marketplace and divert business away from honest competitors,&rdquo; FTC chair Lina Khan said. &ldquo;By strengthening the FTC&rsquo;s toolkit to fight deceptive advertising, the final rule will protect Americans from getting cheated, put businesses that unlawfully game the system on notice, and promote markets that are fair, honest, and competitive.&rdquo;</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>What did the FTC ban?</h2><p>The FTC's press release included a helpful list of everything that is prohibited by this new rule:</p><ul><li><p>Fake reviews and testimonials, whether written by humans or AI, that misrepresent either the author of the review or the author's experience with the product</p></li><li><p>Paid reviews (either negative or positive)</p></li><li><p>Reviews and testimonials from company insiders with a conflict of interest</p></li><li><p>Companies owning websites that claim to host independent reviews of their products</p></li><li><p>Using groundless legal threats or intimidation to have negative reviews removed</p></li><li><p>Buying or selling fake social media followers or views for a commercial purpose</p></li></ul><p>That's a pretty comprehensive list of things that can be troublesome in the realm of online product reviews. Amazon, alone, had to remove 200 million fake reviews on its site in 2020, per <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/amazon-deflects-responsibility-on-fake-reviews-but-admits-200m-were-blocked-last-year/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">TechCrunch</a>. These new rules aim to make it easier to identify genuine reviews and reduce the presence of fake ones.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Fall is one of the best times to head outside. Not only do the summer crowds vanish, the temperature drops back into a range that's comfortable to be outside all day. It also means you might be able to snag that camping reservation you've been hoping would open up.</p><p>Spending time in the great outdoors comes with the need for some great gear. You'll want to cover some bases before setting out, like having a reliably weatherproof tent and a cozy sleeping setup.</p><p>If your collection of camping gear could use a tune up, we're seeing some great deals at Amazon during the week of Aug. 15.

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>If you're taking the whole family camping, you'll want somewhere cozy and spacious to sleep. Sleeping up to eight people, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/KJ7mE?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Coleman%20Evanston%20Screened%20Camping%20Tent&object_type=article&object_uuid=028lFV0HCQyAneG71GGJ6VK&short_url=KJ7mE&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Coleman Evanston Screened Camping Tent</a> impresses in functionality with a budget-friendly price. Thanks to today's sale price, you can grab the tent for just $138.28, down from the list price of $289.99. That's a massive 52% discount.</p><p>One of the highlights of the Coleman Evanston tent is the screened-in porch, allowing you to still feel the joys out being outside without having to deal with all the bugs. Measuring about six feet tall in the center, all but the tallest family members won't have to duck once they're inside.

And as Mashable's reviewer noted, it's also "blazing fast, making it a good alternative to pricier tablets for streaming and games." At full price, it'll run you $229.99, but as of Aug. 15, it's down to just $169.99 &mdash; that's 26% in savings and about $30 away from its record-low.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

It may not be the most advanced iPad in the Apple ecosystem, but it's still pretty solid with an A14 Bionic chip, 10.9-inch Liquid Retina display, and fun color options. </p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>If you're sick of doing the storage shuffle to make space on your computer for new stuff, the Samsung 990 EVO SSD offers 1TB of "premium storage that won't break your budget." Our friends over at PCMag (which is owned by Mashable's publisher, Ziff Davis) <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/samsung-ssd-990-evo" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">tested it out</a> and found it to be an "excellent-value mainstream M.2 internal SSD, with whizzy performance and the class-leading warranty, software, and security that you'd expect from Samsung." It even earned their coveted Editor's Choice award. Usually $149.99, it's on sale for only $69.99 as of Aug. 15 &mdash;&nbsp;that's over half off and its lowest price on record.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>It's hurricane season, which means it's not a bad idea to prepare yourself for potential emergency power outages. If you don't want to spend an arm and a leg on a generator, the Anker 548 Power Station makes having backup power affordable and simple. It features a built-in retractable light, an SOS button for emergencies, two USB-C outlets, two USB-A outlets, and a battery that will maintain 85 percent charge even after a year. Better yet, when you're not using it for backup power, you can take it along on camping trips for portable charging. Regularly $149.99, it's on sale for just $99.74 at Amazon with the on-page coupon. That's its lowest price on record.</p><p><em>None of these deals catching your eye?

As of today, Google is moving the relevant sites section of its AI Overviews to the righthand side of the page. This is a change from the previous interface which was below the AI-generated summary and features the websites more prominently. Now when you Google something like "how to get marks off walls," relevant pages show up right next to the summary. Other sites populate the page below in the classic format. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Additionally, Google is exploring a feature in its testing ground Labs that directly links to relevant sites. "[The goal is to] make it easier for people to click out and visit the sites that interest them and and reduce the friction even further," Hema Budaraju told Mashable. "This experiment has shown positive results that these links make it possible for people to connect, and naturally will drive more traffic to publisher sites."</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

Indeed, Marc McCollum, chief innovation officer at publisher monetization company Raptive <a href="https://apnews.com/article/google-search-ai-overviews-internet-traffic-ebb6bbbde17ed29a5f7b630d9e5e285b" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">told</a> the <em>Associated Press</em>, that search traffic could decline by 25 percent, costing many publishers their main source of revenue. </p><p>But that was then. Whether or not Google acquiesced to publisher backlash or simply wanted a better user experience is unclear. However, Google's announcement carefully positions itself and AI Overviews as a conduit for discovering more by clicking out to publisher sites. Google claims that AI Overviews have contributed to a "greater diversity of websites" and "higher quality" of clicks on those sites. We'd love to get our hands on that data, but alas, we'll have to take Google's word for it. </p><p>Perhaps bolstered by its unpublished findings, Google is expanding AI Overviews to six countries: the UK, India, Japan, Indonesia, Mexico and Brazil, with local language support. Plus, users enrolled in Labs can test out new two new additional features. As of today, Labs users can save specific AI Overview responses so you can easily access it again. Users can also opt to "simplify" a response if the AI Overview is too technical or complicated for novices.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The email, titled "A Fork in the Road," followed a string of odd choices from the billionaire after he bought and began running the platform then known as Twitter. In that email, Musk issued an ultimatum demanding employees click yes to working "extremely hardcore." Well, now that little stunt had cost X hundreds of thousands of dollars. </p><p>Ireland's Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) ruled that a former senior executive for Twitter was wrongly terminated when he declined to click the yes button in Musk's email, <a href="https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2024/0813/1464761-record-award-of-550k-to-former-twitter-senior-executive/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">reported the Irish news outlet RT&Eacute;</a>. The WRC ordered X to pay the ex-employee, Gary Rooney, a record &euro;550,000 or roughly $605,000. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

        </a>
    </div>
<p>The email from Musk came on the heels of the self-crowned chief twit firing roughly half of Twitter's workforce. He effectively demanded his employees work unspecified hours under high-intensity conditions. Rooney apparently balked at agreeing to those "hardcore" demands on a one-day deadline. Rooney claimed he was let go after not clicking yes, RTE reported. The WRC, in fact, ruled Rooney had been fired for not clicking yes, <a href="https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2024/0813/1464761-record-award-of-550k-to-former-twitter-senior-executive/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">RTE noted</a>, and said it was an unfair termination because Twitter didn't have substantial grounds to let him go. </p><p>WRC adjudication officer Michael MacNamee <a href="https://www.audacy.com/krld/news/national/twitter-worker-fired-for-not-replying-to-musk-wins-complaint" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">wrote in the ruling</a>: "No employee, when faced with such a situation, could possibly be faulted for refusing to be compelled to give an open-ended unqualified assent to any of the proposals."</p><p>Musk might've gotten the "hardcore" promises he was looking for, but now his company may have to write a pretty hefty check as a result. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>We get it. Snail mucus? As in the sticky stuff that snails leave when they move? Yeah, that's right. It'll do wonders for your skin, and that's why this <a href="https://zdcs.link/6Xdy3?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=essence&object_type=article&object_uuid=03Udyd8YqEMzvjOfxNLtXM5&short_url=6Xdy3&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">essence</a>, or a water-based hydrating product, is such a highly-rated favorite among skincare enthusiasts. It helps to repair and hydrate thirsty skin while absorbing quickly &ndash; and has none of those heavy, sticky feelings that a traditional moisturizer has. Snail mucin helps to deliver deep moisture, so you can add serums and other treatments that can help you achieve the smooth, virtually poreless look that glass skin requires. And continued use will make sure that your moisture barrier stays happy and satisfied, which means better, healthier skin in the long run. Just don't think about snails, if it helps. </p><h2>Best toner deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>Face toners are important if you want to remove additional dirt or impurities that your cleanser didn't catch. They also help prep skin for serums and moisturizers, while closing pores and helping to brighten (and sometimes tighten) skin.

<h3>Why we like it </h3><p>OK, we know Lenovo isn&rsquo;t exactly a powerhouse when it comes to tablets. <em>But </em>if you need a super cheap tablet for basic tasks, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/rdxrm?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Lenovo%20Tab%20M8&object_type=article&object_uuid=07oV3LJUY3BYJQuCZZLjieW&short_url=rdxrm&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Lenovo Tab M8</a> (4th gen) is currently on sale for just $77.71.</p><p>This tablet only has 32GB of storage, but if you&rsquo;re not saving a ton of apps and games, that should be enough for occasional web browsing, streaming, and reading. It has an 8-inch HD display, so the screen quality won't blow you away, but it's decent enough for casual use. And with 16 hours of battery life, it should get you through a long flight or just a quiet night at home. </p><p>For the price, it's a good option if you need an affordable tablet that can handle basic tasks. It could also be a great option for kids who will mostly use it for streaming shows during car rides or for playing games during screen time periods. With an 8-inch screen, it can work well for older folks who are looking for something a bit bigger than a smartphone for browsing the web and sending e-mails. </p><h3>More tablet deals to shop this week</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/Gd3x8?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Amazon%20Fire%20HD%208%20Plus%20bundle%20%28Hexa-core%202.0%20GHz%2C%2032GB%2C%20WiFi%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=07oV3LJUY3BYJQuCZZLjieW&short_url=Gd3x8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Amazon Fire HD 8 Plus bundle (Hexa-core 2.0 GHz, 32GB, WiFi)</a> &mdash; <strong>$99.98 </strong><s>$169.98</s> (save $70)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/AdJMw?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Amazon%20Fire%20Max%2011%20%28Octa-core%2C%2064GB%2C%20WiFi%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=07oV3LJUY3BYJQuCZZLjieW&short_url=AdJMw&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Amazon Fire Max 11 (Octa-core, 64GB, WiFi)</a> &mdash; <strong>$169.99 </strong><s>$229.99</s> (save $60)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/DdeKW?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Lenovo%20Tab%20P12%20%28MediaTek%20Dimensity%207050%2C%20256GB%2C%20WiFi%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=07oV3LJUY3BYJQuCZZLjieW&short_url=DdeKW&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Lenovo Tab P12 (MediaTek Dimensity 7050, 256GB, WiFi)</a> &mdash; <strong>$329.99 </strong><s>$379.99</s> (save $50)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/KJ7jD?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20iPad%20Mini%208.3-inch%20%28A15%2C%2064GB%2C%20WiFi%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=07oV3LJUY3BYJQuCZZLjieW&short_url=KJ7jD&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple iPad Mini 8.3-inch (A15, 64GB, WiFi)</a> &mdash; <strong>$379.99 </strong><s>$499</s> (save $119.01)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/xP40x?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%20Galaxy%20Tab%20S9%20FE%2B%20Plus%20%28Samsung%20Exynos%201380%2C%20256GB%2C%20WiFi%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=07oV3LJUY3BYJQuCZZLjieW&short_url=xP40x&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ Plus (Samsung Exynos 1380, 256GB, WiFi)</a> &mdash; <strong>$549.99 </strong><s>$699.99</s> (save $150)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/5MD75?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%20Galaxy%20Tab%20S9%20Ultra%20%28Qualcomm%20Snapdragon%208%20Gen%202%2C%20256G%2C%20WiFi%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=07oV3LJUY3BYJQuCZZLjieW&short_url=5MD75&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra (Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, 256G, WiFi)</a> &mdash; <strong>$1,049.99 </strong><s>$1,199.99</s> (save $150)</p></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

Once a relatively obscure term you might&rsquo;ve last encountered during a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@netflix/video/7402355815794920746?_r=1&amp;_t=8os5fXCXdfy" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Gilmore Girls</em> rewatch</a>, it suddenly became ubiquitous. That&rsquo;s the way things work on TikTok &mdash; for better or worse.</p><p>For those unfamiliar with the platform, the latest TikTok trend involves users claiming how "demure" and "mindful" they are in various situations. It&rsquo;s a self-effacing, tongue-in-cheek joke where people adopt a persona that boasts about being demure while doing something as mundane as eating a blooming onion at Outback Steakhouse.</p><p>The trend started with creator Jools Lebron, known as <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@joolieannie" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">@joolieannie on TikTok</a>, who coined the catchphrase "very demure, very mindful."

<p>But the rise of "demure" is not an isolated incident. The internet &mdash;TikTok in particular &mdash; has a habit of plucking words from obscurity, turning them into memes, and then overusing them to the point of exhaustion. Just look at the spike in Google Trends searches over the past week.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

TikTok, in particular, seems to have a knack for reviving old or obscure words. Sometimes it&rsquo;s crass, like "glazing" or "<a href="https://mashable.com/article/serving-cunt-meme" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">serving c*nt</a>," but there are also phrases like "it&rsquo;s giving" or "girly pop." And then there are updated ways of saying old things, like calling someone who gossips a "yapper" or using "<a href="https://mashable.com/article/pookie-explained-meaning-tiktok" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">pookie</a>" as a term of endearment.

<p>But with TikTok, words themselves become funny because we see and hear people say them. It&rsquo;s the age-old challenge for writers: the right word at the right time can be surprisingly delightful. TikTok amplifies these words, turning them into trends as creators like <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@joolieannie" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">@joolieannie</a> demonstrate that how a word is said can make it interesting and new. And as we mindlessly scroll through TikTok, these words inevitably worm their way into our vocabulary.</p><p>The "demure" trend is no different from when streamer <a href="https://mashable.com/article/who-is-sketch-streamer-whats-up-brother-sports" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Sketch had the entire sports world saying</a>, "What&rsquo;s up, brother," in a specific voice and cadence. Words and phrases can be funny simply because they are. It may sound like circular logic, but it holds true.</p><p>Think of it this way: in your group of friends &mdash; especially during high school or college &mdash; you probably had buzzwords and shorthand that only your group understood. You spent so much time together that you developed an internal language. TikTok&rsquo;s influence on our word usage is similar, only now the friend group is essentially everyone with an internet connection. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Her friend Javi (Anthony Ramos, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/hamilton-cut-songs-disney-plus" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Hamilton</em></a>) drags her back to test a groundbreaking new storm-tracking system. They cross paths &mdash; and inevitably butt heads &mdash;&nbsp;with reckless YouTube star Tyler Owens (Powell), who's known as the "Tornado Wrangler." However, a difference in principles is the least of their concerns once the powerful twisters touch down. Chaos &mdash;&nbsp;and even a little romance &mdash;&nbsp;ensues.</p><p>Get a taste of the tornado flick in the <a href="https://mashable.com/video/twisters-trailer" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">official trailer</a> below:</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

<h2>Is <em>Twisters</em> worth watching?</h2><p>Like any film, whether Twisters is worth watching is completely subjective. The disaster flick has earned a 75 percent critic rating and 91 percent audience rating via Rotten Tomatoes, yet Mashable's own film critic <a href="https://mashable.com/article/twisters-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">called it</a> "big and flashy, but not fun or frightening." Meanwhile, Mashable entertainment reporter Belen Edwards thought it was a fun film, but was ultimately <a href="https://mashable.com/video/mashable-rants-twisters-glen-powell" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">disappointed at the ending</a>.</p><p><em>Twisters</em> also smashed expectations at the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/twisters-opening-weekend" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">box office</a>, earning $80.5 million its opening weekend. That's the same amount Oscar-winner <em>Oppenheimer</em> brought in during its opening weekend in 2023 and comes in as the third-biggest opening weekend for a film this year (behind <em>Inside Out 2</em> at $154 million and <em>Dune: Part Two</em> at $82 million). It was only projected to generate up to $55 million on opening weekend, so Twisters has been a surprise success this season.</p><p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/twisters-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Read our full review of Twisters</em></a>.</p><h2>How to watch <em>Twisters</em> at home</h2><p>Less than a month after its theatrical debut, <em>Twisters</em> is already available to watch at home.

<p>If you can commit to Peacock long-term and pay for a year up front, it'll save you about 17%. A yearly subscription goes for $79.99 per year with ads or $139.99 per year without, which is essentially 12 months of streaming for the price of 10. Comparatively, a monthly subscription will run you $7.99 per month ($95.99 per year) or $13.99 per month ($167.88 per year).</p><h3>Best Peacock deal for Xfinity customers</h3><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>Just like students, first responders can score Peacock Premium for just $1.99 per month so long as they can verify their first responder status via SheerID. Just sign up using the unique promo code you receive and the price will drop down to $1.99 per month. Although the student discount is limited to a year, first responders who continue to meet verification qualifications can renew the deal annually. You'll just have to go through the process each time to receive a new promo code and secure the discount each year.

It comes with GPS tracking, texting and calling with approved contacts, and zero social media or third-party apps.&nbsp;</p><p>Since this watch is a Fitbit, it's also a step tracker, albeit one with a novel premise unlike any previous Fitbit model. The Ace LTE, designed specifically with children ages 7 and older in mind, gamifies movement. As a child increases their physical activity, they get more access to Fitbit games and special in-watch rewards.</p><p>At a time when kids aren't moving enough &mdash; often because they're glued to a device &mdash; and their parents are panicking about when to introduce a phone and how to shield them from the worst of the internet, the Ace LTE seems like an ideal solution. But as with many things tech, there may be significant drawbacks for some children, say experts in youth screen time and well-being.&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Jenny Radesky, a developmental pediatrician at the University of Michigan Medical School who authored the screen time guidelines for the American Academy of Pediatrics, says the Ace LTE could benefit some children. But she has a fundamental concern: "You're giving them a gaming console to strap onto their arm."</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>There are other considerations for Radesky and experts like her. While the smartwatch is walled-off from the internet and its attendant dangers, it still puts tech-driven distractions at a child's fingertips. It will boost activity for some sedentary children, but other youth may unhealthily fixate on reaching their exercise goal, particularly since that's the key to enjoying the watch's entertaining features. In general, it may give children the wrong incentive to exercise. Competitors like the Gabb and Gizmo watches have similar connectivity features, but do not gamify movement.</p><p>In a briefing with reporters in May, Google, which owns the Fitbit brand, said it hopes the watch gives parents peace of mind while offering kids an entertaining experience they feel compelled to return to again and again.&nbsp;</p><p>In response to questions for this story, Google told Mashable that the watch's gamification is meant to reward kids for consistency and effort while prioritizing goal-setting and fun, instead of tracking stats and metrics. </p><p>The Ace LTE perfectly illustrates the tensions of parenting in a digital age, and raises a question with no easy answers: How can parents make the least harmful trade-offs when it comes to tech device use?&nbsp;</p><h2>Fitbit Ace LTE pros and cons</h2><p>Ilan Eframian recently gave his 7-year-old daughter an Ace LTE and hasn't regretted it. He likes that the GPS tracking and texting and phone capabilities let him stay connected to her as she attends a day camp an hour away from their home in Jersey City.&nbsp;</p><p>Eframian watches the location of the bus intermittently when she's in transit. Occasionally, she messages him to say hello. (Eframian is a former Google Fiber executive. Mashable contacted him through an anonymous message board where he commented on the Ace LTE.)&nbsp;</p><p>"Being able to see where she is, I love," Eframian says of the GPS feature.&nbsp;</p><p>His daughter's location is visible only to Eframian and his wife; her device doesn't show up in public spaces like devices that rely on Bluetooth do. Google says it deletes GPS data within 24 hours.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Eframian appreciates that the watch isn't assigned a phone number that could receive random spam messages from strangers. The connectivity happens through the Fitbit Ace app, via the LTE network, which requires a monthly or annual subscription that costs $9.99 or $119, respectively. Only parent-approved contacts can message and call a child wearing the watch. Eventually, the watch will have Google Pay enabled on it.&nbsp;</p><p>Eframian uses the parent controls to decide when his daughter accesses the games.&nbsp;</p><p>One of her favorite games, <em>Pollo 13</em>, stars a space chicken careening through an obstacle course. The watch's sensors let the wearer control the spacecraft "tub" by moving their body from side to side as they try to guide the chicken toward the prizes on the track.</p><p>Eframian's daughter is permitted to play on the bus, but a "school time" setting restricts the games while she's at camp. So far, he's not noticed any problematic use of the watch.&nbsp;</p><p>It's not obvious or intuitive, but parents can also completely block individual games through Google's Family Link app. (Parents who are interested in deactivating games completely have discussed it on a <a href="https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Fitbit-Ace-LTE/Disable-Games-Entirely/td-p/5610317" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Fitbit community forum</u></a>.)&nbsp;</p><p>Both the child and parent must have a Google account to use the Ace LTE, which may require bringing young users into the company's sprawling ecosystem before their caregivers had planned to do so.&nbsp;</p><p>Parents cannot, however, block Bit Valley, a separate setting in the watch, which is where a Tamagotchi-like character called an eejie resides. Designed intentionally by Google to keep kids engaged with the watch, the eejie is introduced to the wearer during device setup. It can be outfitted with new clothes, belongings, and home decor based on how many rewards the wearer earns by meeting their goal or playing games.&nbsp;</p><p>But an eejie can <a href="https://support.google.com/fitbitacelte/answer/14965337?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=14965037&amp;sjid=390375685716106708-NC" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>look forlorn when neglected</u></a> by their owner. Keeping them happy means visiting them, changing their outfit or room, and completing daily activity quests. Users reap the rewards of a content eejie by earning more tickets that can be redeemed for even more eejie-related items. Notifications remind wearers to visit their eejie, if they haven't done so already, though Google said Bit Valley has a built-in daily time limit.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>This is one aspect of the watch that gives Radesky pause. She wonders on behalf of parents, "How much does this create a new gaming habit or interest for their child that they didn't necessarily plan for?"&nbsp;</p><p>Amanda Lenhart, head of research at Common Sense Media, found the watch's engagement features troubling.</p><p>"The fact that you're devising things to keep a child looking at, touching, and playing with your device&hellip;it's a great business model, and is also not super great for that child's ability to detach from that device," she says.&nbsp;</p><p>Google did assemble a panel of experts to help develop the watch, including Sandra Calvert, director of Georgetown University's Children's Digital Media Center, and Lauren Sherar, dean of the School of Sport, Exercise, and Health Sciences in the United Kingdom. The company was unable to make any of the panel's members available for an interview.  </p><p>Regardless of differing expert opinions, when it comes to any tech device or platform with captivating features, parents often make the bet that their child won't struggle with boundary-setting like another child might.&nbsp;</p><p>Eframian, for example, says his daughter hasn't resisted the limitations he's put on her Ace LTE. He's noticed a "behavior change" as she tries harder to reach her daily movement goal, which to Eframian indicates that the watch is working as intended.&nbsp;</p><p>Though Eframian's experience sounds straightforward, another parent with the same expectations may surprisingly find themselves in a daily battle over how their child uses the Ace LTE. And children who have conditions that affect their executive functioning, like attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder and autism, may be particularly prone to the distractions that the watch can present, Radesky says.&nbsp;</p><p>Google told Mashable that the company is aware that some kids struggle with regulation, which is why the watch has built-in screen time limits and doesn't reward high-score chasing or overexercise.</p><h2>"Taken to an extreme"</h2><p>Still, the variability between how children react to digital devices and features makes it hard to know how one particular kid will fare. </p><p>Just as some children may develop focus and attention challenges related to their smartwatch use, the risks can be similarly fraught for children who are vulnerable to negative thinking about their bodies.&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Jason Nagata, an adolescent medicine specialist at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital in San Francisco, says children who use technology to boost their physical activity may likely have a positive or neutral experience doing so. But there are others who are vulnerable in ways their parents might not anticipate.&nbsp;</p><p>"I do unfortunately see some teenagers who, they or their parents had very good intentions of trying to be more healthy, or maybe trying to make some lifestyle changes, but then it's taken to an extreme, and they can develop a full-blown eating disorder or muscle dysmorphia," Nagata says, noting some of these cases involved apps or devices that delivered reminders and notifications related to physical activity.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The Ace LTE only counts and displays steps, not calories or other metrics that could become focal points for young users. The watch tracks a range of movement, but the baseline move goal is 45 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous activity. That goal can be increased to 60 or 75 minutes. Some children might breeze through these goals while others, particularly those who only get vigorous exercise during recess, might not.</p><p>Google told Mashable that the watch's interval-based programming is designed to encourage three to four sessions of gameplay per day, with each session clocking in at about five minutes or less. </p><p>Nagata urges parents to regularly check in with their children about their goals, which they can also monitor in the Fitbit Ace app. A parent might grow concerned if meeting the goal consumes their child's energy or conversation, or displaces other activities they once enjoyed. In that situation, the parent should consider reducing the goal, blocking the games, or having their child cease using the watch.&nbsp;</p><p>Clues that a child may be vulnerable to excessive exercise include sensitivity about their appearance, diet, or physical activity. Nagata cautions parents of children who already have an eating disorder or muscle dysmorphia against using the Ace LTE.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Radesky says that some children for whom formal exercise doesn't feel good because of physiological issues like motor-coordination deficits, sensory sensitivity, low muscle tone, and pain may benefit from the Ace LTE's motivating features. But she says that typically pediatricians try to channel kids' drive to move into things that are inherently satisfying.&nbsp;</p><p>A child with sensory sensitivities, for example, might enjoy swimming because the water feels good on their skin. Radesky worries that a device that offers external reinforcement &mdash; in this case, gameplay &mdash; for physical activity that has nothing to do with the inherent joy of movement may deprive kids of the opportunity to choose for themselves what feels good.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, she expects that for some kids, the Ace LTE will be a fun and effective way to motivate health behavior. Others, though, might struggle to manage their use or simply get bored of it.&nbsp;</p><p>For many parents, knowing how their child will react is a question they're desperate to answer before they spend hundreds of dollars.&nbsp;</p><p>In Radesky's opinion, tech companies could simplify the equation for parents by making products that don't hinge on a child's reliably frequent use of the device.</p><p>"How can disengagement be a goal?" Radesky asks. "Because if you had technology that let you go when you wanted to go, that would be so respectful of a child's well-being."&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

It's also a road trip movie that follows four journalists &mdash; photographers Lee and Jessie (Kirsten Dunst and Cailee Spaeny), and reporters Joel and Sammy (Wagner Moura and Stephen McKinley Henderson)&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;making the audacious journey from New York City to the White House in hopes of interviewing the president (Nick Offerman) before the fall of the Capitol. Typically only a few hours on I-95, devastation on the roads means they're forced to navigate through small towns and dangerous pockets of America. </p><p>"Each stop functions as a vignette in which Garland exposes a corner of American wrath, wrong-headed self-righteousness, or apathy. And like with <em>Children of Men, </em>where the quest is born from ideology &mdash;&nbsp;in this case, Lee's dedication to journalism &mdash;&nbsp;it becomes achingly personal. Seeing a bit of herself in Jessie, Lee takes risks to protect the young woman, even as she laments that their work demands putting themselves in harm's way," Mashable Film Editor Kristy Puchko writes in her review of the film.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

<p>Max subscriptions start at $9.99 per month if you don't mind watching with ads. You can simply sign up for a single month (once <em>Civil War</em> is released), then cancel before you're charged for another. Or, if you're in it for the long haul, we recommend the yearly subscription instead. An annual plan with ads goes for $99.99 per year, which breaks down to just $8.33 per month. That's 17% (or $1.66) per month in savings. With a year-long subscription, you can watch many other A24 films beyond <em>Civil War</em>.</p><h3>Best Max deal with no ads: <a href="https://zdcs.link/71pjV?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Save%2022%25%20on%20a%20Max%20Ad-Free%20annual%20subscription&object_type=article&object_uuid=06Yp6xx4Or1vvBmXfUEGJDE&short_url=71pjV&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Save 22% on a Max Ad-Free annual subscription</a></h3><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>Rather not have ads interrupting your movie-watching experience? You have the Max Ad-Free and Max Ultimate tiers to choose from. The Ad-Free tier is $15.99 per month, while the Ultimate tier is $19.99 per month. If you opt for a yearly plan instead, though, it will only cost you $149.99 per year (which breaks down to $12.49 per month) or $199.99 per year (which breaks down to $16.67 per month). That's a total savings of 22% on the Ad-Free yearly plan or 17% on the Ultimate plan.</p><p>Note: While both tiers offer an ad-free viewing experience, the Ultimate tier takes things a step further with 4K Ultra HD video quality and Dolby Atmos immersive audio.</p><h3>Best way to get Max for free: <a href="https://zdcs.link/8B1Zd?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Sign%20up%20for%20a%20DashPass%20annual%20plan&object_type=article&object_uuid=06Yp6xx4Or1vvBmXfUEGJDE&short_url=8B1Zd&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Sign up for a DashPass annual plan</a></h3><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>If you've never considered Cricket as your wireless provider, this deal might make you change your mind. Cricket Wireless customers on the $60 per month unlimited plan get Max with ads for free as long as their account remains in good standing. That's a $99.99 per year value. Just head over to the Max app or navigate to Max.com on a browser, choose Cricket as your provider, and use your Cricket credentials to log in. Then you'll be able to watch <em>Civil War</em> and other A24 films for no extra cost.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/039u5RK5bZIAqR36ilzGHBp/hero-image.jpg" alt="A phone displaying the New York Times game 'Connections.'"><p><em>Connections</em> is the latest <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/connections" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>New York Times </em>word game</a> that's captured the public's attention. The game is all about finding the "common threads between words." And just like <em>Wordle</em>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-20-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Connections</em></a> resets after midnight and each new set of words gets trickier and trickier&mdash;so we've served up some hints and tips to get you over the hurdle.</p><p>If you just want to be told today's puzzle, you can jump to the end of this article for August 15's <em>Connections</em> solution. But if you'd rather solve it yourself, keep reading for some clues, tips, and strategies to assist you.</p><h2>What is Connections?</h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <a class="text-gray-600" href="https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1679674590203723778?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(opens in a new window)">

    </a>
</blockquote>
<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

    </a>
</blockquote>
<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. Like <em>Wordle, </em>you can share the results with your friends on social media.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

The game is all about finding the "common threads between words." And just like <em>Wordle</em>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-20-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> resets after midnight and each new set of words gets trickier and trickier&mdash;so we've served up some hints and tips to get you over the hurdle.</p><p>If you just want to be told today's puzzle, you can jump to the end of this article for July 1's <em>Connections</em> solution. But if you'd rather solve it yourself, keep reading for some clues, tips, and strategies to assist you.</p><h2><strong>What is <em>Connections</em>?</strong></h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <a class="text-gray-600" href="https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1679674590203723778?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(opens in a new window)">

</blockquote>
<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. Like <em>Wordle, </em>you can share the results with your friends on social media.</p><h2><strong>Here's a hint for today's <em>Connections</em> categories</strong></h2><p>Want a hit about the categories without being told the categories?

<h2>Who is Alyn?</h2><p>Alyn is first introduced to us in <em>House of the Dragon</em> Season 2, episode 1, when the Sea Snake himself heads down to the docks to meet him.</p><p>"They tell me that you're the one that dragged my body out of the sea," Corlys says, which Alyn confirms. Both seem a little awkward about the whole interaction, but Corlys makes it clear that he's in Alyn's debt before leaving.</p><p>We also learn that Alyn has a brother, Addam (Clinton Liberty), who is a shipwright.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2>Why might Alyn be important?</h2><p>Clearly Alyn is getting screen time for a reason, but that reason doesn't start to emerge until Season 2, episode 4. This time it's Rhaenys (Eve Best) who also pays a visit to the docks, pulling Alyn aside and telling him she's heard he saved her husband's life.</p><p>"But I was not told his saviour was so comely," she adds. "Your mother must have been very beautiful."</p><p>Again, Alyn seems awkward about the whole thing. Rhaenys appears to be a mixture of stern and sad. When their meeting is interrupted by Corlys, we start to get an idea why that might be.</p><p>"I just had a word with your captains. He was the sailor who plucked you from your watery grave," Rhaenys says to Corlys after Alyn has left them.</p><p>"I know who he is, Corlys. Alyn's past is no fault of his. He saved his lord's life, he should be raised up and honoured, not hidden beneath the tides."</p><p>There's obviously more to Alyn than first meets the eye. Given Rhaenys' pointed comment about the beauty of his mother, as well as what she says to Corlys about knowing who Alyn is, our best bet is that he's Lord Corlys' son &mdash; and that his mother is someone the Lord had an affair with during his time at sea.</p><p>As for what will happen to Alyn next? Maybe he'll be given a key role in the upcoming war, helping led Corlys' fleet into battle.</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/el4jA?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3B%3B%3Btemplate=article&amp%3B%3B%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3B%3B%3Belement=offer&amp%3B%3B%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3B%3B%3Belement_label=New%20episodes%20of%20House%20of%20the%20Dragon%20air%20Sundays%20at%209%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20HBO%20and%20Max.&amp%3B%3B%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3B%3B%3Bobject_uuid=00imlCa1Zf2bZssHTCnPdle&amp%3B%3B%3Bshort_url=el4jA&amp%3B%3B%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Fhouse-of-the-dragon-season-2-book-vs-show&amp%3B%3Btemplate=article&amp%3B%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3B%3Belement=offer&amp%3B%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3B%3Belement_label=New%20episodes%20of%20House%20of%20the%20Dragon%20air%20Sundays%20at%209%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20HBO%20and%20Max.&amp%3B%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3B%3Bobject_uuid=07czANterCeuME4yvDBXHxd&amp%3B%3Bshort_url=el4jA&amp%3B%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Fhouse-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-3-daemon-harrenhal-vision-explainer&amp%3Btemplate=article&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=New%20episodes%20of%20House%20of%20the%20Dragon%20air%20Sundays%20at%209%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20HBO%20and%20Max.&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=05IV8UQmePvc2fyG0aFu6iF&amp%3Bshort_url=el4jA&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Fhouse-of-the-dragon-daemon-invades-harrenhal&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=New%20episodes%20of%20House%20of%20the%20Dragon%20air%20Sundays%20at%209%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20HBO%20and%20Max.&object_type=article&object_uuid=01SxU8Z7AoItRvnPxNKOtwv&short_url=el4jA&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">New episodes of <em>House of the Dragon </em>air Sundays at 9 p.m. ET on HBO and Max.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"A Dance of Dragons" opens with Daemon's vision of the Great Hall at the Red Keep. Once again, he comes face to face with young Rhaenyra, who now sits on the Iron Throne. But something's shifted. In Daemon's vision of young Rhaenyra in episode 3, she was wearing the same gold dress as in the first half of Season 1. However, this manifestation of young Rhaenyra is dressed just like adult Rhaenyra; she's wearing a long black and red gown and the crown of Jaehaerys the Conciliator.</p><p>As <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-3-daemon-harrenhal-vision-explainer" target="_self">episode 3 director Geeta Vasant Patel said</a>, Daemon views young Rhaenyra as someone who truly knew him, who loved him and worshipped him when his own brother Viserys (Paddy Considine) scorned him. Meanwhile, present-day Rhaenyra cast him aside following the reveal that he was complicit in <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-helaena-rat-prophecy-blood-and-cheese" target="_self">young Jaehaerys' murder</a>. Seeing adolescent Rhaenyra take on the clothing and attitude of adult Rhaenyra destabilizes Daemon right off the bat.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Making matters worse is what this vision of Rhaenyra actually says to Daemon. As in their episode 2 argument, she needles at one of his greatest insecurities, that Viserys never loved him as much as he loved Rhaenyra. And even though Daemon "created" Queen Rhaenyra &mdash; literally crowning her in the Season 1 finale &mdash; is he really supportive of her? Or is he hellbent on destroying her and taking power for himself? Rhaenyra delivers these words in <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-learning-high-valyrian-duolingo" target="_self">High Valyrian</a>, a language that she and Daemon often spoke alone together early in Season 1 and that holds quite a bit of intimacy for the two of them. </p><p>The combination of that intimate language being used to harm him and the blending of young and adult Rhaenyra proves too much for Daemon. In this vision, he beheads young Rhaenyra without hesitation, an act that recalls the beheading of Jaehaerys at his behest, and his beheading of Vaemond Velaryon (Wil Johnson) in Season 1. But even then, the horrors aren't over: Rhaenyra's disembodied head asks Daemon whether this is what he's always wanted. Is he really that monstrous?</p><h2><strong>What do Daemon's visions of Aemond Targaryen and Laena Velaryon mean?</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Daemon continues to reckon with his worst fears as "A Dance of Dragons" continues. His next vision is one of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-prince-aemond-villain" target="_self">Aemond Targaryen</a> (Ewan Mitchell). Well, kind of. Daemon sees someone who looks a lot like Aemond Targaryen walking through Harrenhal. From behind, he can see that this figure has long, Targaryen-blonde hair, as well as an eyepatch. However, when the figure turns around, we see that it's actually Daemon, made to look like Aemond.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

            'House of the Dragon' Season 2, episode 3 had the funniest scene so far

<p>There are several layers here. First, Daemon and Aemond act as mirrors to each other. Both are younger brothers of kings, and both are viewed as more dangerous than their siblings. But as the Dance of the Dragons gets underway, the two gain a horrible new commonality. In the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-1-ending-explained" target="_self">Season 1 finale</a>, Aemond's actions led to the death of Lucerys (Elliot Grihault), a child. Daemon's retaliation, while originally targeting Aemond, also leads to the death of a child: Jaehaerys. So when Daemon sees Aemond in Harrenhal, he's not just seeing someone with a similar life path to him. He's seeing himself as a fellow child-murderer and a fellow kinslayer. Plus, fans of George R.R. Martin's <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-book-vs-show" target="_self"><em>Fire &amp; Blood</em></a><em> </em>will also know that Daemon and Aemond's fates are both intertwined with the castle of Harrenhal, so the Daemon-Aemond connection here is especially prescient.</p><p>After all that, Harrenhal <em>still </em>isn't done with Daemon. During a meeting with House Blackwood, a vision warps a serving woman into Daemon's <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-laena-velaryon-death-explainer" target="_self">late wife, Laena Velaryon</a> (Nanna Blondell). Once again, this ghostly apparition is a reminder of what Daemon has lost, as well as his possible monstrosity. While Laena died by suicide, commanding Vhagar to burn her during a painful, likely fatal labor, there was a chance that Daemon would have forced a C-section upon her to save his child, just as Viserys did to <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-aemma-arryn" target="_self">Aemma Arryn (Sian Brooke)</a> in <em>House of the Dragon</em>'s premiere.</p><h2><strong>Why is Daemon getting these visions in the first place, and what does Alys Rivers have to do with it?</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Daemon's nightmarish sleepwalks lead him to Alys Rivers, a bastard woman who's overtaken the duties of Harrenhal's Maester. You may remember her as the woman who tells Daemon, "You will die in this place," on his first night in Harrenhal. What a warm welcome!</p><p>In <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>, various accounts describe Alys as "a serving wench who dabbled in potions and spells," "a woods witch," and "a malign enchantress who bathed in the blood of virgins to preserve her youth." Needless to say, she's a powerful woman in her own right &mdash; although <em>House of the Dragon </em>is so far keeping whatever mysterious abilities she may have somewhat secret.</p><p>Alys offers Daemon a history lesson that hints at why he keeps getting strange visions. Harrenhal is cursed, she says. When Harren the Black built it, he cut down the sacred weirwood trees that used to grow where Harrenhal now stands. "Heart trees imbued with the spirits of those who lived long before he came," Alys explains. "It's said their whispers can still be heard sometimes."</p><p>Daemon is quick to dismiss Alys' account as a midwives' tale. But given that his bed was made from a weirwood tree, and that his first vision of young Rhaenyra led him to the one weirwood tree that still stands in Harrenhal's courtyard, it's clear that her words hold more truth than he might think.</p><p>Is the curse of Harrenhal all that's affecting Daemon, though? Or is some of Alys' witchcraft at work as well? She gives him a draught that she claims will help him sleep, yet he appears disoriented &mdash; and still sees Laena! &mdash; while drinking it. Alys also pokes at Daemon's insecurities about Viserys passing him up as heir, something his vision of Rhaenyra brought up at the start of the episode. Can she see Daemon's visions too? Or is she directly responsible for them? Either way, something supernatural is definitely afoot.</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/el4jA?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3B%3Btemplate=article&amp%3B%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3B%3Belement=offer&amp%3B%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3B%3Belement_label=New%20episodes%20of%20House%20of%20the%20Dragon%20air%20Sundays%20at%209%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20HBO%20and%20Max.&amp%3B%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3B%3Bobject_uuid=00imlCa1Zf2bZssHTCnPdle&amp%3B%3Bshort_url=el4jA&amp%3B%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Fhouse-of-the-dragon-season-2-book-vs-show&amp%3Btemplate=article&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=New%20episodes%20of%20House%20of%20the%20Dragon%20air%20Sundays%20at%209%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20HBO%20and%20Max.&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=07czANterCeuME4yvDBXHxd&amp%3Bshort_url=el4jA&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Fhouse-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-3-daemon-harrenhal-vision-explainer&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=New%20episodes%20of%20House%20of%20the%20Dragon%20air%20Sundays%20at%209%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20HBO%20and%20Max.&object_type=article&object_uuid=01PWm2W3xvezQcSOsZEzAI7&short_url=el4jA&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">New episodes of <em>House of the Dragon </em>air Sundays at 9 p.m. ET on HBO and Max.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>An example of that fleshing out is the relationship between Rhaenyra Targaryen (Emma D'Arcy) and Alicent Hightower (Olivia Cooke), whose fraught dynamic in the show benefits from the extra layers of seeing them grow up together before becoming bitter enemies. That strong adaptation choice is one of many that carries into Season 2, but there are plenty new deviations from <em>Fire &amp; Blood </em>on the way.

Rhaenyra's eldest son Jacaerys (Harry Collett) flew up there in the Season 1 finale to treat with Lord Cregan Stark of Winterfell (Tom Taylor), and by the time we catch up with them at the beginning of Season 2, it seems like they've become good pals. They're taking a field trip up the Wall, bantering about the time Torrhen Stark bent the knee to Aegon the Conqueror, and discussing how the North can aid Rhaenyra in her war efforts.</p><div id="related-video" class="mx-auto mt-8 mb-12 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans md:mt-12 md:mb-16 text-primary-400">

<p><em>House of the Dragon </em>skips over quite a bit of material to get to Jace and Cregan's allyship. In classic <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em> fashion, there are several conflicting accounts of Jace's time in Winterfell in Martin's work. Of his many historical "sources," Grand Maester Munkun writes in his <em>True Telling</em> that the two became inseparable and swore a blood oath of brotherhood, while Septon Eustace claims that Jace badgered Cregan about converting to the Faith of the Seven. The most scandalous of all the accounts belongs, naturally, to court jester Mushroom, who says Jace fell in love with and married a bastard named Sara Snow, even though he was betrothed to his cousin Rhaena (Phoebe Campbell). </p><p>With only eight episodes in this season, <em>House of the Dragon </em>likely didn't have the time to get into all this potential Northern drama. We've got the Dance of the Dragons to kick off, people! Still, you can bet we haven't seen the last of Cregan Stark.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>In a move I didn't see coming (and that certainly isn't in <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>), Dowager Queen Alicent and Lord Commander of the Kingsguard Criston Cole (Fabien Frankel) are getting it on. Based on Alicent's assertion that they shouldn't hook up again (as if that's going to work), we can assume this affair has been going on for <em>a while</em>. So, when did this tryst begin? When did Cole come back around on the whole "breaking his Kingsguard oath of chastity" thing? When did Alicent decide, "Eh, screw it," and start doing exactly what she hated Rhaenyra for doing?</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Alicent and Criston's hypocrisy here doesn't bother me, as it's totally in keeping with their overly righteous characters. And it just makes sense that something would happen between these two. They're basically joined at the hip, and their joint animosity towards Rhaenyra adds a sweet psychosexual twist. Plus, as Alicent reckons with the increasingly unpredictable men in her circle, like her sons Aegon II (Tom Glynn-Carney) and Aemond (Ewan Mitchell), it also makes sense that she'd try to reclaim her power elsewhere. </p><p>What <em>does </em>bother me about this change is that Criston is having sex at all.

<p>In what is undoubtedly one of the darkest scenes ever featured in <em>House of the Dragon </em>and <em>Game of Thrones</em>, two assassins &mdash; known simply as Blood (Sam C.

<p>In the book, Blood and Cheese force Helaena to choose which of her sons she wants them to kill. When volunteering herself doesn't work, she chooses her youngest, Maelor, as Jaehaerys is heir to the Iron Throne. In a nasty twist, Blood and Cheese kill Jaehaerys instead &mdash; and tell Maelor that his mother wants him dead.</p><p>Things play out a little differently in <em>House of the Dragon</em>, although the final outcome is the same: Jaehaerys dies, and Helaena is traumatized for life. First off, Blood and Cheese's original target in the show is Aemond. That change already complicates the blame of Jaehaerys's death. It lets Daemon off the hook <em>a little </em>for bankrolling child murder, just as Vhagar's unauthorized chomping in the Season 1 finale means Aemond <em>technically </em>didn't murder Lucerys. But technicalities don't matter when children are dead.</p><p>Instead of finding Aemond, Blood and Cheese stumble upon Helaena and the twins Jaehaerys and Jaehaera. (Maelor is cut from the show entirely.) They make a snap judgment that one Targaryen son is as good as another and make Helaena tell them which of her children is Jaehaerys. She points him out, but there's a brief moment in which Blood thinks she's trying to double-cross them. After all, why would she give up the heir to the throne so easily? Surely she's actually pointing to Jaehaera. Cheese calls her bluff though and correctly surmises that she's actually singled out her son. With that, Jaehaerys becomes another victim in the Dance of the Dragons.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>This version of the Blood and Cheese scene nods a bit to the book version, with Helaena still having to make an impossible choice and there being trickery involved. However, there's an extra layer of tragedy here. Based on a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-helaena-rat-prophecy-blood-and-cheese" target="_self">rat-centric statement towards the beginning of the episode</a>, Helaena likely foresaw the arrival of Blood and Cheese in a prophetic dream. That means she's had quite a bit of time to think about this moment, and maybe even prepare for it. Her attempt to throw Blood and Cheese off of Jaehaerys's scent was her last-ditch effort to stop the inevitable. In failing, her action turns a horrifying scene into something even sadder.</p><h2><strong>Episode 2: The aftermath of Jaehaerys's death.</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Understandably, much of <em>House of the Dragon </em>Season 2's second episode deals with the fallout from Jaehaerys's murder at the hands of Blood and Cheese. Some elements from <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em> remain the same, such as Aegon's decision to murder all the ratcatchers. Other details are omitted. For example, the show's version of Alicent doesn't try to learn Blood's true name in order to "bathe in the blood of his wife and children." (Probably for the best.) Instead, her reaction is one of grief for Jaehaerys and especially Helaena.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Elsewhere, Hand of the King Otto Hightower (Rhys Ifans) views Jaehaerys's death as an opportunity to spread some good old-fashioned propaganda. He throws a funeral procession for Jaehaerys, with Helaena and Alicent riding with the young prince's corpse. Accompanying them is a crier telling onlookers to "behold the work of Rhaenyra the Cruel," weaponizing Jaehaerys's death against Rhaenyra. The scene is a show-only invention, yet one that's entirely in keeping with Otto's scheming persona. Plus, even though Alicent decries the procession as ghoulish, it seems like Otto's scheme actually works and wins sympathy points from the smallfolk. (At least, until Aegon hangs every ratcatcher in the vicinity.)</p><h2><strong>Episode 2: Rhaenyra and Daemon duke it out.</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>When Rhaenyra learns of Daemon's involvement in Jaehaerys's death, <em>House of the Dragon </em>treats us to a massive argument between the married couple (and uncle-niece pair). Rhaenyra worries that she can't trust Daemon, while Daemon claims Rhaenyra is as weak as her father. It's a brutal but deeply necessary fight, dredging up both characters' insecurities about their relationship, proximity to power, and different approaches to the brewing conflict with Aegon. And <em>none </em>of it is in <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>By this point in <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>, Daemon has already taken control of Harrenhal. He orchestrates the Blood and Cheese plot from afar, and we don't get enough of Rhaenyra's reaction to the murder to suggest that the two fall out over Daemon's actions. Instead, <em>House of the Dragon </em>fills in one of the emotional gaps of Martin's fictional history. The resulting scene gets at the heart of Rhaenyra and Daemon's fraught relationship, and puts the two in very different headspaces as we move into the next section of the season.</p><h2><strong>Episode 2: Arryk versus Erryk.</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Like much of <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-2-twins-erryk-arryk" target="_self">the duel between the Cargyll twins Arryk and Erryk</a> (Luke and Elliott Tittensor) is the subject of differing historical accounts. Munkun says their battle was epic, lasting for almost an hour and ending with the brothers dying in each other's arms. Mushroom, on the other hand, claims the fight was short-lived. Erryk (who fights for Rhaenyra) dealt Arryk (who fights for Aegon) a mortal blow fairly early on. He sustained a gut wound in the process, and succumbed to it after four painful days. Frankly, the latter seems more plausible, so we've got to give this round to Mushroom.</p><p>Also left ambiguous is the true goal of Arryk's mission to Dragonstone. Was he sent to kill Rhaenyra, or to murder her sons Jacaerys and Joffrey (Oscar Eskinazi)? <em>House of the Dragon </em>decides on the latter. It also moves the battle from "deep in the heart of Dragonstone" to Rhaenyra's chambers, putting her in more danger than in <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>. Here, she witnesses firsthand the kinslaying that will continue to take place should she and Aegon go to war outright. Will this prompt her to take swifter action, or will she stay her cautious course?</p><p>Perhaps the most interesting development in the Cargyll fight is the involvement of Mysaria (Sonoya Mizuno), who alerts Dragonstone to Arryk's presence. By this point in <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>, Mysaria and Rhaenyra haven't interacted much, although Mysaria does become Rhaenyra's unofficial mistress of whispers later on. However, Rhaenyra now owes Mysaria her life. Could this signal a greater (and earlier) partnership between the two, especially now that Daemon is gone?</p><h2><strong>Episode 3: The Battle of the Burning Mill and the Taking of Stone Hedge.</strong></h2><p>The first major battle of the Dance of the Dragons comes at the start of Season 2's third episode, when the long-feuding Blackwoods and Brackens take up arms against each other. The result is a slaughter, and while <em>House of the Dragon </em>doesn't show us the actual bloodshed, the field of corpses stretching as far as the eye can see is more than enough to get the job done. In <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>, the clash between the Blackwoods and Brackens becomes known as the Battle of the Burning Mill. The episode's opening shot of a turning mill (later seen burned to a crisp) is a solid nod to that. </p><p>However, <em>House of the Dragon </em>cuts the follow-up to the Battle of the Burning Mill entirely. Martin's work sees what's left of the Bracken forces return to their seat at Stone Hedge, only to discover that Daemon, Caraxes, and several armies have taken it over in their absence. Getting rid of the Taking of Stone Hedge in the show isn't the greatest loss: Daemon has only just arrived in Harrenhal, meaning he hasn't had much time to assemble a host for Rhaenyra. Plus, the show appears to be saving up the first major dragon attack for a larger turning point, as Rhaenyra and Rhaenys (Eve Best) would rather opt for caution than unleashing a bloody war between dragons.</p><h2><strong>Episode 3: Daemon gets spooky visions at Harrenhal.</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Following the attempt on her life in episode 2, Rhaenyra makes the painful decision to send her youngest children away to the Vale (and hopefully later to Pentos). Rhaena (Phoebe Campbell) will accompany them, their hatchling dragons, and four unhatched dragon eggs. In <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>, it's Jacaerys who makes this call, as Rhaenyra is still grieving Lucerys. <em>House of the Dragon </em>brings Rhaenyra back into action much sooner, giving her the space to rule and make these decisions herself.</p><p>The most interesting change here involves the dragon eggs, three of which will look <em>very </em>familiar to <em>Game of Thrones </em>fans. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-3-daenerys-dragon-eggs" target="_self">Episode director Geeta Vasant Patel confirmed to Mashable</a> that the red, gold, and green eggs are the ones that will eventually find their way to Daenerys Targaryen. This confirmation marks a minor deviation from <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>, which heavily implies that Daenerys's eggs were stolen by a character named Elissa Farman during the reign of Jaehaerys I. Overall, though, the origin of Daenerys's eggs is left somewhat ambiguous, so their inclusion here is more of a fun (and literal) Easter egg. Plus, there's a sweetness to the fact that these eggs are the Targaryens' "hope for the future." From an audience standpoint, we know that they do find their way to the last Targaryen, centuries down the line.</p><h2><strong>Episode 3: Rhaenyra and Alicent reunite. </strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>In the biggest book-to-show change this season so far, Rhaenyra travels to King's Landing to speak directly to Alicent. The two don't interact until much later in the Dance in <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>, but given how much <em>House of the Dragon </em>has centered their relationship, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-3-rhaenyra-and-alicent-meeting" target="_self">their meeting here is necessary</a> &mdash; and electric.</p><p>On one level, this is Rhaenyra's last-ditch attempt to stop war from escalating. But on a deeper level, it's two friends trying to get through to one another, with Rhaenyra in particular trying to understand whether her father really changed his mind about having her as his successor. Alicent details how Viserys named Aegon as the Prince That Was Promised in his dying breath. Alarm bells immediately sound in Rhaenyra's head: This has all been a big misunderstanding about Aegon's dream of the Song of Ice and Fire! <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-green-black-rhaenyra-alicent" target="_self">Viserys never doubted Rhaenyra.</a></p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Back in Season 1, I found myself frustrated by the first mention of the Song of Ice and Fire, seeing it as cheap fan service for <em>Game of Thrones </em>fans. But with Viserys's last words, and with Rhaenyra's realization in her conversation with Alicent, <em>House of the Dragon </em>truly justifies its use of Aegon's dream. It's not just an attempt to connect to a series that came before. It's the point around which so much of this war revolves. (Also, just a cautionary tale about naming everyone in the family the same thing.)</p><p>Following Rhaenyra's revelation, a new question arises: How will Alicent act going forward, now that she knows she's made a grave error? </p><h2><strong>Episode 4: Alicent's abortion and her possible change of heart.</strong></h2><p>Season 2's fourth episode, "A Dance of Dragons," sees Alicent undertaking two difficult tasks. First, she aborts a pregnancy from her affair with Criston using a specially brewed tea. Then, she scours historical texts looking for any sign of Aegon's dream. Since both her relationship with Criston and her <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-3-rhaenyra-and-alicent-meeting" target="_self">episode 3 discussion with Rhaenyra</a> are show-only additions, Alicent's story in "A Dance of Dragons" is totally new.</p><p>Here, Alicent's research has the potential to set her on a new path from <em>Fire &amp; Blood </em>entirely. Now that she doubts Aegon II's claim and realizes how horribly she messed up, will she work to undermine the ruler she helped put on the Iron Throne? Based on her discussion with Larys Strong (Matthew Needham), that seems unlikely, as she's resigned to the fact that war is coming no matter what. However, since Larys knows about Alicent's doubts as well as her secret abortion, he's got some extra leverage against her should she choose to act against his interests.</p><h2><strong>Episode 4: Aegon and Aemond at Rook's Rest.</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>"A Dance of Dragons" culminates in this season's first dragon battle: a massive set piece fought over the castle of Rook's Rest. The outcome here is the same as in the book &mdash; Rhaenys (Eve Best) and Meleys dead, and Aegon and Sunfyre fallen, all at the hands (or claws) of Vhagar. But as in much of <em>House of the Dragon</em>, the route the show takes to get there is a little different from how it plays out in <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>.</p><p>In the book, Aegon and Aemond attack Rhaenys together. But in the show, Aegon's arrival interferes with Criston and Aemond's original plan. It's a perfect illustration of his recklessness &mdash; and the perfect opportunity for Aemond to try to get rid of him, a development that is new to the show. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p><em>House of the Dragon </em>has been building the hostility between Aemond and Aegon for a while now. In Season 1, we saw Aegon tormenting Aemond as a child for not having a dragon of his own. And in episode 3, Aegon teased Aemond mercilessly when he found him at the brothel. A lot may have changed in the realm between those points, but the bullying has certainly never stopped. Aegon may think his brother is loyal as a hound, but when Aemond opens fire on him and Rhaenys at Rook's Rest, there's no doubt about it: This is retribution. </p><p>We'll be updating this article as <em>House of the Dragon </em>Season 2 continues airing, so check back weekly for more differences between the show and <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>. </p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/el4jA?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=New%20episodes%20of%20House%20of%20the%20Dragon%20air%20Sundays%20at%209%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20HBO%20and%20Max.&object_type=article&object_uuid=00imlCa1Zf2bZssHTCnPdle&short_url=el4jA&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">New episodes of <em>House of the Dragon </em>air Sundays at 9 p.m. ET on HBO and Max.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As for gameplay, your Sims will grow and develop their Romantic Skill as they go on more dates. Sims can have turn ons and offs, and you can measure their satisfaction with their relationships. The pack has new interactions, too: a new kiss, dance, and three new WooHoo spots.</p><p>There will be several different Romance Dynamics between Sims as well: Wholesome (two Sims falling in love); Steamy (focus on physical connection); Strained (still romantically involved but unhappy); and Unpredictable (going back and forth between fighting and making up). You can explore your Sims' different romantic aspirations, and they can even become a Romance Consultant and help others find love.</p><p><em>The Sims </em>introduces two new traits with this pack: being reserved and a "lovebug" (much less reserved). There are also two new fears, fear of intimacy and of being alone. Just like real life!</p><p>In terms of non-monogamy, Sims will have a "Romantic Boundaries" system that's free to all players. You can customize your Sims' <a href="https://mashable.com/article/setting-boundaries-dating-relationship" target="_self">boundaries</a> and approach to romantic exclusivity and jealousy. The blog post reads, "This allows for Sims to date multiple Sims without impact to other relationships." WooHoo!</p><p><em>The Sims </em>has otherwise expanded Sims' gender and sexuality options in recent years.

<p>Apple might churn out new iPads every year, but the great thing about them is that no matter which version you snag, you can count on it to perform like a champ. If you're looking to invest in one but don't want to spend much, consider buying refurbished units, which typically cost at least a third less than the cost of brand-new products.

<p><a href="https://mashable.com/review/bose-noise-cancelling-700-headphones-review" target="_self"><em>Read our full review of the Bose 700 headphones.</em></a></p><h3><strong>Who it's for: </strong></h3><p>Most headphones with ANC only offer one level of noise cancellation, plus a transparency mode, so you're not completely unaware of the world around you. The Bose 700s amp that up tenfold, giving you ten different adjustable levels of ANC, plus one level without, for the ultimate customization experience. If you're picky about the intensity of your ANC, these are the best headphones for your ears.</p><h3><strong>Why we picked this:</strong></h3><p>When Mashable tech reporter Alex Perry tested out these headphones, he found they worked effortlessly in multiple loud scenarios: "I've tried these out in the lively Mashable office, on the busy streets of New York City, and even in a particularly noisy bar. In every scenario, I couldn't hear much, except for what I chose to listen to."</p><p>To cycle through the different levels, you can use the app or cycle between three favorite settings directly on the headphones. These headphones do have one major downside: They originally came out in 2019. We think they remain current because no other brand has yet delivered headphones with as much ANC customization, but for anyone who loves top notch sound quality, you'll no longer find it in the Bose 700s. It's good, but not industry leading. </p><p>As these headphones are being phased out of Bose's lineup (the <a href="https://zdcs.link/vRDJP?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Bose%20QuietComfort%20Ultras&object_type=article&object_uuid=04y8XvRckQxzNTUEBcR4nmm&short_url=vRDJP&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Bose QuietComfort Ultras</a> are serving as their replacement, though they only have one level of ANC and transparency mode), they are on sale &mdash; you'll just want to grab them while they're still around. We're anticipating that this Prime Day might just be their last, so if you've been holding out to get the best possible deal, your wait may be over. Just don't wait too long. As a previous-gen model, they could sell out for good at any moment.</p><p><strong><em>Battery life:</em></strong> <em>20 hours</em> | <strong><em>Colors:</em></strong> <em>Black, soapstone, silver luxe</em></p><hr><h2>Best sound-first headphones: Sony WH-1000XM5</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p><a href="https://mashable.com/review/sony-wh-1000xm5-headphones" target="_self"><em><u>Read our full review on the Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones.</u></em></a></p><h3><strong>Who it's for: </strong></h3><p>For music lovers, we have to recommend the latest flagship Sony headphones. The <a href="https://zdcs.link/ovqlA?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Sony%20WH-1000XM5%20headphones&object_type=article&object_uuid=04y8XvRckQxzNTUEBcR4nmm&short_url=ovqlA&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones</a> deliver top-notch ANC and audiophile-level sound quality, with a hefty 30-hour battery life. Their design offers a less expensive alternative to the AirPods Max, for those who like their headphones to sound <em>and</em> look good. </p><h3><strong>Why we picked this: </strong></h3><p>If you're into Bose headphones but aren't totally sold on Sony, we're willing to bet you'll see something you like in the WH-1000XM5s. A couple weeks ahead of Prime Day, these headphones are marked down $50, but we wouldn't be surprised if they dipped even lower during the shopping holiday. At the time of writing, their all-time low price is $299.99.</p><p>Often, people herald Bose as having the superior ANC but Sony as owning the sound space. Our Deputy Reviews Editor Miller Kern definitely noticed that these headphones excelled in the latter arena when she tested them out: "[The sound] is full and clear, and feels like surround sound. I&rsquo;m a big fan of power ballads (I&rsquo;m not allowed to pick the music at parties), and Brandi Carlile&rsquo;s '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOpWqWK0q4U" target="_blank"><u>Right on Time</u></a>' sounded like it was meant to be listened to on these headphones. The vocals and instruments all got to shine, and the headphones made it feel like I was there in the studio. These are probably the best-sounding headphones I&rsquo;ve ever tried." </p><p>We do wish they folded up so they weren't so bulky to take on the go, but it's a relatively small con compared to the pros, especially if you're planning on wearing these headphones all day long. </p><p><strong><em>Battery life:</em></strong> <em>30 hours</em> | <strong><em>Colors:</em></strong> <em>Black, blue, silver</em></p><hr><h2>Best noise-cancelling earbuds: Apple AirPods Pro</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p><a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-airpods-pro-usb-c-review" target="_self"><em>Read our full review of the second-generation USB-C AirPods Pro</em></a><a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-airpods-pro-usb-c-review" target="_self">.</a></p><h3><strong>Who it's for: </strong></h3><p>If portability, active noise cancellation, and balanced sound are what you're looking for, your search ends with the AirPods Pro. It's not uncommon for earbuds to have active noise cancellation, but the AirPods Pro deliver an impressive performance. Plus they're versatile &mdash; whether you like to wear your headphones around the house, on a run, or as you're falling asleep at night, the AirPods Pro fit the bill. For obvious reasons, they're also the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-headphones-for-iphone" target="_self">best headphones for iPhone users</a>.</p><h3><strong>Why we picked this: </strong></h3><p>Last year, Apple finally gave their AirPods Pro a much-needed upgrade in the form of a USB-C charger. Other than the charging port, they're identical to the second-gen Pros released in 2022, which <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-airpods-pro-2-review" target="_self">Mashable Senior Editor Stan Schroeder described as</a> "the first pair of earbuds I'd actually consider taking on an airplane (instead of my much larger and clunkier over-ear headphones)." He went on to say "In some aspects, the active noise cancellation was even better than on my daily drivers: <a href="https://mashable.com/review/bw-px7-review" target="_self">B&amp;W's excellent PX7</a> over-ear headphones."</p><p>Despite their size and enhanced ANC, the Pro's battery still lasts for up to six hours on a single charge and 30 hours overall with the case. However, it is worth noting that the battery life will noticeably decline after a few years. </p><p>These earbuds are so frequently on sale that we don't recommend buying them at their full $249 price tag. You can often find them at Amazon (and Walmart) marked down to at least $199, but for Prime Day, we recommend holding out until you see them at $189 &mdash; and we've seen them get as low as $179.</p><p><strong><em>Battery life:</em></strong> <em>6 hours per charge (30 hours with case)</em> | <strong><em>Colors:</em></strong> <em>White</em></p><hr><h2>Best AirPods alternative: Beats Studio Buds + </h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3><strong>Who it's for:</strong></h3><p>If you're into earbuds with good ANC but less into shelling out $249, you'll find your happy medium in the Beats Studio Buds +. There's a reason we've consistently named them the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-airpods" target="_self">best AirPods alternative</a>.</p><h3><strong>Why we picked this: </strong></h3><p>The AirPods Pro are great, but these <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-wireless-earbuds" target="_self">popular wireless earbuds</a> aren't in everyone's budget. These Beats will run you about $80 less (or more, if you catch them on sale), give you some more leeway with color options, integrate just as well into an Apple ecosystem as AirPods, have the same battery life as AirPods, and still deliver pretty good ANC. If you're into a more bass-heavy sound, you'll definitely be happy with them. We've seem them drop down to $129.95 in the past, so we're expecting a similar discount during Prime Day, making these AirPods alternatives an even better value.</p><p>While we didn't find them to be a one-to-one experience during our testing &mdash; you should expect the AirPods to block out more noise, and we missed wireless charging &mdash; they were still incredibly comfortable. We also found them to fit better than AirPods, so if those Apple earbuds usually slip out of your ears, you'll want to try these buds instead. And for Android users, Google Fast Pair makes these earbuds a much better option than AirPods.</p><p>We do want to mention that if $169.95 is still fairly steep, you can also get ANC through <a href="https://zdcs.link/6qpl3?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Amazon%27s%20Echo%20Buds&object_type=article&object_uuid=04y8XvRckQxzNTUEBcR4nmm&short_url=6qpl3&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Amazon's Echo Buds</a> for just $119.99. (Echo Buds were our former budget pick, but we found the Beats have more to offer all-around.) For another solid option in the <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-budget-wireless-earbuds" target="_self">budget wireless earbuds</a> space, try the <a href="https://zdcs.link/wejYA?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Anker%20Soundcore%20Life%20P3i%20earbuds&object_type=article&object_uuid=04y8XvRckQxzNTUEBcR4nmm&short_url=wejYA&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Anker Soundcore Life P3i earbuds</a>, which offer ANC and great battery life for under $50. Though, they do lack multipoint pairing and have a less rich sound profile than Beats earbuds. </p><p><strong><em>Battery life:</em></strong> <em>6 hours with ANC, 9 without (27 hours with charging case)</em> | <strong><em>Colors:</em></strong> <em>Ivory, black, transparent, silver</em> </p><hr><h2>Best workout headphones: Beats Fit Pro</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p><a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-beats-fit-pro-review" target="_self"><em>Read our full review of the Beats Fit Pro.</em></a></p><h3><strong>Who it's for: </strong></h3><p>When it comes to workout headphones, you need a pair that'll actually stay in your ears. Motivating yourself to get through a set of push-ups is hard enough without an earbud popping out. The Beats Fit Pro earbuds are more than up to the task, and they deliver exceptional battery life, sound quality, and a few extras.</p><h3><strong>Why we picked this: </strong></h3><p>Earbuds designed for exercise typically have some sort of wingtip to help hold them in place, but those wingtips can often squeeze uncomfortably on your ears, especially with longer-term use. The small wingtip of these Beats hits the sweet spot &mdash; they're large enough to provide hold, and small enough to be undetectable. Mashable tech reporter Alex Perry writes that the wingtips "result [in] a pair of earbuds that <em>never</em> feel like they're going to fall out and, more importantly, <em>never</em> intrude on your comfort. I've worn these bad boys for six straight hours without any problems. It's hard to ask for more than that." </p><p>Beyond comfort, these earbuds provide an impressive sound profile, including that deep bass that Beats are known for. And of course, as any <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-headphones-for-running-uk" target="_self">workout earbuds</a> should be, these earbuds are sweat and water-resistant with an IPX4 rating. </p><p>If you're not to keen on spending a ton of money on workout headphones, the good news is that Prime Day should bring them back down to their all-time low price of $159.95. Though, if you miss out, we do see them get down to this price throughout the year.</p><p><strong><em>Battery life:</em></strong> <em>6 hours (24 hours with case)</em> | <strong><em>Colors:</em></strong> <em>Black, white, coral, gray, purple, blue, yellow, tan, brown, beige</em></p><hr><h2>Best premium noise-cancelling headphones: Bose QuietComfort Ultra </h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p><a href="https://mashable.com/review/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones" target="_self"><em>Read our full review of the Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones.</em></a></p><h3><strong>Who it's for:</strong></h3><p>If you're looking for a headphone experience built around excellent ANC, we think the Bose 700 headphones will more than do the job (and for a lot less). However, if you appreciate premium features such as spatial audio and want the most comfortable pair of headphones we've ever tested, then you'll be happy with the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/bose-quiet-comfort-ultra-headphones-earbuds-preorder" target="_self">new Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones</a> &mdash; and you'll still dole out less than you would for Apple AirPods Max over-ear headphones. If they get their typical markdown during Prime Day, you should expect to grab these Bose headphones for around $379, but we've seen them drop as low as $339.</p><p>And if you need more convincing, we recently named these new Bose headphones the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-noise-cancelling-headphones-for-flying" target="_self">best noise-cancelling headphones for flying</a>.</p><h3><strong>Why we picked this: </strong></h3><p>We weren't at all surprised that these QuietComfort headphones delivered all-day wear without issue. Even with glasses on, they never felt too tight or heavy, despite being an over-ear headphone with earcups that sealed out sound. Speaking of sound, it always came out well-rounded and functioned well with the immersive audio (which, by the way, is a new feature for the QuietComfort line). </p><p>They don't have adjustable ANC like the 700s, but the one ANC level <em>works</em>, though it will shine the most with lower-pitched tones (for higher tones, a bit of music or a podcast will go a long way in assisting the built-in noise cancellation). As for the downsides, these headphones are expensive at $429 (though <a href="https://mashable.com/article/may-30-bose-quietcomfort-ultra-deal" target="_self">you can find them on sale</a>), so we expected a lot out of them. The pairing can be a little touch and go at times and completely fine at others, but this inconsistency is characteristic of other Bose headphones we've tested. </p><p>The most baffling flaw of these headphones is the lack of passive playback, meaning you have to turn on the headphones to use the wired connection. Though these are clearly meant to be <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-wireless-headphones" target="_self">wireless headphones</a> first and foremost, this feels like a weird oversight (and a deviation from older models). Still, on balance, we think they justify the investment &mdash; they're <em>really </em>comfortable.</p><p><strong><em>Battery life:</em></strong> <em>24 hours</em> | <strong><em>Colors:</em></strong> <em> White, black, sandstone</em> </p><hr><h2>Best wired earbuds: Marshall Mode</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3><strong>Who it's for:</strong></h3><p>There are a lot of good reasons to consider wired earbuds. Some people simply don't want the hassle of constantly charging their headphones. Fair enough. Some people want impressive audio quality without shelling out $100 or more, and some <a href="https://mashable.com/article/wired-headphones-instagram-account-tiktok" target="_self">simply aren't buying</a> what Big Bluetooth is selling. For shoppers who fall into any of the above groups, we recommend the affordable <a href="https://zdcs.link/846Ad?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Marshall%20Mode%20earbuds&object_type=article&object_uuid=04y8XvRckQxzNTUEBcR4nmm&short_url=846Ad&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Marshall Mode earbuds</a>.</p><h3><strong>Why we picked this: </strong></h3><p>Though they're only $60 (and usually on sale for less than $40), Marshall Mode earbuds deliver better sound than most wireless earbuds that are triple the price. The bass is clear but not overpowering, and the highs bright but never too thin or tinny-sounding. </p><p>As for how you sound on the headphone's built-in mic, friends we spoke to on the phone said we came through with perfect clarity (the same can't be said for our tester's two-and-a-half year old first-generation AirPods Pro). Lower down on the wire is a separate remote, so you can pause and play your audio or hang up your calls without fiddling around with the mic. If you're sensing a theme, these earbuds are well-designed, and that comes through in how they wear and store. </p><p>During our testing, we had no trouble with the wire tangling, and it never felt too long during everyday wear. The buds themselves come with three ear tip sizes and wear comfortably all day. If you're not a fan of the shape of AirPods, then you're likely to find these a better shape for actually keeping your earbuds situated in your ears. There is one major downside with these wired earbuds, however. Unlike their more expensive wired counterparts, Marshall's don't come with a replaceable wire, so you'll want to take extra care to be as gentle as you can with the wire to extend its lifespan.</p><p>Though these headphones have a full price of $59.99, they're almost always marked down to $36 to $38 on Amazon. If you catch them on sale for even less during Prime Day, they're definitely worth picking up. </p><p><strong><em>Battery life:</em></strong> <em>N/A</em> | <strong><em>Colors:</em></strong> <em>Black</em> </p><hr><h2>How we tested the best headphones</h2><p>Over the years, we've tested out a <em>lot </em>of headphones and wireless earbuds at Mashable. To determine the best of the best, and not just pick what's trendy at the moment, we went back through our reviews from former and current tech reporters, editors, and shopping reporters. From JBL and Sony to Samsung and Anker Soundcore, we did our research to make sure we left no major headphone stone unturned, and the result is this guide &mdash; our favorite vetted and tested headphones of 2024 (so far). </p><p>All of the headphones in this guide were hands-on tested. In making our selections, we weighed: </p><ul><li><p><strong>Sound: </strong>Since headphones are first and foremost a way for you to listen to audio, if a pair of headphones didn't sound good, they didn't make the list &mdash; that goes for our budget pick, too. </p></li><li><p><strong>Noise cancellation: </strong>These days, some form of noise cancellation is near-essential for any pair of headphones. We prioritized models that feature solid noise cancellation. </p></li><li><p><strong>Comfort: </strong>What's the point of a great pair of headphones if they're too uncomfortable to wear? </p></li><li><p><strong>Customization: </strong>Whether it be for ANC levels, transparency modes, or touch controls, headphones that allow you to adjust the settings will make them feel like they were made for you. </p></li><li><p><strong>Battery life: </strong>Most wireless headphones on the market rely on Bluetooth connectivity, so having a battery you can rely on for at least a few hours of listening time is key. </p></li><li><p><strong>Special features: </strong>When testing headphones and earbuds, we also take into consideration any other special features they offer. For headphones in the $200-plus price range, we expect at least a few special features.</p></li></ul><p>You might notice that the <a href="https://zdcs.link/8j3rw?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20AirPods%20Max&object_type=article&object_uuid=04y8XvRckQxzNTUEBcR4nmm&short_url=8j3rw&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><strong>Apple AirPods Max</strong></a> are missing from our top picks. It's not that we don't like them &mdash; in fact, we think they sound and look great. But <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-airpods-max-review" target="_self">when we reviewed them</a>, we found that they didn't have a practical storage option, they never really turn off (thus draining the otherwise long battery life), and are just too expensive to justify a wholehearted recommendation. We understand if you like them regardless, but personally, we think there are better options at lower price points. </p><h3>Recent testing updates</h3><p>As of Feb. 2024, two of our former recommendations, the Skullcandy Sesh Evo earbuds and Sennheiser IE 300 have been discontinued. We're in the process of testing new headphones to take their place, and we chose the Marshall Mode earbuds as our new budget pick for earbuds. We also added in the Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones as an upgrade recommendation in March 2024.</p><p>From April to May 2024, we also tested the <a href="https://zdcs.link/8BpW2?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Marshall%20Major%20V&object_type=article&object_uuid=04y8XvRckQxzNTUEBcR4nmm&short_url=8BpW2&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Marshall Major V</a> headphones and <a href="https://zdcs.link/Y0w2r?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Bowers%20%26%20Wilkins%20Px7%20S2&object_type=article&object_uuid=04y8XvRckQxzNTUEBcR4nmm&short_url=Y0w2r&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Bowers &amp; Wilkins Px7 S2</a> headphones, both of which had excellent sound profiles and easy to navigate custom equalizers on their companion apps. Ultimately, they didn't make the cut on our final list for a couple of reasons. With the Major V headphones, we love that their claim of 100+ hours of battery life held up under our testing, but we found them to get uncomfortable after a couple of hours. We also would have appreciated ANC at their $149 price point. </p><p>For the B&amp;W headphones, we loved their design and premium feel in addition to their truly impressive sound, but we found that their ANC was only so-so. If you're willing to spend $399, you can find a better balance of sound and ANC in the Sony XM5 headphones.</p><p>As of June 2024, we've removed the Bose QuietComfort 45 headphones as they're officially discontinued and unavailable online.</p>]]></content:encoded>

   <em><strong>UPDATE: Jul. 7, 2024, 5:00 a.m. EDT </strong>This article was updated in July 2024 ahead of Amazon's Prime Day, which is coming July 16 and 17. It reflects the current Kindle lineup after the Kindle Oasis was discontinued earlier this year.</em>
</p>
<p>If you're searching for the best Kindle to buy in 2024, you're spoiled for choice. Amazon now makes a Kindle for every type of reader (including the cute yet highly functional Kindle Kids edition).&nbsp;</p><p>If you haven't yet been converted to the lovely world of Amazon Kindle readers, we have to ask, frankly: <em>What the heck are you waiting for?</em></p><p>And now is the time to buy. With <a href="https://mashable.com/article/prime-day-everything-you-need-to-know" target="_self">Amazon Prime Day 2024</a> coming <strong>July 16 and 17</strong>, the mega-retailer always discounts its own products, which includes Kindles. We're already seeing deals on <a href="https://mashable.com/article/early-prime-day-book-deals-2024" target="_self">bestsellers and Kindle e-books</a>, so there's no doubt we'll see Kindle devices on sale, too. During past Amazon sales, we've seen <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-prime-day-kindle-deals-2023" target="_self">Kindle deals</a> with savings up to $90, so pause before paying full-price.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>We know nothing compares to the feel of a book in your hands as you thumb through page after enticing page. Yet, even if you're a ride-or-die bibliophile whose favorite smell is that of a bookstore (<em>guilty</em>), Kindles have undeniable benefits. You no longer have to pack 10 different books when going on vacation because you never know which book will suit your mood at any given time. You can also read poolside or at the beach without worrying about damaging your precious literature.</p><p>As of July 2024, Amazon makes six different Kindles, after the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/amazon-new-kindle-oasis-review" target="_self">Kindle Oasis</a> was recently discontinued. The current lineup has a vast variety of features and includes a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/amazon-kindle-2022" target="_self">new generation of Amazon e-readers</a> released in 2022 as well as some older models still worth buying. We've gathered our favorites below along with highlights from our Kindle reviews, so read on to find the right model for your reading pleasure. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2>What should I look for in the best Kindles?</h2><p>When shopping for a new Kindle, consider the following factors:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Display size.</strong> The smallest Kindle has a 6-inch display while the largest has a 10.2-inch display.</p></li><li><p><strong>Storage capacity.</strong> Depending on the model, Kindles can have anywhere from 8 GB to 64 GB of storage capacity to stash many thousands of your favorite reads at a time.</p></li><li><p><strong>Battery life.</strong> Kindles generally have outstanding battery life (depending on your usage), but some models are even more impressive. On the low end, they last up to six weeks per charge, while others last up to 12 weeks.</p></li><li><p><strong>Waterproof protection.</strong> Not all Kindles are waterproof, but those that are provide peace of mind in case of accidental immersion in water without incurring damage.</p></li></ul><p>Beyond those variable factors, all the latest Kindles boast a 300 ppi, high-resolution display with zero glare so you can enjoy sharp text and images at any viewing angle. All Kindles are also equipped with WiFi connectivity to allow you to access and download all the reading material you could ever want. (However, select Kindle readers also allow for free cellular connectivity so you have more options.) All Kindles offer parental control options as well, whether or not you've purchased a Kindle device <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-tablets-for-kids" target="_self"><u>specifically made for kids</u></a>. Plus, you can listen to audiobooks on Audible via any Kindle's built-in Bluetooth connection.</p><h2>What features do Kindles offer?</h2><p>Beyond the aforementioned standard features that are found across most (if not all) of the latest Kindle models, there are also specialized features that you'll find on the higher-end models. To pick the right Kindle for your lifestyle, you'll want to consider your particular needs and preferences as you shop.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Perhaps you like to read outside often; you'll want a Kindle with an auto-adjusting light so you don't have to worry about constantly fixing the brightness for optimal viewing in your current environment. The Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition and Kindle Scribe all have this auto-adjustment feature.</p><p>Or, maybe you like to read before bed and want to cut out blue light that tends to keep us awake and alert; you'll need a Kindle that has an adjustable warm light feature so you can shift the display color from white to amber. After <a href="https://mashable.com/article/amazon-kindle-scribe-stylus" target="_self">the 2022 release of the Kindle Scribe</a>, there's even a Kindle that will allow you to jot down notes on your texts for later reference.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[We're comparing top models from Roborock, iRobot, and Shark to find the best robot vacuums for lifting pet hair and crumbs from carpets.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/roundups/02h7gmaazXjCDAQvxzZ6mL5/hero-image.png" alt="iRobot Roomba Combo j9+ cleaning carpeted floor on illustrated artwork version of living room scene"><p>Nearly any robot vacuum can sufficiently clear <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-robot-vacuums-for-tile-floors" target="_self">tile</a> or <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-robot-vacuums-for-hardwood-floors" target="_self">hardwood</a> floors of the hair and crumbs blowing across it like tumbleweeds. But for a robot vacuum to work on carpet, much more suction power and concentrated airflow is required to uproot the debris embedded in those fibers.</p><h2>Do robot vacuums work on carpet?</h2><p>Yes, several robot vacuum cleaners do a pretty phenomenal job on carpet and rugs. In fact, the best robot vacuum brands like iRobot, Roborock, Eufy, and Shark have been mastering the art for several years, particularly honing in on pet hair pickup and combatting hair tangling in the brush. </p><p>For homes with varying floor types and a notable amount of foot traffic, buying the cheapest robot vacuum you can find will likely create <em>more</em> hassle than it's worth. Every time that bot gets stuck on a rug corner or welcomes you home to pet hair still visibly clinging to the living room carpet, you'd probably rather just do the job yourself &mdash;&nbsp;but rest assured that that's not an inevitable experience with every robovac.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>The best robot vacuums for carpet have powerful suction, of course, aided by brush roll systems designed to dig into low- and high-pile carpet to pinch hair and large chunks while simultaneously inhaling fine debris that a weaker robot vac would pass right over. A majority of our top picks also use automatic suction adjustment to customize cleaning based on floor type, and all current picks either come with a self-emptying dock (or at least offer the option) to mitigate the frequency of trips to the trash bin.</p><p>And if a robot vacuum has mastered carpet &mdash;&nbsp;the hardest floor type to tackle &mdash;&nbsp;these models will undoubtedly ace the hard floors in your home. In 2024, most of the robot vacuums with market-leading carpet cleaning are just as advanced at <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-robot-vacuum-and-mop" target="_self">mopping</a>.</p><h2>Prime Day robot vacuum deals are coming</h2><p>Understandably, most robot vacuum brands don't arm their most basic botvacs with their most tenacious suction, so choosing a more powerful robot vacuum cleaner specifically for carpet can be more expensive. If you're on a budget, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/prime-day-everything-you-need-to-know" target="_self">Prime Day</a> is one of your best chances to get a premium robot vacuum on sale for up to half of its usual cost &mdash;&nbsp;ideally competing with the price of the more affordable robot vacuum that you were about to settle for.</p><p>The specific robovacs in our carpet-centric list below haven't seen much movement in the way of discounts so far in 2024, but we're expecting Prime Day to shake that up. We're tracking early <a href="https://mashable.com/article/early-prime-day-robot-vacuum-deals-2024" target="_self">Prime Day robot vacuum deals</a> on a weekly basis, so keep checking back to see if your favorite model goes on sale ahead of the official kickoff on July 16.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

The game is all about finding the "common threads between words." And just like <em>Wordle</em>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-20-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> resets after midnight and each new set of words gets trickier and trickier&mdash;so we've served up some hints and tips to get you over the hurdle.</p><p>If you just want to be told today's puzzle, you can jump to the end of this article for July 1's <em>Connections</em> solution. But if you'd rather solve it yourself, keep reading for some clues, tips, and strategies to assist you.</p><h2><strong>What is <em>Connections</em>?</strong></h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. Like <em>Wordle, </em>you can share the results with your friends on social media.</p><h2><strong>Here's a hint for today's <em>Connections</em> categories</strong></h2><p>Want a hit about the categories without being told the categories?

<p>Eagle-eyed news readers will remember that Apple and Epic have been going at each other's throats for four years now. Epic took umbrage with Apple's practice of scraping 30 percent off in-app payments, which resulted in <em>Fortnite</em> being taken off the iOS App Store. Epic eventually won a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-epic-games-fortnite-ruling" target="_self">partial legal victory</a> related to the matter, and later <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-google-meta-eu-investigations-digital-markets-act" target="_self">unrelated legal developments</a> in the European Union have guaranteed that <a href="https://mashable.com/article/fortnite-return-ios-iphone-apple-eu-dma" target="_self"><em>Fortnite</em></a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/fortnite-return-ios-iphone-apple-eu-dma" target="_self"> will return to iPhones there</a> in short order.</p><p>That said, we're still waiting to find out when or if <em>Fortnite</em> will return to iPhones in the United States. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>Take advantage of price-tracking tools </h2><p>Check out dedicated sites and browser extensions that do the work of tracking prices for you. </p><ul><li><p><a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Camelcamelcamel</strong></a> is a website that gives you price history charts on Amazon products and even sends you alerts when a price has dropped. To up your price-monitoring game, you can install its browser extension called "The Camelizer," which gives you instant access to price history while you're shopping. </p></li><li><p><a href="https://keepa.com/#!" target="_blank"><strong>Keepa</strong></a> is a price monitoring site and browser extension that is dedicated to Amazon products.

These sites are particularly useful because "the Prime Day effect" usually causes other retailers to host competing sales.</p></li></ul><h2>Ask Alexa for help</h2><p>If you have a newer Echo device, you can enable Alexa's <a href="https://mashable.com/article/amazon-prime-day-alexa-advanced-deals-alert-hack" target="_self">advanced deal alerts feature</a> to find and keep track of deals on products you want. The smart assistant will notify you up to 24 hours in advance of a deal you've added to your shopping cart, saved for later, or added to your Wish List. To turn on this setting, go to the Alexa app and open Notifications under Settings. From here, tap Amazon Shopping and scroll down to toggle Deal Recommendations. Your Echo device will flash a yellow ring to indicate this setting is live. </p><h2>Check curated lists</h2><p>Finding the best Prime Day price is one thing, but how do you even know what deals are being offered elsewhere? It's safe to assume that most products on Amazon have some kind of discount, but some deals are better than others, meaning it's important to know what to buy and <a href="https://mashable.com/deals/what-not-to-buy-prime-day?test_uuid=05n6qXSf1roZ2M9nfgWNQzG&amp;test_variant=a" target="_self">what </a><a href="https://mashable.com/deals/what-not-to-buy-prime-day?test_uuid=05n6qXSf1roZ2M9nfgWNQzG&amp;test_variant=a" target="_self"><em>not</em></a><a href="https://mashable.com/deals/what-not-to-buy-prime-day?test_uuid=05n6qXSf1roZ2M9nfgWNQzG&amp;test_variant=a" target="_self"> to buy on Prime Day</a>. </p><p><a href="https://mashable.com/shopping" target="_self">Mashable's shopping team</a> is already doing the legwork of scouring Amazon's vast inventory to highlight the best deals out there, and we'll be on it through the sale.

<h2>Don't forget about other retailers</h2><p>During October's Prime Big Deal Days event, we saw other retailers capitalize on the fervor by hosting their own sales. This year, Target announced its <a href="https://mashable.com/article/target-deals-prime-day-2024" target="_self">Circle Week sale</a> will run July 7-13. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/walmart-plus-week-prime-day-2024" target="_self">Walmart+ Week</a> already went down in June, but it was an overall disappointment, so we're hoping for better deals from Walmart's recently announced <a href="https://mashable.com/article/walmart-deals-prime-day-2024" target="_self">Walmart Deals</a>, running July 8-11. Best Buy just had a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/july-4th-best-buy-deals-2024" target="_self">4th of July sale</a>, but they will likely announce another competing sale aligned with Prime Week as well.</p><p>Competition can be a great way to drive prices down, but certain retailers have specialties with these sales. Best Buy is usually good for big ticket tech like high-end TVs or laptops as well as gaming deals, Walmart is ideal for more budget-friendly TVs and home tech, and Target is best for everyday essentials.</p><h2>Shop invite-only deals to avoid the chaos</h2><p>This year, Amazon is once again hosting <a href="https://mashable.com/deals/prime-day-invite-only-deals" target="_self">invite-only deals</a> that give big discounts on in-demand items. Deals you can request now include headphones, a SodaStream bundle, and a watch, but more deals are likely to be announced. Last year, a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/oct-5-early-prime-day-deal-amazon-fire-tv-omni-series" target="_self">50-inch Amazon Fire TV Omni Series TV</a> and a Blink Outdoor security camera system were available for 60% off. Lucky shoppers who are chosen for access to these deals will receive an email with a unique link to buy them at some point when the sale is live.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

   <em><strong>UPDATE: May. 11, 2024, 5:00 a.m. EDT </strong>Two top picks in this story have shifted after senior shopping reporter Leah Stodart was able to hands-on test CES 2024 releases from Roborock and Eufy in her own home.</em>
</p>
<p>Nearly any robot vacuum can sufficiently clear a <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-robot-vacuums-for-tile-floors" target="_self">tile</a> or <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-robot-vacuums-for-hardwood-floors" target="_self">hardwood</a> floor of the hair and crumbs blowing across it like tumbleweeds. But for a robot vacuum to work on carpet, much more suction power and concentrated airflow is required to uproot the debris embedded in those fibers.</p><h2>Do robot vacuums work on carpet?</h2><p>Yes, several robot vacuum cleaners do a pretty phenomenal job on carpet and rugs. In fact, the best robot vacuum brands like iRobot, Roborock, Eufy, and Shark have been mastering the art for several years, particularly honing in on pet hair pickup and combatting hair tangling in the brush. </p><p>For homes with varying floor types and a notable amount of foot traffic, buying the cheapest robot vacuum you can find will likely create <em>more</em> hassle than it's worth. Every time that bot gets stuck on a rug corner or welcomes you home to pet hair still visibly clinging to the living room carpet, you'd probably rather just do the job yourself &mdash;&nbsp;but rest assured that that's not an inevitable experience with every robot vacuum.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>The best robot vacuums for carpet have powerful suction, of course, aided by brush roll systems designed to dig into multiple pile heights to pinch hair and large chunks while simultaneously inhaling fine debris that a weaker robot vac would pass right over. A majority of our top picks also use automatic suction adjustment to customize cleaning based on floor type, and all current picks either come with a self-emptying dock (or at least offer the option) to mitigate the frequency of trips to the trash bin.</p><p>And if a robot vacuum has mastered carpet &mdash;&nbsp;the hardest floor type to tackle &mdash;&nbsp;these models will undoubtedly ace the hard floors in your home. In 2024, most of the robot vacuums with market-leading carpet cleaning are just as advanced at <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-robot-vacuum-and-mop" target="_self">mopping</a>.</p><p>The Mashable team is on a continuous mission to narrow down those options for you. We've hands-on tested dozens of robot vacuums on several pile lengths of carpets, rugs, and bath mats in a variety of home layouts. Here are our favorites for every carpeted situation in 2024.</p>]]></content:encoded>

You can generally expect the mopping technique to get a little more meticulous as price goes up, so the <em>type</em> of mess that you'll be expecting your 2-in-1 model to conquer becomes a big deciding factor. Are you mostly concerned with wiping up spur-of-the-moment spills, or will you be a stickler about dried-on stains that call for more heavy-duty scrubbing?</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Fortunately, both ends of the pricing spectrum provide way more bang for their buck in 2024 than they did in the early 2020s. The past year or so has seen serious strides in the automated mopping department: Brands like <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-roombas" target="_self">iRobot</a>, Roborock, Eufy, <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-shark-robot-vacuums" target="_self">Shark</a>, and Narwal are moving far past the bare minimum &mdash; the mere presence of mopping gear &mdash; with features that actually make autonomous mopping effective, like pressurized and/or spinning mopping pads (rather than lackadaisical, stationary ones), water tanks that refill themselves, and interior compatibility with cleaning solutions for better sanitization than cleaning with just water.</p><p>This shift is particularly exemplified in the fleet of new hybrid robot vacs released at <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ces-2024-robot-vacuums" target="_self">CES 2024</a>, where a new standard for the future of mopping robot vacuums was set: The best robot hybrids will also cross post-mopping maintenance off of your list by automatically washing and drying their own mopping pads, shifting the concept of a self-empty dock to a full self-cleaning station. With one of these self-cleaning models, your robovac will be ready to mop again almost immediately &mdash;&nbsp;a clutch change from older, more basic designs that required you to toss soggy mopping pads in the washing machine after every use..</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

While the time-saving factor may be a moot point here, it doesn't completely diminish the appeal of using a robot vacuum in a crowded home. </p><p>It's actually totally plausible that spaces with less square footage get dirty faster because virtually every spot is a high-traffic spot.

<p>However, it <em>is</em> crucial to not automatically assume that less floor to cover means that the cheapest vacuum you can find will suffice. Cramped furniture arrangements and quick changes between floor types actually call for a vac on the more competent end navigation-wise, or you'll risk arriving home to a bot that got stuck in kitchen chair legs during the first five minutes of cleaning. Before getting into specific robovac recommendations, let's assess the features that would make this a smart purchase.</p><h2>Do robot vacuums work in small apartments?</h2><p>While some large, heavy-duty robot vacuums would probably be overkill in a tight space, there are several compact, quiet robot vacuums on the market that make a lot of sense in a small space. </p><p>One way to downsize the space a robot vac takes up is to forego the self-empty dock. While forgoing it automatic emptying o save yourself inches on the floor may not be ideal, it'll be a little less damning in a small space, as the vacuum isn't sucking up as much dirt on each cleaning run as it would in a big house. However, finding a super compact auto-empty dock nowadays isn't hard, and many robot vacuums offer the option to buy one separately later. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

(Hint: It's in the name.)</p><p>When you outsource vacuuming to a robot, your floors get cleaned way more often. The only downside of this extra attention? More debris off the floor means a dust bin that fills up faster, and emptying a vacuum's dust bin by hand is arguably the worst part of the chore.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Enter self-emptying robot vacuums.&nbsp;These vacs do your vacuuming and emptying for you for a few weeks at a time, storing the debris the <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-robot-vacuums" target="_self">robot vacuum</a> collects on each trip in a larger compartment that's located in the charging dock.</p><h2><strong>Are self-emptying robot vacuums worth it?</strong></h2><p>Not having to lift a finger when it comes to floor maintenance is well worth it for anyone who just doesn&rsquo;t have the time &mdash; or the interest &mdash; in wrestling an upright vacuum out of the closet every few days. The next question is whether you want the true set-it-and-forget solution that only automatic emptying can provide, and if you're willing to pay more for it.</p><p>Automatic emptying quickly proves its worth in households where the layer of pet fur would otherwise have you dumping the vacuum's tiny dust bin after just a few rooms. The best self-emptying robot vacuum cleaners let you off the hook for months at a time. And when it actually is time to empty the bigger dust bin, most self-empty docks trap dust inside a disposable bag, meaning you won't have to see or touch the nasty stuff at all.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>For people with allergies, auto-emptying also spares you from inhaling the inevitable puff of dust that emerges when dumping a dust bin into the trash.</p><p>Speaking of avoiding the grosser parts of the job, if you want a <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-robot-vacuum-and-mop" target="_self">robot vacuum that mops</a>, many self-emptying docks also take it upon themselves to deal with dirty mopping pads after the job is done. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-of-ces-2024-highlights" target="_self">CES 2024</a> ushered in a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ces-2024-robot-vacuums" target="_self">new wave of flagship robot vacuums</a> that self-wash and self-dry the soggy mopping pads in the same dock where debris is held. </p><p>While self emptying could add anywhere from $100 to $500 to a robot vac's overall price tag, automated mopping pad washing and drying is the automation that really kicks the price up over the $1,000 mark. Remember that both of these are optional in most cases, so if you're on a tight budget or tight on space, you can forgo the fancy dust bin and save significantly. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

It is, in fact, a capital "R" that denotes Roomba as a proper noun rather than a generic trademark, though the Band-Aid level interchangeability really does exemplify just how iconic iRobot has become in the world of automated floor cleaners.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>That can be attributed to the fact that iRobot has consistently delivered some of the most reliable robot vacuum models for two decades. More than 20 Roombas have come out since the first one hit homes in 2002, but tracking the best Roombas isn't so chaotic when you consider that only a handful of those models are actually relevant at the time of your shopping.</p><p>Right now is a particularly good time to keep your eye out for a discounted Roomba, because <a href="https://mashable.com/article/prime-day-everything-you-need-to-know" target="_self">Amazon Prime Day 2024</a> is on the way. This year's big shopping event is on July 16 and 17, and we're already seeing <a href="https://mashable.com/article/amazon-prime-day" target="_self">early Prime Day deals</a> on plenty of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/early-prime-day-robot-vacuum-deals-2024" target="_self">robot vacuums</a>, including <a href="https://mashable.com/article/early-prime-day-roomba-deals-2024" target="_self">Roombas</a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/early-prime-day-self-emptying-robot-vacuum-deals-2024" target="_self">self-emptying robovacs</a>. There are certainly more robot vacuum deals to come, and we'll keep you updated on all things <a href="https://mashable.com/category/prime-day" target="_self">Prime Day</a> leading up to the event and beyond.</p><h2>How to tell the difference between the Roomba models</h2><p>The arbitrary numbers and letters of the Roomba family tree are confusing at face value, but nothing that can't be told apart after learning a few super general classification themes.</p><p>When shopping for a Roomba, you'll really only be choosing from what we call iRobot's core lineup: the group of three to five Roomba series that are actively sold on iRobot's website. Any Roomba whose title includes a letter with a number (like j9+ or i5) is more advanced than a Roomba with just numbers in the title (like 692). </p><p>The j Series is iRobot's most advanced right now, followed by the s Series, i Series, and then the 600 Series. A plus sign (like j9+) denotes that the model comes with a self-emptying dock. Roombas that mop will have "Combo" in the title, and there are several Roombas that can be purchased with or without mopping abilities. </p><p>You won't need to memorize any nuances past these overarching rules. We'll cover the fine print, like which Roombas have smart mapping or small obstacle detection, in our deep dive below, noting the most important differences between each current Roomba. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>It's summer, and the last thing you want is to be sweating all night long inside a too-hot sleeping bag. Grab this one meant for warmer temps (though it will still protect you at 30 degrees) for 60% off. It's lightweight and comes with a compressible sack for easy transportation. And if night temps are still high, you can always just use it as an extra sleeping pad as you snooze on top. </p><h2>Best mosquito repellent deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>The most annoying part of the outdoors? The bugs. Zap the problem with Thermacell's unscented solution that should protect a 20-foot area. Repellent cartridges last 12 hours, and the device is rechargeable with a 5.5-hour battery life. Plus, it's portable, so you can bring it from the pool to the campsite. This bundle comes with one refill cartridge and a charging cable.</p><h3>More early Prime Day outdoor deals:</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/KJBdV?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Collapsible%20LED%20Camping%20Lantern%204-pack&object_type=article&object_uuid=03o7NwhfcB2rGf0GsoDzPvT&short_url=KJBdV&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Collapsible LED Camping Lantern 4-pack</a> &mdash; <strong>$19.59</strong> <s>$29.99</s> (save 35%)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/3d4p3?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Wise%20Owl%20Outfitters%20Camping%20Hammock&object_type=article&object_uuid=03o7NwhfcB2rGf0GsoDzPvT&short_url=3d4p3&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Wise Owl Outfitters Camping Hammock</a> &mdash;<strong> $18.84 </strong><s>$25.37</s> (save 26%)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/joxyL?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Aqua%20Plus%20Inflatable%20Stand%20Up%20Paddle%20Board&object_type=article&object_uuid=03o7NwhfcB2rGf0GsoDzPvT&short_url=joxyL&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Aqua Plus Inflatable Stand Up Paddle Board</a> &mdash; <strong>$169.99</strong><s> $249.99</s> (save $32%)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/xPrdO?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=UNP%206-Person%20Waterproof%20Tent&object_type=article&object_uuid=03o7NwhfcB2rGf0GsoDzPvT&short_url=xPrdO&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">UNP 6-Person Waterproof Tent</a> &mdash; <strong>$115.90</strong> <s>$169.90</s> (save 32%)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/GdB6q?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=HiiPeak%20Sleeping%20Pad&object_type=article&object_uuid=03o7NwhfcB2rGf0GsoDzPvT&short_url=GdB6q&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">HiiPeak Sleeping Pad</a> &mdash; <strong>$27.99</strong> <s>$34.99</s> (save 20%)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/71oqy?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Maelstrom%2035-Can%20Cooler%20Backpack&object_type=article&object_uuid=03o7NwhfcB2rGf0GsoDzPvT&short_url=71oqy&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Maelstrom 35-Can Cooler Backpack</a> &mdash;<strong> $35.97</strong> <s>$39.99</s> (save 10%)</p></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

<h3>1. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/early-prime-day-apple-deals-2024" target="_self">Apple products</a></h3><p>Buying the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/early-prime-day-apple-deals-2024" target="_self">fruit company's flagship tech</a> during Prime Day is a major hack. If you're already planning on buying some of the most notoriously expensive tech on the market, why not buy it at a discount? In light of Apple's latest <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ipad-pro-2024-preorder" target="_self">iPad Pro</a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ipad-air-2024-preorder" target="_self">iPad Air</a> drops, we expect to see markdowns on older models.

<h3>5. Pet supplies</h3><p>As the owner of two dogs, I feel like I'm constantly shelling out money for dog food, dog treats, dog toys, and grooming products. If you have a dog or a cat, it's basically a given that you're going to need to buy these essentials every few months <em>at least</em>. During July Prime Day, I bought a 50-pack of poop bag rolls for a fraction of what I'd pay for at the pet store, in addition to a ton of cheap treats and toys. Prime Day is the best time to stock up on pet stuff, especially from the Amazon Basics brand. If you missed out on the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/amazon-pet-day-2024" target="_self">Amazon Pet Sale</a>, don't sleep on the Prime Day pet deals.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

These won't be your showstopper living room TVs, but are great for your guest bedroom or kids' rooms. During last year's event, we saw an invite-only deal for the 43-inch version of a 4K Omni Series TV for just $99.99, and we expect to see even more cheap Fire TVs to come this year.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3>10. Invite-only deals</h3><p>Amazon brought back its <a href="https://mashable.com/deals/prime-day-invite-only-deals" target="_self">invite-only deals program</a> for Prime Day 2024. Deals on headphones, SodaStreams, and more are already live, with more to come.

<h2>Things to avoid on Prime Day</h2><p>While Prime Day might have some good deals, there are some things to look out for. <a href="https://mashable.com/deals/what-not-to-buy-prime-day?test_uuid=05n6qXSf1roZ2M9nfgWNQzG&amp;test_variant=b" target="_self">Mashable covered things to avoid in detail</a>, but here are a few quick tips.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

            What not to buy on Prime Day, from third-party scams to Ring cams

<h3>1. Third-party sellers</h3><p>In general, you can trust things sold and shipped by Amazon. Third-party sellers tend to be less reliable, and you run the risk of buying counterfeit products. If a deal from a third-party seller seems too good to be true, it probably is. </p><h3>2. Ring doorbells and cameras</h3><p>The steep discounts on Ring cameras and bundles might be tempting around Prime Day, but we don't recommend anything from Ring due to privacy concerns. Not only are they easily hackable, but Ring is also notorious for giving people's info away without their consent. There are plenty of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-prime-day-home-security-deals-2023" target="_self">home security deals from other brands</a> on Prime Day, and if you need a little guidance on the good ones, check out our <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-home-security-systems" target="_self">guide to the best home security systems</a>.</p><h3>3. Anything you don't need</h3><p>Like we mentioned before, it's best to use Prime Day as a way to get something you need at a good discount. What's not as advisable is buying things <em>just because</em>. Something you don't need or won't use is still something you don't need or won't use, no matter how good the deal is. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Andrea Luck, based in Scotland, processed the raw data to enhance its clarity (shown above). The plumes, visible along Io's limb, are either blasting out of two vents from one enormous volcano or two separate-but-snug volcanoes.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/nasa-io-images-juno" target="_self"><u>Juno</u></a> has been orbiting <a href="https://mashable.com/article/james-webb-space-telescope-jupiter-europa-images" target="_self"><u>Jupiter</u></a> for more than seven years. During its primary mission, the spacecraft collected data on the gas giant's atmosphere and interior. Among its discoveries was a finding that the planet's atmospheric weather layer extends way beyond its clouds.&nbsp;</p><p>After completing 35 orbits, the spacecraft transitioned to studying the entire system around Jupiter, including its dust rings and many moons. This extended mission will continue for another year or until the spacecraft dies. Juno will eventually burn up in Jupiter's atmosphere as its trajectory around the planet erodes. Relax, though: NASA says the orbiter is not at risk of crashing into and contaminating Jupiter's moons, some of which may be <a href="https://mashable.com/article/jupiter-juice-launch-date-mission" target="_self"><u>habitable worlds</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The spacecraft has an instrument, dubbed <a href="https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/junocam/" target="_blank"><u>JunoCam</u></a>, designed to take closeup photos of Jupiter and engage the public.

These lakes are contained in caldera-like features &mdash; large basins formed when volcanoes erupt and collapse, said Alessandro Mura, the paper's lead author, in a statement.</p><p>The researchers think the moon teems with vast lakes of lava, wherein magma rises and recedes. The lava crust breaks against the lake's steep walls, forming a ring similar to what happens in Hawaiian lava lakes. The tall barriers may be what's preventing the magma from spilling all over Io's surface.</p><p>But there's another idea that can't be ruled out: Magma could be welling up in the middle of the lake, spreading out, then forming a crust that sinks along the lake's rim, exposing lava.</p>]]></content:encoded>

He's now ventured into television with Netflix series <a href="https://mashable.com/video/supacell-netflix-cast-superpowers-origin-stories" target="_self"><em><u>Supacell</u></em></a>. Using <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/sickle-cell-disease" target="_blank">sickle cell disease</a> as the origin of superpowers, the show is an innovative approach to the science fiction and superhero genre. Through this unique concept, <em>Supacell</em> also challenges long-standing stereotypes associated with the Black community.</p><p>Across six episodes, we see the story of five seemingly ordinary Black people from South London, all linked by a genetic history of sickle cell disease and the sudden emergence of superpowers. But things get tricky when courier and new time-traveller Michael (Tosin Cole) teleports into the future and discovers his fianc&eacute;e Dionne's (Adelayo Adedayo) life is in danger. To save her, he must find four others with newfound superpowers: Sabrina (Nadine Mills), Rodney (Calvin Demba), Andre (Eric Kofi Abrefa), and Tazer (Josh Tedeku).&nbsp;</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Despite the instantly opportunistic nature of getting superpowers, <em>Supacell'</em>s characters are not trying to use their newfound talents to conquer the world. As Rodney, newly equipped with super speed, says, "This ain't a fucking comic book, this is real life." They grapple with personal dilemmas, be it Andre paying child support, Tazer dealing with gang rivalry, or Sabrina protecting her sister from harm. They don't have time to focus on helping someone save their fianc&eacute;e or dealing with mysterious figures trying to capture them. They're already just trying to survive the day.</p><h2><em>Supacell </em>fosters a broader social dialogue</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>One of the most remarkable aspects of <em>Supacell</em> is its exploration of a story that has traditionally only existed in white spaces. While characters like Miles Morales as Spider-Man, Storm in <em>X-Men</em>, Luke Cage, and<em> Black Panther</em>'s T&rsquo;Challa, <em>Captain Marvel</em>'s Monica Rambeau, and Blade are some exceptions, Rapman's show seizes the opportunity to highlight how science fiction and superhero stories have rightly faced criticism for their long-standing lack of racial representation. </p><p>Mainstream media seldom portrays the intricacies of Black life, instead perpetuating stereotypes without challenging or exploring them. But this issue isn't new; the #OscarsSoWhite movement rose in 2015 and, more recently, in 2022, a report <a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/film-tv-representation-diversity-2022-1235583955/" target="_blank"><u>revealed a 16.7 percent decrease in the number of films with Black stories at the forefront. </u></a>The challenge with science fiction is that when a genre that thrives on endless possibility, and struggles to recognise the value of including people of colour, those communities' critical issues go unheard. Never hearing from underrepresented communities can't lead to the kind of awareness that results in <a href="https://www.blood.co.uk/news-and-campaigns/news-and-statements/call-the-midwife-prompts-people-to-register-as-blood-donors/" target="_blank"><u>46 percent more people registering as new blood donors</u></a> because a show like <em>Call the Midwife </em>educated people on sickle cell disease.</p><p>This is where <em>Supacell</em> shines through, as its exploration of the sci-fi world from the viewpoint of marginalised communities fosters a broader societal dialogue. The title, <em>Supacell</em>, is a clever play on words, linking the word 'sickle cell' and its negative associations with a genetic blood disease that affects 17,000 people living in the UK to create characters with superpowers resulting from mutated genes linked to the sickle cell gene.&nbsp;</p><div id="related-video" class="mx-auto mt-8 mb-12 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans md:mt-12 md:mb-16 text-primary-400">

<p>In <em>Supacell</em>'s first episodes, we witness the characters unlocking their powers. Michael learns he can time travel when he is stabbed during a delivery job. Sabrina finds out about her telekinetic abilities after learning that her boyfriend is cheating on her. Tazer realises he has the gift of invisibility when lured into a trap by a rival gang. Rodney discovers that he can run like the Flash when he accidentally runs all the way to Scotland while trying to make it to a drug deal on time. Andre's super strength is revealed when he breaks an ATM in frustration over his financial struggles that make him unable to provide for his son. These powers are not just part of the plot but a reflection of the character's core essence, strengths, and struggles.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The series delves into various themes such as job insecurity for ex-convicts, poverty, the exploitation of Black bodies, being Black in predominantly white spaces, violence against women, and the pervasive inequality that impacts Black lives in every aspect. These themes add a layer of realism to the genre. If the characters can't afford to eat or, like Michael, can't save their loved ones, what's the point of having superpowers? This portrayal serves as a metaphor for the resilience of these communities in the face of adversity due to societal and institutional failings.</p><h2><em>Supacell </em>challenges stereotypes used to define Black lives</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p><em>Supacell</em> boldly confronts how societal failings have led to the stereotypes often used to define Black lives. It challenges the labels society may expect us to associate with certain characters, such as gang leaders, drug dealers, ex-convicts, angry Black women, and damsels in distress. Instead, it aims to shatter narrow portrayals of Black life shaped by these stereotypes by revealing the true depth of what lies underneath.</p><p>At first glance, Andre might seem like the typical absent father. However, as we learn more about his story, we understand that his absence wasn't a choice but a consequence of society failing him. This continues as he struggles to find employment due to his criminal record. The final episode reveals his vulnerability despite his super strength, highlighting that superpowers haven't solved his problems.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p><em>Supacell</em> also presents a striking contrast between Rodney and Tazer, both involved in selling drugs to make ends meet, both having turbulent home lives. Initially seen as comic relief as he tries to get by with his best friend, Spud (Giacomo Mancini), we learn that Rodney's involvement in dealing is a result of the racism he experiences at home. Despite his mother leading a comfortable life in a nice house with her partner, Rodney's mixed race background is a point of contention with his stepfather, leading him to leave home and find a means of income.&nbsp;</p><p>Contrastingly, the show tempts us to see Tazer as a hardened gang leader seeking to incite more bloodshed with rival gangs. However, when we witness his interactions at home with his grandmother and friends, our perception shifts, and we begin to empathise with him as a tragic figure haunted by abandonment issues related to his mother. The show strategically reveals details about the characters, and we later learn that Tazer's mother was the woman brutally killed in the show's opening scene, echoing the tragic real-life <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0xxgn82yv7o" target="_blank">killing of Black women</a>. Despite Tazer being initially unaware of this, his sense of abandonment and unknowing link to violence lets us understand how he was drawn into a life of crime under the influence of Krazy (Ghetts). <em>Supacell</em> presents this as a cycle resulting from societal structure, as illustrated when Andre's son, AJ (Ky-Mani Carty), becomes enticed by the same world simply by growing up in the area. The series refrains from romanticising gang leadership or violence and instead emphasises their devastating impact as a result of life circumstances.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

    </div>
<p>Additionally, Tazer's circle of friends further imbue his character with suppressed vulnerability. His friends are loyal, supportive, and unafraid to admit when they're scared, as Tiny (Akai Coleman) does when Tazer goes to visit him in the hospital after he's shot by Krazy. It's a moving scene. Tazer wants revenge, as is common in street culture, but his friend says, "You don&rsquo;t have to. Just keep coming to see me." Their aim isn't to be gang members but to succeed in a challenging environment where feeling safe is hard. Tazer's worst moments are led by emotion, driven by the fact that he loves deeply. It's why he is upset by his mum's absence and why he changes his mind about stabbing Michael a second time. It's with this <em>Supacell</em> allows us to understand the complexity behind the gang stereotypes.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>While the female characters do need more dimension in the show, they still play a significant role in <em>Supacell</em>&rsquo;s messaging. Despite appearances, Sabrina defies the angry Black woman stereotype by revealing herself rather as a woman disheartened by life. She&rsquo;s a Black woman with a tumultuous love life and she'll do anything to protect her supportive older sister Sharleen (Rayxia Ojo) who lacks support herself. Sabrina struggles to find success at her job not because she's not qualified but because it's harder to progress professionally as a Black woman. <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/businessreview/2021/03/03/black-women-are-missing-in-the-uks-top-1/" target="_blank"><u>Black women are 6.1 percentage points less likely than white women to be in the top 10 percent of income</u></a>. In this way, Sabrina begins to challenge this cliche as a woman who is, at her core, dealing with being underpaid, overworked, and seeking to protect those closest to her.

<p>Michael often treats Dionne as a damsel in distress, attempting to shield his fianc&eacute; from the knowledge that she dies in the near future. However, Dionne subverts this role by using her position as a social worker to actively investigate the disappearances of Black people that have been overlooked. Dionne's refusal to remain passive and her unwavering dedication to uncovering the reasons behind the disproportionate number of missing Black individuals is powerful. It reflects the alarming real-life situation in the UK, where <a href="https://www.port.ac.uk/news-events-and-blogs/blogs/democratic-citizenship/why-racial-bias-dominates-coverage-of-missing-person-cases" target="_blank">Black people often do not receive the same treatment and media coverage as their white counterparts</a>. It&rsquo;s a reminder that despite her impending peril, Dionne was never a damsel. Every choice she made with purpose.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Supacell </em>challenges the notion that Black British shows primarily dwell on the negative aspects of Black British life. Despite its flaws, the show's commitment to portraying the complexities of Black life in a leading role within a genre where Black individuals are frequently overlooked is a powerful message that urges us to move beyond initial judgments and stereotypes. Hopefully, other creators will take note of what Rapman has accomplished with<em> Supacell </em>and strive to achieve the same.</p><p><strong>How to watch: </strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/5Mb38?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Supacell%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Netflix.&object_type=article&object_uuid=07qh8DJz84rLfBCcVdsMP1o&short_url=5Mb38&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><em>Supacell</em> is now streaming on Netflix.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

But they're also going retro with three-minute speed dates in bars. They're even sitting down in front of a blank canvas with a glass of wine and trying to make conversation with strangers.</p><p>While these events vary widely, the attendees agreed on one thing: they were ready to try something &mdash; anything, really &mdash; to avoid one more online date. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/dating-predictions-rest-of-2024" target="_self"><u>Singles are sick of dating apps</u></a>, so they're turning to a growing number of offline events to find love.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>Dating app fatigue and frustration&nbsp;</h2><p>Though mobile dating apps have only been mainstream for a little over a decade &mdash; a mere blink in the long history of romance &mdash; their ubiquity in dating culture has left many singles feeling frustrated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps that's why the cracks in profitability are starting to show. Over the last three years, sales growth at Bumble has slowed<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-05-14/dating-apps-tinder-bumble-look-for-new-ways-to-find-and-keep-customers" target="_blank"> <u>from 31 percent in 2021 to only 9 percent today</u></a>. To say that Bumble's latest marketing push failed to reverse this trend is an understatement. The ad campaign included billboards with phrases like, "A vow of celibacy is not the answer." That unleashed palpable anger from women online that <a href="https://mashable.com/article/bumble-celibacy-ad-apology" target="_self"><u>prompted an apology from Bumble</u></a> this May. The same month,&nbsp; <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/ai-personas-are-future-dating-bumble-founder-says-many-arent-buying-rcna151738" target="_blank"><u>Bumble founder Whitney Wolfe Herd</u></a> painted an even more disturbing picture: a future where your AI avatar (trained to know your personality and preferences) will go on dates with someone else's avatar to determine your compatibility. Reactions online were <a href="https://x.com/MarioNawfal/status/1788869476819063046/quotes" target="_blank"><u>overwhelmingly negative</u></a>.</p><p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/tinder-bumble-hinge-are-collapsing-into-each-other" target="_self">Bumble previously told</a> Mashable, "We will stay relevant through our fundamental belief that by making the world better for women, we are making the world better for everyone, and that includes continuing to empower women in every aspect of their life."</p><p>Disaffection with the apps may also be attributed to new fees for previously free services. Although most have a free membership option, dating apps have basically dropped the pretense that this will lead to a love connection. Hinge, for example, has a new way to monetize love: only the highest tier membership (HingeX, available at $149.99 for 6 months as of publication) promises "access to your type." In other words, the Hinge algorithm has found the people with whom you would be most compatible. Without paying up, however, you'll only be allowed to access the less-than-ideal matches. If you use the basic model or Hinge+, you'll receive only one "rose" per week to contact your "standout" matches. If you want to reach out to more than one, it'll cost you about $1.50 for each additional person. Unless you're willing to shell out some cash, these magical, ideal partners sit in what TikTok users have dubbed "<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/Am-I-in-hinge-rose-jail?lang=en" target="_blank"><u>Rose Jail</u></a>." </p><p>"Hinge is intentionally designed with one goal: to help all daters find each other and get out on great dates. Every feature is designed to help daters be more intentional about who they are, who they like, and why they like them. Our free membership and cost-effective subscriptions offer daters one of the most valuable experiences in the industry," a Hinge spokesperson told Mashable. "Hinge's intentional app design makes it easier for daters to express themselves and more quickly connect with people they&rsquo;re compatible with through detailed profiles built around Prompts (short questions that allow people to showcase who they are). And it's working. Currently, we're setting up a date every two seconds."</p><p>An <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/68251429/29/oksayan-v-matchgroup-inc/" target="_blank"><u>ongoing lawsuit alleges that Match Group</u></a>, which owns Hinge, Tinder, and others, aims to turn users into "addicts" instead of helping them find a love match.</p><h2>The surge of IRL dating events</h2><p>With so much dating app dissatisfaction,&nbsp; it's no wonder that people are looking for alternatives &mdash; and event planners are responding with creativity. Mackenzie Zoppi and Stephanie Scheele, for example, created LA Singles Only Social Club (or LA SOSO CLUB) after hearing about their friends' dating app fatigue. People weren't meeting suitable partners, were getting tired of trying, and the pandemic had only heightened their loneliness.<br><br>Scheele and Zoppi partner with local brands to throw mixers, organize speed dating, and host events like happy hours, beach tennis tournaments, or backgammon nights. Before long, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/exclusive-dating-apps-raya-the-league-lox-club" target="_self"><u>"exclusive" dating app</u></a> The League started sharing SOSO events with members; that's when they knew they were really onto something. The League "knew that people wanted in-person meetups, but they didn't have the bandwidth to host them," said Zoppi. After operating for one year, SOSO Club already boasts five committed relationships and countless first dates that have resulted from their soirees.&nbsp;</p><p>Megan Weks, a dating and relationship coach, sees the rise of in-person dating options as a signal that the culture around dating is changing. "There is so much hope for commitment-minded singles, as motivated entrepreneurs are inspired to create opportunities for single people to meet the one," she said. Unfortunately, online dating has lessened our collective comfort with striking up conversations. "People are shy, unskilled, and even afraid of approaching others in real life."</p><p>Mike Falzone, creator of the aforementioned Human Romance comedy show, noticed that viewers of his advice-driven YouTube channel often asked about dating (or even about making friends as adults). Like Weks, he's seen how people are hesitant to startsingl IRL conversations. "We're all so insular now," he said. "The pandemic has made people unable to communicate with each other."&nbsp;</p><p>Falzone's solution? A comedy show where three comedians interview audience members, match the ones who seem compatible, and then watch them go on a ten-minute date, live on stage. "Comedians can read people," Falzone said, and their ability to assess an audience via "crowdwork" gives them insight into who might have a spark.</p><p>The show's crowd skewed towards single women in their late 20s, many of whom said that they were, "unfortunately," using dating apps. Eleni*, a 28-year-old architect, said of digital dating, "In the beginning it's kind of fun and exciting, but after a while you're like, 'I could just be out with my friends right now. Why am I here with this man?'" Neither Eleni nor her friend Meghan (a 29-year-old content creator) had attended any singles events before. Bri, 28, a retired athlete-turned-data analytics student, likes that dating apps provide a way to meet people. But she said "the desperation to find companionship," both from herself and from others, made things uncomfortable.</p><p>Bri was picked out of the crowd and paired with Bridget, a 29-year-old TV production secretary. During the show, Falzone and his fellow hosts Rachel Scanlon and Luke Mones posed such questions as, "If you went on a road trip, who would drive and who would handle the aux cord?" (Bridget prefers to take the wheel, so Bri would be happy to DJ.) "If this were a real date, who would be paying?" (Bri would definitely pay, but she'd be annoyed if Bridget didn't try to fight for the check.) </p><p>Based on audience applause, Bri and Bridget won the prize for best couple &mdash; $50 out of Falzone's own pocket to pay for their second date. Undeterred by the distance between them (Bri lives in Riverside, an hour-and-a-half drive from Bridget's place in central LA), the two were excited to have a real meet-up. "We've exchanged Instagrams, and&hellip; We'll see what happens," said Bridget with a flirtatious smile.</p><h2>My journey into the jungle of offline dating events</h2><p>Fueled by my own app burnout, I unsubscribed from Hinge+ a few months ago and decided to spend my money on in-person events. The first was an LA SOSO cold plunge singles mixer in Venice Beach. Perhaps I shouldn't have been surprised to see that most of the attendees, who'd shown up in bathing suits and flitted from ice cold baths to saunas and sweat lodges, seemed inhumanly fit and gorgeous. I had great conversations with many of the women, but my "average"-to-"curvy" body seemed to prevent me from even registering as female on the radars of these muscled SoCal Adonises. I chatted with a lot of them, but none asked for my number.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>I had more luck at speed dating, where I made a few connections. Maybe it was because the hopeful romantics at these events seemed a bit sheepish about trying this twentieth-century dating method, but found strength in numbers. The men and women I met at CitySwoon's algorithm-based speed dating night (you receive texts telling you which of the attendees you should talk to next based on compatibility) shared a sense of vulnerability and openness &mdash; after all, we were all there for the same reason. Many of the people I spoke to said speed dating seemed more "humane" than swiping on an app.&nbsp;</p><p>A singles Paint and Sip event, organized by event space and podcast studio BSPOKE/LA, wine brand Besa Mi Vino, and app First Round's On Me, drew a crowd, but many of the attendees weren't aware the event was directed at singles at all. Teresa, a 29-year-old production manager, is in a relationship, but thought the Paint and Sip would be a good way to make friends. Selena Sevenler and Natalie Drelles, creative director and assistant creative director of BSPOKE/LA respectively, agreed that people are starved for connection, both romantic and platonic. "All we want is to make sure that the people around us actually have a heartbeat," said Drelles, who added that online communities feel disconnected from reality.</p><p>First Round's On Me (FROME) is a dating app, but it's one that encourages users to get together in-person by giving them only one match per day and 12 hours to plan a date with them. (The concept is not too dissimilar from HowAboutWe, a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/dating-apps-defunct" target="_self"><u>now-defunct dating app</u></a> that emphasized meet-ups.) The 22-year-old painting instructor, Fredo Gillis, said that he'd noticed people coming solo to Paint and Sips that he'd facilitated before. It seemed like a natural "collaborative, social singles event." (Fredo is single and has Tinder, but said he meets most of his potential partners at modeling casting calls.) Besa Mi Vino head of events Jessie Goodall, who also works part time for FROME, wasn't surprised that all the painters were laughing and joking about their painting skills (or lack thereof.) "All it really takes is something to break the ice," she said.&nbsp;</p><p>Shockingly, I turned out to be one of the only straight single women at the FROME Paint and Sip. I left with a mediocre painting of an LA skyline, Instagram accounts of two cute guys, and budding friendships with other artistically-challenged women.</p><p>When it comes to choosing events, Weks said that the hardest part can be making sure they attract potential partners who meet your qualifications. She advised daters to look for event companies that are a little more niche, rather than casting a wide net. "Whether it's people who value their careers, have a certain level of success, or love dogs, you'll save time by attending events that match your interests." If you get stuck in a conversation you're not enjoying, Weks also reminded us that, "It's okay to gently excuse yourself. You can always pick up the conversation later or let them approach you again if they are motivated."&nbsp;</p><p>If you're afraid of approaching strangers in-person, Weks said it might help to <em>not </em>focus too much on romantic potential at the beginning of an interaction. "The basis of flirting can stem from genuine curiosity about others," she said. "Cultivate the habit of growing curiosity about others and practice chit-chatting for no other reason than to express curiosity or create a shared feel-good moment."&nbsp;</p><p>As for me, I haven't deleted "the apps," but meeting people in the wild felt like a nice change from mindless (and fruitless) swiping. Only time will tell if this trend will last, or if our Whitney Wolfe Herd AI avatars will soon be handling all our dating for us in the Metaverse. For now, I'll probably just skip the events that require bathing suits.&nbsp;</p><p><em>* Daters requested to go by their first-names only for privacy reasons.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><em>Aggretsuko</em> is a down-to-earth anime that primarily takes place in an office and follows the life of Retsuko, an unassuming twentysomething red panda, who has to deal with a shitty boss, navigate relationships with coworkers, and let off steam by growling to death metal songs at karaoke bars.

<p>A remixed anime version of Bryan Lee O'Malley's beloved graphic novels that brings back the actors from Edgar Wright's 2010 live-action adaptation <em>Scott Pilgrim vs. the World</em> to voice a totally different series of adventures for Scott, Knives, and Ramona with her league of evil exes? <a href="https://mashable.com/article/scott-pilgrim-takes-off-review" target="_self"><u>Heck yes, please</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The first episode of the eight episode series &mdash;&nbsp;co-run and co-written with O'Malley's <em>Are You Afraid of the Dark?</em> partner BenDavid Grabinski &mdash; follows closely in the movie's footsteps. Dopey ne'er-do-well Scott Pilgrim falls for dream delivery girl Ramona Flowers, only to find out he must fight her seven former partners to the death in order to win her heart. But by that first episode's surprising end, you'll see that this series has a very different story to tell.&nbsp;</p><p>With the superstar bunch of Michael Cera, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Chris Evans, Aubrey Plaza, Anna Kendrick, Brie Larson, Mae Whitman, Jason Schwartzman, Kieran Culkin, Alison Pill, and Ellen Wong all back on hand, this whole thing lands like a dream.

<p>The character of "Astro Boy," whose history stretches back into the 1950s, is iconic enough to be familiar to people who've never read a manga in their lives. He's basically the Mickey Mouse of manga. So when legendary artist Naoki Urasawa teamed up with the grandson of Astro Boy's creator to craft an updated story for the character in the aughts, it was kind of a big deal. So big a deal, it took another decade and a half for them to translate that manga, which was titled <em>Pluto</em>, into an anime series. </p><p>The futuristic world of <em>Pluto</em> is one of happy coexistence between humans and robots &mdash; until a serial killer comes along and starts murdering the world's top robots one by one, that is. As we tag along with a robot detective named Gesicht, we meet the next victim-to-be on the killer's list: a boy robot named Atom, who's incredibly powerful but in danger all the same. What follows from there in<em> Pluto</em>'s eight hour-long episodes is one of the great reworkings of an iconic character, told with true emotional depth and no shortage of astonishing visuals. <em>&mdash; J.A.</em></p><p><strong>How to watch:</strong> <a href="https://zdcs.link/KJB2n?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Pluto%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Netflix.&object_type=article&object_uuid=01QYiRsRUVRTiAOhKXvRz2h&short_url=KJB2n&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><em><u>Pluto</u></em><u> is now streaming on Netflix</u>.</a></p><h2><strong>8.<em> Neon Genesis Evangelion</em></strong></h2><p>One of the greatest and most influential anime series of all time, <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion </em>is wildly ambitious, emotionally complex, and beautifully animated.

<p><em>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</em> is an off-the-wall series full of ridiculous characters, beefy dudes, wild plotlines, and bright colors. The series follows various members of the Joestar family as they go on their individual, supernatural journeys, make friends, and ultimately defeat over-the-top villains.

Think David Cronenberg's film <em>The Brood,</em> only instead of deformed rage babies who wear snowsuits and kill people, these curses are spiritual beings, a la ghosts and demons, called Noroi, which translates straight to "Curses." The curses will attach themselves to people and do what curses do &mdash; fuck shit up. To battle these Curses, there are Sorcerers &mdash; people who, unlike most humans, can channel their "Curse Energy" to fight the monsters.&nbsp;</p><p>The lead character is a high school kid and sorcerer-in-training named Yuji Itadori, who becomes host to one of the scariest curses around by, uhh, eating a cursed finger. (If you ask me, Yuji had it coming. Who eats a finger?) Anyway the cursed finger belonged to Ryomen Sukuna, an ancient sorcerer known as the greatest who ever lived, who went on to become King of the Curses himself &mdash; dude never did anything halfway.

<p>LeSean Thomas'&nbsp;miniseries&nbsp;follows the life and legend of its title character, a Black samurai who served daimy&#333; Oda Nobunaga. Years after Nobunaga's death, Yasuke lives as Yassan, a boatsman who shuttles villagers along the water and speaks little of his past. But a young girl with awesome power undoes Yassan&rsquo;s quiet life and alias, thrusting him back into a world of warriors, magic and more. The show blends together sci-fi, fantasy, and history as only anime can, with LaKeith Stanfield at the mic bringing Yasuke sublimely to life. &mdash; <em>Proma Khosla, Entertainment Reporter</em></p><p><strong>How to watch:</strong> <a href="https://zdcs.link/vW117?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Yasuke&object_type=article&object_uuid=01QYiRsRUVRTiAOhKXvRz2h&short_url=vW117&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><em>Yasuke</em></a><a href="https://zdcs.link/vW117?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Netflix.&object_type=article&object_uuid=01QYiRsRUVRTiAOhKXvRz2h&short_url=vW117&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"> is now streaming on Netflix.</a></p><h2><strong>13. <em>One Piece</em></strong></h2><p>Looking for adventure on the high seas? <em>One Piece </em>is the anime for you.

It tells the story of a genius surgeon named Dr. Kenzo Tenma who makes the mistake of saving a child's life.&nbsp;</p><p>Not something that's usually a mistake, right? Well, this show is basically an inverse of that old moral quandary, "Would you go back in time to kill baby Hitler?" Because the kid that the good doc saves grows up to be a world-class sociopath named Johan. (And yes, Johan is German and blond, and eugenics is an explicit part of the plot. So the Hitler reference isn't out of nowhere.)&nbsp;</p><p>The series follows Doc Kenzo for a full 74 episodes of hunting down Johan via the madman's ever-widening trail of destruction&nbsp;&mdash; 74 half-hour episodes that originally aired between 2004 and 2005, an extraordinary output that makes every other series on television seem awfully lazy.&nbsp;But this doesn't make the series doesn't feel rushed.

<p>A sweet fable about two maintenance robots in a humanless future who accidentally wake a human child named Sara Grace out of stasis. (Turns out there are humans, but they're all crated up for the time being.) And since their robot overlords don't look kindly upon humans (indeed, they're considering letting all of sleeping humanity go extinct), the two robots take the little girl out into the countryside to raise her safely.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Eden</em> is just four 25-minute episodes long, following Sarah Grace to her teen years, where she begins to explore and uncover her place in the world &mdash; not just her own, but all of humanity's. As teenagers are prone to do. Still, Sarah Grace's is a special case, you could say, and <em>Eden</em> probes at it with lovely (and gorgeously animated) curiosity. <em>&mdash; J.A.</em></p><p><strong>How to watch:</strong> <a href="https://zdcs.link/MVnpq?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Eden%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Netflix.&object_type=article&object_uuid=01QYiRsRUVRTiAOhKXvRz2h&short_url=MVnpq&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><em><u>Eden</u></em><u> is now streaming on Netflix</u>.</a></p><h2><strong>16. <em>7SEEDS</em></strong></h2><p>Similar to <em>Eden</em>, <em>7SEEDS</em> is also about human beings being awoken from suspended animation into a distant future that's nothing like the one they came from. But this is the not-so-friendly version. In the before times, a meteorite is headed straight for Earth, so a group of Japanese scientists cryogenically freeze five pods of seven people (who notably aren't told what's happening to them beforehand). Each group is named after a season (with a Summer A and a Summer B) and scattered out to different areas of Japan. A computer is set to wake them up when it measures the world fit for human life again.&nbsp;</p><p>When that fateful moment does arrive, our survivors (including a shy girl named Natsu who is basically our main character) stumble out into a world that has changed greatly. Not just the landscape, which has been altered drastically by climate change, but the lifeforms that survived the meteorite evolved and mutated in all kinds of terrifying ways. There are giant lizards reminiscent of velociraptors, swarms of carnivorous white cockroaches, and beetles the size of boats among the many horrors our humans encounter. Basically it's <em>Land of the Lost </em>but way yuckier.

<p>Grindhouse trash to be sure, but grindhouse trash that is great fun and super ridiculous, <em>High-Rise Invasion</em> is about a schoolgirl named Yuri Honjo who finds herself suddenly transported into a surreal world of mile-high rooftops connected by rope bridges where she's hunted by masked killers. Vacillating wildly between helplessness and being a savage gun-toting maniac, Yuri's character makes very little sense. But she eventually gets a girlfriend named Mayuko and the series becomes about two lesbians graphically murdering pervy dudes, and I can find no wrong with that. Oh, and it's also about this death game that they've been forced into playing about the creation of God? It's way weird, y'all. <em>&mdash; J.A.</em></p><p><strong>How to watch:</strong> <a href="https://zdcs.link/8BWj7?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=High-Rise%20Invasion%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Netflix.&object_type=article&object_uuid=01QYiRsRUVRTiAOhKXvRz2h&short_url=8BWj7&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><em><u>High-Rise Invasion</u></em><u> is now streaming on Netflix</u>.</a></p><h2><strong>18. <em>Mononoke</em></strong></h2><p>With a stunningly singular animation style that looks like classical Edo-era art filtered through <em>Aeon Flux</em>, <em>Mononoke</em> tells the tale of a nameless medicine man who every episode hunts down and fights a different "mononoke" &mdash; unnatural spirits that attach themselves to and feed off of bad vibes, basically. Our main character rolls into town, figures out what the baddie is, and how to fight them. It's a standalone series; think <em>Murder She Wrote</em> with monsters.</p><p>As a spin-off of the previous series, <em>Ayakashi: Samurai Horror Tales</em>, <em>Mononoke</em> and its many demons often make for a very scary show, with the true strangeness of the animation only making its mood feel even more surreal.

Miyamoto is based on Japan's most legendary movie star, Toshiro Mifune (of <em>Rashomon, Seven Samurai, Throne of Blood, The Hidden Fortress, Yojimbo,</em> etc.), which means that Miyamoto is hella hot. You know. For an animated character. Anyway, that's reason enough right there to watch. It's why I have watched every season of <em>Archer</em>!</p><p>In all seriousness, the show, which is based on the old 2001 Capcom video game of the same name, blends 2D animation with computer graphics in a spectacular fashion, making the many fights truly something wondrous to behold. And it's got a surprising amount of heart, as our sexy hero wields a weapon called the Oni Gauntlet, which eats some of his soul every time he uses it. He's basically destroying himself to save the world. And he's doing it while looking like Toshiro Mifune!

<p>If you dug the vibe of the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/sherlock-s4-finale" target="_self">2010 </a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/sherlock-s4-finale" target="_self"><em>Sherlock</em></a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/sherlock-s4-finale" target="_self"> series with Benedict Cumberbatch</a>, then <em>Akuma Kun </em>might just be the anime for you. It's about a boy genius named Akuma Kun and his sidekick, a half-demon named Mephisto, solving paranormal mysteries. Akuma Kun has no social skills and seems very much on the spectrum in the way he sorts out the world, while Mephisto is the friendlier, funnier Martin Freeman type of the pair.&nbsp;</p><p>Far less interested in big battle sequences than most anime tends to be, this series is more concerned with wading through philosophical puzzles. Akuma Kun and Mephisto spend a lot time wittily debating their at-odds instincts as they solve each episode's riddle. And that, along with the fine hand-drawn animation, really makes this series (which is technically a sequel to a 1989 series of the same name) stand out from the pack. <em>&mdash; J.A.</em></p><p><strong>How to watch</strong>: <a href="https://zdcs.link/vdomx?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Akuma%20Kun%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Netflix.&object_type=article&object_uuid=01QYiRsRUVRTiAOhKXvRz2h&short_url=vdomx&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><em><u>Akuma Kun</u></em><u> is now streaming on Netflix</u>.</a></p><p><em>Asterisks (*) indicate the entry is slightly modified from a previous Mashable list.</em></p><p class="mx-auto">

The game is all about finding the "common threads between words." And just like <em>Wordle</em>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-20-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> resets after midnight and each new set of words gets trickier and trickier&mdash;so we've served up some hints and tips to get you over the hurdle.</p><p>If you just want to be told today's puzzle, you can jump to the end of this article for July 1's <em>Connections</em> solution. But if you'd rather solve it yourself, keep reading for some clues, tips, and strategies to assist you.</p><h2><strong>What is <em>Connections</em>?</strong></h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

      <guid isPermaLink="false">00NmVBhgcQDEr65HxIvyiTu</guid>
      <pubDate>Fri, 05 Jul 2024 21:27:20 +0000</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[Be prepared to see X's AI chatbot on the social media platform a lot more with these upcoming features.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00NmVBhgcQDEr65HxIvyiTu/hero-image.jpg" alt="X's Grok and Elon Musk's X profile"><p>X, formerly known as Twitter, is looking to integrate its <a href="https://mashable.com/article/elon-musk-x-twitter-ai-chatbot-grok-fake-news-trending-explore" target="_self"><u>flawed</u></a> AI chatbot even more deeply into the platform.</p><p>App researcher Nima Owji has recently uncovered code written within the X website that shows the company's upcoming plans for its AI chatbot Grok. While the features haven't publicly launched yet, Owji's discovery gives users a sneak peek into how much Elon Musk is looking to depend on AI for his social media platform.</p><p>It's important to note that these upcoming Grok-related features will likely be paywalled, similar to how Grok AI is currently structured. While users originally needed to pay for the $16 per month Premium+ plan, X has since rolled Grok out to those paying for the $8 X Premium plan.</p><h2><strong>X's upcoming Grok features</strong></h2><p>According to Owji's findings, X is planning to launch at least three new features across the platform that are powered by Grok.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <a class="text-gray-600" href="https://twitter.com/nima_owji/status/1809258214468317279" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(opens in a new window)">

    </a>
</blockquote>
<p>X will reportedly allow X Premium and Premium+ subscribers to highlight text on the platform &mdash; and then ask Grok about the selection via a pop-up without needing to head off the page. Owji found code in X which deploys an "Ask Grok" prompt <a href="https://x.com/nima_owji/status/1809258214468317279" target="_blank"><u>pop-up message</u></a> when text is highlighted.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <a class="text-gray-600" href="https://twitter.com/nima_owji/status/1809260460945944742" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(opens in a new window)">
        Tweet may have been deleted
    </a>
</blockquote>
<p>Another upcoming X feature that lets users access Grok without moving off-page is the "More about this account" <a href="https://x.com/nima_owji/status/1809260460945944742" target="_blank"><u>prompt</u></a>. Based on Owji's research, it appears X will soon let paying users ask Grok for background information about a specific X account via a Grok button that appears on an X user's profile card.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <a class="text-gray-600" href="https://twitter.com/nima_owji/status/1809261891128107020" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(opens in a new window)">
        Tweet may have been deleted
    </a>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a clear pattern here where X is trying to promote Grok use throughout the entire social media platform &ndash; and this final recently discovered upcoming feature makes that fully possible. X is looking to allow its subscribers to access Grok anywhere on X via a "<a href="https://x.com/nima_owji/status/1809261891128107020" target="_blank"><u>Grok drawer</u></a>." This basically enables an AI chatbot window to float over the X platform and remain accessible &mdash; no matter where the user goes on the site.</p><p>Grok is the first product from Musk's AI company xAI, which recently <a href="https://mashable.com/article/elon-musk-xai-6-billion" target="_self"><u>raised</u></a> billions of dollars. Musk has been looking to prioritize his entrance into the AI race and Grok's deep integration into X at the AI chatbot's launch gave it a built-in user base.</p><h2><strong>Grok's stumbles</strong></h2><p>However, Grok has had its struggles.&nbsp;</p><p>In April, X relaunched its Explore tab and made the feature dependent on Grok, which now creates news headlines and summaries based on what's trending on the platform. As Mashable previously reported, Musk's AI chatbot has already spread dangerous misinformation such as creating a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/elon-musk-x-twitter-ai-chatbot-grok-fake-news-trending-explore" target="_self"><u>fake news story</u></a> about Iran striking Tel Aviv, Israel with missiles. In another example of Grok's failings, the AI chatbot took <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/grok-is-making-up-fake-news-on-x" target="_blank"><u>jokes</u></a> posted by users on X and created a fake story about the NYPD being sent into NYC subways to have a "showdown" with an earthquake.&nbsp;</p><p>That same month, <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/04/12/elon-musk-grok-ai-x-premium-users/" target="_blank"><em><u>Fortune</u></em></a> reported that Musk was actually looking to further integrate Grok throughout X, going as far as wanting the AI chatbot to <a href="https://mashable.com/article/x-twitter-elon-musk-grok-ai-generated-user-tweets" target="_self"><u>create posts</u></a> for users. So, while these three upcoming Grok features aren't quite that, it's clear that X is going forward with pushing Grok onto users all throughout the platform.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>Ahead of Prime Day's official start, the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II are sitting at an all-time low of $169.95 (reg. $279) at Amazon. These buds feature a completely personalizable ANC experience, which intelligently adjusts noise cancellation and sound performance based on your environment. They come with three sets of ear tips and stability bands for a comfortable listening experience and last up to six hours on one charge (24 with help from the charging case). While we haven't had a chance to review the newest installment (we <a href="https://mashable.com/review/bose-quiet-comfort-earbuds-review" target="_self">reviewed the original QuietComfort Earbuds</a> and mostly loved them), our friends at PCMag (which is owned by Mashable's publisher, Ziff Davis) have and they were big fans &mdash; honoring them with a 4.5-star rating and an <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/bose-quietcomfort-earbuds-ii" target="_blank">Editor's Choice award</a>.</p><h2>Apple earbuds early Prime Day deals</h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/vdo70?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Beats%20Flex&object_type=article&object_uuid=07vKWUZrNEH342LLlztIZR8&short_url=vdo70&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Beats Flex</a> &mdash;

      <description><![CDATA[Hackers now have a record-breaking database of nearly 10 billion leaked passwords at their disposal.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01WRDz2sMpVsOvPLk3Ex14c/hero-image.jpg" alt="Login screen"><p>Cybersecurity researchers are calling it the largest password compilation leak of all time.</p><p>On July 4, a newly registered user on a popular hacking forum posted a file containing nearly 10 billion compromised passwords in plaintext. The post was first noticed by researchers at <a href="https://cybernews.com/security/rockyou2024-largest-password-compilation-leak/" target="_blank"><u>Cybernews</u></a>.</p><p>"Xmas came early this year," user "ObamaCare" wrote on the forum. "I present to you a new rockyou2024 password list with over 9.9 billion passwords!"</p><h2><strong>RockYou2024 leaked password compilation</strong></h2><p>This gigantic list of leaked passwords known as RockYou2024 provides hackers with an important tool that can be utilized in a brute force attack.&nbsp;</p><p>A brute force attack is a popular hacking method where the attacker guesses a user's password by trial-and-error. Hackers commonly use automated scripts when carrying out a brute force attack, which enables them to try out a slew of passwords within a short period of time. With a leaked password database this big, hackers have a nearly unlimited pool of passwords to try out.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;In its essence, the RockYou2024 leak is a compilation of real-world passwords used by individuals all over the world," writes Cybernews' researchers. "Revealing that many passwords for threat actors substantially heightens the risk of credential stuffing attacks."</p><p>As Cybernews researchers point out, this list may very well be the largest password leak ever, beating the previous record holder known as RockYou2021, which had around 8.4 billion passwords.</p><p>In fact, the hacker forum user "ObamaCare" claims they used that older list and updated it with newer password leak data from over the past three years. As a result, 1.5 billion more passwords have been added to the previous compilation to create RockYou2024.</p><p>"I updated rockyou21 with collected new data from recent leaked databases in various forums over this and last years," wrote the hacker forum user while adding that they also included recent compromised passwords that they recently obtained themself.</p><p>The RockYou2024 leaked password list is new, so at the time of this writing, it's unclear if any private data has been compromised as a direct result of this compilation.</p><p>Anyone signed up to any service online should assume that a password that they use is on this list. Cybersecurity researchers recommend that users update their passwords and enable multi-factor authentication wherever possible.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The current-generation iPad mini debuted in 2021 &mdash; and Apple hasn't upgraded it since.</p><p>However, rumor has it that the Cupertino-based tech giant plans to unleash a new iPad mini this year, as well as the 11th-generation iPad, according to <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2386713/apple-backend-code-ipad-identifiers-pro-mini-base-model.html" target="_blank">MacRumors</a>. And Nicol&aacute;s &Aacute;lvarez on X discovered some clues about gen-over-gen upgrades due to a reference in Apple's backend code (h/t <a href="https://x.com/aaronp613/status/1808680380129595896" target="_blank">@aaronp613</a>).</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2><strong>iPad mini 2024: Expected new upgrades</strong></h2><p>Apple dropped the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-ipad-air-2024" target="_self">iPad Air</a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-ipad-pro-13-inch-2024" target="_self">iPad Pro</a> (the thinnest product the Cupertino-based tech giant launched), and now the company is focusing on two new iPads: iPad mini 7 and the 11th-gen iPad.</p><p>According to &Aacute;lvarez's findings, the iPad mini 7 is set to sport an A17 chip. It's unclear whether it will be the A17 Pro processor found in the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-review" target="_self">iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro models</a>, but if it is, MacRumors claims that it may run <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-intelligence-ai-siri-wwdc-2024" target="_self">Apple Intelligence</a>.</p><p>The 11th-gen iPad, however, will reportedly sport an A16 processor, a step up from the A14 Bionic chip packed inside the current 10th-gen model.</p><h2><strong>Did Apple initially plan to launch an M3 iPad Pro?</strong></h2><p>&Aacute;lvarez's discovery revealed that Apple reportedly planned on unleashing an M3 iPad Pro this year &mdash; not the M4 iPad Pro. The previous iPad Pro featured an M2 chip, so naturally, we expected an M3 iPad Pro.</p><p>Instead, Apple surprised the tech world, leap-frogged the M3 chip, and debuted the M4 iPad Pro. As it turns out, the Cupertino-based giant allegedly planned on unleashing an M3 iPad Pro <em>initially, </em>but it appears that Apple made a last-minute shift of plans.</p><p>Finally, &Aacute;lvarez claims that we should expect an M5 iPad Pro some time next year or early 2026.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Deemed the "<a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-blenders" target="_self">best cooking blender</a>" upon testing, the Breville Super Q Blender has a lot to love about it. From its sleek brushed stainless steel design to its host of innovative features, you can expect exceptional results. Other pros include its quiet operation, intuitive control panel with various settings, and its powerful 1,800-watt motor. It's pretty dang expensive at $550, but as of July 5, you can grab it for only $399.95 in select colors &mdash; that's its <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0CDM1ZRZ4" target="_blank">lowest price on record</a>.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>Just 99 cents shy of its <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0CM5JLWJK" target="_blank">all-time low price</a> at Amazon, the base model 2023 MacBook Pro (which includes 8GB RAM and 512GB of storage) is on sale for just $1,399.99 with an on-page coupon. It looks and feels like the MacBook Pro you know and love, but inside it's packed with the crazy fast M3 chip. Apple claims the M3 chip is up to 15 percent faster than the previous M2 chip, but we actually <a href="https://mashable.com/review/m3-14-inch-macbook-pro" target="_self">found it to be even faster</a> than that in our testing. Our reviewer was also blown away by its battery life and "divine" built-in speakers. </p><p><a href="https://mashable.com/review/m3-14-inch-macbook-pro" target="_self"><em>Read our full review of the M3 MacBook Pro</em></a>.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>Investing in <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-bluetooth-trackers" target="_self">Bluetooth trackers</a> can help you keep track of your luggage on all of your summer travels. And if you're an iPhone user, we'd highly recommend Apple's <a href="https://mashable.com/article/what-is-an-airtag" target="_self">AirTags</a>. AirTags calibrate their locations as long as there's an Apple device with Find My nearby, instead of relying on a Bluetooth range. That's what makes them such a great choice for locating lost luggage. Typically, a single AirTag costs $29, which means it would cost $116 to buy four separately. This four-pack deal is just $79.99, which essentially gets you 1.25 for free.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>Our <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dyson-airwrap-dupes" target="_self">favorite Dyson Airwrap dupe</a>, the Shark FlexStyle, is back on sale at Amazon as of July 5. This deal includes the auto-wrap curlers, a styling concentrator, an oval brush, and a paddle brush, making it a mix of the curly system and straight system accessories. In testing of the FlexStyle, Mashable Shopping Reporter Bethany Allard found that it offered a nearly one-to-one experience with the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/dyson-airwrap-versus-shark-flexstyle" target="_self">Airwrap</a>, nothing that she couldn't imagine a reason why you'd choose Dyson's more expensive option instead. Regularly $299.99, this air styling and drying system is on sale for $249.97.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>If you're jealous of your friend's fancy Dyson stick vacuum, you can get yourself a similar style device on a budget by opting for the Samsung Jet 60 Pet. It offers that sleek, slim aesthetic with an impressive amount of power and an even more impressive price tag. The Jet Cyclone technology operates similarly to Dyson's, keeping dust and debris from clogging up the filter. Plus, it's extremely light and easy to maneuver at only five pounds. It's usually $329, but you can save 40% as of July 5 and snag it for just $199 at Amazon.</p><p><em>None of these deals catching your eye?

<p>As of today, July 5, KitchenAid has lowered its prices on stand mixers, attachments, and other kitchen equipment for a limited time at Amazon. While none of today's deals are the lowest KitchenAid prices we've ever seen, today's price drops still shave a noteworthy chunk of change off the premium kitchenware's prices. </p><h2>Best stand mixer deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

Thankfully, the process is really easy.

<h2>Why we like it</h2><p>Any time you can get a new Fire Tablet for under $100 is a good day. This Fire HD 10 is fully kitted out with the maximum amount of storage, and features great performance even though it's not the latest generation model. It's also got a 13-hour battery life and a 5MP front-facing camera. Pick one up ahead of Prime Day and score $95 in savings &mdash; it's just $84.99.</p><h2>More early Prime Day Fire Tablet deals</h2><p><strong>Fire Tablets</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/qkn10?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Amazon%20Fire%20HD%208%20tablet%20%2864GB%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=01UdMGsaqNG2TLyJS38R8gM&short_url=qkn10&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Amazon Fire HD 8 tablet (64GB)</a> &mdash;

The cybercriminal allegedly swiped sensitive information from a discussion forum where employees chatted about the company's latest models.</p><p><em>The New York Times </em>was hush-hush about the source of this news, claiming that "two people familiar with the incident" spilled the beans. However, they maintain that the cybercriminal only breached the forum &mdash; not the core systems that power OpenAI's AI algorithms and framework.</p><p>OpenAI reportedly revealed the hack to employees during an all-hands meeting in April 2023. It also informed the board of directors. However, OpenAI executives decided against sharing the news publicly.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2><strong>Why did OpenAI keep the breach under wraps?</strong></h2><p>According to <em>The New York Times</em>, OpenAI didn't reveal the hack to the public because information about customers was <em>not </em>stolen. </p><p>The company also did not share the breach with the FBI or any other law enforcement entities.</p><p>"The executives did not consider the incident a threat to national security because they believed the hacker was a private individual with no known ties to a foreign government," the newspaper said.</p><p><em>The New York Times' </em>sources say that some OpenAI employees expressed fear that China-based adversaries could steal the company's AI secrets, causing a threat to U.S. national security. </p><p>Leopold Aschenbrenner, leader of OpenAI's superalignment team (a unit focused on ensuring that AI doesn't get out of control) at the time, reportedly shared the same sentiments about the lax security and being an easy target for foreign enemies.</p><p>Aschenbrenner said <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/former-openai-researcher-leopold-aschenbrenner-interview-firing-2024-6" target="_blank">he was fired early this year</a> for sharing an internal document with three external researchers for "feedback." He insinuates his firing was unfair; he scanned the document for any sensitive information, adding that it's normal for OpenAI employees to reach out to other experts for a second opinion.</p><p>However, <em>The New York Times </em>points out that studies conducted by Anthropic and OpenAI reveal that AI "is not significantly more dangerous" than search engines like Google.</p><p>Still, AI companies should ensure that their security is tight. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/10/technology/california-ai-regulation.html" target="_blank">Legislators are pushing for regulations</a> that slap hefty fines on companies with AI technologies that cause societal harm.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Otherwise, having a WiFi connection will let you use them, but that means hotspotting your phone if you're on the road.</p><p>We don't know exactly when the update will be rolled out to all Tesla owners, and at present Not a Tesla App records zero percent of cars updated with it. But kids, your days of unbridled acceleration are numbered.</p>]]></content:encoded>

It's a relief it wasn't a bigger hit, or else it might have done for forest trails what Spielberg's <em>Jaws</em> <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/steven-spielberg-regrets-how-jaws-impacted-real-world-sharks-180981335/" target="_blank"><u>once did for sharks</u></a>.

<p>The film's use of POV has been much-discussed, but its ending is equally strange and subversive, adding a unique exclamation point to the whole affair. <em>In A Violent Nature</em>, through its genre deconstructions and surprisingly considered visual approach, nestles a story of &mdash; as its title suggests &mdash; the nature of violence, both as a human impulse and as a catalyst for horror cinema. All of this leads to a quiet crescendo, in the form of an unbearably tense vice grip that never yields, even once the credits have rolled.</p><h2>Here's Johnny: <em>In A Violent Nature</em>'s instantly-iconic killer</h2><p>Slasher movies live or die based on their central killers. While more recent mainstays like Jigsaw and Ghostface (from the <em>Saw</em> and <em>Scream</em> movies, respectively) have an intellect bent with complex motives (relatively speaking), classic villains like <em>Friday the 13th</em>'s Jason Voorhees, <em>Halloween</em>'s Michael Meyers, and <em>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</em>'s Leatherface embody a sense of unstoppable malice.</p><p>Johnny from <em>In A Violent Nature</em> belongs to that latter group, beginning with his emergence from being buried beneath the ground &mdash; a rebirth into what is eventually revealed to be a vicious cycle of killings &mdash; and because he seems instinctively driven to slash his way through the Ontario wilderness.

<p>Equally accessorized with the rusty and rustic, he lumbers his way through thickets and campsites &mdash; accompanied by Michelle Hwu's ambient sound design &mdash; in the hopes of recovering a locket from a band of rowdy twentysomethings who unknowingly picked it up. The item, through one brief daydream, is revealed as tied to his childhood. This motive, at first, seems like a conveniently tacked on explanation to justify his steady rampage, but his very first on-screen kill is disguised with unexpected panache. With his victim helplessly caught in a bear trap, Johnny reaches for his face, only for the movie to cut to several minutes later, as the killer's stout and rotting hand &mdash; now soaked in blood &mdash; reaches for a locket he thinks is his, in one continuous motion.</p><div id="related-video" class="mx-auto mt-8 mb-12 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans md:mt-12 md:mb-16 text-primary-400">

<p>This oblique cut is the first of several that denies the viewer the complete satisfaction of on-screen gore (don't fret; there's still plenty of that), but it also lends credence to the idea that something palpable, and perhaps fundamentally human, lies beneath Johnny's inhumane compulsions. That Johnny seems, at first, Terminator-esque in his one-tracked drive is also a function of Nash initially refusing to reveal the killer's face, even when he's unmasked. However, the film reveals Johnny's monstrous complexion at a moment that challenges the implications of his appearance. The first time we see his glassy eyes, infected teeth, and decomposing flesh happens to be when he sits down to play with a toy car. Like Jason and Leatherface, he appears to be constrained by arrested development.</p><p>None of this changes his or the movie's overarching trajectory &mdash; Johnny soon continues his vicious killing spree &mdash; but fleshing the character out this way is part and parcel of the movie's injection of melancholy into what might otherwise be cheap thrills.</p><h2><em>In A Violent Nature</em> is aesthetically rich slasher cinema</h2><p><em>In A Violent Nature</em> has a few of the most hilariously inventive kills in slasher cinema, but it also wrestles with its own violence in uncomfortable ways. There is, perhaps, only one death that plays out to its fullest potential in terms of sick satisfaction (the lady on the ledge; you'll know it when you see it), because for the most part, the film is designed to deny the thrilling release of on-screen bloodshed.</p><p>One kill unfolds entirely underwater, out of view. Another, up against a tree, cuts away during its most squelching moments. If he's in search of some catharsis, Johnny's drive to violence seems to help him <em>almost</em> achieve it, but each kill requires another. Nash's placement of the camera enhances this sense of forward momentum; we're almost always following Johnny from behind as he marches toward some unattainable goal.</p><p>Along the way, Nash and cinematographer Pierce Derks' use of digital noise replicates film grain, ramping up the visual tension even within stillness &mdash; as though the frame were pulsing and alive &mdash; while giving the movie a photographic quality reminiscent of celluloid. While shot on the Canon C70, it resembles an eerie 16-millimeter found footage discovery, further enhanced by its narrow 4:3 aspect ratio. This mimicry of film extends to the use of halation: sunlight pierces the corners of the frame in uncanny ways, creating a halo effect around Johnny, making him seem like a creature plucked out of time &mdash; like something that has always existed in these woods.</p><p>While there's arguably a finite timeline to Johnny's story &mdash; rumors and urban legends place his origin a few decades prior &mdash; nothing precludes his evocation of a Michael Meyers-esque embodiment of evil, who revels in (or at least, tries to revel in) his vicious handiwork. These echoes burrow their way under your skin, and become all the more viscerally upsetting as the film begins to focus on death not just as entertainment but as inevitability.</p><p>The aforementioned woman on the ledge (Charlotte Creaghan), though she becomes a victim of cartoonish brutality, has a rare and poignant moment of acceptance right before her death. She doesn&rsquo;t resist. A later victim, the Park Ranger (Reece Presley), becomes the center of one of the most ghastly and sadistic on-screen killings in recent slasher cinema, though not because of its actual bloodshed. Rather, Johnny breaks the Ranger's spine, paralyzing him and forcing him, and us, to watch &mdash; in an unbroken three-minute take &mdash; as he's slowly dismembered (and eventually, beheaded) by logging equipment. He can&rsquo;t resist either.</p><p>Accompanied only by mechanical rumbling, this kill in particular completes the movie's transformation from something thrilling, wherein death lurks around every corner, to something deeply sad, in which the camera unflinchingly portrays death head on, with no possibility of escape. All of this builds to the movie's stunning climax, a final 20 minutes that proves intensely nerve-wracking, despite the fact that Johnny isn't even on screen.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2><em>In A Violent Nature </em>ramps up the intensity during its quiet climax</h2><p>The movie's "final girl," Kris (Andrea Pavlovic) is, like her group of friends, marked for death by her proximity to the man who initially stole Johnny&rsquo;s locket. When she realizes the kind of unrelenting force she's up against, Kris runs away as fast as she can, all but leaving the movie's core premise behind. But before she escapes, the camera lingers on her unbroken stare, as Johnny executes her friend. There's something fearfully paralyzing about what she sees, but also, on the level of an audience expecting cathartic payoff, there's something enrapturing too &mdash; Kris lingers just a hair longer than any real person might.</p><p>As she runs helter-skelter through the darkened woods, the film briefly resembles the claustrophobic horrors of <em>The Blair Witch Project</em>, but it soon allows her an escape when she reaches a dirt road and flags down a pickup truck, &agrave; la the original <em>Texas Chain Saw</em>. During these climactic moments, there are plenty of shots that feel like they could serve as emphatic final images &mdash; from Johnny slashing away at a long-dead victim, to Kris charging through the forest (and eventually, standing still on the road) &mdash; thus concluding the movie in a state of unrest.</p><p>However, Nash prolongs this restlessness well beyond what might feel most rhythmic, or cinematically "correct," by essentially extending the movie beyond its natural life, into an extra act as Kris hitches a ride with a helpful woman (Lauren Taylor, of <em>Friday the 13th Part 2</em>). It's here, perhaps more than any other moment in the film, that the genre's expectations come charging into play, from the slasher&rsquo;s proclivity for "one final scare" to the creeping suspicion of an accomplice (the driver seems to be familiar with the dangers lurking in the woods).</p><p>Through shaky, claustrophobic closeups, Nash ratchets up the nauseating tension amidst this car ride, during which it feels violence could erupt at any moment. The aforementioned sound design, involving rusting trees and trilling insects, becomes louder and more harrowing, as though the forest itself were cursed. By sticking with Johnny's perspective through most of the film, Nash turns the concept of the cinematic gaze into something malevolent. When the movie finally leaves Johnny behind, switching its POV to Kris, it can't help but echo this sensation, a lingering feeling verging on the desire for on-screen violence. Watching these final minutes unfold involves not just expecting some vicious eruption, but on some level, yearning for it, as though it were the only possible escape from Kris' newfound paranoia.</p><p>This is, on one hand, a deft aesthetic embodiment of the way trauma seeps its way into your bones. But it is also wildly self-reflexive as a postscript to a horror film, as though Johnny's unrelenting thoughts of violence had, in some way, been transferred to Kris' psyche, through the mere act of her witnessing his executions &mdash; as an enraptured audience member cursed with the instinct to look away, but the desire to keep watching.</p><p><strong>How to watch:</strong> <a href="https://zdcs.link/2e6NE?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=In%20a%20Violent%20Nature%20is%20available%20to%20rent%2Fbuy%20on%20Amazon&object_type=article&object_uuid=04QGLT4GU0qFDuZiPkTQzaJ&short_url=2e6NE&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><em>In a Violent Nature</em> is available to rent/buy on Amazon</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/5MAK5?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=04QGLT4GU0qFDuZiPkTQzaJ&short_url=5MAK5&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Apple TV</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/6X033?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Vudu&object_type=article&object_uuid=04QGLT4GU0qFDuZiPkTQzaJ&short_url=6X033&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Vudu</a>, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/pg5Av?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Microsoft&object_type=article&object_uuid=04QGLT4GU0qFDuZiPkTQzaJ&short_url=pg5Av&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Microsoft</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Well, it turns out this breach was bigger than initially thought. As in, "440,000 compromised tickets just for <a href="https://mashable.com/article/taylor-swift-eras-tour-ticketmaster-press-release" target="_self">Taylor Swift's Eras Tour</a>" big.</p><p><a href="https://hackread.com/ticketmaster-breach-shinyhunters-leak-taylor-swift-eras-tour-tickets/" target="_blank">Cybersecurity publication Hackread</a> reports that hacker group ShinyHunters updated their ransom demand on Thursday, asking Ticketmaster's parent company Live Nation Entertainment to shell out $8 million for the safe return of the information. Though ShinyHunters claimed it previously accepted a "rushed" offer of $1 million from Live Nation, the group has since assessed the hacked data and revised its demands. Apparently ShinyHunters deduced the data is significantly more valuable than they'd initially believed.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>"[W]e found out how to make way more expensive and insurance surely accepts this; we restart negotiations at $8M let the negotiator and insurance know," read a post from ShinyHunters (via a screenshot by Hackread), published on the notorious hacking forum Breach Forums.</p><p>According to ShinyHunters, the group has obtained a total of 193 million ticket barcodes, valued at over $22.6 billion in total. This includes 440,000 tickets for <a href="https://mashable.com/article/taylor-swift-eras-tour-surprise-songs-list" target="_self">Taylor Swift's ongoing Eras Tour</a>, as well as 30 million more for 65,000 other events.</p><p>It's unclear exactly when Live Nation purportedly offered to pay the $1 million ransom, or whether it actually happened at all. Ticketmaster has denied ShinyHunter's claim, saying that the company never agreed to pay a ransom and did not offer the hackers any money.</p><p>"Ticketmaster&rsquo;s SafeTix technology protects tickets by automatically refreshing a new and unique barcode every few seconds so it cannot be stolen or copied," Ticketmaster said in a statement to Mashable. "This is just one of many fraud protections we implement to keep tickets safe and secure."</p><p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/ticketmaster-data-breach-shinyhunters-hack" target="_self">ShinyHunters initially attempted to sell the data for $500,000</a> at the end of May, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ticketmaster-breach-confirmed" target="_self">when the Ticketmaster breach was first reported</a>. At the time, the 1.3 terabytes were believed to contain sensitive information belonging to 560 million Ticketmaster customers. This included users' full names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, their ticket purchase history and details, and even partial payment data such as credit card expiry dates.</p><p>ShinyHunters' latest announcement has now provided further details on the breach, stating that the hacked information includes 400 million encrypted credit cards, 440 million unique email addresses, and 680 million order details. The hacker group claims that this makes it "the largest publicly disclosed non-scrape breach of customer [personally identifiable information] of all time."</p><h2><strong>Ticketmaster's ongoing troubles</strong></h2><p>Ticketmaster has been having a hard time of it lately, even beyond the <a href="https://mashable.com/video/john-oliver-ticketmaster" target="_self">universal</a> <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ticketmaster-platinum-prices-hurting-fans" target="_self">loathing</a> it commonly receives. Last year the company was the subject of a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ticketmaster-senate-hearing" target="_self">U.S. Senate hearing</a> investigating the apparent lack of competition in the live music industry. The U.S. Justice Department later <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ticketmaster-lawsuit-live-nation" target="_self">filed a lawsuit aiming to break up Live Nation</a> this May, accusing it of violating antitrust laws. <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24680185-doj-v-live-nation" target="_blank">According to the complaint</a>, over 70 percent of tickets sold or resold for major U.S. concert venues in 2022 were handled by Ticketmaster.</p><p>For its part, Live Nation has denied that Ticketmaster is a monopoly, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ticketmaster-lawsuit-live-nation" target="_self">claiming in a previous statement to Mashable</a> that "competition has steadily eroded Ticketmaster&rsquo;s market share and profit margin." Of course, having a shrinking market share doesn't preclude a company from also having a monopoly, especially if it's starting from a dominant position of 70 percent.</p><p>This also isn't the first time Ticketmaster has fallen afoul of Taylor Swift fans. The 2022 presale for Swift's Eras Tour was <a href="https://mashable.com/article/taylor-swift-era-tour-ticketmaster" target="_self">infamously a fiasco</a>, with Ticketmaster subsequently <a href="https://mashable.com/article/taylor-swift-eras-tour-ticketmaster-cancelled" target="_self">cancelling the public ticket sale</a> due to "insufficient remaining ticket inventory." The company issued an <a href="https://mashable.com/article/taylor-swift-eras-tour-ticketmaster-press-release" target="_self">official apology</a>, though this did not stave off <a href="https://mashable.com/article/taylor-swift-swifties-sure-ticketmaster" target="_self">a subsequent lawsuit from disgruntled Swifties</a>. Unhappy fans accused Ticketmaster of operating an "anticompetitive scheme," deceiving fans by failing to disclose that it had sent more presale codes than it could actually service with tickets.</p><p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/taylor-swift-eras-tour-ticketmaster-statement" target="_self">Swift released an official statement following the Eras Tour ticket debacle</a>, expressing her frustration and revealing that Ticketmaster had assured her team it could handle the demand after they'd inquired about it multiple times.</p><p>"It's truly amazing that 2.4 million people got tickets, but it really pisses me off that a lot of them feel like they went through several bear attacks to get them," wrote Swift.</p><p>Unfortunately, it seems as though the headache still isn't over for at least 440,000 of those Swifties.</p><p class="mx-auto">

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/07C5Q4D2QoOSrRooJmpBXcp/hero-image.jpg" alt="iPhone umbrellas at the beach"><p>A <a href="https://mashable.com/category/tiktok" target="_self">TikTok</a> creator pleaded with Apple to add a new feature to the iPhone: beach mode.</p><p>"Like nothing is more annoying than not being able to see your phone at the beach," the caption on <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@larissadomingueti/video/7384142343231917354" target="_blank">larissadomingueti's</a> video said. "Also why does it automatically dim? And overheats so easily. Apple, please fix this."</p><blockquote class="tiktok-embed" data-video-id="7384142343231917354" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;">

</blockquote>

<p>Some commenters dismissed the TikTokker's claims, declaring that it's common knowledge that smartphone displays appear to be dimmer while being drowned in sunlight. However, other replies pushed back, correctly pointing out that it's safety feature to protect the phone from overheating. As a result, users are experiencing a dimmer-than-usual display &mdash; so much so that it appears to be unreadable.</p><p>Solutions you'll find for this issue include <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253686926?answerId=256913038022&amp;sortBy=best#256913038022" target="_blank">turning off True Tone</a> and auto-brightness. However, some iPhone users have reported <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/254790709?sortBy=best" target="_blank">this doesn't work for them</a>. This is because heat-induced auto-dimming is not a user-configurable feature. As <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/iphones-auto-brightness-is-driving-you-crazy-heres-a-couple-of-fixes-to-try-out/" target="_blank">CNET</a> pointed out, according to Apple, you should keep your iPhone cooler than 95 degrees. Otherwise, if your phone gets too hot, the auto-dimming feature will kick in before it eventually shuts down. (Of course, when it cools down, it will become usable again.)</p><p>So the question is, what is the solution for beachgoers? iPhone umbrellas, apparently.</p><h2><strong>'iPhone umbrellas' as a solution for beach auto-dimming?</strong></h2><p>The TikTok video, which attracted 21 million views and 3.2 million likes, had a top comment that caught our eye.</p><p>"You need to order a phone umbrella. It changed my life," kaylie said. Several other users suggested the same. "Portable fan and phone umbrella babes," izzy added.  "Get a phone umbrella they help so much," Addi replied. "My aunt got me a phone umbrella and it works wonders on the beach," Gianna Dietitian said.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>A quick check on Amazon shows that iPhone umbrellas indeed exist. The highest-rated one at 4.3 out of 5 stars is this <a href="https://zdcs.link/Y023r?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Kiorafoto%20Magnetic%20Phone%20Umbrella&object_type=article&object_uuid=07C5Q4D2QoOSrRooJmpBXcp&short_url=Y023r&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Kiorafoto Magnetic Phone Umbrella</a>. It comes Black, Blue, Pink, and Yellow. The first three cost $19.99, but the yellow model is slightly more expensive at $21.99. (Of course, black <em>attracts </em>heat, so you'll be better off with the yellow variant.)</p><p>This iPhone umbrella utilizes the MagSafe, the magnetic tech on the back of the iPhone, to remain attached to your advice. This mean it's most compatible with MagSafe-supported iPhones, including the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/iphone-12-and-iphone-12-pro-review" target="_self">iPhone 12</a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/review/iphone-13-review" target="_self">iPhone 13</a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-iphone-14-pro-review" target="_self">iPhone 14</a>, and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/iphone-15-vs-iphone-15-pro" target="_self">iPhone 15</a>. (However, you can use older phones if you have a case with a built-in magnetic metal ring.)</p><p>Mashable hasn't tested iPhone umbrellas for their effectiveness, but according to Amazon reviewers, it does help to block the sun and prevents their iPhone from overheating. However, some buyers wished the umbrella had better quality.</p><p>Until Apple gifts us with a, er, "beach mode" (or if owners can stop shining their hunk of metal under the bright sun and sit under a proper beach umbrella), an iPhone umbrella seems like it could be a decent solution.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

    </div>
<p>From its opening voiceover of a young boy marveling at a world most don't see, <em>The Imaginary </em>centers on Rudger (voiced in the English language dub by Louie Rudge-Buchanan), an easily spooked blonde who is the devoted best friend of Amanda (Evie Kiszel). With the sprawling physicality of a Miyazaki heroine and crispy short bangs that suggest an impromptu DIY haircut, she is a spark plug of impulse and excitement. Naturally, that's a blessing and a curse for her single mum Lizzie (Hayley Atwell), who's balancing parenthood with managing a failing bookshop. &nbsp;</p><p>Cobbling together toys, props, and her trusty umbrella, Amanda composes epic odysseys for herself and Rudger, leaving a mess of water drops and toppled knickknacks for her mother to clean up. But this trio encounters real trouble when the bizarre Mr. Bunting (Jeremy Swift) pokes his ruddy nose into their shop. </p><div class="content-block-mashable-video mt-8">
    <div id="mashable-video-container-00TGevKPz2YVJidENK3oT9Q"></div>
</div>
<p>A pushy stranger with a gruff mustache, he has with him a wan girl with long dark hair and soulless eyes. Curiously, Lizzie can't see her. Shortly after this unnerving intrusion, a shocking turn of events separates Rudger and Amanda, forcing him out into the wider world. Now, the skittish sidekick must venture out to become his own hero, not only to reconnect with his best friend but also to save his fellow "imaginaries" from the vile Mr. Bunting and his J-horror companion.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong><em>The Imaginary </em>embraces the weird turns and deeper importance of playtime.&nbsp;</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

    </div>
<p>While the visual style is cuddly and cute, Nishimura's script recognizes that kids dream up all kinds of dark and bonkers things. As Rudger wanders into the community of other imaginaries, he meets a quirky collection of characters, including a goggled girl with Main Character energy named Emily (Sky Katz), a big pink hippo called Snowflake (Roger Craig Smith), a grizzled cat (Kal Penn), a snuffly old dog (LeVar Burton), and a small but energetic skeleton dubbed Cruncher-of-Bones (Courtenay Taylor). They make for a chaotic crew, but Momose unifies them through a cohesive and charming aesthetic, as they tumble into scenarios involving space travel and high-stress ballet recitals.&nbsp;</p><p>Within these surreal scenarios, Nishimura laces hints to what Amanda is coping with through her playtime with Rudger. For starters, she makes him promise: "Never disappear. Protect each other. And never cry." </p><p>What happened that this moxie-filled girl needs such assurances? Why does she name a mythic imaginary beast after the "green lager" her mother favors at the end of a tough day? Why does she have a keepsakes box with a note on it telling Rudger to KEEP OUT? While Rudger races blindly just to reunite with her, the audience is urged to wonder what he's missing amid his harried heroics.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What age is <em>The Imaginary </em>suitable for?&nbsp;</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Rated PG, <em>The Imaginary </em>might require some parental guidance for younger audiences. You know your kid better than anyone else, so rather than lay down a number, allow me to give a hint to what <em>The Imaginary </em>gets into &mdash; without spoilers.&nbsp;</p><p>For much of the film, Rudger's biggest fear is Amanda forgetting him, which would result in him literally disappearing. So, there's some existential dread hitting in a way kids can understand &mdash;&nbsp;as will be illustrated by other characters. But there are bigger issues of loss as Amanda faces a health crisis and a traumatic past event that inspired her to dream up Rudger in the first place. Basically, if you're uncomfortable talking about death with your kid, maybe your household isn't quite <em>The Imaginary</em>-ready yet.&nbsp;</p><p>The other element I'd flag would be for kids sensitive to scares. While Momose is mindful to keep a pivotal moment of violence offscreen, Mr. Bunting and his child cohort can be pretty frightening. Both have the ability to use imagination to contort themselves into the stuff of nightmares. Even as an adult, I winced at some of these scenes. While most of <em>The Imaginary </em>is whimsical, these bites &mdash;albeit brief &mdash; reach <em>Coraline-</em>levels of disturbing. </p><h2><strong>The voice cast for <em>The Imaginary's</em> English dub is divine.&nbsp;</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Sometimes the voice-casting for animated films can feel more like a grasp at cachet than actually finding a vibe match &mdash; looking at you, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-super-mario-bros-movie-review" target="_self"><em>Super Mario Bros Movie </em></a>and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-garfield-movie-review" target="_self"><em>The Garfield Movie</em></a>! Smartly, Studio Ponoc chose talent that comes alive in voice work over favoring flashy names. Sure, Atwell's voice is recognizable, but not distractingly so. She's well-suited to the role of a mother who is warm but also pretty understandably frustrated by her thrill-seeking youngster.&nbsp;</p><p>Child actors Evie Kiszel and Louie Rudge-Buchanan bring an authentic youthfulness to their roles. The former imbues Amanda with a mix of mischievousness and feigned ambivalence that instantly defines the strong facade of this wounded little girl. The latter rattles in nervousness at the start, but slowly steadies his delivery as Rudger grows more autonomous. Essentially, these talented children truly do chart the evolution of their characters through their vocal performances alone.&nbsp;</p><p>Elsewhere, Swift is jaunty but menacing as Mr. Bunting, bringing a relish for wickedness that echoes the best Disney villains. Katz is so lively and engaging as Emily, it's easy to wish for a spinoff for this punky ego-booster. Taylor offers Pokemon energy to Cruncher-of-Bones, assuring the creepy name and design aren't too much for little kids. Penn brings a smoky calm to the wise feline Zinzan. But my personal favorite is Burton as the old dog.&nbsp;</p><p>In the interest of full transparency, my brain is hardwired to take a breath and listen up when I hear LeVar Burton, the former host of <a href="https://mashable.com/video/stephen-colbert-reading-rainbow-woodward-trump" target="_self"><em>Reading Rainbow</em></a>. Whether I'm rewatching him on <em>Star Trek</em>, hearing him as the voice of Bubble on <a href="https://mashable.com/article/fionna-and-cake-review" target="_self"><em>Adventure Time</em></a>, or cuing up his podcast <a href="https://mashable.com/article/levar-burton-reads-podcast" target="_self"><em>LeVar Burton Reads</em></a>, there's an instant comfort in his buttery tones. <em>The Imaginary</em> makes great use of Burton in a small but pivotal role. It almost doesn't matter what his old dog says, because the very presence of this voice assures us that we'll be okay, come what may.&nbsp;</p><p>In Momose's richly realized world, where anything can be dreamed up, there's splendid spectacle in the imagined and the jolting realities that Rudger and Amanda encounter. Nishimura's script charts an adventure that reflects the travails of growing up, learning about the wider world, and confronting hard truths. Using a familiar animation style with a gentler color palette, Momose gives us a steady hand to hold as <em>The Imaginary </em>takes dark turns. And his terrific voice cast brings to vibrant life an eclectic cavalcade of characters.&nbsp;</p><p>If you love Studio Ghibli, you won't want to miss a film that feels like a cousin to its fantastical family. If you love animation that makes you gasp, giggle, and weep, you won't want to miss <em>The Imaginary</em>. And you've got young ones who are sensitive to scares and the unavoidable terror of mortality, well, <em>The Imaginary </em>will be on Netflix when they are ready.&nbsp;Rudger will be there waiting patiently. </p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/dM7X1?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=The%20Imaginary%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20on%20Netflix.&object_type=article&object_uuid=03DgZfzNd9mxSiudckJhFgx&short_url=dM7X1&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><em>The Imaginary </em>is now streaming on on Netflix.</a></p><p class="mx-auto">

The game is all about finding the "common threads between words." And just like <em>Wordle</em>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-20-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> resets after midnight and each new set of words gets trickier and trickier&mdash;so we've served up some hints and tips to get you over the hurdle.</p><p>If you just want to be told today's puzzle, you can jump to the end of this article for July 1's <em>Connections</em> solution. But if you'd rather solve it yourself, keep reading for some clues, tips, and strategies to assist you.</p><h2><strong>What is <em>Connections</em>?</strong></h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

      <description><![CDATA[Memes about VP Kamala Harris have shifted from humor to serious political discourse after Biden's poor debate performance.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01qVIycopLWT6aZpTTDlrjR/hero-image.jpg" alt="Vice President Kamala Harris delivers remarks on reproductive rights at Ritchie Coliseum on the campus of the University of Maryland on June 24, 2024 in College Park, Maryland. Harris is speaking on the two year anniversary of the Dobbs decision, the Supreme Court ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade and struck down federal abortion protections."><p>Momala is here to save all the coconuts in the tree while she exists in the context of all in which she lives, and what came before her, as the meme-pilled discourse of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/elon-musk-x-twitter-remove-repost-retweet-like-reply-buttons-count" target="_self">X</a> moves from ironic KHive posting to potentially actually wanting her to become president.</p><p>If that sentence made sense to you, I'm so sorry. If it didn't, here's what you missed: Vice President Kamala Harris's meme power &mdash; once a satiric gag &mdash; might be an indication of her ascension to the presidency. </p><p>The entire length of this presidential administration can be analyzed through memes courtesy of the veep. It started with "<a href="https://mashable.com/article/kamala-harris-we-did-it-tweet" target="_self">We did it, Joe</a>," and continued with her singing The Wheels of the Bus. She said "What can be, unburdened by what has been" a million times and her laugh is astonishing. She reminded us that her mother would say "'I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s wrong with you young people. You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?' You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you."</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>These memes have shaped the way the public &mdash; particularly the public that spends a lot of time online &mdash; views Harris' role in the administration. But after President Joe Biden's abysmal showing at the recent debate against Republican candidate and former President Donald Trump, the memes have taken a new turn. They've become more explicitly political, and people have begun taking her even more seriously.&nbsp;Perhaps the American public is more comfortable with a presidential candidate who seems like your silly aunt than one who looks, well, a bit too old for the role.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>The Biden campaign is struggling to hold onto young voters, and the debate only made that desperation more clear. In a <a href="https://x.com/tencor_7144/status/1808170120755241341" target="_blank"><u>CNN poll from after the debate</u></a>, VP Harris not only outperformed Biden, but she outperformed all the other Democratic choices. People are calling for Biden to step down from running for reelection, and the best option to replace him? She did not just fall out of a coconut tree.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

It can work as a home office computer, it can handle homework and other tasks for the kids, and it's great for just streaming and checking email, or whatever you want to do on your off days. Considering that you usually can't even get a similar tablet for this price, you'll want to jump on this deal quickly before it's gone. A whole laptop for less than $400 is a seriously hot 4th of July deal.</p><h2>Best Chromebook deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

But that's not always an option &mdash; maybe you don't live near a fireworks display, you're too sick to leave the house, or the weather has proved challenging. If that's the case, you can watch the a firework display online. </p><p>The most famous firework show to stream online is the Macy's fireworks over the Hudson River. Former Mayor Bill de Blasio started the tradition a decade ago and, now, you can watch it without ever having to leave your home. The <a href="https://www.macys.com/s/fireworks/fireworks-101/" target="_blank">show will include</a> 60,000 shells of 30 different colors at 1,000 feet high.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>NBC will be <a href="https://www.macys.com/s/fireworks/" target="_blank">live streaming it at 8 p.m. ET</a>, hosted by country singer Mickey Guyton and Access Hollywood&rsquo;s Zuri Hall. Just like other Macy's holiday events, there's more on the docket than just the fireworks &mdash; come for the explosions but stay for musical performances by Lainey Wilson, Luis Fonsi, Tanner Adell, Bell Biv DeVoe, Shaboozey, and more. </p><p>"Whether you&rsquo;re at home or on the go, catch every dazzling display, guest appearance, live performance &amp; incredible moment of America&rsquo;s favorite fireworks spectacular," <a href="https://www.macys.com/s/fireworks/" target="_blank">Macy's said on its site</a>.</p><p>If you don't have cable, you can watch it on <a href="https://mashable.com/category/peacock" target="_self">Peacock</a>, NBC's streaming service.

It's a cooling wonder that's meant to help hot sleepers better regulate their temperature and keep up to five degrees cooler throughout the night. Since the summer nights aren't much cooler than their daytime counterparts, you're going to want all the cooling power you can get when dealing with the higher temps that persist even when the sun goes down. No one wants to wake up a sweaty, uncomfortable mess, after all. </p><h2>Best mattress deal for couples</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>Through the end of the day, REI Co-op is slashing prices on clearance gear, offering shoppers up to 40% off thanks to the outdoor retailer's <a href="https://mashable.com/article/rei-4th-of-july-sale-deals" target="_self">4th of July sale</a>. If you're shopping for a new tent to hit the trails with this summer, this sale offers some of the best deals, including savings on the  <a href="https://zdcs.link/xPVXD?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=REI%20Co-op%20Skyward%204%20Tent&object_type=article&object_uuid=00299R83i3MXGkPmT4VqoFp&short_url=xPVXD&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">REI Co-op Skyward 4 Tent</a>. This four-person tent is 60 square feet and has a peak height of 78 inches, making it a spacious shelter with enough room to change and stand without hunching and ducking.

Thanks to their Apple H1 chip, they sound fantastic, with equally great active noise cancellation that works great to keep outside sound out. They also offer spatial audio support with dynamic head tracking as well as Dolby Atmos support. But one of their greatest achievements is their ability to stay comfortable even during long wear sessions. You also get the added effect of everyone noticing what you're wearing &ndash;&nbsp;they're certainly status symbols. But what's important here is that they deliver as headphones, and if you want a great pair, they're even better when you can get them at a solid discount. </p><h3>More headphones deals:</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/Y02M4?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Soundcore%20by%20Anker%20P20i%20wireless%20earbuds&object_type=article&object_uuid=00l2WDcjZSkRwzSKLmL95fp&short_url=Y02M4&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Soundcore by Anker P20i wireless earbuds</a> &mdash; <strong>$19.99 </strong><s>$24.99</s> (save $5)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/1v51b?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Soundcore%20by%20Anker%20Sport%20X10&object_type=article&object_uuid=00l2WDcjZSkRwzSKLmL95fp&short_url=1v51b&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Soundcore by Anker Sport X10</a> &mdash; <strong>$69.99 </strong><s>$7.99</s> (save $10)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/8BWPv?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Sennheiser%20Accentum%20wireless%20headphones&object_type=article&object_uuid=00l2WDcjZSkRwzSKLmL95fp&short_url=8BWPv&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Sennheiser Accentum wireless headphones</a> &mdash; <strong>$150.04 </strong><s>$199.95</s> (save $49.91)</p></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

<h3>Why we like it </h3><p>The <a href="https://zdcs.link/glDX0?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Roborock%20Q5%2B&object_type=article&object_uuid=00KNgu6xJ2f0hpQaWlkCdgY&short_url=glDX0&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Roborock Q5+</a> self-emptying robot vacuum <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B09NM56KJM" target="_blank">rarely goes on sale</a>, so if you're looking for one, you may want to whip out your wallet. This Roborock was on sale for a couple hundred dollars cheaper in the days preceding July 4th (make it make sense), but if you need a great self-emptying robot vacuum, this is still one we recommend &mdash; and $100 off ain't bad. </p><p>With the Roborock Q5+, you can set a cleaning schedule and forget about it (for up to seven weeks, then you&rsquo;ll need to empty the self-disposal bin). Thanks to its LiDAR navigation, this baby cleans just as good as a Roomba for a fraction of the price. </p><h3>More self-emptying robot vacuum deals: </h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/3d5KK?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=eufy%20L60%20self-emptying%20robot%20vacuum&object_type=article&object_uuid=00KNgu6xJ2f0hpQaWlkCdgY&short_url=3d5KK&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">eufy L60 self-emptying robot vacuum</a> &mdash; <strong>$299.99 </strong><s>$399.99</s> (save $100)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/2eOp5?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=iRobot%20Roomba%20i4%2B%20EVO%20self-emptying%20robot%20vacuum&object_type=article&object_uuid=00KNgu6xJ2f0hpQaWlkCdgY&short_url=2eOp5&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">iRobot Roomba i4+ EVO self-emptying robot vacuum</a> &mdash; <strong>$449.99 </strong><s>$599.99</s> (save $150)</p></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

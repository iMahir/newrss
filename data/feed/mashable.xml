      <description><![CDATA[Reddit is requiring that mods ask permission from the company to make subreddits private going forward.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01HWQgCXkebXELcS5E5w2DJ/hero-image.jpg" alt="Reddit app icon"><p>Reddit is changing its rules in a way that may ensure its mods never go rogue again.</p><p>On Monday, Reddit's VP of community, Laura Nestler, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/1fsyzjd/a_change_to_community_type_settings/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">announced</a> in a post on the platform's r/modnews subreddit that the company was changing Community Type settings rules. Going forward, moderators will be required to submit a request to Reddit instead of being able to just change the setting immediately on their own.</p><p>Community Type settings on subreddits are typically set by moderators and change a subreddit's visibility from public view to restricted or private. Mods can also change the Community Type settings from SFW (safe for work) to NSFW (not safe for work), which restrict access to the group by age.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>According to Nestler, in an interview with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/30/24253727/reddit-communities-subreddits-request-protests" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>The Verge</u></a>, Reddit has been talking about this change behind-the-scenes since she joined the company in 2021.</p><p>"When a public community goes private, all redditors (even members of that community) lose access to the community and its content," Nestler said in the announcement posted on Reddit. "Outside of extenuating circumstances, communities should honor the expectations they set &mdash; public communities should remain accessible to all; private communities should remain private."</p><h2><strong>Stifling future Reddit protests</strong></h2><p>Whether or not Reddit has been discussing this change prior to the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/reddit-blackout-explainer" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Reddit blackout protests</u></a> of last year, it'll be hard for users to see this as anything but a change meant to stifle future dissent.</p><p>In June 2023, thousands of Reddit communities, known as subreddits, changed their Community Type settings from public to either restricted or private in protest of the company's recent changes to its API. The Reddit API was once free for developers to build upon. However, the company decided to start charging for API access, which resulted in some popular Reddit-based apps like <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apollo-shut-down-reddit-api-dispute" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Apollo</u></a> shutting down.</p><p>Reddit eventually had to get involved and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/reddit-takes-over-subreddits-api-protests" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>take over</u></a> some larger subreddits in order to restore access to these communities. When a subreddit gets turned private, many users and visitors are completely cut-off from viewing the content posted there. Some moderators who refused to comply with Reddit were removed from their moderator positions. The role of moderator, we should note, is generally not held by employees of Reddit. Moderator is a completely unpaid, voluntary position and moderators are taken up by members of the Reddit community. </p><p>Reddit admins, who will approve or deny these Community Type settings change requests, <em>are</em> employed by the company.</p><p>Earlier this year, Reddit became a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/reddit-ipo-stock-price-rddt" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>publicly traded company</u></a> on the stock market. The social media platform now has less wiggle room for its community to partake in actions that can hit the company's traffic or revenue like they did in 2023.</p><h2><strong>The new rules</strong></h2><p>According to Reddit, moderators will now have to <a href="https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/23535789982868-Changing-your-Community-Type" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>submit a request</u></a> before taking their subreddit private or changing its age restrictions.</p><p>Outside of protest, the obvious rationale for a speedy change of Community Type might be to avoid being inundated with harassment in the event that a subreddit is being brigaded by trolls. This is&nbsp;a situation that communities would, it seems, be more vulnerable to after this rule change. Some mods shared this concern in the replies to Reddit's rule change post.</p><p>"Our trans subs have been brigaded by large, organized harassment campaigns in the past, sometimes for months on end," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/1fsyzjd/comment/lpsyfs1/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">wrote one user</a> in the comments to Reddit's announcement. "Going private and manually checking and approving each applicant has been our primary defense for protecting our users, their photos, and their information."</p><p>Mashable reached out to Reddit for comment on this potential problem, and for further information about the change in general, but we did not hear back in time for publication. </p><p>Mods can apply for these requests at any time and will receive a response within 24 hours. Subreddits with less than 5,000 members, or those less than 30 days old, will have their requests approved automatically.&nbsp;</p><p>Moderators can still temporarily restrict posts and comments to a subreddit under its <a href="https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/27018580066708-Temporary-events" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Temporary Events</u></a> policy. Restrictions put on a subreddit by mods due to a sudden spike in traffic will not require approval from Reddit. These restrictions under Temporary Events are allowed to remain for up to 7 days.</p><p>Regardless of what Reddit's true reasoning behind the new rules is, the changes will likely not receive a positive response from moderators as Reddit removes a source of leverage these community members&nbsp;once held.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Merlin represents over 30,000 independent record labels, and their previous agreement with TikTok expires on Oct. 31. According to <a href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/merlin-says-tiktok-walked-away-licensing-negotiations/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Billboard</em></a>, TikTok "walked away" from "negotiations before they even began." In a letter published by&nbsp;<em>Billboard</em>, Merlin explained to its members that the social media company does not want to renew its deal; it intends to license Merlin members directly, minimizing the group's collective power. </p><p>"Their approach [to pursue direct deals with Merlin members] suggests that [TikTok] believe[s] their objectives can be better served by fragmenting the Merlin membership, in order, we believe, to minimize their payout," reads the letter<em>.</em> "As you know, Merlin was founded to stand up for and champion its members. We will not support an approach that devalues our community." </p><p>A TikTok spokesperson told <em>Billboard</em>, "TikTok would like to offer all of the world&rsquo;s music to our users. We are committed to working with the independent sector as well as the major labels and publishers. We know that our community of over a billion music fans value the diversity and richness that independent music brings to our platform. We are committed to entering into direct deals with Merlin members in order to keep their music on TikTok."</p><p>Without the collective bargaining power under Merlin, each record label would have to negotiate a new licensing deal by the end of October. If a deal isn't reached, artists under the individual label's catalogs would be removed. Artists currently under Merlin include <a href="https://mashable.com/article/boygenius-phoebe-bridgers-memes-explained" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Phoebe Bridgers</a>, Mitski, Mac Demarco, Nirvana, and Thundercat. </p><p>Merlin's letter to artists also explained that TikTok claims it won't negotiate with the music company due to alleged fraud committed by Merlin members. According to TikTok, some members have posted songs or remixes that aren't owned by the label. Since the issue is only with some members it seeks to negotiate with individual labels. However, Merlin contends that the real reason behind the move is to secure cheaper deals than Merlin would allow for. </p><p>This comes after <a href="https://mashable.com/article/tiktok-songs-sounds-universal-music-group" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Universal Music Group</a> (UMG) and the National Music Publishers' Association both struggled to reach licensing agreements with TikTok.

<p>As you're getting ready for <a href="https://mashable.com/article/october-prime-day-how-to-find-the-best-deals-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">another Prime Day</a> on <strong>Oct. 8 and 9</strong>, knowing the different types of deals can help you shop smarter. </p><p>Lightning deals are offers on products only available for a specific amount of time and in limited quantity. They're signified on product pages with a little bar that reads "X% claimed." The deals are available until all units have been claimed or the deal timer runs out &mdash; whichever comes first. Lightning deals are usually limited to one day, sometimes only lasting a few hours, and new deals rotate daily.</p><p>They're certainly tantalizing &mdash; since these deals don't hang around for long, they put the pressure on to buy ASAP. Lightning deals are also only available to Prime members and may not appear to non-members.</p><h2>Did Amazon get rid of lighting deals?</h2><p>Strangely, some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/1cai4xo/what_happened_to_the_lightning_deals_on_the_web/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">very keen Prime members noticed</a> last spring that the category for lightning deals on the "Today's Deals" tab at Amazon had disappeared. They weren't completely gone but became inexplicably harder to find. One Reddit poster noted that they called Amazon after lightning deals disappeared and were told that the company was updating the system to make it better for users. For months, the lightning deals just blended into the regular deals.</p><p>We're pleased to announce that the official "Lightning deals" tab has returned this fall, making it easier to shop the limited-time offers during October Prime Day. </p><h2>How to find lightning deals</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Thankfully, Amazon made finding lightning deals a breeze once again. All active lightning deals can be found by navigating to the <a href="https://zdcs.link/DdoEb?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=%22Today%27s%20Deals%22%20tab%20of%20Amazon&object_type=article&object_uuid=03dF1E9G167Xu4BDmzn7Yih&short_url=DdoEb&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">"Today's Deals" tab of Amazon</a>, then clicking on 'Lightning deals,' which is marked with a yellow lightning bolt. </p><p>You'll also notice that all lightning deals are marked with a bar that says "X% claimed" which sits right under the product listing. The higher the percentage claimed, the closer the deal is to ending. Occasionally, you'll also see a countdown clock on the listings, but usually, it's just the percentage claimed bar.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">
    <div class="flex justify-center">
                    <img class="border border-gray-100" src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03dF1E9G167Xu4BDmzn7Yih/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1720708138.png" alt="A page of products on Amazon with red circles around the lightning deal bars." width="2000" height="1125" loading="lazy" srcset="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03dF1E9G167Xu4BDmzn7Yih/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1720708138.png 800w, https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03dF1E9G167Xu4BDmzn7Yih/images-1.fill.size_1400x788.v1720708138.png 1400w, https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03dF1E9G167Xu4BDmzn7Yih/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1720708138.png 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px">

<p>If you're using the Amazon app, you can find lightning deals similarly by tapping the three-line menu at the bottom right of your screen. Then tap "Today's Deals" and choose the "Lightning deals" tab to filter the current available deals.</p><h2>When do lightning deals expire?</h2><p>Lightning deals don't last long, but how long do they usually last? There's no standard time frame. Typically, they last between a couple of hours and up to 24 hours, but because they're also available in limited quantity, the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/amazon-prime-day-alexa-advanced-deals-alert-hack" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">deals</a> may go before time runs out. </p><p>Amazon doesn't tell you how many deals are available, only the percentage claimed, so the higher it gets, the closer it is to running out.</p><p>Lightning deals expire when either time runs out or when all the available products have been claimed &mdash; whichever comes first. If there's a lightning deal you really want, we recommend purchasing it right away, since these deals are guaranteed not to last.</p><h2>Are lightning deals any good?</h2><p>We can't categorically say all lightning deals are good or bad. Like any <a href="https://mashable.com/article/amazon-prime-day-how-to-find-the-best-deals" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">deal on Amazon</a>, it totally depends. Sometimes lightning deals are on products from sketchy third-party products with no name recognition &mdash; those you want to skip. </p><p>But other times, big brands will be featured with products up to 50% off, and those are the deals to catch. If you're unsure, tools like <a href="https://zdcs.link/BdA7b?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=camelcamelcamel&object_type=article&object_uuid=03dF1E9G167Xu4BDmzn7Yih&short_url=BdA7b&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">camelcamelcamel</a> are a fantastic price-tracking resource to utilize. If you find a lightning deal, use the <a href="https://zdcs.link/4Apkk?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=camelcamelcamel%20extension&object_type=article&object_uuid=03dF1E9G167Xu4BDmzn7Yih&short_url=4Apkk&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">camelcamelcamel extension</a> to check the product's price history to see just how good the lightning deal actually is.</p>]]></content:encoded>

One is by cross-checking the listing with its manufacturer's website to verify its MSRP; Amazon will occasionally inflate them to make discounts look steeper than they really are. We also recommend cross-checking sale prices at competing retailers like <a href="https://mashable.com/article/walmart-october-prime-day-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Walmart</a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-buy-october-prime-day-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/target-circle-week-october-prime-day-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Target</a>, which will sometimes match or beat Amazon's offers.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The Amazon price-tracking website <a href="https://zdcs.link/kvV7r?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=camelcamelcamel&object_type=article&object_uuid=01pXUuexOFVqGAMexDxRmqX&short_url=kvV7r&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">camelcamelcamel</a> is an especially valuable tool during sales like Prime Big Deal Days. If you plug a product's Amazon listing into the search bar at the top of its homepage, you'll be able to see the products's going rate(s) over the weeks/months/years. The site occasionally misses short-term discounts, but it can give you a good general idea of whether or not a discount you see is actually as impressive as it seems.</p><p>Take this <a href="https://zdcs.link/9g3Ng8?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Rockland%20luggage%20set&object_type=article&object_uuid=01pXUuexOFVqGAMexDxRmqX&short_url=9g3Ng8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Rockland luggage set</a>, for instance.

<p>Ultimately, we don't think it's worth the hassle of combing through an unfamiliar seller's entire review history for potential red flags when there's a huge selection of deals from Amazon itself <em>right there</em>. It's also just not worth taking any risks when your money is on the line, no matter how small they may be. It's OK to be overly picky, especially when it comes to tech and other major purchases you might be making during a once-a-season sale. (Think about it this way: Would you feel more comfortable dropping several hundred dollars on a laptop sold by Amazon or something called "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?me=A1685R6739O6PG&amp;marketplaceID=ATVPDKIKX0DER" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Mall of Americ (SN Recorded)</a>"? Typo theirs, not ours.)</p><p>You can find out who's selling an item you're interested in by visiting its product page and looking just below its "Buy Now" button on the far right side. If you see two lines indicating that it "Ships from <a href="http://Amazon.com" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Amazon.com</a>" and is "Sold by <a href="http://Amazon.com" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Amazon.com</a>," you're good to go.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

            October Prime Day is just around the corner. Here's what to buy, and what not to.

<h2>Tip #1: Organize your Amazon wishlist</h2><p>If it&rsquo;s news to you that <a href="https://mashable.com/category/amazon" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Amazon</a> even offers such a feature, here&rsquo;s how it works:</p><p>Every product page on the retail giant&rsquo;s website has a little &ldquo;Add to List&rdquo; button right near the &ldquo;Add to Cart.&rdquo; Click on the list button and you can add said product to your personal Amazon wishlist, or any other saved list that you&rsquo;ve created on your profile.</p><p>Do this with all of those items that you've been eyeing, but can't seem to make a move on unless they're on sale. Then, you can view your definitive list at a glance, or even rank each item based on how badly you want it.</p><q>
    Your Amazon wishlist is one of the most useful tools that you have at your disposal come Prime day.
    </q>
<p>Then, and here's the important part, be sure to check back on your wishlist when Prime Big Deal Days 2024 kicks into high gear. You&rsquo;ll be able to see which products have gone on sale and snatch them up before they&rsquo;re gone. </p><p><strong>WARNING:</strong> Only add the <em>necessities </em>to your wishlist or risk critical failure and end up with mass shipments of stuff you don&rsquo;t need, never needed, and will never need.</p><h2>Tip #2: Turn on wishlist alerts</h2><p>That&rsquo;s not where the perks of "wishlisting" cap out. If you download Amazon&rsquo;s mobile companion app, you&rsquo;ll be granted the added benefit of "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/vdp/00b8627be4234bd89134216fa0081c67" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">wishlist alerts</a>."</p><p>These alerts notify you when an item on your wishlist becomes a &ldquo;lightning deal,&rdquo; as well as when a sold-out item on your wishlist goes back in stock. </p><p>This isn&rsquo;t a notification setting that's turned on by default, so you&rsquo;ll have to go in and check it off yourself. All you have to do is open up the Amazon app, go into your settings, then to your notifications, and click on &ldquo;your watched and waitlisted deals.&rdquo;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2>Tip #3: Turn on Alexa's advanced deal alerts</h2><p>As it turns out, newer Echo smart speakers are good for more than just bumping out your playlists. They can also notify you of a sale on an item in your wishlist, shopping cart, or "saved for later" queue up to 24 hours <em>before</em> it even goes live. </p><ul><li><p>Open up the Alexa mobile app to turn on the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/amazon-prime-day-alexa-advanced-deals-alert-hack" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">advanced deal alerts feature</a>. You'll find it under More &gt; Settings &gt; Notifications &gt; Amazon Shopping </p></li><li><p>Once you're there, click Shopping Recommendations and then Deal Recommendations. Since you already have your wishlist organized and ready to go, that's all there is to it. </p></li><li><p>You'll see a pop-up alert or a yellow ring light on your Echo device whenever Alexa finds out about an upcoming deal on products in your wishlist. Ask, "Alexa, what are my notifications?" to get the scoop.</p></li></ul><p>You can either have Alexa let you know once the deal is live or even give her the go-ahead to order it for you ("Alexa, buy it for me"). Your default payment and delivery address on file will be used automatically.</p><p><em>Voil&agrave;</em> &mdash; now you&rsquo;ll never miss a deal for something you want. Your Amazon wishlist is one of the most useful tools that you have at your disposal to ensure a successful shopping experience. </p><p>When you're done curating your list, you can even share it with your friends.

<h3>10. Gaming deals</h3><p>Upgrading your gaming console and even buying new games feels like a drag &mdash; when you're doing it at full price, that is.

<h2>Things to avoid on Prime Day</h2><p>While Prime Day is chock full of good deals, there are some things you'll want to be wary of while you shop. Mashable covered <a href="https://mashable.com/deals/what-not-to-buy-prime-day?test_uuid=05n6qXSf1roZ2M9nfgWNQzG&amp;test_variant=b" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">all the things we recommend avoiding</a> in detail, but here are a few quick tips.</p><h3>1. Products sold by third-party sellers</h3><p>Many third-party sellers on Amazon are legitimate, but the <a href="https://www.retaildive.com/news/amazon-counterfeit-products-fake-goods-removal-2023/711615/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">prevalence</a> of counterfeit products makes us nervous to recommend anything listed by unfamiliar, unvetted merchants. They can also offer different <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GLC8ZMBWMBTR6QZZ" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">customer service</a> than Amazon itself.</p><p>Amazon's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GQ37ZCNECJKTFYQV" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">A-to-z Guarantee</a> covers you if you have issues with a third-party seller. But if you don't want to deal with the potential hassle of its claims and eligibility process, a good rule of thumb is to stick with products that are shipped and sold by Amazon itself. </p><h3>2. Ring doorbells and cameras</h3><p>The steep Prime Day discounts on Ring cameras and bundles might be tempting, but we <a href="https://mashable.com/article/do-not-get-a-ring-camera-why" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">don't recommend</a> buying or using Ring devices due to the company's history of <a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/smart-home/ring-doorbells-had-vulnerability-leaking-wi-fi-login-info-researchers-found/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">major</a> <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/05/ftc-says-ring-employees-illegally-surveilled-customers-failed-stop-hackers-taking-control-users" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">security</a> <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/01/ring-doorbell-app-packed-third-party-trackers" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">and</a> <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/11/26/amazon-ring-home-security-facial-recognition/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">privacy</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/08/28/doorbell-camera-firm-ring-has-partnered-with-police-forces-extending-surveillance-reach/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">issues</a>.

Anything you don't need</h3><p>Like we mentioned before, it's best to use Prime Day as a way to get something you need at a good discount.

<p>As Mashable's resident beauty tech expert, I've spent a lot of time covering the FlexStyle. I've only had the FlexFusion Straight in my hands for a few days, so a full review is still in the pipeline &mdash; in the meantime, I'll be breaking down everything you need to know about the Shark FlexFusion.</p><h2>Shark FlexFusion vs. Shark FlexStyle</h2><p>As I mentioned above, unlike other multi-stylers on the market, the FlexFusion is designed to be used to style wet hair and dry hair. "This makes it the perfect innovation for both wash day, second-day hair, and beyond," a Shark spokesperson told Mashable in an email.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>To do that, the tool uses the air styling that has been the hallmark of multi-stylers so far, but combines it with traditional heat styling you'd expect from a normal flat iron or curling iron. For instance, the Wet-or-Dry Fusion Air Straightener comes with ceramic plates that heat up just like your flat iron. You can use the tool with both air and heat styling simultaneously, just air, or just heat styling for the Fusion Brush and Straightener (hence, being able to work with those second-day and beyond looks). </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Shark also claims that both new FlexFusions are smaller, lighter, and more powerful than the FlexStyle. Shark sent me the FlexFusion Straight, and just from a glance, the base is slightly shorter than the FlexStyle's, and by feel, slightly lighter, too. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The curling attachments still go only one direction like they do with the FlexStyle, but they are slightly taller, which will likely make styling easier for folks with longer hair. As they aren't specifically wet-or-dry attachments, they can't be used solely as heat stylers.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The FlexFusion also allows you to go attachment-free to be used as a standard hair dryer, just like the FlexStyle.</p><p>While those are the larger differences between the FlexStyle and FlexFusion, the two main versions of the FlexFusion themselves also have some variation.</p><h2>Shark FlexFusion attachments</h2><p>As a reminder, the standard FlexFusion bundle retails for $349.99. The standard FlexStyle goes for $299.99 and comes with a set of auto-wrap curlers, a diffuser or paddle brush, an oval brush, and a styling concentrator. In comparison, here's what attachments you'll get with the FlexFusion:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Wet-or-Dry Fusion Brush: </strong>Essentially, this attachment is a round brush with some extra frizz-fighting power, thanks to the heated comb on one side of the brush. For your hair health, you'll want to only use that comb on mostly or completely dried hair, but it helps remove a step of de-frizzing that can sometimes arise with air stylers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Styling concentrator: </strong>The concentrator looks nearly identical to what comes with the FlexStyle, and has no heat-styling extras.</p></li><li><p><strong>1.25-inch Auto-Wrap Curlers: </strong>As I mentioned above, these curlers are ever so slightly longer than those of the FlexStyle, but from initial tests seem to perform very similarly. The design has slightly different air gaps &mdash; as I do more testing, I'll be paying closer attention to how that affects styling, if at all.</p></li><li><p><strong>FrizzFighter Finishing Tool: </strong>Again, this attachment is a one-to-one to the FrizzFighter already offered with the FlexStyle. It uses Coanda airflow tech to "grab" the hair and provide even more smoothing &mdash; this could come in handy for some quick smoothing after a rough dry.</p></li></ul><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2>Shark FlexFusion + Straight attachments</h2><p>The FlexFusion + Straight retails for $399.99, the most expensive Shark multi-styler to date, and comes with many of the same attachments above, plus one additional one (as the name might suggest):</p><ul><li><p><strong>Wet-or-Dry Air Straightener</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Wet-or-Dry Fusion Brush</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>1.25-inch Auto-Wrap Curlers</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Styling concentrator</strong></p></li></ul><p>The Fusion Straightener is giving <a href="https://zdcs.link/QddrqK?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Dyson%20Airstrait&object_type=article&object_uuid=012HkH003rApvyXPhK8bZA2&short_url=QddrqK&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Dyson Airstrait</a>, but it's not quite the same tool. The major difference is that Dyson's straightener doesn't use any hot plates to style the hair, instead relying on a combination of tension and hot air. You could try to replicate that by not turning on any heat with your Shark straightener, but it will likely be harder to yield the results you want with just cool air. Not for nothing, the Airstrait is also $500.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

        </a>
    </div>
<p>If you buy the FlexFusion without the straightener and later decide you want the attachment in your tool kit, it is available for <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wGr66?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=purchase%20separately%20for%20%2499.99&object_type=article&object_uuid=012HkH003rApvyXPhK8bZA2&short_url=9wGr66&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">purchase separately for $99.99</a>. It's not nearly as good a deal as if you get it from the jump, but it's cheaper than buying a whole new multi-styler. If you want to personalize beyond the above kits, the build-your-own bundles are a great option that also include a wide tooth comb and diffuser.</p><p>On that note, if you already own a FlexStyle and are interested in any of the FlexFusion attachments, unfortunately, you <em>will</em> have to get a whole new multi-styler. Due to the size and functionality differences, the attachments are not interchangeable between the hair tools.</p><h2>Is the FlexFusion an Airwrap dupe? </h2><p>The FlexFusion can definitely be used as a dupe, but that's not all it is. It feels like with the FlexFusion, Shark is aiming to create a unique tool that can replace your standard curling and flat iron, as well as give you the air-styling people know and love from multi-stylers. If you're rocking with your hot tools from when you were a teenager, this might be the upgrade you're looking for.</p><p>With that said, if you're happy with your hot tool selection, sticking to the FlexStyle will still save you cash and give you an incredibly good Dyson dupe. If you're extra conscious about heat damage when styling your hair, the FlexStyle or Airwrap may be more your speed.</p><p>The FlexFusion is available on Shark's website as of Oct.1. </p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

The state filed a lawsuit against the platform in <a href="https://apnews.com/article/new-mexico-snapchat-attorney-general-sextortion-teens-1a1c4c856a24d15631f26bb69e0f4c74" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">early September</a>, alleging it did not do enough to warn users of online risks despite employees waving red flags.  </p><p>New Mexico's suit claims that the platform weighed the cost of addressing widespread child grooming and decided it wasn't worth the administrative burden, despite warnings that the problem was becoming more common among teens. Internal communications show the company believed the task "should not be its responsibility," and safety staff documented that 90 percent of reports were ignored in favor of automatic prompts telling users to merely "block the other person."</p><p>The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/snap-failed-to-warn-users-about-sextortion-risks-state-lawsuit-alleges-0b170fc7?st=C2yjkn&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">newly unredacted</a> complaint points to a 2022 internal analysis showing company employees were fielding around 10,000 reports of sextortion each month. Those numbers are most likely grossly underestimated, the company noted internally, as victims frequently choose not to report intimidation. Executives also said they couldn't actually verify user ages, and that user reports, as well as known perpetrators, were "falling through the cracks."</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>"We continue to evolve our safety mechanisms and policies, from leveraging advanced technology to detect and block certain activity, to prohibiting friending from suspicious accounts, to working alongside law enforcement and government agencies, among so much more," a company spokesperson said in a comment on the filing."We know that no one person, agency, or company can advance this work alone, which is why we are working collaboratively across the industry, government, and law enforcement to exchange information and concept stronger defenses."</p><p>But the company disagreed on how to warn users "without stoking fear in Snapchatters," the suit claims, and its <a href="https://mashable.com/video/snapchat-minor-teen-safety-updates" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">internal safety measures</a> failed to stack up. Other design features, such as Streaks and Quick Add, appear to enable abusive behavior, the state argues. Snap <a href="https://newsroom.snap.com/new-mexico-ag-statement" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">responded to the initial filing</a>, saying it shared the state's and public's concerns about online safety. </p><p>Almost since its inception, the communication-first platform has been associated with explicit messaging and NSFW content, pegged to the misunderstood nature of the app's "disappearing" images &mdash; Snapchat has informed users that content can be easily saved and shared. In recent years, the trend of app-based "sexting" has risen once again among younger users &mdash; many of them are <a href="https://mashable.com/article/teens-talking-to-strangers-online" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">simultaneously turning to strangers online</a> for comfort and advice. Both behaviors have the possibility of opening up young people to the risk of predation. </p><p>The problem isn't just with the young: Sextortion schemes are worsening across digital spaces, with online predators and scammers using the threat of unveiled explicit imagery to demand individuals pay up. Two recent sextortion-based scams also hinge on access to a victim's personal (though, most likely, still publicly available) data, like your <a href="https://mashable.com/article/sextortion-online-scam-cheating-spouse" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">spouse's name</a> or photos of your <a href="https://mashable.com/article/sextortion-scam-uses-homes-coerce-victims" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">home address,</a> to add legitimacy to their claims. </p><p>But, alarmingly, the often <a href="https://www.missingkids.org/blog/2023/financial-sextortion-growing-crisis" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">life-threatening</a> phenomenon is growing <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-talk-to-teens-about-sextortion" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">among younger and younger populations</a> &mdash; and within interpersonal relationships &mdash; as generative AI tools become more accessible. Experts have urged vigilance and preparedness as caregivers warn their children about online risks, including sex-based and technological threats. </p><p>Nationwide, state leaders and school districts continue <a href="https://mashable.com/article/michigan-school-district-sues-meta-tiktok-google-snapchat" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">pursuing legal action against social media platforms</a> who they claim are putting young people at risk, failing to warn caregivers, and jeopardizing the mental wellbeing of generations. </p><p>"It is disheartening to see that Snap employees have raised many red flags that have continued to be ignored by executives," wrote attorney general Torrez. "What is even more disturbing is that unredacted information shows that the addicting features on Snapchat were blatantly acknowledged and encouraged to remain active on the platform."</p>]]></content:encoded>

While not perfect, the ABC debate was given high marks for professionalism and a lack of chaos that usually surrounds Trump-related events.&nbsp;</p><p>Fact-checking will be available to debate viewers watching via <a href="http://CBSNews.com" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">CBSNews.com</a>, where 20 journalists will correct lies and exaggerations in real time; those watching live on CBS will have the option of scanning a QR code directing them to the website. The passive fact-checking is not everyone&rsquo;s favorite, as it could allow some misinformation to devolve into a he said/he said situation. Also, many viewers may be watching via cable and likely have no interest in running up to their TV screen and scanning a code on their smartphone.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>It doesn't really get much better than Apple's recent M3 line of MacBooks. The <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-macbooks-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">M3 Air</a> is one of our favorites, and ahead of Prime Big Deal Days you can score one for just $1,006.99, which $92.01 off the usual price. This MacBook Air in particular comes with a 13-inch screen (great for traveling), and features the speedy M3 chip. It also has support for Apple Intelligence and can handle up to 18 hours of usage on one charge.</p><h3>More MacBook deals</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/ao5pPY?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20MacBook%20Air%2C%2013-inch%20%28M2%2C%208GB%20RAM%2C%20256GB%20SSD%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=032BGR40jknn3BTDZSr6OWE&short_url=ao5pPY&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple MacBook Air, 13-inch (M2, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD)</a> &mdash; <strong>$849</strong> <s>$999</s> (save $150)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/aR86DV?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20MacBook%20Pro%2C%2014-inch%20%28M3%2C%208GB%20RAM%2C%20512GB%20SSD%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=032BGR40jknn3BTDZSr6OWE&short_url=aR86DV&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple MacBook Pro, 14-inch (M3, 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD)</a> &mdash; <strong>$1,299</strong> <s>$1,599</s> (save $300)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/QddBL6?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20MacBook%20Air%2C%2015-inch%20%28M3%2C%2016GB%20RAM%2C%20512GB%20SSD%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=032BGR40jknn3BTDZSr6OWE&short_url=QddBL6&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple MacBook Air, 15-inch (M3, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD)</a> &mdash; <strong>$1,549</strong> <s>$1,699</s> (save $150)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/9lwkbd?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20MacBook%20Pro%2C%2016-inch%20%28M1%20Pro%2C%2016GB%20RAM%2C%201TB%20SSD%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=032BGR40jknn3BTDZSr6OWE&short_url=9lwkbd&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple MacBook Pro, 16-inch (M1 Pro, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD)</a> &mdash; <strong>$2,070.65</strong> <s>$2,699</s> (save $628.35)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qm2506?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20MacBook%20Pro%2C%2016-inch%20%28M3%2C%2018GB%20RAM%2C%20512GB%20SSD%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=032BGR40jknn3BTDZSr6OWE&short_url=Qm2506&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple MacBook Pro, 16-inch (M3, 18GB RAM, 512GB SSD)</a> &mdash; <strong>$2,324</strong> <s>$2,499</s> (save $175)</p></li></ul><h2>Best iPad deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>The AirPods Max are a great pair of over-ear headphones for those who prefer that style to that of earbuds. The Max provide super high-quality audio, active noise cancellation, a transparency mode so you can enjoy your tunes and the world around you, and personalized spatial audio. It's also got a 20-hour battery life, which is pretty sweet. Snag a pair before Prime Big Deal Days and save $100.</p><h3>More AirPods deals</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/QKD2Zj?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20AirPods%20%282nd%20Generation%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=032BGR40jknn3BTDZSr6OWE&short_url=QKD2Zj&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)</a> &mdash; <strong>$89</strong> <s>$129</s> (save $40)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/zjGede?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20AirPods%20%283rd%20Generation%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=032BGR40jknn3BTDZSr6OWE&short_url=zjGede&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple AirPods (3rd Generation)</a> &mdash; <strong>$129.99</strong> <s>$169</s> (save $39.01)</p></li></ul><h2>Best Apple Watch deals</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>If you've ever considered buying a keyboard or a piano but couldn't lock in a purchase, this Amazon Basics option is a great pick. It might be an unorthodox one when it comes to things you should stock up on for your home, but the fact that it's on sale makes it worth checking out. It's a full-sized 88-key keyboard with a sustain pedal and power supply, complete with an amplifier, speaker, and mixing port. It also has a number of special functions to help you learn how to play as well as make some multifaceted music straight from the keyboard, as well as over 140 tones to choose from. Make your own music with its built-in memory to record and play back your tunes, too. Whether you're a beginner getting started with piano or an expert who wants a home instrument to work with, this Basics option is a good buy. </p><h2>Best Amazon Basics smart bulb deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>This 4-pack of smart bulbs is the perfect addition to your smart home. They're controllable via your voice or the Alexa app, so you'll have full control over them whenever you want to tweak your home lighting. Turn them on and off, create schedules for when they'll operate, and change colors with 16 presets that you can choose the brightness off from 5% to 100% brightness. Create lights in the Alexa app to control multiple lights at once, and set up routines so you can have your lights on even when you aren't home to deter bad actors. They're dimmable as well, so you can tap a button and change the mood of a room instantly. You get enough in this pack to totally transform one or two locations in your home, and savings like this make it worth snagging these bulbs for a smart hub starter pack. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>Whip up game day snacks or a full meal in a flash and save some money with this deal on the Chefman TurboFry Touch air fryer. Its 8-quart basket is built for family-sized meals, but its sleek design won't take up too much real estate on your countertop. With presets for fries, chicken, fish, and meat, you can whip up crispy air-fried goodness at the touch of a button. No need to wait for your oven to heat up. Ahead of October Prime Day, it's on sale for $69.99 at Amazon for Prime members. That's 42% in savings and $15 cheaper than it was just last week.</p><h3>More air fryer deals</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp6ryl?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Chefman%20Dual%20Basket%20Air%20Fryer%20Oven%20%286-quart%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=07CACG0BwjBdW4rXe8pTtsI&short_url=Qp6ryl&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Chefman Dual Basket Air Fryer Oven (6-quart)</a> &mdash; <strong>$69.99</strong> <s>$99.99</s> (save $30)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/QGVDLK?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Cosori%20Turboblaze%20air%20fryer%20%286%20-quart%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=07CACG0BwjBdW4rXe8pTtsI&short_url=QGVDLK&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Cosori Turboblaze air fryer (6 -quart)</a> &mdash; <strong>$89.99</strong> <s>$119.99</s> (save $30)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/QWdZgW?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Chefman%20multifunctional%20digital%20air%20fryer%20%2810-quart%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=07CACG0BwjBdW4rXe8pTtsI&short_url=QWdZgW&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Chefman multifunctional digital air fryer (10-quart)</a> &mdash; <strong>$79.99</strong> <s>$139.99</s> (save $60 with Prime)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/Q4b2KX?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Ninja%20Air%20Fryer%20Pro%20XL%20%286.5-quart%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=07CACG0BwjBdW4rXe8pTtsI&short_url=Q4b2KX&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Ninja Air Fryer Pro XL (6.5-quart)</a> &mdash; <strong>$129.99</strong> <s>$169.99</s> (save $40)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/92b781?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Ninja%20Foodi%206-in-1%20FlexBasket%20air%20fryer%20%287-quart%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=07CACG0BwjBdW4rXe8pTtsI&short_url=92b781&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Ninja Foodi 6-in-1 FlexBasket air fryer (7-quart)</a> &mdash; <strong>$119.99</strong> <s>$179.99</s> (save $60)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/92b78D?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Ninja%20DoubleStack%20XL%202-basket%20air%20fryer&object_type=article&object_uuid=07CACG0BwjBdW4rXe8pTtsI&short_url=92b78D&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Ninja DoubleStack XL 2-basket air fryer</a> &mdash; <strong>$209.99</strong> <s>$249.99</s> (save $40)</p></li></ul><h2>Best blender deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>Trying to break your Starbucks habit? Invest in a fancy brewer for your home, like the Ninja Specialty Coffee Maker. It happens to be on sale for just under $100 ahead of October Prime Day, which is 41% in savings and matches its Black Friday price from last year. It features four brewing styles (classic, rich, over ice, and specialty brew), six brewing sizes (cup, XL cup, travel mug, multi-serve travel mug, half carafe, and full carafe), and a fold-away milk frother. That means you can create anything from hot or ice lattes and macchiatos to cappuccinos and iced coffee from the comfort of your kitchen. </p><h3>More coffee maker deals</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/ao5pAe?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Keurig%20K-Mini%20Coffee%20Maker&object_type=article&object_uuid=07CACG0BwjBdW4rXe8pTtsI&short_url=ao5pAe&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Keurig K-Mini Coffee Maker</a> &mdash;

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>Significantly cheaper than KitchenAid mixers, Instant Pot makes its own six-speed tilt-head stand mixer to help you tackle all sorts of jobs &mdash; from kneading bread dough to mixing up a major batch of cookies. Just last week, it was on sale for $115, but a week ahead of Prime Day, it's now down to $108.46 when you use the on-page coupon. That's still about $10 shy of its most recent Prime Day price, so it might drop further. Regardless, it's still a great deal for the 6.3-quart stainless steel stand mixer with a 400-watt motor and six mixing speeds.</p><h3>More stand mixer deals</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/aR86lK?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Hamilton%20Beach%20Electric%20Stand%20Mixer%20%284-quart%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=07CACG0BwjBdW4rXe8pTtsI&short_url=aR86lK&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Hamilton Beach Electric Stand Mixer (4-quart)</a> &mdash;

Mine's the 'Lover Girl' era. </p><p>Don't worry, this <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-sites-for-serious-relationships-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">dating</a> trend isn't a catchy <a href="https://mashable.com/article/online-dating-app-buzzwords-ghosting-fleabagging" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">buzzword to describe bad behaviour</a>. Rather refreshingly, it describes people who proudly call themselves romantic, those who are embracing their soppy side &mdash; something that's historically been regarded as a bit cringe, or something we should hide. </p><p>The Lover Girl dating trend is about tossing aside that boring cynicism and disdain. Get in, girlies, we're embracing our love of romance and we don't care if you don't think we're cool. </p><p>We're in great company, too. Sixty percent of UK women surveyed by Bumble identify as Lover Girls and are "celebrating romance with renewed enthusiasm," according to the dating app. Fifty-seven percent of those surveyed would proudly call themselves romantic at heart, with 51 percent embracing qualities like thoughtfulness and passion in their quest for love. Old-school romantic gestures are also having a moment, with 42 percent loving unexpected gifts, 42 percent enjoying forehead kisses, and 38 percent liking handwritten love notes. </p><p>What does Lover Girl-ishness look like in the dating realm? Well, it starts with knowing what you want and being intentional about finding it. Forty-seven percent of single folks say they're clearer about their dating goals, and 40 percent are focusing on quality over quantity when it comes to dates.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

Historically, people have <a href="https://mashable.com/article/romantic-comedy-genre-snobbery" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">looked down upon rom-com movies</a> and romantic literature, with some people patronisingly referring to these genres as "chick lit" or regarding them as artistically inferior. I don't need to spell out why devaluing art that's typically made <em>for </em>and<em> by </em>women is deeply misogynistic, but if you would like to read more about this particular side effect of existing in a patriarchy, then <a href="https://mashable.com/article/romantic-comedy-genre-snobbery" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">here's a piece I wrote about romcom snobbery.</a> Romantic fiction is also having a major moment <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/magazines/style-magazine/article/booktok-romance-fiction-cameron-capello-dgs5h6pg2" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">thanks to TikTok</a> &mdash; specifically BookTok and their love for all things spicy. </p><p>In any case, I'm glad we're all going public about our love of romance &mdash; something we've typically been made to feel a bit embarrassed or cringey about. As Bumble's sex and relationship expert, Dr. Caroline West, says, "It's historically been a bit 'uncool' to admit that you are romantic &mdash; but this shouldn't be the case, so now is the time to drop being 'coy' and embrace a season for Lovers."&nbsp;</p><p>"Being confident and intentional when you date can be a really attractive quality. Bumble's research suggests that we're embracing our emotions this year, with over a third of people being more intentional about getting what they want when it comes to romance and dating," adds West. <strong> </strong></p><p>This is one <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-apps-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">dating</a> trend that requires mass adoption, in my view. If everyone can embrace just even the smallest crumb of romance, then we can finally bridge the gap between fiction and reality. Everyone needs to step into their romantic hero/heroine light. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Best Buy's event, which is being framed as a countdown to the holiday season, is technically split up into several sale events that kicked off on Sept. 27 and run through Oct. 25. Quietly baked into the agenda is one of its iconic 48-hour flash sales that just happens to fall Oct. 8 and 9 &mdash;&nbsp;the same <a href="https://mashable.com/article/when-does-october-prime-day-start-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">start and end dates</a> as Amazon's October Prime Day.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>If you're still riding with Baby's First 4K TV from 2018, you're probably putting up with the laggiest interface ever. Rather than throwing it out the window once and for all, <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/services/recycling/pcmcat149900050025.c?id=pcmcat149900050025" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">recycle it at a Best Buy location</a> and then finally make that upgrade to a nice, new QLED.

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>While Apple, Sony, and Bose tend to get most of the hype around earbuds, there are plenty of other brands that sneak in there and surprise us. Amazon happens to be one of them with the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/amazon-echo-buds-2-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">2021 Amazon Echo Buds</a>. They provide excellent noise-cancellation and are compatible to any system not prioritizing Android or iOS.</p><p>Normally $139.99, they're already a steal for a pair of earbuds with active noise cancellation. But ahead of Prime Day, they're down to $34.99 saving you $105 for 71% off.</p><h2>Best AirPod deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>With the sale just a week away, we're seeing price cuts on the Series 9, Ultra 2, and even the 46mm Series 10. Last week, we did see a nice $30 markdown on the 42mm Series 10, but we're expecting that we might have to wait until Prime Day nears, or officially starts, to see that price drop again. In the meantime, the $100 price cut on the Series 9 watches is welcome, and we'll likely see them get phased out after this fall shopping season, making it a good time to pick one up.</p><p>We'll be updating this page often, so be sure to check back if you're interested in grabbing the best Apple Watch deals ahead of October's Prime Day.

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p><a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-watch-series-9" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Check out our full review of the Apple Watch Series 9.</em></a></p><p>At just one year old, the Series 9 is hardly outdated. It comes with the same 18 hours of battery life as the Series 10 and many of the same fitness features. While you'll get a slightly larger display with the newer Apple Watch and a sleep apnea sensor, you'll save $100 on the Series 9 because it's the "old" Apple Watch. Both watches have the same 2,000-nit max brightness, which Mashable Senior Editor Stan Schroeder said was one of the best reasons to grab the watch. Overall, if you've never bought into the Apple Watch ecosystem and want to save some cash, this Series 9 deal is a decent bang for your buck.</p><h3>More early Apple Watch deals</h3><p><strong>Series 10</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/9lweo0?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20Watch%20Series%2010%20%2846mm%2C%20GPS%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=05qpn4P4QoVo4iBhFsoI5M1&short_url=9lweo0&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple Watch Series 10 (46mm, GPS)</a> &mdash; <strong>$413.99</strong> <s>$429</s> (save $15.01)</p></li></ul><p><strong>Series 9</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/QPbj5A?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20Watch%20Series%209%20%2841mm%2C%20GPS%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=05qpn4P4QoVo4iBhFsoI5M1&short_url=QPbj5A&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple Watch Series 9 (41mm, GPS)</a> &mdash; <strong>$299</strong> <s>$399</s> (save $100)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/9wGmgA?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20Watch%20Series%209%20%2845mm%2C%20GPS%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=05qpn4P4QoVo4iBhFsoI5M1&short_url=9wGmgA&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple Watch Series 9 (45mm, GPS)</a> &mdash; <strong>$329</strong> <s>$429</s> (save $100)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/QLnX7X?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20Watch%20Series%209%20%2845mm%2C%20GPS%20%2B%20cellular%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=05qpn4P4QoVo4iBhFsoI5M1&short_url=QLnX7X&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple Watch Series 9 (45mm, GPS + cellular)</a> &mdash; <strong>$599</strong> <s>$749</s> (save $150)</p></li></ul><p><strong>SE</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/QOD3PM?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20Watch%20SE%20%2840mm%2C%20GPS%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=05qpn4P4QoVo4iBhFsoI5M1&short_url=QOD3PM&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple Watch SE (40mm, GPS)</a> &mdash; <strong>$189</strong> <s>$249</s> (save $60)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/QGVv4q?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20Watch%20SE%20%2844mm%2C%20GPS%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=05qpn4P4QoVo4iBhFsoI5M1&short_url=QGVv4q&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple Watch SE (44mm, GPS)</a> &mdash; <strong>$229</strong> <s>$279</s> (save $50)</p></li></ul><p><strong>Ultra</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/aR8GPE?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20Watch%20Ultra%202%20%2849mm%2C%20GPS%20%2B%20cellular%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=05qpn4P4QoVo4iBhFsoI5M1&short_url=aR8GPE&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple Watch Ultra 2 (49mm, GPS + cellular)</a> &mdash; <strong>$734.89</strong> <s>$799</s> (save $64.11)</p></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Getting some fresh air can make a world of difference, but not all air is worthy of inhaling. Some of it contains irritating allergens, dust, or even viruses that can mean you might spend the next week on the couch sniffling. Using an air purifier in your home can help cut down on some of those nasty microscopic elements you'd rather not inhale.</p><p>While Amazon's Prime Day Big Deal event doesn't kick off until next week, we're already seeing great discounts on air purifiers from top brands that use HEPA filtration like Coway, Shark, and Blueair. Here are some of the best air purifier deals to shop the week of Oct. 1.</p><h2>Best overall deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p><a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-airpods-max-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">AirPods Max</a> are stylish headphones with easy connectivity to boot. Just like the rest of the AirPods collection, the AirPods Max connect to iOS devices just by turning them on, plus you don't need an auxiliary app to control them, plus they have excellent audio quality and good battery life.</p><p>A big hang-up we have with the AirPods Max is their price tag &mdash; at $549, you can find headphones with the same quality for far cheaper. However, when the AirPods Max are on sale, we're all in. Ahead of Prime Big Deal Days, you can get the AirPods Max for $429, saving $120 for 22% off.

<p>Last week, we saw deals on the AirPods Pro and AirPods 4 with noise-cancelling that have since jumped back up in price. It's not uncommon to see products hit their full prices ahead of a sitewide sale, so with Prime Big Deal Days just seven days away, this isn't unexpected.</p><p>Even so, there are still savings to be had, if sparse. The AirPods Max are $120 off, putting them down at $429. It's not their lowest price ever &mdash; that honor would go to their $395 price tag we saw them hit earlier this summer &mdash; but if you really don't want to wait until Prime Day, this is a decent price to grab them at. If you don't need noise-cancelling, you can also save $10 on the newly released AirPods 4.</p><p>Below, you'll find our complete list of the best AirPod deals ahead of Prime Day.

One, they have different charging ports. Two, they have different color ways. Performance wise, you'll be enjoying the same excellent active noise cancellation and sound profile on this 2020 model that you would on the new model. The third difference, at the time of writing, is that you can grab the AirPods Max for $120 off at just $429 (if you're cool with the pink colorway), while the lowest price on the USB-C Max headphones is $540.99, an $8 markdown on their $549 price tag.</p><h3>More early AirPods deals</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/9ywNpm?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20AirPods%204&object_type=article&object_uuid=03sSWC3Rz230ChSfj1q0DOp&short_url=9ywNpm&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple AirPods 4</a> &mdash; <strong>$119</strong> <s>$129</s> (save $10)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/9wGmyp?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20AirPods%20%283rd%20Generation%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=03sSWC3Rz230ChSfj1q0DOp&short_url=9wGmyp&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple AirPods (3rd Generation)</a> &mdash; <strong>$129.99</strong> <s>$169</s> (save $39.01)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/aR8GOX?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20AirPods%20Max%20%28with%20Lightning%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=03sSWC3Rz230ChSfj1q0DOp&short_url=aR8GOX&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple AirPods Max (with Lightning)</a> &mdash; <strong>$429</strong> <s>$549</s> (save $120)</p></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

In the photos, you can see a pretty radically redesigned Pixel phone, different from both the Pixel 9 and the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/google-pixel-8a-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Pixel 8a</a> that preceded it last year.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

            iPhone 16 vs. Google Pixel 9: What are the differences?

        </a>
    </div>
<p>The main thing to note is that, if the leaks are accurate, Google is removing the camera bar that's made Pixels easily identifiable over the past few years. The Pixel 9 already started this process by turning it into more of a floating camera box than a full horizontal bar, but on Pixel 9a, there appears to be nothing of the sort. There are two camera lenses stacked horizontally in a regular-looking camera setup. </p><p>Android Headlines also pointed out the rather large bezel around the screen, which isn't exactly a surprise for a budget phone. It's impossible to say what kinds of specs or features the Pixel 9a will have based on these renders alone. The Pixel 8a was impressively close to the Pixel 8 for a much lower price, so expect Google to try and reach that again with the Pixel 9a.</p><p>It'll just look different in the process.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Completely redesigned from the original Echo Buds, the 2023 version offers a more budget-friendly approach. As Mashable reviewer SaVanna Shoemaker <a href="https://mashable.com/review/echo-buds-2023-release" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">noted</a>, "For the price, the Echo Buds are a solid pair of wireless earbuds." While they don't offer noise cancellation or have the most comfortable fit on the market, the new Echo Buds sound great, last up to 20 hours with the charging case, are simple to use, and seamlessly pair with other Alexa devices. Plus, the price is hard to beat &mdash;&nbsp;especially ahead of Prime Day. They usually cost $49.99, but you can grab a pair for just $24.99 a week before the big savings event. That's 50% off and <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B09JVG3TWX" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">matches the record-low</a> from July's Prime Day.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>After a Kindle deal drought, there's finally a light at the end of the tunnel. As of Oct. 1, you can grab the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/kindle-paperwhite-kids-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Kindle Paperwhite Kids</a> at Amazon for just $114.99 instead of the usual $169.99. That's 32% in savings and just $5 shy of its all-time low price. A boosted version of the <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-kindles" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">basic Kindle Kids</a> (which we love as a budget option), the Paperwhite Kids adds some key features like a larger display, longer battery life, double the storage, IPX8 waterproofing, and an adjustable warm light to cut down on blue light. As our reviewer noted, "It&rsquo;s a piece of kids&rsquo; tech that even the most anti-screen relatives at your next family get-together won&rsquo;t be able to grumble about." Plus, with a year of Kindle Kids+ included, your kiddo will get access to a preloaded library of age-appropriate books, games, videos, and apps.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>Just like Gemini Live and ChatGPT Advanced Voice Mode, you'll have the ability to interrupt Copilot Voice. Plus, there will be four voices you can choose from.</p><p>In an early demo Microsoft shared with Mashable, Copilot Voice spoke with filler words and disfluencies like &ldquo;ums&rdquo; and &ldquo;likes.&rdquo; The voice had a slightly metallic tone, but it&rsquo;s too early to determine if this will carry over once it rolls out to customers.</p><h2><strong>2. Copilot Vision</strong></h2><p>As you browse the web, Microsoft revealed that the upgraded Copilot can now &ldquo;see what you see and hear what you hear." </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>While most of the popular AI chatbots can handle text and images, Copilot Vision's edge is that it can interact with you while observing your browsing activity.</p><p>In other words, Copilot Vision can process text and images on your screen in <em>real time</em>, ready to jump in with answers to your questions, suggest next moves, and keep things running smoothly without interrupting your workflow.</p><p>One use case for Copilot Vision would be scrolling through Rotten Tomatoes and scratching your head on which film you should watch. With Copilot's help (again, it can see what you're doing), you can ask it which movie you should indulge in.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Tapping into Copilot Voice, the AI chatbot can respond to you verbally by saying, for example, "Oh wow, there are lots of colorful posters and different genres on the Rotten Tomatoes homepage. Anything catching your eye?"</p><p>After telling it that you have a desire to watch a comedy, Copilot Voice can chime in with funny movies that it has spotted on the page. You can even ask it for reviews.</p><p>And don&rsquo;t worry &mdash; Microsoft says it's serious about privacy and security. Your sessions are opt-in only, and once they&rsquo;re done, your data is wiped clean. No training, no tracking &mdash; just real-time help.</p><h2><strong>3.

<p>However, it takes longer to respond because it&rsquo;s carefully weighing all the options before replying. Think Deeper is ideal for those tricky, everyday decisions &mdash; like whether you should move to a new city or which car fits your lifestyle best. It&rsquo;s still in the experimental phase over at Copilot Labs, so Microsoft is counting on user feedback to help refine and improve this new skill.</p><p>In addition to these three features, Microsoft is introducing Copilot Daily, a new perk that lets users get a daily digest &mdash; a summary of news and weather &mdash; all read in their favorite Copilot Voice. </p><p>Microsoft said that it will only pull from authorized sources, including content from Hearst Magazine, Reuters, Axel Springer, and Financial Times.

<p>Yet <em>Babygirl </em>stands out among these other sexy films and series by keeping the playfulness of fucking fiercely at the center of its wilfully problematic romance.

<p>At first blush, <em>Babygirl</em>'s premise sounds almost tediously familiar: A high-powered CEO's family and job are threatened, thanks to a torrid affair with a lusty young intern.</p><p>Except Reijn genderswaps these roles, so the mighty CEO isn't a snarling Michael Douglas type; she's played by a crisp, cool Kidman. And rather than a curvy nymph swanning into their new workplace in a snug pencil skirt, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/triangle-of-sadness-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Triangle of Sadness</em></a>' Harris Dickinson strolls in with a blazer and a bored expression. And just like that, the expectations of this erotic tale are thrown off-kilter.&nbsp;</p><p>Romy Mathis (Kidman) seems to have it all: a posh Hamptons home, a luxury Manhattan apartment, a handsome, doting husband (Antonio Banderas), two lovely teen daughters Isabel (Esther McGregor) and Nora (Vaughan Reilly), and a high-power job, where she's not only respected but also a role model for women in male-dominated fields. However, deep down Romy desires to be <a href="https://mashable.com/article/humiliation-kink-sex-explained" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">disrespected, debased, and made to beg</a>. It's a wish so dark she can't even share it with her long-time partner. So when this beautiful and blas&eacute; hunk talks to her as casually as he might a barista, she's uncomfortably aroused. And he knows it.&nbsp;</p><p>Samuel (Harris) is a new take on the problematic Lolita trope: a young person (typically a girl, often a minor) who is portrayed as sexually precocious and self-aware way beyond their years. Early on, he can sense that what Romy is missing in her life is a place where she can play at being <a href="https://mashable.com/article/dom-sub-kink-dynamics-guide" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">submissive</a>. Tough but tender, Samuel is ready to be her dominant, expecting her to grovel on a dirty hotel room floor or drink a tall glass of milk just because he said so. Romy's desire is one often associated with male execs, especially in BDSM circles. The genderswapping of this May-December dom-sub relationship (the opposite of say Steven Shainberg's office-set BDSM rom-com <em>The Secretary</em>), makes for a thrillingly transgressive narrative.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Romy and Samuel's relationship is undeniably hot, thanks to the intense chemistry between Kidman and Harris. Yet it's an onscreen romance that might well make its audience squirm, because of the power dynamics, the age difference, the non-conforming gender roles, and the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/mismatched-kinkiness-vanilla-bdsm" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">kinky sex</a>. This relationship is deeply fucked up even before Romy suggests their safe word be "Jacob" &mdash; the name of her husband. And all of this works toward a lusty and liberating message that sex should be about aching emotional honesty and fun discoveries.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Babygirl </em>revels in sexual experimentation and consent.&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

In a husky voice, Samuel tells Romy to do certain things. She might blush or refuse him, and he'll urge her tell him why. It's not pressuring, it's communication. Notably, the kind of dialogue &mdash; awkward and exhilarating &mdash;&nbsp;that she can't manage to open with her sweet husband.&nbsp;</p><p>Far from the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/248892-the-zipless-fuck-is-absolutely-pure-it-is-free-of" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">"zipless fucks" </a>dreamed of by Erica Jong or idealized in erotic thrillers of the '90s, <em>Babygirl </em>uses these moments of clumsy conversation and fumbling foreplay not only to ground their sexual fantasy in a more realistic setting, but also, because there's a freedom to seeing the process here. We see the pair's chosen cheap hotel room as a sexual sandbox, where both feel liberated as playmates. The power dynamic is in effect, but pleasure is the goal both seek to find together. And perhaps because it's Kidman in the lead, <em>Babygirl </em>urges its audience to take themselves less seriously in the bedroom, and be a bit like Romy and Samuel.&nbsp;</p><h2>Nicole Kidman delivers a hot-blooded and vulnerable performance that could make her an Oscars frontrunner.&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Some will likely balk at or criticize Kidman for taking such a sexually raw role. (She faced similar critiques over <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-paperboy-review-reappraisal?taid=667d5ced6190110001edba3e&amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem%3A+Manual&amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;utm_source=twitter" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>The Paperboy</em></a>.) As Romy, Kidman is given a level of power few women in the world will ever have. And so there&rsquo;s a knowing discomfort in watching her surrender that power to some reverent dude in a necktie. As the stakes of this drama heighten through the possibility of Romy losing her job or her husband or the respect of her assistant (<a href="https://mashable.com/article/talk-to-me-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Talk to Me</em></a>'s Sophie Wilde) and daughters, there are plenty of reasons to judge this relationship. Yet within those scenes, Kidman lets loose a version of this character who is so radiantly human, so beautifully flawed, full of yearning and shame, that she is comprehendible. Even as we know, she&rsquo;s making "bad choices," we might be a relieved to watch someone dare to do that. By living vicariously through <em>Babygirl</em>'s dizzying highs and gut-churning lows, you might feel inspired to embrace the truth of yourself as Romy does over the course of this movie.&nbsp;</p><p>Kidman thoughtfully knocks herself off of the high pedestal of glamour girl movie stardom to give us this gift. While the scenes of sexual discovery can feel downright juvenile with their laughter and awkward <a href="https://mashable.com/article/mismatched-kinkiness-vanilla-bdsm" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">conversations around consent and kink</a>, <em>Babygirl</em> has a profound maturity in its psychological understanding and empathy for unconventional desires.&nbsp;</p><p>As to the Oscars, Kidman&rsquo;s win in Venice suggests she&rsquo;s in good standing this award season. Sexual liberation and unapologetic nudity certainly didn&rsquo;t hurt <a href="https://mashable.com/article/emma-stone-wins-best-actress-oscars-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Emma Stone</a> last year in the best actress race so she won for <a href="https://mashable.com/article/poor-things-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Poor Things</em></a><em>.</em> However, Kidman's age might prove a challenge. Even as there is a rise in May-December romances featuring an older woman and younger man (including Kidman's summer release <a href="https://mashable.com/article/netflix-a-family-affair-romcoms-nicole-kidman-sexism-snobbery" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>A Family Affair</em></a>), there can be a backlash against older women lusting for a younger man, as we&rsquo;ve seen in the mixed reception of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/netflix-a-family-affair-romcoms-nicole-kidman-sexism-snobbery" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>The Idea of You</em></a><em>, </em>a rom-com about a middle-aged single mom hooking up with a 20-something boyband member. </p><p>Kidman is helped, however, by being surrounded by strong performances. Harris is finely tuned at the cross-section of lusty fantasy and irksome reality, playing a character who maintains a sultry mystique, justified by his place in Romy&rsquo;s conflicted perspective. Banderas warmly portrays a loving partner/father, edging the fun of the affair with the pain of his inevitable discovery of it. Wilde withers as a keen assistant. McGregor brings a free-spirited Gen Z sense of sexual liberation as Romy&rsquo;s queer daughter with a love triangle of her own, while Reilly succinctly captures the sweet innocence of a child that might well be shattered by the cracking of her mother&rsquo;s all-mighty facade.&nbsp;</p><p>Altogether, the cast makes <em>Babygirl</em> a stunner, landing silly moments as well as sexy ones. Emotionally naked, unapologetically provocative, and defiantly playful, Reijn's film joyfully explores the complicated ties that bind. Amid stiff competition, she delivers one of the sexiest, most thrilling films of the year.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Babygirl </em>was reviewed out of its North American premiere at the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/tiff-2024-preview" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">2024 Toronto International Film Festival</a>.

<p>As someone who got a chance to get some hands-on experience with the Galaxy Chromebook Plus, I can confirm that it is razor thin.

Now, all models will incorporate Chat with Gemini, but Chromebook Plus models are getting even more. New tools include Help me read, Live Translate, and a Quick Insert key.</p><h3>Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11-inch</h3><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>With an 11-inch screen, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet focuses on portability. The compact size, the same as the smallest iPad Air model, is easy to throw in any back. Plus, it's a 2-in-1 style laptop. The kickstand and detachable keyboard allows you to use it as a tablet. It's compatible with USI 2.0 styluses, but unfortunately, it doesn't come with a pen. It has 8GB RAM and 128GB SSD. Like other tablets, it includes two cameras, a front-facing camera of 5MP and a back-facing camera of 8MP.</p><p>It costs $349 and will be available in October 2024.</p><h3>Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus</h3><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>This launch also debuts Samsung's first Chromebook Plus. Like the Lenovo, it emphasizes portability, measuring 11.8 mm in thickness and weighing just 2.58 pounds despite its 15.6-inch screen. It has 8GB RAM with 256GB SSD as well as an Intel Core 3 100U processor. Outfit with all of the new Gemini features announced at this launch, it's a promising debut in the Chromebook line-up.</p><p>While we haven't gotten our hands on the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus, it's hard not to compare it to the Apple MacBook Air 15-inch model, which starts with 8GB of RAM and 256GB SSD, just like Samsung's Chromebook Plus. However, Samsung's is even lighter, measuring about .8 pounds less and 4mm slimmer. Despite their similar stature, that says nothing of how the two compare in processing &mdash; something we'll just have to measure ourselves.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Chromebook will be available in October 2024 and costs $699 &mdash; $600 less than the MacBook Air (M3) 15-inch laptop.</p><h2>New Chromebook Plus features</h2><p>The new Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus highlights the latest features Google is unveiling, however, all Chromebook Plus models will eventually see the latest updates. All of these features will be available through automatic updates coming later in October. Here's are the new features to expect:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Quick Insert key:</strong> Now included on keyboards, you'll find the Quick Insert Key, which launches a menu of shortcuts like Help me write, emojis and GIFs, recently visited links, and Google Drive integrations. The Quick Insert key is coming to the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus to start, but will eventually be available on all Chromebook Plus models next year. Users on standard Chromebooks can use the keyboard shortcut (Launcher Key + F) to access the same menu.</p></li><li><p><strong>Help me read:</strong> Google's Help me write composes emails and more to help you sound more eloquent and now the Help me read tool, summarizes anything you need to read, including PDFs and websites. To access the Help me read tool, just give the mouse a right click, and you'll receive a bulleted summary of the most important takeaways.</p></li><li><p><strong>Recorder app:</strong> This AI-powered tool automatically creates transcriptions on Google Meet, Zoom, and more. It automatically detects different speakers while capturing the audio.</p></li><li><p><strong>Built-in video call features:</strong> To make all your digital meetings better, two new features boost your mic and video quality. A studio-style mic reduces background noise to deliver clearer audio. Plus appearance effects adjust brightness and lighting for an enhanced look. Essentially, it makes you look like you have a professional ring light look without actually having one.</p></li><li><p><strong>Live Translate:</strong> Using AI, Google now automatically produces like translations for whatever you're doing, whether it be video calls, files, YouTube videos, or livestreams. It's currently available in over 100 languages.</p></li></ul><h2>New features on all Chromebooks</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Chat with Gemini:</strong> To access Gemini chat, you no longer need to open up the browser, as it comes pinned to the Chromebook shelf.</p></li><li><p><strong>Google One AI Premium plan at no cost for three months:</strong> This plans provides access to Gemini advanced. Chromebook Plus purchases come with 12 months of the plan.</p></li><li><p><strong>Welcome Recap:</strong> When you log back into your Chromebook, the Welcome Recap tells you exactly where you left off and provides suggestions on meetings you need to join and sites you were last browsing.</p></li><li><p><strong>Focus mode:</strong> Essentially a more advanced 'Do Not Disturb', Focus mode blocks out notifications and lets you create the perfect environment to get work done. You can choose a set amount of time for your study time and even play soundscapes and white noise.</p></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Despite its close proximity to our solar system, Barnard's star is too faint to see with the naked eye. A simple eight-inch amateur telescope should be able to spot it in deep <a href="https://mashable.com/category/space" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>space</u></a>, though.&nbsp;</p><p>This special star, a target of exoplanet searches for over a century, has a long history of false positive planet detections. Six years ago, an international team of researchers thought they had found a planet three times larger than Earth, just outside the so-called <a href="https://mashable.com/article/exoplanets-water-milky-way-galaxy" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">habitable zone</a>, in the Barnard's star system.

At the time it was considered an unconfirmed candidate, but the lead scientist had said in a statement then that he was "99% confident that the planet is there." He cautioned, however, that the team would continue to observe the star to rule out other "possible, but improbable" explanations.&nbsp;</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>The radial velocity technique looks for subtle changes in the frequency of starlight as seen from Earth. The gravitational tug of an orbiting planet is thought to cause little wobbles in the light measurements. But sometimes astronomers can be fooled: What might appear to be a planetary signal could in fact be little spots on the surface of the star, causing a false detection.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the 2018 super-Earth candidate was proposed, other astronomers' follow-up studies have formally refuted its existence, including this most recent one. In 2021, a team led by astronomer Jack Rubin <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ac0057" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>conducted nearly 120 new observations</u></a> with an instrument on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope in Texas and found the mistaken signal was associated with the star's 145-day rotation period.&nbsp;</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-gaE_FDLXAz4"></div>
</div>


<p>The clue that there was a misinterpretation came from the fact that the strongest signal coincided with a period when stellar activity was also strong. In 2022, <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ac7ce6" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>another team</u></a> found that the planetary signal was unlikely.&nbsp;</p><p>But that wasn't the first time the star had tricked astronomers into thinking it had planets. Astronomer Peter van de Kamp thought he had discovered two gas giant planets around Barnard&rsquo;s star, the first as long ago as the 1960s. <a href="https://hpf.psu.edu/2021/05/17/barnard/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Some astronomers say</a> he may have died believing he was the first to ever locate exoplanets.

Other verifying observations came from the Roque de los Muchachos and Calar Alto observatories in Spain and the La Silla Observatory in Chile.

<p>The bad news: Even if the star were about 2,500 degrees cooler than the sun, the planet would still be too hot for liquid water to exist on its surface, and not likely to be habitable, said lead author Jonay Gonz&aacute;lez Hern&aacute;ndez.

I'd be uneasy, for instance, if my brain surgeon had a vast meme collection &mdash; put down the phone, pick up the scalpel.</p><p>Politicians, however, are in a more complicated position.

Today's presidential campaigns are Too Online, and it's to the point where real-life issues might get lost in the noise of memes and digital posturing.</p><p>This isn't to say both campaigns are the same; they're not. However, both candidates have leaned heavily into online spaces, albeit very differently. Kamala Harris' campaign has embraced popular internet trends like "<a href="https://mashable.com/video/stephen-colbert-kamala-harris-brat-coconut-tree-memes" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Brat Summer</a>" and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kamalahq/video/7400838392373595423?lang=en" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">viral TikTok sounds</a> like <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kamalahq/photo/7394504839306169631?lang=en" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Chappell Roan's "Femininomenon"</a> to <a href="https://time.com/7017076/kamala-harris-memes-social-media-young-voters/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">court young voters</a>. Donald Trump's camp, on the other hand, has veered into race-baiting <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-fringe-online-claim-immigrants-eating-pets-debate-trump-rcna170759" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">edgelord memes</a>, such as baseless claims about Haitian immigrants eating pets, framing it as a crucial election issue for his base. </p><p>The difference remains stark: Harris risks coming across as cringe-worthy or overly focused on online voters, while Trump pushes dangerous, often fabricated ideas to rile up his fervent supporters.</p><h2>Campaigning in the Meme Age</h2><p>So, how are these campaigns "too online"? First, let's acknowledge that it's likely not actually the candidates themselves. Trump famously <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/12/29/politics/donald-trump-computers-internet-email/index.html" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">doesn't use a computer</a> &mdash; his phone is seemingly just a machine for posting tweets or updates on <a href="https://mashable.com/article/donald-trump-taylor-swift-endorsement-truth-social" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Truth Social</a> &mdash; and I doubt Harris or her running mate Tim Walz are scrolling all that much.

The world is, after all, an online world.</p><p>"Candidates can really set the agenda [on social media] and make sure that people are talking about the things that they want people to pick up on," said Dr. Caroline Leicht, a researcher at the University of Southampton who studies media and political communication with <a href="https://theconversation.com/kamala-is-brat-an-expert-explains-the-kamala-harris-memes-flooding-the-internet-235250" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">a focus</a> on social media. </p><p>Leicht added: "With social media, there are these opinion leaders who then take over the conversation and spread the message further. So it's really free advertising in a way."</p><p>Harris' campaign, in particular, has capitalized on this free advertising. A spokesperson <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/08/13/2024/kamala-harris-campaign-online-backlash-kamalahq" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">told Semafor</a> that their online strategy aims to "meet voters where they are." After President Joe Biden dropped out of the race in July, Harris saw a <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/538/harris-ride-memes-white-house/story?id=112522095" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">spike in online interest</a>. The memes worked &mdash; but maybe they learned the wrong lesson. The excitement mattered more than the memes. Voters welcomed a fresh face on the ticket, and memes followed naturally. You can't force a meme. Over-prioritizing an online presence risks becoming a distraction, emphasizing engagement that doesn't necessarily translate to votes. Focusing too much on crafting viral content or having the most polished online presence could be a damaging fool's errand. Let's not forget Hillary Clinton's attempt to connect with young voters in 2020. Her use of the phrase <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2020/11/hillary-clinton-pokemon-go-to-the-polls-sexism.html" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">"Pok&eacute;mon Go to the polls"</a> got a lot of attention online, but none of it was positive. The phrase was endlessly memed and mocked. </p><p>To be fair, the Harris campaign has said its hope is to capitalize on trends, not create them.</p><p>"We're leveraging organic viral trends and online energy for V.P. Harris's presidential bid to do two big, and election-winning things: bring the conversation about the stakes of this election to the places a lot of our voters are getting their news from and two, transfer the enthusiasm we're seeing online to grow our grass-roots supporter network,&rdquo; Seth Schuster, a spokesman for the Harris campaign, told the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/04/style/harris-trump-political-memes.html" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>New York Times</em></a> in August.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>The campaigns must realize that most people aren't as online as they are. Do you know who works on campaigns? People who spend all day online. Spending all day online is an easy way to get fooled into thinking it matters more than it does. </p><p>Pew data&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/03/26/about-three-in-ten-u-s-adults-say-they-are-almost-constantly-online/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">showed that</a>&nbsp;44 percent of people between the ages of 18-49 say they go online "almost constantly," but this could be anything from Googling to emailing to, yes, posting memes. That number drops steeply with older folks. Just 22 percent of those between the ages of 50-64 say they were that online. The number craters to 8 percent of those 65 and older. Do you know who votes? Older people. The type of folks who might actually care that Harris <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/23/us/politics/dnc-social-media-influencers.html" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">did three interviews</a> with influencers before a mainstream TV sit-down. (Though, of course, she has courted older voters, too, with moves like <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/harris-teams-oprah-broaden-outreach-persuadable-voters/story?id=113853644" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">her interview</a> with Oprah, a Baby Boomer icon.) Fifty-five percent <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">of the electorate</a> was 50 or older in the last presidential election. Meanwhile, 67 percent of folks between the ages of 18-49 didn't vote &mdash; and that is a much better turnout than in non-presidential elections. </p><p>In other words, the most online folks aren't reliable voters. The people seeing your campaign's memes might not cast a ballot. Or, worse, the memes could turn them off because they might not appear genuine. </p><p>That's how you get the Harris campaign sending out a Dril tweet and then Dril &mdash; perhaps the most influential Twitter poster of our time &mdash; <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/dril-kamala-harris-trump-post-1235084267/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">immediately hating it</a> in a very public, <a href="https://x.com/dril/status/1821649007208493361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1821649007208493361%7Ctwgr%5E2b793cdbc145c6f7d6e3cc672e42eeaa3f5b3072%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.indy100.com%2Fviral%2Fdril-harris-walz-press-release" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">very direct way</a> that wasn't a good look at all<em> </em>for the VP.

<p>Or, less seriously, being super online risks the Harris campaign looking cringe to younger voters or out-of-touch with others.

<p>Trump, however, ran with the Facebook rumor on the national debate stage, screaming, "They're eating the dogs!" &mdash; something everyday voters would have<em>&nbsp;</em>to find ridiculous. What began as a meme soon <a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/185879/jd-vance-donald-trump-debate-memes-migrants-pets" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">became another meme</a>, with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/09/13/eating-cats-springfield-ohio-meme-x-tiktok-campaign/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">some mocking Trump and Vance and others supporting them</a>.

With time, everywhere you looked online, people were posting about eating dogs and cats. Is this really what's going to win over the <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/who-are-the-undecided-voters-and-what-are-they-thinking" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">vanishingly few</a> undecided voters?

Vance even admitted it's probably made up. "If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that's what I'm going to do," he said in an interview with CNN. In other words, it's just shitposting...but, you know, as an effort to get access to the nuclear codes. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>But the Trump campaign really does seem to think shitposting is a winning strategy. They've rolled out what <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/20/g-s1-23911/how-trump-and-vances-tour-of-dude-influencers-might-help-them-win" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">NPR dubbed</a> a tour of "dude influencers." Trump has talked with some of the pre-eminent right-leaning and  rightwing online bros, like Logan Paul, Tucker Carlson, and Adin Ross. These are the sorts of folks that right-leaning young men might find controversially funny or interesting. In short, it's a press tour for male shitposters.  </p><h2>A need for balance</h2><p>Clearly, a digital presence matters &mdash; 2016 showed us that. What was 2016 if not a referendum on the internet's power, with Trump seemingly tweeting his way into the White House? It makes some sense, then, that the Harris campaign recently <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/08/kamala-harris-ad-placements-trump-1236042810/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">spent $200 million</a> on digital ad-buys, which was a record amount. But there's a line between effective online engagement and over-reliance. Maybe we don&rsquo;t need Tim Walz narrating memes aloud, and we definitely don&rsquo;t need any more rightwing cat memes. </p><p>As Dr. Leicht notes, "There is a very difficult balance to find, and I don't think there's a one-size-fits-all solution." </p><p>For most voters, a campaign's memes won't change their vote. Even young voters won't likely cast a vote based on online presence. Polls show <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/22/politics/young-voters-election-issues/index.html" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">they care about economic issues</a> &mdash; like most voters &mdash; and mostly don't support sending military aid to Israel or the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Posting online matters for attention purposes, but from there, campaigns need to have something tangible to offer. </p><p>Focusing too much on memes also opens the door for errors &mdash; like becoming the next "Pok&eacute;mon Go to the polls" moment. There's a fine line between being savvy and losing sight of what's really important to constituents. The Harris campaign risks falling into the latter category with its meme obsession, while the Trump campaign has gone too far down the rabbit hole of internet conspiracies.</p><p>Perhaps I&rsquo;m biased, being so entrenched in the online world. I'm always logged on, and it makes me think&nbsp;they're<em>&nbsp;</em>always logged on. But I'd argue it takes one to know one, and it&rsquo;s safe to say these campaigns have become Too Online. They've started confusing the digital world with the real one. </p><p>It's time to log off a little &mdash; <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/touch-grass" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">touch grass</a>, if you will &mdash; or, <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/11/monograph/chapter/2326652" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">more</a> <a href="https://isps.yale.edu/research/field-experiments-initiative/lessons-from-gotv-experiments" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">importantly</a>, go <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/30/republicans-alarm-trump-ground-game-00181577" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">knock on more doors</a>. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The image on the left, a green box of premium quality "Olde Belgium" lager, is actually a throwback to <a href="https://mashable.com/article/only-murders-in-the-building-season-3-ending-explainer" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">the end of Season 3</a>. This is the case of beer that Sazz (Jane Lynch) brings to Charles (Steve Martin), shortly before she's killed. "I got a cold case for ya," says Sazz, but Charles suggests fetching the 1966 Argentinian Malbec from his apartment instead. If only they'd stuck to lager.</p><p>The second image is a mockup poster of the apparently upcoming <em>Only Murders in the Building</em> movie adaptation, complete with the names of the core cast &mdash; Eugene Levy, Eva Longoria, and Zach Galifianakis &mdash; and a line promising the film will be "only in theaters this Christmas".</p><h2>Episode 2, "Gates of Heaven"</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>On the left we have the small pig that Oliver (Martin Short) and Mabel (Selena Gomez) discover in the bathroom of the abandoned apartment opposite Charles' &mdash; in the West tower. This appears to have been the place where the killer sniped Sazz from, so we're guessing the pig will surely be significant down the line? We don't know who exactly it belongs to, but it makes a grunting bid for freedom at the end of the episode when it flees through the apartment's open door.</p><p>On the right are some playing cards, presumably representing the game of "Oh Hell" that Oliver and Mabel play with "the sauce family" who live opposite Charles. Could the game itself be some kind of clue? It could also represent the poker game Sazz set up for Charles on set of <em>Brazzos</em> back in the day, described in a moving moment in the episode as the time Sazz "found friends" for the lonely star of the show. </p><h2>Episode 3, "Two for the Road"</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Of course, the object on the left is a ham radio. These radios play a key roll in episode 3, with Mabel, Oliver, and Charles finally going some way to revealing their mystery right before the end credits. "Howard [Morris, Michael Cyril Creighton's character] was clocking the same song on the radio," says Oliver, after he and Mabel break into an impromptu rendition of the theme tune for 1986 sitcom <em>Perfect Strangers</em>. "Yes, a person came on the line and said, 'Meet me at 445.'"</p><p>The group quickly works out that this is a frequency, but when they tune into it they receive a cold warning. "You shouldn't be on this frequency," says the strange voice that responds. "The last person who came around asking these questions got killed."</p><p>The object on the right is less mysterious. It's a screenshot of a web search for "squatters rights NYC", with the following sentence highlighted: "a squatter can be considered a legal tenant in as little as 30 days." This is a callback to Mabel's plan to stay in the abandoned apartment in the West tower of The Arconia, now that she doesn't have her own place.</p><h2>Episode 4, "The Stunt Man"</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2>What is Connections?</h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <a class="text-gray-600" href="https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1679674590203723778?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(opens in a new window)">

</blockquote>
<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>
<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. Like <em>Wordle, </em>you can share the results with your friends on social media.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Subscribing to dating apps and sites is also a way less intimidating way of meeting someone compared to a face-to-face situation. If you find the idea of meeting people slightly terrifying, these apps can help you face your fears from the comfort of your own home.  </p><h2>Is online dating worth the hassle?</h2><p>Sentiments aside, we have some hard data to back our reasoning for Why Online Dating Is Worthwhile&trade;: <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/2158/online-dating/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Statista</u></a> predicted that the online dating audience will grow to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/417654/us-online-dating-user-numbers/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">53.3 million</a> by 2025, compared to 44.2 million users in 2020. A <a href="https://qz.com/1546677/around-40-of-us-couples-now-first-meet-online/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>study</u></a> from Stanford released in 2019 asserted that online dating is officially the most common way for couples to meet, rounding out at nearly 40 percent of couples having first met online.</p><p>This pre-pandemic prediction came before the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/cuffing-season-2020-dating-app-increases-hinge-match" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">COVID-era dating app sign-ups surge</a>. Though people are eager to get back to doing as many things IRL as possible now, dating apps are still a great place to find someone, whether you want a <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-sites-for-serious-relationships-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">relationship</a> or are just looking to <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-hookup-apps-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">get nasty</a>.</p><p>And yes, though there are <a href="https://mashable.com/article/tinder-bumble-hinge-okcupid-grindr-dating-app-algorithms" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">algorithms</a> that dictate what profiles pop up on your screen, we firmly believe that the stars aligning still comes into play. After all, the person who signs up on the app and is looking for love at exactly the same time you are is up to fate and the universe, proving that online dating romance is very much alive and well.</p><p>Because it's not 2007 anymore, the need for mobile-friendly online dating isn't just a millennial thing &mdash; <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-sites-apps-over-40-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">people over 40</a> don't have time to sit around at their home desktops, either. Dating sites that are older than most members of Gen Z (like Match and eharmony) have been forced to give serious attention to their smartphone counterparts if they don't want to be outgrown.</p><p>However, that statistical promise still requires patience and a game plan,&nbsp;the game plan is choosing the dating app with features that best fit your lifestyle &mdash; and the lifestyle of the type of person you're looking for. Are you looking for an <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-hookup-apps-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">app strictly for sex</a> or an app <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-sites-for-serious-relationships-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">more serious than Tinder</a> but less serious than eharmony?

Paid sites provide access to premium features that give you the best chance of finding something special.</p><h2>What is the best dating site?</h2><p>We're sorry to break it to you like this, but there isn't a single dating site that is better than the rest.

      <description><![CDATA[These travel-friendly VPNs can secure your connection and unblock streaming sites.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/roundups/02knynnbRdVUDo4dkB7UxAD/hero-image.png" alt="Laptop on table with map on wall"><p>Travelling requires a lot of planning. You need to be prepared with a checklist of essentials, and then pack everything in such a way that you're not left with a crumpled mess of belongings on the other side. </p><p>Something you don't need to pack is a VPN, but it should still be at the top of your list. Why? These security services protect your data and personal information when you're travelling, as well as providing access to top streaming sites from around the world. So whether you're dreaming of getting away, planning your next big trip, or in the departure lounge, you need a VPN by your side.</p><h2>What is a VPN?</h2><p><a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">VPNs</a> provide protection for your data and identity when you're online by creating an encrypted tunnel for your online traffic. This protects your personal information by hiding your IP address, and allowing you to safely use public WiFi hotspots. </p><p>This means that your internet traffic can't be tracked and recorded by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) or other third party, wherever you are in the world.</p><h2>Do you need a VPN for travelling?</h2><p>A VPN is an essential when you're travelling for two key reasons: encryption of your web traffic and access to the websites and apps you use when you're at home.</p><p>Any sort of activity on an unsecured WiFi network leaves your private information and browsing habits exposed to the world, unless you're using a VPN. The likelihood of using an unsecured network is increased when you're away from home, so the need for a VPN is great. </p><p>The <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-netflix" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">need to access content</a> when travelling is also significant. There will be plenty of moments when you need to access a particular site or app when you're on the road, but you're blocked due to your location. VPNs can bypass these blockades by hiding your real IP address and connecting you to a server in the UK. This process can trick your favourite services into thinking that you're back home, meaning that you can continue to access the content you love. </p><h2>What are the most important VPN features for travelling?</h2><p>The <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-deals" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">best VPNs</a> for travelling will have certain features in common. To help you make sense of everything, we have highlighted a selection of the most important things to think about before committing to a service. You should consider connection speed, server network, number of simultaneous connections, and more:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Bandwidth</strong> &mdash; There are VPNs that place monthly caps on network bandwidth. You should avoid these services, unless you're on a free trial. If you're paying for a VPN, you need to be able to download and upload as much as you want.</p></li><li><p><strong>Connection speed</strong> &mdash; You shouldn't accept a significant drop in connection speed with a VPN, because this is going to result in buffering when you're streaming. If you're planning on watching a film or downloading a file when travelling, you should opt for something with decent connection speeds.</p></li><li><p><strong>Encryption</strong> &mdash; You are likely to come across terms like "military-grade" and "enterprise-grade" encryption. There are clearly different levels of encryption, and whilst it's important to take note of the grade provided by your VPN, the best options will all offer powerful protection for your data. </p></li><li><p><strong>Number of simultaneous connections</strong> &mdash; The best VPNs let you connect a large (or unlimited) number of devices with the same account. A service that offers multiple simultaneous connections lets you protect all of your devices with the same plan.</p></li><li><p><strong>Privacy policy</strong> &mdash; You should be aware of the data-handling, storage, and usage practices of a VPN, and these practices should be clearly laid out in a privacy policy. Most VPNs require access to your IP address, online transactions, and browsing history, plus your personal details when you sign up, so it's absolutely vital that your VPN is not going to store these details. </p></li><li><p><strong>Server network</strong> &mdash; The very best VPNs provide access to thousands of geographically diverse servers. It's useful if a VPN has a lot of servers in key locations, because you should always be able to find a stable and speedy connection for <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-streaming-movies-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">streaming</a>, shopping, or browsing anonymously when you're travelling around.</p></li></ul><p>You should also think about things like price and subscription options, but these features represent are a good place to start.</p><h2>Do you need to pay for the best VPNs?</h2><p>There are a lot of free versions of top VPNs, plus free trials of VPNs with full access to everything you get with a premium plan. With this in mind, why would you ever pay for a VPN?</p><p>The fact is you get what you pay for with VPNs. There are always catches with free versions, and it's normally in the form of limited data usage. These plans will work fine for some people, but if you're going to be streaming or downloading on the move, it isn't going to work. Free trials work differently: they come without limitations, but don't tend to last very long. Trials give you the opportunity to test out a service before committing, but this isn't a long-term solution if you're travelling.</p><p>To gain access to advanced security features without limitations on usage, you need to pay up. The best VPNs are generally the most expensive, but there are plenty of <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-cheap-vpn-services-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">cheap plans</a> out there, especially if you're willing to commit to a lengthy contract.</p><h2>What is the best VPN for travelling?</h2><p>There are a lot of VPNs out there all offering different sets of features, with different pricing plans. Finding the best service for you is not easy, so we recommend taking some time to carefully access your options and decide on what you really need from a provider. Once you have established your priorities, you can check out this roundup of the best VPNs for travel.</p><p>We have tracked down everything on offer and lined up a selection of the very best VPNs for travelling. We have tried to find something for everyone and every budget, and you can find popular services like <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/e2fc?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=ExpressVPN&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=02knynnbRdVUDo4dkB7UxAD&short_url=e2fc&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">ExpressVPN</a>, <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/76q9?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=NordVPN&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=02knynnbRdVUDo4dkB7UxAD&short_url=76q9&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">NordVPN</a>, and <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/e2no?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=CyberGhost%20VPN&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=02knynnbRdVUDo4dkB7UxAD&short_url=e2no&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">CyberGhost VPN</a> in this roundup. </p><p>These are the best VPNs for travelling in 2024.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[We've lined up all the best VPNs for accessing Max, including streaming-friendly services like ExpressVPN and CyberGhost VPN.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/roundups/046WhKBVwMV2kRzRY2RVEey/hero-image.jpg" alt="Person looking at laptop"><p>There is no such thing as too many streaming sites. Sure, you might already be subscribed to <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-netflix" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Netflix</a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-amazon-prime-video-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Prime Video</a>, but there might be hit shows and newly-releases movies still out of reach. We're not suggesting you subscribe to everything out there, but one more subscription couldn't hurt.</p><p>If you're looking to expand your content options, you might have considered Max. This popular streaming platform offers TV favourites, blockbuster movies, and new Max originals. So what's stopping you? Well, despite Max expanding into Europe in 2021, the UK is still not on the list. Try and visit the platform from the UK, and you'll be greeted with "Sorry, Max isn&rsquo;t available in your region yet."</p><p>We know this is tough news to take, but you still have the ability to stream on Max in the UK. All you need is a VPN.</p><h2>What is a VPN?</h2><p>Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) provide protection for your data and identity when you're online. They create a private network that hides your real IP address, which boosts your online privacy and anonymity, and makes sure that your activity is untraceable and secure.</p><p>It's not the easiest concept to grasp, so it can be helpful to think about a VPN like an encrypted tunnel. All of your online traffic passes through this tunnel, and nobody can see inside. Everything inside the tunnel is protected against online threats like viruses, hackers, and malware.</p><h2>Why should you consider investing in a VPN?</h2><p>VPNs are designed to provide <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-for-anonymity-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">protection for your sensitive information</a>, which is obviously a major reason to consider investing in a service. Cybersecurity is an absolutely vital part of existing online these days, and VPNs offer the features needed to secure your online world against the worst of the web. It's not all about online security and privacy though, because an increasing number of subscribers are looking to boost their content options.</p><p>VPNs can be also be used to watch content that is normally blocked in your location. By hiding your real IP address and connecting you to a server in another country, you can watch all your favourite content from that location. VPNs can bypass the geo-restrictions of the most popular streaming sites, including Max. </p><h2>How do you access Max with a VPN?</h2><p>The process of accessing Max with a <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-amazon-prime-video-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">VPN</a> is not exactly simple. First you need to do is open up your preferred VPN, select an American server in order to spoof your IP to a U.S. address, and then head to Max. This makes Max think you're in the U.S. when you're actually in the UK. The next step is to add your payment information.</p><p>Max only lets you sign up if you have a payment card that&rsquo;s tied to the U.S. If you don't have this, you'll need to follow these steps:</p><ul><li><p>Open up your preferred VPN on your iOS/Android device and connect to a server in the U.S.</p></li><li><p>Create an Apple ID/Google Play account</p></li><li><p>Register your account on the app store</p></li><li><p>Download and install the Max app</p></li><li><p>Create a new account in the Max app with your email address and password</p></li><li><p>Pay with your UK PayPal account</p></li></ul><p>We know this is a little laborious, but it's worth it.</p><h2>What should you consider before investing in a VPN?</h2><p>Rather than listing off every feature offered by the <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-deals" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">best VPNs</a>, we have highlighted a selection of the most important things to think about if you're planning on streaming with a VPN. You should look out for connection speed, server network, number of simultaneous logins, and other important features:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Connection speed </strong>&mdash; Using a VPN is likely to produce a drop in your connection speed, but you shouldn't accept anything significant. This will result in buffering, which is going to make it difficult to stream without frustration.</p></li><li><p><strong>Number of simultaneous connections </strong>&mdash;<strong> </strong>The best VPNs let you connect an unlimited number of devices with the same account.

If this is all very new to you, you've probably got a lot of questions. Don't worry, because we can help. </p><p>We've done all the hard work for you and thoroughly researched these services to provide the information that matters to you. Here's everything you need to know about VPNs.</p><h2>What is a VPN?</h2><p>VPNs (or Virtual Private Networks) provide important protection for your data and identity when you're online. They offer this <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-for-anonymity-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">online privacy and anonymity</a> by creating a private network that hides your real IP address (digital location). This means that all of your activity is untraceable and secure. </p><p>Basically, you can think about VPNs as encrypted tunnels through which all of your online traffic passes through. Nobody can see into the tunnel, and everything inside the tunnel is protected against online threats like viruses, hackers, and malware.  </p><h2>Do you need a VPN?</h2><p>Any sort of activity on an unsecured WiFi network leaves your private information and browsing habits exposed to the world, unless you're using a VPN. There's no need to panic, because whether you're sending important emails, doing some online shopping, or paying essential bills, VPNs make sure that everything remains private and anonymous.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>First and foremost, VPNs are designed to provide online security, but there is another reason that millions of people use these services: streaming more content from around the world. By hiding your real IP address and connecting you to a server in another location, you can trick your favourite streaming services into thinking that you are based in a different country. This means that you can watch all of the shows and films from global libraries, like all the extra content on <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-netflix" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">U.S. Netflix</a>. This is the quickest and easiest way of boosting your content options, without the need to rely on a dodgy stream.</p><h2>What should you consider before subscribing to a VPN?</h2><p>There are plenty of things that you should consider when it comes to VPNs, but we don't have all day. Instead of listing off every feature offered by the <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-deals" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">best VPNs</a>, we have highlighted a selection of the most important things to think about.</p><p>Before you make any sort of decision, you should look out for connection speed, server network, number of logins, and more important features:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Bandwidth </strong>&mdash; There are some VPNs out there that place monthly caps on network bandwidth, meaning you can only download a certain amount of data. You should avoid these services, unless you're on a free trial. If you're paying for a VPN, you should be able to download and upload as much as you want.</p></li><li><p><strong>Connection speed </strong>&mdash; Using a VPN is going to produce a drop in your connection speed, but you shouldn't accept a significant drop that is going to result in buffering. Be sure to select a VPN that doesn't negatively impact your connection speed to the point that you can't watch a film or download a file without frustration.</p></li><li><p><strong>Encryption </strong>&mdash; There are different levels of encryption, and whilst it's important to take note of the grade provided by your VPN, the best options will all offer powerful protection for your data. You are likely to come across terms like "military-grade" and "enterprise-grade," which just means that you can rely on it to do its job.</p></li><li><p><strong>Number of connections </strong>&mdash;<strong> </strong>Some VPNs let you connect an unlimited number of devices with the same account. Others limit you to just a single device. You should look out for a service that offers multiple simultaneous connections, so you can stay protected on all your devices at the same time.</p></li><li><p><strong>Server network </strong>&mdash; The very best VPNs provide access to literally thousands of geographically diverse servers. It's useful if a VPN has a lot of servers in key locations, because you should always be able to find a stable and speedy connection for <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-streaming-movies-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">streaming</a>, shopping, or browsing anonymously. It's not a straightforward case of more is better, but it's always good to have options.</p></li><li><p><strong>Privacy policy </strong>&mdash; It's worth paying special attention to the data-handling, storage, and usage practices of the VPN you are planning on using. These practices should be laid out in a privacy policy, and if they aren't clear, it's best to avoid. Most VPNs require access to your IP address, online transactions, and browsing history, plus your personal details when you sign up. If privacy is the objective, it's absolutely essential that your VPN is not going to store these details. If it does, the whole thing is kind of pointless.</p></li></ul><p>There are other things to consider, like price and subscription plans, but these features are a good place to start.</p><h2>Should you use free VPNs?</h2><p>There are plenty of <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/deals/best-vpn-for-free" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">free versions</a> of popular VPNs, plus free trials of VPNs with full access to everything you get with a premium plan. So why would you ever pay for a VPN?</p><p>As with most things in life, you get what you pay for with VPNs. There tends to always be a catch with free versions, and it's normally in the form of limited data usage. If you're just an occasional user, these plans will work fine. But if you're going to be streaming or downloading, this isn't going to work. Free trials are a little bit different: they come with everything you get in a paid plan, but obviously they don't tend to last very long. Trials are great for testing out a service before committing, but this isn't a long-term solution. </p><p>What we're saying is that the best option for streaming securely and accessing the online world without restrictions is with a paid subscription to a VPN. To gain access to advanced security features without limitations on usage, you need to pay up. The best VPNs are generally the most expensive, but there are plenty of <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-cheap-vpn-services-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">cheap plans</a> out there, especially if you're willing to commit to a lengthy contract.</p><h2>What is the best VPN?</h2><p>There are a lot of VPN providers out there all offering different sets of features, with different pricing structures. We recommend taking some time to carefully access your options, and decide on what you really need from a VPN. Once you have established your priorities, you can check out this definitive list of the best VPNs this month.</p><p>We have tracked down everything on offer and lined up a selection of the very best VPNs for streaming, shopping, and everything else. We have tried to find something for everyone and every budget, and you can find popular services like <a href="https://go.expressvpn.com/c/190434/1462855/16063" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">ExpressVPN</a>, <a href="https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=340&amp;aff_id=682%20" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">NordVPN</a>, and <a href="https://www.cyberghostvpn.com/offer/sdh_qwcvea7" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">CyberGhost VPN</a> in this list.

They are AI-powered small obstacle avoidance technology and self-washing and drying mopping pads. Not only did Eufy bravely attempt both of them without severely hiking the price tag to match, but both features are actually pretty competent &mdash;&nbsp;I wouldn't have been surprised if a cheap robovac talking this fancy talk couldn't actually walk the walk.</p><p>If you really care about the automation aspect of a robot vacuum, those two convenience-related features are reason to choose the X10 Pro Omni over similarly-priced hybrid models like the <a href="https://zdcs.link/6XyWj?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3Btemplate=gift_guide&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=Roomba%20Combo%20j7%2B&amp%3Bobject_type=roundup&amp%3Bobject_uuid=00g8uqgzNycnV4FrwYAdZnn&amp%3Bshort_url=6XyWj&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Froundup%2Fbest-robot-vacuum-and-mop-2024&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Roomba%20Combo%20j7%2B&object_type=review&object_uuid=07Iar4WA3ur4G8BzDvzAnSH&short_url=6XyWj&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Roomba Combo j7+</a> or <a href="https://zdcs.link/4Aq0k?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3Btemplate=gift_guide&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=Roborock%20Q8%20Max%2B&amp%3Bobject_type=roundup&amp%3Bobject_uuid=00g8uqgzNycnV4FrwYAdZnn&amp%3Bshort_url=4Aq0k&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Froundup%2Fbest-robot-vacuum-and-mop-2024&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Roborock%20Q8%20Max%2B&object_type=review&object_uuid=07Iar4WA3ur4G8BzDvzAnSH&short_url=4Aq0k&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Roborock Q8 Max+</a>, which still require you to manually handle the mopping pads and refill the water tank after each use or two.</p><h2>Maintenance: I simply love not touching soggy mopping pads</h2><p>Past automatic emptying, which is more common than not for a robot vacuum to have these days, the Eufy X10 Pro Omni's dock also automatically washes and dries its two mopping pads after each use. Its dock also has two large water tanks: one with clean water that refills the smaller water tank onboard the vacuum and a dirty water one that holds whatever's wrung out of the mopping pads after each use. Refilling the clean water tank and dumping the dirty water are only required every few weeks, depending on mopping frequency and intensity. I mopped my kitchen and bathroom several times a week for four-ish months and only had to deal with the tanks a couple of times. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 max-w-3xl">

<p>I have thought about the mopping pads 100 percent fewer times. The Omni X10 Pro's dock deals with them completely, washing them and then drying them with hot air to prevent that moldy wet fabric smell. You know, the exact one that I have to be near when testing a 2-in-1 robot vacuum that needs its mopping pads to be removed and washed by hand. That level of effort (and grossness) is enough to make me want to skip mopping altogether, so I think that the self-cleaning mopping pad system is actually pretty crucial for getting your money's worth out of the mop part.</p><p>The self-empty dust bag in the dock lasts even longer than the water tanks. The Eufy X10 Pro Omni vacuumed various floors in my homes almost every other day from mid-May to mid-September, and I didn't get a "full" notification until the end of that period.</p><h2>Cleaning performance: Not always spotless, but satisfactory</h2><p>Allegedly, the X10 Pro Omni dishes out 8,000 Pa of suction power &mdash; pretty high compared to the market leading 10,000 Pa seen on a few Roborock models or the alleged 11,000 Pa seen on a Yeedi model. Compared to other robot vacuums in this price range, 8,000 Pa kicks ass &mdash; on paper.</p><p>But comparing cleaning prowess based on that one suction power metric alone is kind of a moot point when not every robot vacuum brand even measures suction power in Pascals. (iRobot and Shark are the two big ones that don't.) The real test is simply how much the botvac sucks up in real life.</p><p>In my testing, the Eufy X10 Pro Omni's suction power was strong enough to pick up about 90 percent of the dry debris I threw at it on hardwood, and was about 80 percent successful at pulling hair and rice from a medium pile rug. It's not the level of thoroughness I'd achieve when taking <a href="https://mashable.com/review/dyson-v12-detect-slim" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">my Dyson</a> out for a spin, but I felt comfortable letting the Eufy X10 Pro Omni take care of the random crumbs that show up in the kitchen, as well as kitty litter in my bathroom. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 max-w-3xl">

<p>The few occasions when some debris around the edges was left behind taught me to always opt for two cleaning passes instead of one and either turbo or max suction (the strongest two out of the four). </p><p>The X10 Pro Omni's mopping performance has a similar story: It's absolutely reliable enough for keeping hard floors nice and shiny on a daily basis, especially if you're even <em>less</em> likely to mop or Swiffer by hand than you are to vacuum. I can almost always tell the difference in stain visibility when a <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-robot-vacuum-and-mop-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">hybrid robot vacuum</a> mops with one flat pad or two spinning pads, as the latter just seems to be more robust &mdash; less wiping, more scrubbing. I felt like I could trust the X10 Pro Omni's dual pad situation enough to thoroughly spot clean a marinara sauce or wine spill before the cats could get to it.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>There were a few instances where two passes and one of the higher water intensities were necessary, like a spot where I spilled sesame oil &mdash;&nbsp;just one single light pass left the hardwood feeling greasy. I also noticed that the shoe stains by the front door aren't completely gone after the X10 Pro Omni has attempted them on a few occasions, but then again, every 2-in-1 robot vacuum struggles with those.</p><h2>User friendliness and navigation: The X10 Pro Omni assimilates pretty easily</h2><p>Much of the robot vacuum experience comes from how seamless of an addition it is to your home and lifestyle. In this regard, the Eufy X10 Pro is overall a pretty polite house guest. </p><p>Its long battery life (over two hours of cleaning on one charge) means that I can comfortably queue up my "two passes for good measure" task in multiple rooms without it having to pause and charge in between. Though those extra passes might take a few extra minutes, the X10 Pro Omni isn't unbearably loud, even on max suction. The automatic emptying roar isn't so demure, but it's not a huge deal.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>But for me, the main criterion that makes a robot vacuum a polite house guest is whether or not it continually navigates to the right spot without getting lost or stuck. The X10 Pro Omni whipped up a very accurate map of my home on the first try, only requiring me to split one room (many robot vacs I test think that, like, four rooms are the same room). I only experienced the X10 Pro Omni being unable to figure out its position and returning to the dock during a handful of cleaning sessions, but queuing it up again does the trick.</p><p>As long as it's not unable to complete a task because it's physically stuck, I'm pretty satisfied. The X10 Pro Omni carves around table and chair legs with ease, finding the perfect angle to scoot around rather than giving up and sitting there. My favorite part? It hasn't eaten any cords or socks (though my cat's shoelace toy did have to be untangled from below). </p><h2>Downsides: My one major gripe feels so fixable</h2><p>Unfortunately, the X10 Pro Omni's obstacle avoidance technique is also the source of my main complaint. It's<em> so</em> cautious about not sucking up rogue pieces of laundry that it mistakes the fluffy bath mat in front of my shower as a piece of laundry to avoid. Every single time. That wouldn't be so annoying if there was an option to ignore an incorrectly-identified obstacle like several other robot vacuum apps offer, but there's no way to do that on Eufy's app. Shouldn't the AI powering the obstacle recognition want to learn and adjust?</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>This means that I have to move that rug out of the bathroom ahead of a cleaning. However, I've learned to do that with all small rugs regardless, because if the X10 Pro Omni actually does attempt to vacuum a rug, it turns up the corners and jumbles it all around. It even has a hard time gently hoisting itself over the edges my large low pile living room rug and kitchen runner.</p><h2>Is the Eufy X10 Pro Omni worth it?</h2><p>The Eufy X10 Pro Omni doesn't do... <em>anything</em> perfectly (does any robot vacuum?), but it cleans, navigates, and maintains itself competently enough to make it a front runner over a ton of older hybrid vacuums. Specifically, the X10 Pro Omni is the better value over any hybrid model that isn't equipped with those two game-changing features: small obstacle avoidance technology and self-cleaning mopping pads.</p><p>I won't pretend that there aren't some performance and navigational quirks that'll need some getting used to, but for the price, the X10 Pro Omni covers all of the bases necessary to make your day-to-day a lot easier.

<p>In my opinion, that makes the Echo Show 8 way better suited to be your family &ldquo;hub&rdquo; &mdash; located in a central location like the kitchen or dining room for easy video calls with the grandparents using Alexa. All you have to do is add contacts you&rsquo;d like to call in the Alexa app on your phone. However, it may not be a necessary purchase if you already have a tablet with great video functionality. And if you want a larger device as your smart home hub, the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/echo-show-10-amazon" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Echo Show 10</a> is an even better choice.</p><p>Regardless, the Echo Show 8 offers some other advantages for video calls in addition to its size.</p><p>On the other hand, the Echo Show 5 would be better in places where you want the device's functionality, without it being front and center &mdash; like your desk or nightstand.</p><p>And if you're a sucker for colorways, the Echo Show 8 only comes in the glacier white and charcoal color options. You can get more variety with the new Echo Show 5, which comes in glacier white, charcoal, and deep sea blue. The Echo Show 5 Kids comes in chameleon green.</p><h2>Camera and video calling</h2><p>The Echo Show 5 got a decent camera upgrade from its 1st gen version &mdash; increasing the megapixels from one to two. However, it was a whole different ball game for the Echo Show 8. While the 1st gen Echo Show 8 offered a 1 MP camera, the revamped 2021 model came equipped with a 13 MP camera, which carried over into the 2023 model. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>The image is <em>incredibly </em>crisp, and alongside the larger screen makes the Echo Show 8 the video call winner. But that&rsquo;s not even the best part: The Echo Show 8 features auto-framing functions that automatically pan and zoom the camera to keep it focused on the people in view.</p><p>Both devices also feature some handy connectivity features, like intercom to page every Alexa device in the house (&ldquo;We&rsquo;re leaving in 15 minutes, so be ready!&rdquo;) and drop-in, which allows you to video chat with any connected Alexa device.</p><h3>Zoom calls</h3><p>The Echo Show 8 can also join Zoom calls, while the Echo Show 5 can&rsquo;t. To be totally honest, I could not get the Zoom call feature to work after several tries because none of the calls I joined had a dial-in number. </p><p>I&rsquo;ll still say the Echo Show 8 wins on this one just because it&rsquo;s theoretically possible, and I&rsquo;m really hoping to be able to join Zoom calls from it soon to free up my laptop and extra monitor for in-meeting multi-tasking.</p><h2>Kid-friendly content</h2><p>During the initial setup, you can choose to make any Echo Show device a dedicated device for a kid. This gives you access to some expanded parental controls, which is great for older children, tweens, and teens that you still want to shield from some of the worst things the internet has to offer.</p><p>However, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/91bGZw?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Echo%20Show%205%20Kids&object_type=article&object_uuid=073bv393q3gg6vR5o1TbOpo&short_url=91bGZw&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Echo Show 5 Kids</a> is the first and only Echo Show that&rsquo;s bottom-to-top and side-to-side designed for kids. It features a fun design (the chameleon color looks like dinosaur scales, according to my 5-year-old), and comes with a free year of Amazon Kids (usually $5.99 per month) &mdash; which offers curated books, games, and videos just for kids far beyond what&rsquo;s available through a basic Prime membership. In addition, it comes with souped-up parental controls so you can tweak things even more.</p><h2>Alexa functionality</h2><p>Both the 2nd gen Echo Show 5 and the 2nd gen Echo Show 8 have some Alexa abilities that their 1st gen counterparts don&rsquo;t.</p><p>First up is the home monitoring function, where you can remotely access the camera on your device from the Alexa app just to check in on things. You&rsquo;ll need a WiFi connection to do it, but I had no problems getting it to work. I can imagine it would be great to check in on pets, the babysitter, or just to take a peek at your home while on vacation to make sure everything is on the up and up.</p><p>Next is the addition of motion-enabled routines. This allows Alexa to detect when you enter or leave a room and use that activity to start a routine. Fair warning, this can open a can of worms re: privacy, but it also opens up some exciting possibilities for the smart home buff. You could have Alexa read your calendar when you walk into your office, or turn off all smart-enabled devices when there&rsquo;s no motion detected in the living room &mdash; and those are just two simple ideas. With the addition of Alexa-enabled devices or smart plugs, your options open up even more. Amazon does offer ways to manage these settings if you'd like to delete recordings or manage your data.</p><p>All of these devices feature the same Alexa functionality you came to expect from the previous iteration of Echo Show devices.</p><h2>Echo Show 5 vs. Echo Show 8: Which one is better?</h2><p>For only $45 more, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/98bv7q?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Echo%20Show%208&object_type=article&object_uuid=073bv393q3gg6vR5o1TbOpo&short_url=98bv7q&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Echo Show 8</a> was the clear winner for me. Not only does it have a larger screen and a 13 MP camera with auto-framing (making it the best for video calling), it also allows you to hop on Zoom meetings, if/when you can get that function to work properly.</p><p>If video calls and Zoom meetings aren&rsquo;t your concern, then the <a href="https://zdcs.link/WmwNd?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Echo%20Show%205&object_type=article&object_uuid=073bv393q3gg6vR5o1TbOpo&short_url=WmwNd&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Echo Show 5</a> is still a great choice &mdash; like the 2nd gen Echo Show 8, the new Echo Show 5 boasts many of the same expanded Alexa functions, like home monitoring and motion detection routines.

      <description><![CDATA[Put Alexa to good use by having her manage these key household tasks.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/06IHxq3wtBUKsxUPfx819qd/hero-image.jpg" alt="Echo Show sitting on counter"><p>You already know you can ask Alexa to tell you the weather (and if it&rsquo;s rainy, she&rsquo;ll kindly suggest you bring an umbrella) but there are actually a ton more ways she can help you lead a more efficient, less stressful life. You just have to know what she can do.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><strong>1. Make a grocery list</strong></p><p>Did you finish up the last of the milk in this morning&rsquo;s cereal? Ask Alexa to add some 2% to your shopping list. Make it a family thing and remind everyone who eats in your house to tell Alexa when they&rsquo;ve finished something, too. When you&rsquo;re ready to go to the market have her read off everything you&rsquo;ve collected during the week.<br></p><p><strong>2. Entertain your dog</strong></p><p>Have to leave your best friend for a bit and don&rsquo;t want him to fret? Just say &ldquo;Alexa, play relaxing dog music in the kitchen.&rdquo; Because yes, she has a playlist for that. Maybe your pup wants something more upbeat? Ask Alexa to &ldquo;open Puppy Jams&rdquo; and she&rsquo;ll first ask how your pooch is feeling so she can tailor her musical choices to his mood. Not for nothing, Alexa is also a great initial resource when your pooch eats something he shouldn't. &ldquo;Alexa, open MyPetDoc. Are grapes bad for dogs?&rdquo; (They are.) Of course, Alexa should never replace an in-person vet visit, but she can get you started and can even connect you with a vet if you need one.<br></p><p><strong>3. Manage multiple cooking timers</strong></p><p>The pasta and the garlic bread will be done at different times, and both are <em>no beuno</em> if they go too far. Ask Alexa to set a timer for 8 minutes to get the perfect <em>al dente</em> pasta and then ask her to set another timer (4 minutes?) for the bread. While you&rsquo;re at it, ask her to how many calories are in a glass of Chianti.</p><p></p><p><strong>4. Call everyone to dinner</strong></p><p>We are tired of screaming through the house when it&rsquo;s time for dinner. Ask Alexa to save your vocal cords by doing it for you. Saying, &ldquo;Alexa, make an announcement &ndash; dinner time!&rdquo; activates every Alexa in the house with a clanging dinner bell and your voice saying &ldquo;dinner time!&rdquo; No screaming required. How quickly the kids actually show up is another thing entirely.<br></p><p><strong>5. Activate your Roomba</strong></p><p>Alexa can pair with a bunch of robot vacuums, starting and stopping cleaning by voice command. Setting it up is as simple as going into the Alexa app and searching for your vacuum. Once you find and link the device you&rsquo;re good to go. </p><p></p><p><strong>6. Order household supplies</strong></p><p>You&rsquo;re never near your list when you run out of batteries, or paper towels, or moisturizing lotion. But it&rsquo;s likely you&rsquo;re near an Alexa. Ask her to send you some AAAs, and she&rsquo;ll ship you the exact same type and brand you bought the last time, which means the task is completely off your mental list before it even went on it.</p><p></p><p><strong>7. Make a chore chart</strong></p><p>Build out a list of weekly chores for everyone in your house &ndash; bring the recycling down on Monday night, change the sheets on Sunday, even study for a Friday morning math test. Once you&rsquo;ve listed the chores, assign them to their various owners. When someone completes a chore as intended, they let Alexa know. Here&rsquo;s the best part: She keeps score. So at any moment during the week you can ask her for a &ldquo;chore score.&rdquo; At one point per completed chore, it turns things into a competition and may actually mean stuff gets done.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[Even if you don't own a smart TV, it's relatively easy to turn your TV screensaver into a photo slideshow. Here are three ways to do it.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/06Ny9bJKmgZi4ouTy87EU53/hero-image.png" alt="woman hanging art on wall"><p>Most default screensavers are pretty dull. Like, I already know my TV is a TCL &mdash; I don't need the TCL logo to be constantly present onscreen. And don't get me started on those <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-office-dvd-logo-cold-open" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>old-school bouncing DVD icons</u></a> that <em>never</em> made it into the corner.</p><p>Luckily, it's relatively easy to turn your TV screensaver into a slideshow of your own photos, so that you can see your family, friends, pets, or bygone vacations smiling back at you when you're not watching Netflix. It's a small change that can make your home feel a little cozier &mdash; a little more like <em>your </em>space<em>.</em></p><p>The best method will vary depending on your TV, so here are a few options to try.</p><h2>Option #1: Investigate your TV's cloud-based features</h2><p>Your smart TV likely includes built-in features for setting up a photo screensaver.&nbsp;</p><p>Roku, for example, has <a href="https://photostreams.roku.com/index" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Photo Streams</u></a>, which is accessible to anyone with a Roku account. Simply log in, create a new "stream," and upload your photos. From there, the Photo Streams channel should appear on your Roku menu, and your screensaver will be <a href="https://support.roku.com/article/4421919862167" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>"automatically set to Photo Streams,"</u></a> according to Roku.</p><p>Similarly, an <a href="https://amazonfiretv.blog/how-to-personalize-your-fire-tv-screensaver-with-your-own-photos-14db56867e75" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Amazon Fire TV can set a slideshow screensaver</u></a> using images you've uploaded to Amazon Photos. A <a href="https://support.google.com/googletv/answer/10070821?hl=en" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Google TV can create a screensaver</u></a> using images from Google Photos. You get the idea.</p><p></p><h2>Option #2: Opt for an add-on streaming device</h2><p>Even if you don't have a smart TV, adding a streaming device to your current TV can help you access the same features outlined above. For example, a Roku device means you'll have a Roku account, which means you can use Photo Streams &mdash; and it'll likely cost you less than $50.</p><p>An Apple TV box is especially simple to use for custom screensavers. Just open the Photos app, which should be synced with the rest of your Apple devices, and select an entire album to use.&nbsp;</p><p>You can also use AirPlay to cast photos straight from your iPhone or iPad, though that's not really a set-it-and-forget-it method. It can be helpful if you want to display a slideshow during a get-together, though!</p><p></p><h2>Option #3: Turn to the trusty USB</h2><p>Are the other options not working out? It's time to get vintage with it. Load your selections onto a USB drive, then plug it into the USB-A port on your TV. From there, many TVs will detect the drive and give you a list of options for media playback, including slideshow speed.</p><p>If you want even more control over your slideshow's pacing, you can upload all your photos into a PowerPoint presentation, set transitions between slides, and save <em>that</em> to the USB drive before you plug it in. Just be sure it's a file type compatible with your particular TV &mdash; an mp4 should do the trick in most cases.</p><p>Even if you have to do some extra work, having a custom slideshow on your TV can go a long way toward personalizing your home.&nbsp;</p><p>And if you want to use something other than your own photos? Try matching your home's aesthetic with a slideshow of open-access images, like from the <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-met/policies-and-documents/open-access#get-started-header" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Metropolitan Museum of Art's open-access collection</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The possibilities are endless, really. After all, it's your space.</p><p><br><br></p>]]></content:encoded>

The scammer told his victim that he'd failed to report to jury duty and had an active warrant for his arrest, according to the <a href="https://www.click2houston.com/news/local/2024/09/24/causes-you-to-panic-fraudsters-convince-retired-houston-man-to-deposit-60k-to-crypto-atm-in-arrest-warrant-scam/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">NBC News affiliate Click2Houston</a>. The only way the victim could get out of legal trouble? By depositing cash into a Bitcoin ATM at a nearby grocery store. </p><p>"They were pretty sophisticated and pretty adamant that, you know, you couldn't get off the phone, it had to be dealt with right now," the victim, who was only identified by the first name of Loyd, told Click2Houston. By the time Loyd had finished putting money into the Bitcoin ATM, he'd lost nearly $60,000. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Breyault says that Bitcoin ATM scammers are incredibly skilled at convincing their victims to part with their cash. Though consumers older than 60 are more likely to be targeted, the median loss in these schemes across all ages is $10,000, according to the Federal Trade Commission. The agency issued a <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/09/new-ftc-data-shows-massive-increase-losses-bitcoin-atm-scams" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">warning about Bitcoin ATM fraud</a> in September, noting that losses have increased nearly 10-fold since 2023. </p><p>Breyault says scammers are so successful because they get "people into such an agitated state emotionally that they're not able to make rational decisions." </p><p>In order to prepare consumers for that possibility, Breyault shared basic information about how Bitcoin ATMs work, whether victims can recover their losses to a scam, and warning signs that you've become a target. The FTC, which has its own list of <a href="https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2024/03/did-someone-send-you-bitcoin-atm-its-scam" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">similar tips</a>, says that if anyone sends you to a Bitcoin ATM, it's a scam. </p><h2>How do Bitcoin ATMs work? </h2><p>As cryptocurrency went mainstream, companies that sell it began to place Bitcoin ATM machines in heavily trafficked stores and businesses, says Breyault. While the number of machines varies depending on the source, one <a href="https://www.kansascityfed.org/research/payments-system-research-briefings/the-controversial-business-of-cash-to-crypto-bitcoin-atms/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">estimate published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City</a> put the figure at about 49,000. </p><p>Before the spread of those kiosks, customers needed tech savviness to create and access cryptocurrency accounts. The ATM machines make it much easier to deposit cash and purchase Bitcoin. But unlike traditional ATM machines, Bitcoin consoles don't typically allow withdrawals. </p><p>The companies that operate the machines lease a business's space, much like banks do to place their ATMs in front of consumers. However, the rapid appearance of Bitcoin ATMs has far outpaced consumer protections and education. For example, the machines inconsistently feature signs warning customers about fraud. Victims may also be told to ignore such messaging.</p><p>When scammers direct their victim to a Bitcoin ATM, they usually give specific instructions to create a new account and then to provide the thief with the QR code or digital key that provides them access to the cash. Victims may also be told to deposit the money into an established account. </p><p>Breyault says employees of stores and businesses that host Bitcoin ATMs often don't have training to spot scams underway, or the know-how to intervene. One victim was even offered a chair to sit in while spending hours stuffing thousands of dollars into an ATM, according to a <a href="https://www.aarp.org/money/scams-fraud/info-2024/crypto-atm.html" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">story reported by AARP</a>. </p><h2>Can I get my money back from a Bitcoin ATM scam? </h2><p>Once the money is deposited into an account, and the thief has the digital key to access it, the cash can be moved to another account almost instantly. This makes recovering the victim's money nearly impossible, Breyault says. </p><p>He adds that this is largely because cryptocurrency is loosely regulated. As a result, it's subject to "weak" fraud controls. Unlike fraudulent credit card spending, which banks try to flag immediately, and which can be recouped, there are no such consumer protections for Bitcoin scams. </p><p>While federal legislation could change that in the future, scammers are currently taking advantage of the "insecure technology," Breyault says.</p><p>"Nobody is immune to this,"&nbsp;he adds. "What's important to stress is that these are professional criminals. This is what they do all day, every day. They're very good at it."</p><p>The FTC advises consumers who've lost their money to a Bitcoin ATM scam to inform their bank or fund immediately, then <a href="https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">report it to the agency</a>. </p><h2>Warning signs of a Bitcoin ATM scam</h2><p><strong>1. Requests to deposit money into a Bitcoin ATM</strong></p><p>The biggest red flag is when someone asks you to deposit money into a Bitcoin ATM. This might seem like it casts too wide of a net, but Breyault says that consumers should be skeptical of any such request &mdash; even from someone they feel like they know and trust, and have met in person.</p><p>That's because some Bitcoin ATM scams involve grooming victims over time. Colloquially known as "<a href="https://www.fdicoig.gov/pig-butchering-scams" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">pig butchering</a>," like an animal being fattened before slaughter, these schemes start as online friendships or romances in order to build trust. The thief might eventually talk about crypto investing, or say they need help paying for an unexpected expense, but it's a scam designed to empty the victim's bank account. </p><p>Even if you're comfortable with crypto and have an account of your own, Breyault recommends never sharing your private key with anyone. </p><p>"That's like handing cash to them," he says. </p><p><strong>2. The person you're talking to has created a sense of urgency</strong></p><p>If someone that you're talking to, whether they're a stranger or person who feels like a friend, is insisting that you deal with a problem immediately by taking money out of your bank account, it's likely a scam, Breyault says. </p><p>Common tactics include telling the victim that they have to act now or they or a loved one will be jailed because they violated the law; that a government agency, like the Internal Revenue Service, will come to their house; or that a "risk-free" crypto deal is only available for a very limited time. </p><p>"If you are feeling pressured to act quickly, no matter how dire they make the situation sound, stop and ask a friend or a loved one," Breyault says.</p><p><strong>3. The person knows a lot about you &mdash; and seems legitimate</strong></p><p>Scammers can be very persuasive when they seem to know a lot about their victim, including where they live. But Breyault says that a lot of that information is publicly available or can be obtained via data breaches or for a small fee from data brokers. </p><p>Recently, for example, scammers have used <a href="https://mashable.com/article/sextortion-scam-uses-homes-coerce-victims" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">publicly available pictures of people's homes</a> to pressure victims in Bitcoin <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-talk-to-teens-about-sextortion" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">sextortion</a> schemes. </p><p>Scammers can also spoof phone numbers and email addresses to make it seem like they're contacting the victim from an official government agency. Breyault recommends people avoid trusting communication from seemingly legitimate sources when they involve urgent demands for money and information.  </p><p><strong>4. Promises for big returns on a Bitcoin investment</strong></p><p>Some Bitcoin ATM scams revolve around offers to invest in cryptocurrency that will lead to massive financial gain. Breyault says scammers use traditional marketing tactics, offering limited-time deals or insider knowledge. Those promises are almost bound to be lies. </p><p>Breyault recommends only getting involved in cryptocurrency as a "sophisticated" investor who's prepared to lose money. </p><p>If you suspect you've been targeted by or you've become the victim of a Bitcoin ATM scam, Breyault says to report it to law enforcement. </p><p>Doing so helps them create a record, spot trends, and "hopefully put some of these bad guys behind bars." </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I've tested a ton of automatic vacuums and upright cordless vacuums, assessing from all of those angles along the way. And I have a handful of recommendations for both. But first, let's unpack which kind overall might work better in your living arrangement.</p><h2>Should I get an upright or robot vacuum?</h2><p>I could argue for both sides, considering I think the true dream setup is to have both on hand for different situations. While there are definitely ways to shop strategically and split your budget between one of each, that won't be the most practical choice for every household. If you're only choosing one type of vacuum, consider your main priority when it comes to vacuuming. Is your ideal vacuum cleaner one that automates the most steps to give you as little work as possible, or is it one that does the absolute most meticulous job, even if you still have to do the work?</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

    </div>
<p>Drawbacks of each also have to be considered. Trusting a robot vacuum to do this chore comes with the fine print that the robot vacuum is probably going to piss you off sometimes. While I absolutely can't knock the strides that have been made with smart mapping, AI small obstacle avoidance, automatic floor type recognition, and debris level sensors over the past few years, even the <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-robot-vacuums" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">latest and greatest robot vacuums</a> are still inanimate objects, not perceptive humans. </p><p>The downside of an upright vacuum is that you have to have free time, and spend some of that free time off the couch. Granted, <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-cordless-vacuums" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">the better the cordless vacuum</a>, the less you'll have to get it out, and the less of a pain it'll be to whip around.</p><h2>Do corded vacuums have better suction?</h2><p>Typically, corded vacuums have better suction than cordless vacs, but at this point in the game, it's not a noteworthy enough increase to cover the headache of digging that monstrosity out of the closet and wrestling with the cord. if you detest getting your vacuum out, you probably won't vacuum too often &mdash;&nbsp;and that defeats the purpose of doing your research/spending your money on a nice, new vacuum in the first place.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>However, it <em>is</em> crucial to not automatically assume that less floor to cover means that the cheapest vacuum you can find will suffice. Cramped furniture arrangements and quick changes between floor types actually call for a vac on the more competent end navigation-wise, or you'll risk arriving home to a bot that got stuck in kitchen chair legs during the first five minutes of cleaning. Before getting into specific robovac recommendations, let's assess the features that would make this a smart purchase.</p><h2>Do robot vacuums work in small apartments?</h2><p>While some large, heavy-duty robot vacuums would probably be overkill in a tight space, there are several compact, quiet robot vacuums on the market that make a lot of sense in a small space. </p><p>One way to downsize the space a robot vac takes up is to forego the self-empty dock. While forgoing it automatic emptying o save yourself inches on the floor may not be ideal, it'll be a little less damning in a small space, as the vacuum isn't sucking up as much dirt on each cleaning run as it would in a big house. However, finding a super compact auto-empty dock nowadays isn't hard, and many robot vacuums offer the option to buy one separately later. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Redefining all that B.F.F. can mean, <em>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy</em> director Tomas Alfredson's timeless 2008 adaptation of John Ajvide Lindqvist's novel gives us the tender tween love story of a bullied boy named Oskar (K&aring;re Hedebrant) and the eternal nightmare monster from hell, Eli (Lina Leandersson), who just happens to look like a sweet sullen young girl. Meeting up in the dead of night on the snowy playground outside their forbidding brutalist apartment building, the two young people sweetly bond, all while Eli's blood-harvesting sidekick goes through a series of tribulations nobody would wish on their worst enemy. But a twist of fate could change both of their lives forever.&nbsp;</p><p>You only really realize after the fact how horrifying this love story truly is. Alfredson plays it all like a YA novel, and that's ultimately the deepest horror of all. And, yes, Matt Reeves's 2010 American remake <em>Let Me In</em> (starring Kodi Smit-McPhee and Chloe Grace Moretz as the young couple) is far better than it has any right being, but still &mdash; Team Original, if you ask me.</p><p><strong>How to watch</strong>: <a href="https://zdcs.link/ZooBV?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Let%20the%20Right%20One%20In%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Peacock.&object_type=article&object_uuid=03yg5X6s5XIM9L8jvyzuPpr&short_url=ZooBV&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Let the Right One In </em>is now streaming on Peacock.</a></p><h2><em>Tourist Trap</em></h2><p>This deeply bizarre 1979 flick is courtesy of director David Schmoeller, who also gifted the world Klaus Kinski's wildly unhinged turn in 1986's <em>Crawlspace</em>, not to mention the first <em>Puppet Master</em>. <em>Tourist Trap</em> finds a group of horned-up twentysomethings getting lost on their way through the California desert and stumbling upon some sort of haunted mannequin museum, with dire consequences. Not that there are really any other kind of consequences when one stumbles upon a haunted mannequin museum. You've never heard anybody say they stumbled upon a haunted mannequin museum and had a good time, that much we can guarantee.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, it's the usual stuff &mdash; pretty young things picked off one by one by a masked killer. But it's all so freaking weird, with the mannequins and everything, that you won't soon forget it.</p><p><strong>How to watch</strong>: <a href="https://zdcs.link/drrPj?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Tourist%20Trap%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Peacock&object_type=article&object_uuid=03yg5X6s5XIM9L8jvyzuPpr&short_url=drrPj&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Tourist Trap</em> is now streaming on Peacock</a>.</p><h2><em>Black Christmas</em> (1974)</h2><p>It doesn't even have to be the holiday season to watch this slasher classic. Four years before Michael Myers stabbed his way onto the scene, there was director Bob Clark of <em>A Christmas Story</em> fame unleashing a perverted killer on a sorority house full of extremely likable girls &mdash; including Olivia Hussey, Andrea Martin, and Margot Kidder (pre-Lois Lane).</p><p>As a group of sorority sisters on winter break endure a series of increasingly obscene phone calls, their enormous house begins feeling smaller and smaller. <em>Black Christmas </em>masterfully isolates the girls one by one with no idea they're being stalked, much less that half their friends have already been murdered. Not until it's inevitably too late. <em>2001</em> star Keir Dullea co-stars as a rageaholic pianist slash main suspect, but nothing in this deeply unsettling flick is ever as clear as it seems. Except maybe that crystal unicorn figurine that one of the girls gets stabbed with.</p><p><strong>How to watch</strong>: <a href="https://zdcs.link/Mqqjk?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Black%20Christmas%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Peacock&object_type=article&object_uuid=03yg5X6s5XIM9L8jvyzuPpr&short_url=Mqqjk&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Black Christmas</em> is now streaming on Peacock</a>.</p><h2><em>Curtains</em></h2><p>Some say the 1983 Canadian slasher <em>Curtains</em> is only worth watching for one scene. But that's unfair as there are many delights to be had&hellip; as long as Canadian slashers from the '80s are the sorts of things you find delight in.&nbsp;</p><p>Directed by Richard Ciupka, the film's got an unusual plot as far as slasher movies go. A prestigious slimeball movie director invites a gaggle of young, thirsty-for-fame actresses to an isolated mansion to audition for the lead role in his new movie. Showing up out of the blue to complicate matters is the director's former muse (Samantha Eggar of <em>The Brood</em> fame), who has "aged out," as far as the director is concerned. She's prepared to fight for the role tooth-and-nail anyway. Suffice it to say that tensions are running high even before a masked killer shows up and starts offing the actresses one by one.&nbsp;</p><p>All of the expected cat-fighting and the humor at the expense of overly serious actors in <em>Curtains</em> remains totally on point, especially when it's Eggars on-screen, as nobody in 1983 was doing big-eyed unhinged better than she. But that aforementioned one killer scene does get hollered about for good reason. You take one iced-over pond and a maniac wearing a hag mask while wielding a sickle, and that's cinema, baby.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How to watch</strong>: <a href="https://zdcs.link/qeekp?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Curtains%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Peacock&object_type=article&object_uuid=03yg5X6s5XIM9L8jvyzuPpr&short_url=qeekp&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Curtains</em> is now streaming on Peacock</a>.</p><h2><em>Ginger Snaps</em></h2><p>Teen sisters Brigitte (Emily Perkins) and Ginger (Katharine Isabelle) are as close as they come, bonded by their experiences in a shitty world where they've been forced to take care of one another. The introvert Brigitte gets bullied a lot, and Ginger's always there to save her. Then, one night while out in the woods, Ginger gets her first period, and, uhh, things change. Namely, a werewolf drawn by her menstrual blood bites her, and she becomes a werewolf, much to Brigitte's chagrin.&nbsp;</p><p>An immediately classic spin on the werewolf mythos that folds monster tropes into the horrors of puberty, <em>Ginger Snaps</em> has two sequels and a pack of diehard lycan-fans. But the original stands on its own two sturdy hind legs just fine, telling a standalone story of a familial bond being tested and of useless boys being chewed up and spat to the side. Make sure to watch it with your sister on a full moon, especially if your cycles are in sync!</p><p><strong>How to watch</strong>: <a href="https://zdcs.link/Lvvbb?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Ginger%20Snaps%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Peacock&object_type=article&object_uuid=03yg5X6s5XIM9L8jvyzuPpr&short_url=Lvvbb&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Ginger Snaps</em> is now streaming on Peacock</a>.</p><h2><em>The House of the Devil</em></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

One great example of this is 2009's <em>The House of the Devil</em>, a babysitter-in-peril horror flick that feels like a forgotten artifact dug up out of the early 1980s.&nbsp;</p><p>Jocelin Donahue stars as Samantha, a college student so desperate to rack up some cash that she ignores her intuition around a mysterious "baby-sitting" gig at a weird old mansion in the middle of nowhere. <em>The House of the Devil</em> is deeply infatuated with not just the aesthetics of its setting but also all the creepy trappings of the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/satanist-representation-2018-media" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Satanic Panic</u></a> stories of that era.

Alexandra Essoe gives one hell of a performance as a gifted but flailing young actress in Hollywood whose career is going nowhere and whose friends all suck.

<p>Unfortunately for her (and for those shitty friends), those "sacrifices" start getting out of hand quickly. A casting director with a pentagram pendant is just the start of this deeply cynical <em>A Star Is Born</em> narrative's undoing, which literalizes the Faustian pact in blood and flesh and tears and pretty dresses for movie premieres. But as straightforward a narrative as <em>Starry Eyes</em> ends up telling, it's turned riveting by Essoe's fierce commitment and by a killer synth score that sets it all spinning. Some stylish devilry, indeed.</p><p><strong>How to watch</strong>: <a href="https://zdcs.link/5OOMV?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Starry%20Eyes%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Peacock&object_type=article&object_uuid=03yg5X6s5XIM9L8jvyzuPpr&short_url=5OOMV&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Starry Eyes</em> is now streaming on Peacock</a>.</p><h2><em>Eaten Alive</em></h2><p>Though director Tobe Hooper rightly made his name with his 1974 masterpiece <em>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</em> (see further down this list), we nevertheless have a deep fondness for his 1976 alligator attack movie <em>Eaten Alive</em>. It is just so much weirder than this sort of thing has any right to be, and ends up all the more transfixing for it.&nbsp;</p><p>Filmed on a swampy soundstage that always feels like you're sitting in the audience for a regional theatrical production of a lesser-known Tennessee Williams play, the sweaty rednecks that Hooper specialized in find themselves converging on a run-down Bates-esque hotel. Only instead of a mother-loving boy in a wig there's a crocodile. And <em>Real Housewives</em> star Kyle Richards. And, yes, wigs too. <em>Eaten Alive</em> has a little of everything, and utter chaos ensues as it all comes smashing together. If this movie makes you feel like you've lost a little bit of your sanity while watching it, one suspects that's precisely what Hooper was aiming for.</p><p><strong>How to watch</strong>: <a href="https://zdcs.link/mbbRy?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Eaten%20Alive%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Peacock&object_type=article&object_uuid=03yg5X6s5XIM9L8jvyzuPpr&short_url=mbbRy&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Eaten Alive</em> is now streaming on Peacock</a>.</p><h2><em>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</em></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Famously shot during a brutally hot Texas summer, you can immediately feel the sweat soaking through director Tobe Hooper's 1974 grindhouse masterpiece <em>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre </em>even before its characters are given any reason to work up one. We first meet our group of wayward twentysomethings (led by horror icon Marilyn Burns playing our final girl Sally) riding in one of those stereotypical hippie vans of the moment with the windows rolled down. But all the same, you can hardly breathe. The air itself looks thick and dirty. Squalid. And that sensation will only grow worse with every passing minute.&nbsp;</p><p>There's been a rash of grave-robbing in central Texas, as described in a nice little introductory monologue by John Laroquette (who <a href="https://parade.com/tv/john-larroquette-got-paid-in-marijuana-for-texas-chainsaw-massacre" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>received some of Texas's finest marijuana</u></a> from Hooper as payment). Sally and her friends are headed to visit their grandfather's grave to make sure it's intact. Along the way, they pick up a seriously creepy hitchhiker, jaw about slaughterhouses, and end up at the home of a family of miscreants whose appetites for red meat has truly gotten the best of them. Texans and their barbeque, man! Still, as admirably disgusting as all that sounds, Hooper accomplishes his horror almost entirely through implication &mdash; but what disturbing implications they are. Just coming to understand how Leatherface gets his name is enough to turn you vegan. One of, if not the, greatest horror films ever made.</p><p><strong>How to watch:</strong> <a href="https://zdcs.link/Lvvjb?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=The%20Texas%20Chain%20Saw%20Massacre%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Peacock&object_type=article&object_uuid=03yg5X6s5XIM9L8jvyzuPpr&short_url=Lvvjb&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</em> is now streaming on Peacock</a>.</p><h2><em>The Changeling</em></h2><p>1980's <em>The Changeling </em>stars George C. Scott as a composer named John Russell who, after his wife and daughter are killed in a car accident in front of him, retreats to an isolated mansion outside of Seattle. Of course, the house is isolated for a reason. Slowly but surely, it begins spilling its secrets to him &ndash; there's knocking on the walls, a broken window, and an infernal red ball that keeps bouncing down the stairs.</p><p>Already in a fragile mental state due to his grief, John finds himself easily swept up in the unraveling of the mysteries, and the spirits in the house take full advantage.

Too long a runtime, and it's hard to sustain the mood or the tension. The audience will inevitably begin poking holes in the plot. And yet Na Hong-jin's 2016 South Korean film <em>The Wailing</em> manages to sustain itself for nearly three hours &ndash; it's an anomaly!&nbsp;</p><p>How he does it is by making <em>The Wailing</em> several movies in one. It's a comic police procedural and a zombie outbreak movie and a terrifying demonic possession movie. It switches tones frequently, lurching from comedy to terror with wild abandon. In fact, there's so much going on it's difficult to summarize and capture anything near the scope of it. But the gist is there's this police officer (Kwak Do-won) whose daughter has gone missing, and all of the strange things happening in a rural village seem to be connected to that.

It's all chaos, all the time. And even after you've seen most of his movies, you're still likely to have no idea what the hell is going on in half of them.&nbsp;</p><p>1981's <em>The Beyond</em> is the middle chapter in his so-called "Gates of Hell" trilogy of films, sandwiched between <em>City of the Living Dead</em> and <em>The House by the Cemetery</em>. But there's not really a coherent order to what occurs; just expect a gateway to hell to be opened and all sorts of truly vicious horrors to come spilling out. Fulci films are all about the languorous nightmare vibes &mdash; everyone behaves totally irrationally, but they somehow still work if you can subscribe to their dream logic.&nbsp;</p><p><em>The Beyond</em> stars (as do all three of the films in the trilogy) the great Catriona MacColl. She plays a different person in each movie,&nbsp; and here she's Liza, a New Yorker who's moved to New Orleans to take over a crumbling hotel she's recently inherited. Immediately, strange things start happening, mostly involving reanimated corpses and exceedingly slow scenes of grotesquery, and Liza does her damndest to figure out what's driving it before Hell takes over Earth. And let's just say that Fulci's not known for happy endings.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How to watch</strong>: <a href="https://zdcs.link/GvvJB?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=The%20Beyond%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Peacock&object_type=article&object_uuid=03yg5X6s5XIM9L8jvyzuPpr&short_url=GvvJB&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>The Beyond</em> is now streaming on Peacock</a>.</p><h2><em>Abigail</em></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Taking a break in between <em>Scream</em> sequels &mdash; a break that would prove to be permanent soon after &mdash; the directing duo of Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett (aka Radio Silence) reunited with <em>Scream</em> star Melissa Barrera to toss off this vampire ballerina goof, which <a href="https://mashable.com/article/abigail-movie-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>ended up being a total crowd-pleaser</u></a> and their best movie since <em>Ready or Not</em>. Barrera plays Joey, a laconic member of a gang of criminals led by Frank (Dan Stevens, doing his thing again). Together, they kidnap Abigail (Alisha Weir), the daughter of a very powerful man, and plan to hold her for ransom.&nbsp;</p><p>Little do they know though that, much like Kirsten Dunst in <em>Interview with the Vampire</em> before her, Abigail is actually an ancient bloodsucker trapped in the body of a tween ballerina, and have they ever busted into the wrong mansion this time. With a game cast that also includes Kathryn Newton, Kevin Durand, Angus Cloud (in his final role), and Giancarlo Esposito, <em>Abigail</em> might play its big twist way past when we've already figured it out, but it's having such a bloody good time you really don't care.</p><p><strong>How to watch</strong>: <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qx7J7p?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Abigail%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Peacock&object_type=article&object_uuid=03yg5X6s5XIM9L8jvyzuPpr&short_url=Qx7J7p&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Abigail</u></em><u> is now streaming on Peacock</u></a>.</p><h2><em>Us</em></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>With a killer cast including Lupita Nyong'o, Elisabeth Moss, and Winston Duke, Peele makes the oddness of his conceit work in what is essentially a home-invasion picture, delivering an unforgettable pile-up of scenes that are chock-full of immediately iconic imagery. The scissors, the red jumpsuits, the bunnies, oh my! And in the pantheon of horror performances that deserved but didn't get awards attention, Nyong'o's double-forked performance in <em>Us</em> stands especially tall. Tall, wielding scissors, and smiling that big broad terrifying smile &mdash; the one that will make you wanna crawl right outta your skin. </p><p><strong>How to watch</strong>: <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKDYDD?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Us%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Peacock&object_type=article&object_uuid=03yg5X6s5XIM9L8jvyzuPpr&short_url=QKDYDD&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Us</u></em><u> is now streaming on Peacock</u></a>.</p><h2><em>Old</em></h2><p>The current period in <a href="https://mashable.com/article/m-night-shyamalan-thriller-ranked" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">M.

But Werner Herzog's 1979 take on the infamous Dracula rip-off is in my estimation the lushest, the most gorgeous, and by far the weirdest. It certainly helps to be lush and gorgeous when your movie stars Isabelle Adjani. And it definitely helps being way out there weird when the other star is Klaus Kinski.&nbsp;</p><p>Herzog bridges the gap between those two actors' very different energies nimbly; this movie feels like dream and nightmare simultaneously, and there's nothing else like it. Visions of plague rats and burial caskets overtaking the streets of 19th-century Germany move through a fine grainy mist, as the cursed dance between the beauty and her beast slowly, surely inches itself toward the bleakest of dawns. It's the purest horror cinema: the essence of wanton despair.

<p>Zack Snyder's greatest movie, hands down! (DC fans, that bait's just for you.) The <em>Justice League </em>director may not have nailed the capitalist critique that made George A. Romero's original 1978 zombie classic so biting, but Snyder's 2004 remake kicks all kinds of unholy ass all the same. It certainly helps that he's got Oscar&ndash;winner Sarah Polley as his leading lady, a nurse named Ana who returns from a long shift to find the world exploding into a cannibalistic apocalypse in an opening outbreak sequence for the ages.</p><p>As Ana and other survivors (or zombies-to-be) &mdash; including stalwart character actors like Ving Rhames, Jake Weber, Mekhi Phifer, and Michael Kelly &mdash; all descend on a shopping mall to barricade themselves in for humanity's last stand, Snyder ramps everything up to eleven, twelve, and thirteen. This killer group of actors is what truly make this movie soar, giving us real-seeming people to worry about as the big zombie rampage starts turning them into snacks.</p><p><strong>How to watch</strong>: <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGVYV8?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Dawn%20of%20the%20Dead%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Peacock&object_type=article&object_uuid=03yg5X6s5XIM9L8jvyzuPpr&short_url=QGVYV8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Dawn of the Dead</u></em><u> is now streaming on Peacock</u></a>.</p><h2><em>Gonjiam: Haunted Asylum</em></h2><p>If you love found-footage horror, then this 2018 example from South Korea ranks among the most entertaining, jump-off-your-seat examples.

There is a truly nonsense backstory involving an Aztec cult (Q is short for "Quetzalcoatl") and a rampaging cop slash jazz pianist (Michael Moriarty) that you 100% don't have to pay attention to. <em>Q: The Winged Serpent</em> lives and breathes by its scenes of a claymation dinosaur descending into rooftop pools and snatching unsuspecting New Yorkers off the sidewalks into its jaws and its claws.

<p>Sometimes only a classic Universal Monster will scratch that spooky itch, and thankfully the greatest of them all is here with its big fingers at the ready: James Whale's 1931 masterpiece <em>Frankenstein</em>, and its equally excellent sequel, <a href="https://zdcs.link/a0XJXA?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Bride%20of%20Frankenstein&object_type=article&object_uuid=03yg5X6s5XIM9L8jvyzuPpr&short_url=a0XJXA&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Bride of Frankenstein</u></em></a>. Adapting Mary Shelley's legendary novel about a mad doctor (Colin Clive) bringing a corpse back to life through that modern boogeyman "electricity," Whale &amp; Co. didn't make a single bad step in the movie's making. From Boris Karloff's casting as the monster, all the way down to the design of the bolts on his neck, every decision proved iconic.&nbsp;</p><p>It's as watchable and eerie as it was when it dropped in theaters almost a full century ago.

Kind of like Phillip Noyce's infamous 1993 piece of trash <em>Sliver</em> with Sharon Stone but actually great and terrifying, <em>Sleep Tight</em> sees C&eacute;sar sneaking into everybody's homes in the middle of the night, chloroforming them as they sleep, and then doing whatever the hell he wants to whilst they remain not-so-blissfully unconscious.&nbsp;</p><p>Balaguer&oacute;'s movie ends up being so super creepy precisely because it seems way too possible; indeed, there are echoes of many real-world news stories in this unsettling premise. Balaguer&oacute; leans hard into every single one of the nightmares from this set-up that your brain can conjure up.

<p>In the mood for an old-fashioned ghost story? Set in 1921 England, <em>The Awakening</em> centers on a professional skeptic Florence Cathcart (Rebecca Hall), who dedicates her life to debunking so-called clairvoyants and their showy seances. With ruthless reasoning and science experiments, she has exposed frightful frauds and infuriated believers. However, Florence may have met her match when she travels to a boys&rsquo; boarding school to confront a reportedly murderous apparition. Director Nick Murphy imbrues this spooky tale with suspense and dread, unfurling a final act that&rsquo;s uniquely haunting. Dominic West and Imelda Staunton co-star. <em>&mdash; K.P.</em></p><p><strong>How to watch</strong>: <a href="https://zdcs.link/V4lX7?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=The%20Awakening&object_type=article&object_uuid=06yky93hrNghc6zSRCi1PIQ&short_url=V4lX7&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>The Awakening</u></em></a><a href="https://zdcs.link/V4lX7?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Shudder.&object_type=article&object_uuid=06yky93hrNghc6zSRCi1PIQ&short_url=V4lX7&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u> is now streaming on Shudder.</u></a><a href="https://zdcs.link/V4lX7?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&object_type=article&object_uuid=06yky93hrNghc6zSRCi1PIQ&short_url=V4lX7&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"> </a></p><h2>3. <em>Nina Forever</em></h2><p>Yearning for a dark comedy that&rsquo;s bloody fun? You&rsquo;ll fall hard for <em>Nina Forever</em>. Co-writers/co-directors Ben Blaine and Chris Blaine have dreamed up a truly deranged tale of love and letting go, and it all begins with a macabre crush. Grocery clerk Holly (Abigail Hardingham) hopes she can help mournful motorcyclist Rob (Cian Barry) forget his last girlfriend, who died in a grisly accident. But every time these new lovers crawl into bed, Nina (Fiona O'Shaughnessy) intrudes. Or more specifically, her broken and bloody corpse crashes the party with snarky one-liners and withering eye-rolls. Full of gore, sex, and jaw-droppingly outrageous gags, this horror-comedy earns its hard-R, yet delivers a surprisingly tender tale. <em>&mdash; K.P.</em></p><p><strong>How to watch</strong>: <a href="https://zdcs.link/EoGgJ?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Nina%20Forever&object_type=article&object_uuid=06yky93hrNghc6zSRCi1PIQ&short_url=EoGgJ&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Nina Forever </u></em></a><a href="https://zdcs.link/EoGgJ?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Shudder.&object_type=article&object_uuid=06yky93hrNghc6zSRCi1PIQ&short_url=EoGgJ&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>is now streaming on Shudder.</u></a><a href="https://zdcs.link/EoGgJ?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&object_type=article&object_uuid=06yky93hrNghc6zSRCi1PIQ&short_url=EoGgJ&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"> </a></p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>It&rsquo;s a rare thing for a remake to outdo the original. Yet Kimo Stamboel&rsquo;s <a href="https://mashable.com/video/shudder-the-queen-of-black-magic-trailer" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>gruesome 2019 offering</u></a> does just that by upping the ante on body-horror with frightfully realistic gore. Deep in rural Indonesia, a humble orphanage is supposed to be the site of a warm reunion between three friends (Ario Bayu, Tanta Gintin, and Miller Khan), who long ago spent their boyhoods there. But in the past and in this place, they buried a terrible secret. Now, something horrid has risen to claim vengeance on them and their families. With creeping dread, stomach-churning scares, and ruthless supernatural twists, this one is not for the faint of heart. <em>&mdash; K.P.</em></p><p><strong>How to watch</strong>: <a href="https://zdcs.link/Yw8WR?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=The%20Queen%20of%20Black%20Magic&object_type=article&object_uuid=06yky93hrNghc6zSRCi1PIQ&short_url=Yw8WR&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>The Queen of Black Magic</u></em></a><a href="https://zdcs.link/Yw8WR?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Shudder.&object_type=article&object_uuid=06yky93hrNghc6zSRCi1PIQ&short_url=Yw8WR&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u> is now streaming on Shudder.</u></a><a href="https://zdcs.link/Yw8WR?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&object_type=article&object_uuid=06yky93hrNghc6zSRCi1PIQ&short_url=Yw8WR&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"> </a></p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

The best of the bunch is this funny, personal, and political exploration of the infamous <em>A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy&rsquo;s Revenge. </em>Long mocked for its queer content, the subversive sequel proved a nightmare for its unconventional scream queen, Mark Patton. However, directors Roman Chimienti and Tyler Jensen present the charismatic Patton with the opportunity to reclaim the narrative (and share a slew of stories, both thrilling and heartbreaking). The result is a bio-doc that&rsquo;s sensationally bold, surprisingly funny, and proudly gay as hell. <em>&mdash; K.P.</em></p><p><strong>How to watch</strong>: <a href="https://zdcs.link/Jw5gN?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Scream%2C%20Queen%21%20My%20Nightmare%20on%20Elm%20Street&object_type=article&object_uuid=06yky93hrNghc6zSRCi1PIQ&short_url=Jw5gN&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Scream, Queen!

<p>What if zombie bites weren&rsquo;t <em>all </em>bad? More specifically, what if a nip from the undead would give the impotent new life below the belt? That&rsquo;s the preposterous premise that kicks off this gleefully bonkers South Korean comedy. The Park family is scraping by running a battered gas station when their fortunes are turned by a zombie (Jung Ga-ram) with a rejuvenating bite. That&rsquo;s just the first act of director Lee Min-jae&rsquo;s playful horror-comedy. Family hijinks, ghoulish action, gross-out gags, and absurdly earnest romance also pop up, making for a movie that is chaotically charming and pleasantly unpredictable. <em>&mdash; K.P.</em></p><p><strong>How to watch</strong>: <a href="https://zdcs.link/1rOj5?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Zombie%20for%20Sale%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Shudder.&object_type=article&object_uuid=06yky93hrNghc6zSRCi1PIQ&short_url=1rOj5&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Zombie for Sale is now streaming on Shudder.</u><a href="https://zdcs.link/1rOj5" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"> </a></em></a></p><h2>8. <em>Revenge</em></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Before there was <em>Home Alone</em>, French writer/director Ren&eacute; Manzor dared to dream up a kid-centered holiday home invasion that is unapologetically scary. Since its 1989 debut overseas, this festive thriller could not get a US theatrical run. So, it became a coveted treasure for American horror fans, who&rsquo;d heard of its heady combination of terror, twists, and toys. Mazor&rsquo;s own son, Alain Lalanne (credited as Alain Musy), stars as a clever boy, who must use all his wits and playthings to survive the night, once a menacing mall-Santa breaks into his home hellbent on homicide. Forget paint cans and Wet Bandits. Manzor&rsquo;s spin on this story is far darker, zanier, and bolder, making for a movie that&rsquo;s outrageously funny, truly frightening, and ultimately unforgettable. <em>&mdash; K.P.</em></p><p><strong>How to watch</strong>: <a href="https://zdcs.link/X7EWR?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Deadly%20Games&object_type=article&object_uuid=06yky93hrNghc6zSRCi1PIQ&short_url=X7EWR&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Deadly Games</u></em></a><a href="https://zdcs.link/X7EWR?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Shudder.&object_type=article&object_uuid=06yky93hrNghc6zSRCi1PIQ&short_url=X7EWR&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u> is now streaming on Shudder.</u></a><a href="https://zdcs.link/X7EWR?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&object_type=article&object_uuid=06yky93hrNghc6zSRCi1PIQ&short_url=X7EWR&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"> </a></p><h2><strong>10. <em>Oddity</em></strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>An incredibly eerie morality tale set in modern-day South Africa,<em> Good Madam</em> tells the story of Tsidi (Chumisa Cosa) and her 9-year-old daughter Winnie (Kamvalethu Jonas Raziya), who become homeless when Tsidi's grandmother (who raised her) dies. Needing a stable home, Tsidi reaches out to her estranged mother Mavis (Nosipho Mtebe), who's been a live-in domestic servant in the home of a rich white woman since Tsidi was a child. And that's when the skin-crawling creepy feelings start piling up.</p><p>There in this big fancy house, they find the good madam catatonic in bed, all while Mavis inexplicably maintains her grueling schedule of work around the clock for the unconscious woman. Something is deeply amiss, and as Tsidi starts pulling at threads it all starts to unravel. And co-writer/director Jenna Cato Bass manages to lay a sharp critique of post-apartheid racial relations in South Africa against the scares too &mdash; <em>Good Madam</em> unnerves as much as it enlightens.<em> &mdash; J.A. </em>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How to watch: </strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/z3bqEw?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Good%20Madam%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Shudder.&object_type=article&object_uuid=06yky93hrNghc6zSRCi1PIQ&short_url=z3bqEw&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Good Madam</u></em><u> is now streaming on Shudder</u>.</a><br></p><h2>14. <em>Mad God</em></h2><p><a href="https://mashable.com/video/mad-god-phil-tippett-star-wars" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">30 years </a><a href="https://mashable.com/video/mad-god-phil-tippett-star-wars" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>in the making,</u></a> <em>Mad God</em> is a surreal and horrific stop-motion masterpiece from Phil Tippett, the legendary special-effects master behind everything from the aliens in <em>Starship Troopers</em> to the dinosaurs in <em>Jurassic Park</em>.

<p>Writer/director Filip Jan Rymsza threads one hell of a needle with his truly odd 2020 film <em>Mosquito State</em>, which metaphorically links the 2008 financial collapse with the mating habits of the mosquito. And it somehow works!&nbsp;</p><p>Beau Knapp (<em>Road House</em>) gives a hypnotic performance as Richard, a Wall Street numbers-cruncher who is obsessed with obscure patterns, using them to see into the financial future. When a single mosquito stows away under his shirt collar and lays eggs in Richard's fastidiously sterile apartment, he descends into swollen madness trying to understand the message the insects must be transmitting through their every sting. For my fellow entomophobes, this one will have you itching your eyes out even as you gape at the strange beauty of it all. <em>&mdash; J.A.</em></p><p><strong>How to watch: </strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/9wG4dR?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Mosquito%20State%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Shudder&object_type=article&object_uuid=06yky93hrNghc6zSRCi1PIQ&short_url=9wG4dR&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Mosquito State</u></em><u> is now streaming on Shudder</u></a>.</p><h2>18. <em>Ghostwatch</em></h2><p>An artistic prank on the level of Orson Welles' infamous <em>War of the Worlds</em> broadcast in 1938, the BBC mockumentary <em>Ghostwatch</em> was unleashed on an unsuspecting public on Halloween night 1992. Using real-life UK-famous personalities and journalists like Michael Parkinson, Sarah Greene, Mike Smith, and Craig Charles, the film plays out as a live on-air broadcast from in-studio as well as from the home of a woman and her three daughters, who insist their house is haunted.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, things get more unhinged as the show goes on, and many BBC viewers who tuned in after the broadcast's beginning (or were only half paying attention) missed that this was a fiction film. And they absolutely freaked out, calling into the TV station in a state of alarm. Which is understandable because <em>Ghostwatch,</em> with its eerie found footage constantly catching blink-and-you'll-miss-it horrors, gets under your skin even if you know it's all staged. Just utter the ghost's name, "Pipes," to someone who's seen <em>Ghostwatch</em>, and you'll see skin crawl before your very eyes.

Playing out like a <em>Penthouse</em> fantasy come to life, the women are drenched from a rainstorm and say their car broke down, only to relentlessly flirt with him until he &mdash; you guessed it &mdash; relents.</p><p>But that fantasy immediately descends into a nightmare as the women refuse to leave when morning comes, and they start teasing and tormenting him, with their abuses growing more and more hilariously over the top. Terrified that his wife will return home before he can get rid of them, George is boxed in; it's every cheating jerk's nightmare brought to vivid life. But ultimately, <em>Death Game</em> turns into a blow-out showcase for the actresses (in particular Locke), who are having so, so much fun tormenting this pathetic man.

<p>Of course, this embattled existence can't last forever. One breakdown in their routine leads to disaster. As the family finds itself scattered in the dark, they're beset upon by the creatures, and this is where <em>Arcadian</em> really sets itself apart. Its monsters are wondrous, unlike anything you've ever seen before. Somewhere between an ostrich and a tarantula &mdash; maybe with some woodpecker mixed in? &mdash; they have big grinning skulls that make the most horrible thwacking sounds. Half the movie's fun is just trying to figure these horrible things out, and they keep swerving just when you think you've got a handle on what they're capable of.

<p>If this sounds familiar it should &ndash; it's the plot of every slasher movie. What sets this apart is you could almost mistake it for a Terrence Malick movie in between the kills, as the killer's POV is one that mainly consists of a series of slow contemplative walks through the beautiful forest. Of course, the kill scenes are wildly over the top, as if to make up for the slowness of the rest of the proceedings. This gives the film a lackadaisical rhythm punctuated by extreme violence that becomes weirdly hypnotic, if you let it.

<p>Visionary of the zombie apocalypse George A. Romero tops this list with his most iconic film: <em>Night of the Living Dead.</em> This 1968 classic makes for a great watch &mdash; not only as a standard-setting staple of cinema, but also as a vehicle for terror that gets under your skin and festers there. Expertly executed from start to finish, this bleak tale of strangers versus an army of the undead needles at you in a way that's still tough to shake more than 50 years later.<a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-horror-movies-amazon-prime-video" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">*</a> &mdash; <em>Alison Foreman, Entertainment Reporter</em></p><p><strong>How to watch: </strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/jdrMp?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Night%20of%20the%20Living%20Dead&object_type=article&object_uuid=03uEqCoD2T3Fx77hEXApula&short_url=jdrMp&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Night of the Living Dead </em></a><a href="https://zdcs.link/jdrMp?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Max.&object_type=article&object_uuid=03uEqCoD2T3Fx77hEXApula&short_url=jdrMp&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">is now streaming on Max.</a></p><h2>2. <em>Eraserhead</em></h2><p>God, Henry is just so <em>fucked</em>. The directorial debut of walking-talking id David Lynch, <em>Eraserhead </em>follows the poor guy, played by Jack Nance, as he wanders through a surrealist blend of horror and humor, featuring an alien baby, sperm monsters, a lady with big ol' cheeks, and more bizarre characters. The plot has been interpreted as a representation of Lynch's own fear of being a parent, with Henry serving as a kind of placeholder for Lynch himself. It's fascinating, freaky, and really fun. &mdash; <em>A.F.</em></p><p><strong>How to watch: </strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/7Lv2G?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Eraserhead&object_type=article&object_uuid=03uEqCoD2T3Fx77hEXApula&short_url=7Lv2G&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Eraserhead </em></a><a href="https://zdcs.link/7Lv2G?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Max.&object_type=article&object_uuid=03uEqCoD2T3Fx77hEXApula&short_url=7Lv2G&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">is now streaming on Max.</a></p><h2>3. <em>Cronos</em></h2><p>Guillermo del Toro's first film carries with it all the hallmarks of the Mexican auteur's career-to-come &ndash; gross monster mayhem with delightful creature design, religious and political settings and symbolism, the innocence of children as a contrast to all adult awfulness. This time around it's the story of an elderly antique dealer named Jes&uacute;s (Federico Luppi, who also had roles in <em>The Devil's Backbone</em> and <em>Pan's Labyrinth</em>) and the 500-year-old golden scarab he finds tucked away inside the base of a statue.&nbsp;</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Winding it up the scarab suddenly springs to life and injects the old man with a mysterious substance, and before you know it Jes&uacute;s' youth is being restored to him&hellip; alongside a newfound taste for blood. When a tough guy named Angel (Ron Perlman) shows up to find the device, the film turns into a showdown between Jes&uacute;s and Angel for eternal life. Not particularly subtle there, Guillermo! But <em>Cronos</em> is a blast anyway, and the perfect introduction to one of modern horror's reigning kings. <em>&mdash; Jason Adams, Contributing Writer</em></p><p><strong>How to watch: </strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/QPbAmy?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Cronos%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Max.&object_type=article&object_uuid=03uEqCoD2T3Fx77hEXApula&short_url=QPbAmy&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Cronos</u></em><u> is now streaming on Max</u>.</a></p><h2>4. <em>Trick &lsquo;r Treat</em></h2><p>Be warned: this horror anthology is so deliciously spooky that you&rsquo;re gonna wanna make it an annual tradition. Written and directed by Michael Dougherty, <em>Trick &lsquo;r Treat</em> tears a page from <em>Creepshow</em>, unfurling a collection of horror shorts with comic book-style panache. In the mix are vengeance-seeking ghosts, trouble-making trick-or-treaters, werewolves on the prowl, and a cryptic critter, who is a deadly enforcer for the rules of Halloween. Splashed with gore, rich in lore, and studded with familiar faces, this terror-laced film is a terrific treat. &mdash; <em>Kristy Puchko, Film Editor&nbsp;</em></p><p><strong>How to Watch:</strong> <a href="https://zdcs.link/5Ogy5?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Trick%20%27r%20Treat&object_type=article&object_uuid=03uEqCoD2T3Fx77hEXApula&short_url=5Ogy5&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Trick 'r Treat</em></a><a href="https://zdcs.link/5Ogy5?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Max.&object_type=article&object_uuid=03uEqCoD2T3Fx77hEXApula&short_url=5Ogy5&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"> is now streaming on Max.</a></p><h2>5. <em>The Blob</em></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Mark my words, anyone who reduces director Irvin Yeaworth's iconic <em>The Blob </em>to "just a B-movie" hasn't actually seen it. An astounding feat of filmmaking for the time, that maintains a surprisingly watchable flow 63 years later, <em>The Blob </em>is a solid selection for anyone seeking that classic scary movie vibe. Stand by helplessly as intergalactic goo terrorizes the citizens of Phoenixville, Pennsylvania. Then, be genuinely impressed by how the '50s townspeople manage to corral the thing through smart, sensible sci-fi means. Nice job, humans! &mdash; <em>A.F.</em></p><p><strong>How to watch: </strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/A4elw?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=The%20Blob&object_type=article&object_uuid=03uEqCoD2T3Fx77hEXApula&short_url=A4elw&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>The Blob </em></a><a href="https://zdcs.link/A4elw?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Max.&object_type=article&object_uuid=03uEqCoD2T3Fx77hEXApula&short_url=A4elw&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">is now streaming on Max.</a></p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p></p><h2>6. <em>House</em></h2><p>Reader, cue up <em>House </em>and avail yourself of one of the weirdest and most wonderful viewing experiences out there. </p><p>Sometimes listed as<em> Hausu, </em>director Nobuhiko Obayashi's surreal 1977 horror comedy is a whirlwind of spectacular and bizarre images unlike any other title on this, or frankly any, list. Running just under an hour and a half, it's a breezy jolt of strange beauty and intense dread that uses dreamlike images to tell the story of six girls as they're eaten by a house.

But director Luis Llosa knows we've come to have fun, so he never skimps on the laughs. After all, the 1998 movie is infamous for its scene of Oscar-winning actor Jon Voight getting regurgitated right onto Jennifer Lopez. (Voight, covered in snake slobber, then winks at her.)&nbsp;</p><p>And so <em>Anaconda</em> remains all these years on a massively entertaining 89 minutes of animal attack nonsense set in the scenic Amazon, with a game cast (also including Ice Cube and Owen Wilson) getting gobbled up one by one as the big snake's buffet. They could honestly put out a new one of these movies with a brand new cast every year, and I wouldn't be angry at it. More, more, more barfed-up actors, please!

<p>Candace Hilligoss plays Mary, a good girl who gets caught up in a road race that flies out of control in the film's opening scene. Recovering in its aftermath, Mary begins experiencing visions of an odd haunted theme park on the shores of the Great Salt Lake. Her isolating job as a church organist, along with constant harassment from an aggressive next door neighbor, only further dissociates her from those around her, until she can no longer tell what's real and what's not, with it all leading to one of the all-time great twist endings. <em>Carnival of Souls </em>is probably the closest thing we'll ever get to a <em>Twilight Zone</em> episode directed by Ingmar Bergman. <em>&mdash; J.A.</em></p><p><strong>How to watch: </strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/9ywKxP?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Carnival%20of%20Souls%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Max.&object_type=article&object_uuid=03uEqCoD2T3Fx77hEXApula&short_url=9ywKxP&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Carnival of Souls</u></em><u> is now streaming on Max</u>.</a></p><h2>10. <em>Kwaidan</em></h2><p>Just a couple of years after delivering his three-part WWII masterpiece <em>The Human Condition</em>, writer/director Masaki Kobayashi gathered together four old Japanese folk tales to make <em>Kwaidan</em>.

<p>Being afraid of the dark and the things lurking within it is a totally normal human reaction, and so the horror movies that can make broad daylight work in their favor are rare birds indeed. Among this elite group, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/midsommar-movie-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Ari Aster's </a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/midsommar-movie-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Midsommar</em></a> might just be the greatest example of unblinkingly bright horror. The 2019 film is about a young woman named Dani (Florence Pugh) who tags along with her passive-aggressive boyfriend (Jack Reynor) and his college pals as they visit a reclusive commune in rural Sweden. The Swedes' friendliness feels immediately surreal and sinister, and Aster turns the unyielding sunshine (and the cult members' smiles) into his greatest weapon. There is nowhere for any of these dumb American kids to run or hide; there are no shadows. All they can do is just stare in disbelief as the story surrounding them turns too terrible and dark to imagine. <em>&mdash; J.A.</em></p><p><strong>How to watch: </strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp6RDY?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Midsommar%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Max.&object_type=article&object_uuid=03uEqCoD2T3Fx77hEXApula&short_url=Qp6RDY&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Midsommar</u></em><u> is now streaming on Max</u>.</a></p><h2>13. <em>Pulse</em></h2><p>The greatest of the turn-of-the-millennium J-horror films, period. In 2001, writer/director Kiyoshi Kurosawa distilled the previous best of the genre, like <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-11-scariest-horror-movies" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Ringu</em></a> and <em>Ju-On</em>, down to their most disturbing essence with <em>Pulse</em>. The gist is basically that the internet has become a door to the afterlife, so the ghosts in the machines have begun literally tumbling out into the real world. When there's no more room in Hell, the dead will download! But Kurosawa tells this story with unfailing restraint and an overwhelming sense of mounting dread; he's able to make you crawl over the back of your seat just by showing a woman walking down a hallway. But he'll go big when he needs to, and <em>Pulse</em>'s unforgettable final scenes must be seen to be believed. <em>&mdash; J.A.</em>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How to watch: </strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/z3bXr2?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Pulse%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Max.&object_type=article&object_uuid=03uEqCoD2T3Fx77hEXApula&short_url=z3bXr2&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Pulse</u></em><u> is now streaming on Max</u>.</a></p><h2>14. <em>Scream</em></h2><p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/where-to-watch-scream-movies-series" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Scream</em></a><em> </em>is one of those landmark moments in horror history that can be used to define everything that came before and after it.

<p>Writer/director Robert Eggers's haunting folk horror flick follows an isolated family living in 1630 New England as paranoia and religious fervor brew after an infant goes missing. Rebellious teen Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy) bears the brunt of the blame from her Puritan parents, but her eerie twin siblings (is there any other kind?) and their friendship with a goat they've nicknamed Black Phillip lets the viewer know something far stranger is afoot.</p><p>"What really sets this movie apart from its horror peers [...] is its sheer beauty," wrote Yohana Desta in <a href="https://mashable.com/archive/the-witch-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">her review for Mashable</a>.

Which is to say, don't go in expecting a modern read on mental health issues in this story about formerly conjoined twins turned fashion models who go on a murder spree. But as dated as some of its psychological concepts are, not to mention its emphasis on Hitchcock's <em>Psycho</em>, <em>Sisters</em> remains a magnificently crafted thriller that will have you jumping out of your seat more than once. And Margot Kidder's having a terrific&nbsp; time with the soapiness of ping-ponging between good and evil twins. The movie that somehow made birthday cake terrifying! <em>&mdash; J.A.</em>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How to watch: </strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qx7pjb?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Sisters%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Max.&object_type=article&object_uuid=03uEqCoD2T3Fx77hEXApula&short_url=Qx7pjb&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Sisters</u></em><u> is now streaming on Max</u>.</a></p><h2>18. <em>The Fury</em></h2><p>Another Brian De Palma movie! But can you blame us? The man made his name by updating Hitchcock's obsessions with cinematic sleaze and brutality, bringing them into the modern era, and he has given us more classics that you'll want to take a shower after than most directors could dream of. With a script by best-selling author John Farris based on his own novel, <em>The Fury</em>&nbsp; is basically the sexier version of Cronenberg's head-exploding extravaganza <em>Scanners</em> (which came out the following year). Amy Irving plays a college student named Gillian whose psychic powers are proving more than she can handle, so Gillian gets sent off to a research institute where it turns out they're up to no good. It all leads up to legendary actor John Cassavetes exploding from about twenty different angles, and if that's not reason enough to watch a movie I don't know what is. Plus, it feels like an extension of sorts to De Palma's <em>Carrie</em>, which came out two years before and also co-starred Irving as good girl Sue Snell. <em>&mdash; J.A.</em></p><p><strong>How to watch: </strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/z7bYl8?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=The%20Fury%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Max.&object_type=article&object_uuid=03uEqCoD2T3Fx77hEXApula&short_url=z7bYl8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>The Fury</u></em><u> is now streaming on Max</u>.</a></p><h2>19. <em>The Shining</em></h2><p>All work and no play makes Uncle Stevie a dull boy! <a href="https://mashable.com/category/stephen-king" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Stephen King</a> might not like what Stanley Kubrick did with <a href="https://mashable.com/video/whats-the-difference-the-shining" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">his book</a>, but Stephen King has been known to be wrong now and then.

As ever with such monkey's paws, the good stuff sours quick, and small supernatural pranks quickly escalate to a life-and-death battle for their souls.

<p>Writer/director Jane Schoenbrun's <em>I Saw the TV Glow</em> is such a mood, especially if you're someone who came of age in the late '90s/early aughts with any of the teen-centric television shows that aired on the WB. Starring Justice Smith and Brigette Lundy-Paine as Owen and Maddie, two outcasts who bond over their love of the <em>Buffy</em>-esque program <em>The Pink Opaque</em>, Schoenbrun, a trans filmmaker, is <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/the-hidden-hope-in-i-saw-the-tv-glows-ending-explained.html" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>explicitly exploring the places</u></a> where our obsessions fracture our identities, and vice versa &mdash; how we build ourselves in the image of fiction.&nbsp;</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>The movie casts an eerie spell with its bizarre overlapping realities that make the shifting dynamics of a Christopher Nolan movie seem pat and hollow. And there might be no more unsettling monster this year than the moon-faced Mr. Melancholy, whose discount-budget cheapness gives way to a true chasm of uncanniness.<em> &mdash; J.A.</em></p><p><strong>How to watch: </strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/z6bBNk?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=I%20Saw%20the%20TV%20Glow%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Max.&object_type=article&object_uuid=03uEqCoD2T3Fx77hEXApula&short_url=z6bBNk&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>I Saw the TV Glow</u></em><u> is now streaming on Max</u>.</a></p><h2>23. <em>The Strangers</em></h2><p>While there are pieces here and there to recommend from <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-strangers-chapter-1" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">the sequels</a>, the horrific strength of writer/director Bryan Bertino's 2008 <em>The Strangers</em> comes from the simplicity of its conceit and execution (pun definitely intended).

<p>More than four decades after we first rendezvoused with Sam Raimi's demon troupe of Deadites, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/evil-dead-rise-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Evil Dead Rise</em></a> proved there's still plenty of juice &mdash; not to mention a myriad of other less savory liquids &mdash; left in the franchise. And it did so by simply shifting location; who needs a creepy cabin in the woods when we've got a run-down apartment building isolated from the outside world by a power outage during a big storm?&nbsp;</p><p>It also benefits from a big shift in character dynamics. Rather than a group of sexy young people (hubba hubba, Bruce Campbell) tearing each other to shreds after reading from the Book of the Dead, writer/director Lee Cronin gave us a single mom and her young kids all battling to save and/or swallow each other's souls. While the nasty, bloody business stays the same, it sure hits different when it's your possessed mommy (an outstandingly acrobatic Alyssa Sutherland) trying to carve you up like Christmas dinner. <em>&mdash; J.A.</em></p><p><strong>How to watch: </strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/QKDbAG?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Evil%20Dead%20Rise%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Max.&object_type=article&object_uuid=03uEqCoD2T3Fx77hEXApula&short_url=QKDbAG&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Evil Dead Rise</u></em><u> is now streaming on Max</u>.</a></p><h2>25. <em>Fright Night</em></h2><p>If you're the only child to a single mom, then there's never been anything more relatable put on screen than the quest of the teenager Charley (William Ragsdale) to convince his mom (Amanda Bearse) that the next-door neighbor that she's just begun dating (Chris Sarandon) is really an evil vampire from hell in the 1985 film <em>Fright Night</em>. Charley enlists everyone from his best friend to a cheesy vampire hunter TV host (Roddy McDowall) to stake this home invader before anybody can have any of his Mom's time but him, darn it. It's a perfect metaphor.</p><p>Writer/director Tom Holland went on to direct the first <em>Child's Play</em> movie, which, funny enough, is also about the miscommunication between a single mom and her son being brought to monstrous life. In both movies, Holland threads the needle between comedy and horror seamlessly. This movie is often deeply goofy, and it is 100% a time capsule of its moment; there actually might not be a more 1985 movie in all of existence. It feels created in a lab for vegging out with sugary snacks, and McDowall's turn gives us a true camp horror icon. <em>&mdash; J.A.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p><p><strong>How to watch: </strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/z3bXrM?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Fright%20Night%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Max.&object_type=article&object_uuid=03uEqCoD2T3Fx77hEXApula&short_url=z3bXrM&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Fright Night</u></em><u> is now streaming on Max</u>.</a></p><p></p><p><em>Asterisks (*) indicate the entry comes from a previous Mashable list.</em></p><p class="mx-auto">

<p>Ba-ba-DOOOOOK. You'll never quite see a children's pop-up book the same way after watching Australian director Jennifer Kent's frightening feature-length debut.

<p>While the rebooted big-budget popcorn blockbusters <em>Godzilla</em> and <em>Godzilla: King of the Monsters</em> have smashed and crashed through cinemas before this, another take on the terrible lizard took the crown in the 2010s. From<em> Evangelion </em>mastermind Hideaki Anno and Shinji Higuchi, <em>Shin Godzilla</em> unpacks the bureaucracy behind handling the invasion of a Giant Unidentified Creature. The film <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/japan-box-office-tohos-godzilla-916071" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">blatantly takes its cues</a> from the government's handling of the 2011 T&#333;hoku earthquake and tsunami, and the subsequent Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.</p><p>Though there are some spectacularly destructive city-stomping scenes, the film focuses on the repercussions of a government slow to act during a disaster. You'll sit through meeting upon meeting, weighing pros and cons, considering expert testimony, and managing logistics before any action is taken. Which government agency is responsible for this thing? What's the biggest priority: people or damage? While this is all happening, the evolving monster itself just looks like it's having the greatest time, slithering and smashing its way to global chaos.</p><p><strong>How to watch:</strong> <a href="https://zdcs.link/DVvJw?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Shin%20Godzilla%20is%20now%20available%20to%20rent%20or%20purchase%20on%20Prime%20Video&object_type=article&object_uuid=02fNOTQLYmAWFhxhsZzdJ2B&short_url=DVvJw&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Shin Godzilla</em> is now available to rent or purchase on Prime Video</a> (but only in the UK right now).</p><h2>7. <em>A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night</em></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>You've never seen an Iranian feminist vampire Western like this. Seriously, it's the only one. Writer/director Ana Lily Amirpour's feature-length film debut, <em>A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night</em> hinges on the nightly hunts of an intense young vampire (Sheila Vand) who rides a skateboard. Set in the ominous small town of Bad City, it's at once a sweet love story, a slick crime movie, a full-blown noir, a reinvented Western, and a bloody monster flick, with one of the best soundtracks around.</p><p><strong>How to watch: </strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/ddeLK?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=A%20Girl%20Walks%20Home%20Alone%20at%20Night%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Kanopy.&object_type=article&object_uuid=02fNOTQLYmAWFhxhsZzdJ2B&short_url=ddeLK&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night</em> is now streaming on Kanopy.</a></p><h2>8. <em>Troll Hunter</em></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>If you were to tell me that a found-footage horror about trolls would actually be an effective monster movie, I&rsquo;d think you were... trolling me (pew! pew!). But Norwegian director Andr&eacute; &Oslash;vredal's <em>Troll Hunter</em> uses dry humour and creative mythology-building to ask one question: What if there are trolls hiding in the mountains, and the Norwegian government not only knows about it but has deployed specialised hunters to keep them at bay? </p><p>It&rsquo;s a mockumentary that deploys the ol' student filmmaker-shot, first-person POV techniques popularised by <em>The Blair Witch Project</em>. While there are some good scares, it's actually kind of fun too. The key lies in the troll hunter himself.</p><p><strong>How to watch:</strong> <a href="https://zdcs.link/Q4bx7y?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Troll%20Hunter%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Max.&object_type=article&object_uuid=02fNOTQLYmAWFhxhsZzdJ2B&short_url=Q4bx7y&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Troll Hunter </em>is now streaming on Max.</a></p><h2>9. <em>The Cabin in the Woods</em></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>A film that's much smarter than it looks, <em>The Cabin in the Woods</em> is the ultimate slasher/monster movie homage. The directorial debut of <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer </em>writer Drew Goddard, the film unpacks the horror genre as expertly as Randy from <em>Scream </em>would. A group of college friends, each embodying a well-known horror trope, hit the road for the requisite drunken weekend away in a remote forest cabin.</p><p>But if you think you know where this film's going, you're wrong. That's the key to this savvy horror film, with two mysterious figures (the show-stealing Bradley Whitford and Richard Jenkins) quite literally changing the game on our protagonists. There are monsters aplenty, in every shape and size. If only everyone would listen to Marty (Fran Kranz): "Do not read the Latin."</p><p><strong>How to watch:</strong> <a href="https://zdcs.link/k7BVX?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=The%20Cabin%20in%20the%20Woods%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Peacock.&object_type=article&object_uuid=02fNOTQLYmAWFhxhsZzdJ2B&short_url=k7BVX&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>The Cabin in the Woods</em> is now streaming on Peacock.</a></p><h2>10. <em>Train to Busan</em></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>There are zombie films, and there are zombie films, and South Korean director Yeon Sang-ho's 2016 thriller <em>Train to Busan</em> is one of a kind. Almost entirely set on a train travelling from Seoul, the film follows Seok-woo (Gong Yoo) and his daughter Su-an (Kim Su-an), an estranged pair who find themselves passengers amid a zombie outbreak.</p><p>As fast-paced as its hordes of undead (these zombies run, <em>Dawn of the Dead</em> remake-style), the film sinks those gnashing teeth in and doesn't let go until the final sequence. The sheer scale of the zombie population in this film is realised through impressive extra work, and there are more than a few sequences that'll have you shifting uncomfortably in your seat. Genuinely moving, very bloody, and above all, an example of who the true monsters inevitably turn out to be during a disaster: us.</p><p><strong>How to watch:</strong> <a href="https://zdcs.link/ao5pGe?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Train%20to%20Busan%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Peacock.&object_type=article&object_uuid=02fNOTQLYmAWFhxhsZzdJ2B&short_url=ao5pGe&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Train to Busan</em> is now streaming on Peacock.</a></p><h2>11. <em>Crimson Peak</em></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Guillermo del Toro dabbled in a spot of Victorian-era Gothic horror in 2015 with his big-budget ghost story <em>Crimson Peak</em>. It's your classic set-up: A mysterious English baronet (Tom Hiddleston) with a crumbling mansion in northern England piques the romantic interest of an aspiring New York author (Mia Wasikowska), and off they trot to their creepy new home. But of course, the mansion holds a secret, not to mention conveniently blood-red clay grounds, some frighteningly bloody ghosts, and a highly sinister sister figure (Jessica Chastain). Armed with some solid jump-scares, <em>Crimson Peak</em> is the kind of camp, isolated-location nightmare that the likes of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/fall-of-the-house-of-usher-edgar-allan-poe-references" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Edgar Allan Poe</a> might appreciate.</p><p><strong>How to watch:</strong> <a href="https://zdcs.link/q4Pm3?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Crimson%20Peak%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Prime%20Video.&object_type=article&object_uuid=02fNOTQLYmAWFhxhsZzdJ2B&short_url=q4Pm3&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Crimson Peak</em> is now streaming on Prime Video.</a></p><h2>12. <em>Under the Skin</em></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Tehran in the '80s during the Iran-Iraq War is the last place you'd expect to be facing a djinn, but in <em>Under the Shadow, </em>that&rsquo;s exactly what's up. The feature-length directorial debut of Iranian-born, London-based filmmaker Babak Anvari, this modern version of a haunted house horror film centres around medical student Shideh (Narges Rashidi), whose family's apartment building is hit by a missile during the conflict. But that's not the only thing to worry about, with a shadowy presence threatening Shideh and her daughter Dorsa (Avin Manshadi) in between all-too-human attacks. It's a bona fide master class in tension building.</p><p><strong>How to watch: </strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/Pb3gy?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Under%20the%20Shadow%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Netflix.&object_type=article&object_uuid=02fNOTQLYmAWFhxhsZzdJ2B&short_url=Pb3gy&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Under the Shadow</em> is now streaming on Netflix.</a></p><p class="mx-auto">

<h2>25. <em>The Autopsy of Jane Doe</em></h2><p>Anybody who saw the absolute blast of found footage fun that was 2010's <em>Troll Hunter</em> knew that Norwegian director Andr&eacute; &Oslash;vredal was somebody to watch out for. And yet six years later, his follow-up, this claustrophobic oddity about a father and son pair of coroners (pre-<em>Succession</em> Brian Cox and Emile Hirsch) who go to work trying to figure out what killed the mysterious, unblemished young woman whose body has been delivered to their lab, didn't make much of a sound. Not at first, anyway.&nbsp;</p><p>But over the years the film's cult has steadily grown, and by now from where I stand, it's become a stone cold (or should I say, "corpse cold"?) classic. Awash in deeply unsettling body horror that digs its hooks deep into our anxieties about what's under our own skin, <em>The Autopsy of Jane Doe</em> eventually twists its scalpel to become something even stranger still.

She plays Sarah, a divorced mother and fertility doctor suddenly in charge of her late father's estate &mdash; which includes her estranged mother, Joan (Greta Scacchi), who is in the beginning stages of dementia and is in an adult care home. If that weren't enough, Sarah's young daughter, Mia (Lily LaTorre), has begun acting strange. First, it&rsquo;s the stray rabbit she&rsquo;s brought home and started dressing like. Then, it&rsquo;s some creepy crayon drawings and insistent demands to visit Joan, whom Mia has never met. Finally, it&rsquo;s the girl&rsquo;s conviction that she&rsquo;s not Mia at all but Alice, Sarah&rsquo;s sister who went missing when they were children at the same age Mia is now. Is Alice back for some sisterly spooks? Director Daina Reid makes deft use of unnerving sound design, creepy visuals, and a pervasive sense of dread and danger to strongly suggest the answer is yes. &mdash; <em>R.H.&nbsp;</em></p><p><strong>How to watch:</strong> <a href="https://zdcs.link/D0LYw?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Run%20Rabbit%20Run%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Netflix.&object_type=article&object_uuid=01HrszmAfWrcHdPZrGm7els&short_url=D0LYw&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Run Rabbit Run </em>is now streaming on Netflix.</a></p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>21. <em>The Babysitter </em></h2><p>Y'know, I'm not sure <em>The Babysitter </em>really works as a movie; it's more the idea of a movie loosely strung together by one-liners and style. Still, it's a fun way to kill a few hours. Samara Weaving stars as the titular childcare professional, a popular teen with a passion for human sacrifice and one-liners. Judah Lewis stars as the kid being babysat, with supporting performances by Hana Mae Lee, Robbie Amell, Bella Thorne, and Andrew Bachelor. The sequel, released in 2020, is more of the same &mdash; so if you like the first, do a <a href="https://zdcs.link/gL2ve?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=double%20feature&object_type=article&object_uuid=01HrszmAfWrcHdPZrGm7els&short_url=gL2ve&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">double feature</a>. <em>&mdash; Alison Foreman, Entertainment Reporter</em></p><p><strong>How to watch: </strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/rKDnX?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=The%20Babysitter&object_type=article&object_uuid=01HrszmAfWrcHdPZrGm7els&short_url=rKDnX&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>The Babysitter</em></a><a href="https://zdcs.link/rKDnX?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Netflix.&object_type=article&object_uuid=01HrszmAfWrcHdPZrGm7els&short_url=rKDnX&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"> is now streaming on Netflix.</a></p><h2>20. <em>Bone Tomahawk</em></h2><p>If you've already seen <em>Bone Tomahawk</em> &mdash; writer/director S.

(The film manages to thread the needle on what could be considered problematic representation, making it clear this tribe is shunned by all the other tribes due to their inbred cannibalistic savagery.) That's basically the entirety of it: a rescue mission that goes very, very, very sour, very fast.

<p>From the dude behind the brilliant 2014 psychological thriller <em>Nightcrawler </em>comes a hilarious &mdash; and horrifying &mdash; send-up of the Los Angeles art scene. In writer-director Dan Gilroy's epic <em>Velvet Buzzsaw, </em>Jake Gyllenhaal, Rene Russo, Toni Collette, and half a dozen other performers you probably love act their hearts out as fine art appreciators hunted down and killed by their priceless pieces.

<p>One of the most underrated titles in Netflix's original horror catalog, Isa Mazzei and Daniel Goldhaber's <em>Cam </em>combines the tumultuous world of professional webcam modeling with the insidious terrors of a body-snatching whodunnit. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-handmaids-tale-season-4-refresher" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>The Handmaid's Tale</em></a>'s Madeline Brewer stars as Alice Ackerman, an ambitious performer eager to climb up the digital ranks who finds herself confronted with a doppelg&auml;nger gunning to take her spot, her fans, and maybe...her life. <em>&mdash; A.F. </em></p><p><strong>How to watch: </strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/N1v63?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Cam&object_type=article&object_uuid=01HrszmAfWrcHdPZrGm7els&short_url=N1v63&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Cam </em></a><a href="https://zdcs.link/N1v63?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Netflix.&object_type=article&object_uuid=01HrszmAfWrcHdPZrGm7els&short_url=N1v63&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">is now streaming on Netflix.</a></p><h2>12. <em>The Babadook</em></h2><p>Way back before becoming an inexplicable LGBTQ+ icon, <em>The Babadook</em> was just a simple ghoul standing in front of a girl asking her to "dook dook dook" it. Anyway, enough has been written in the last decade about director Jennifer Kent's 2014 film being an "allegory for grief" that we should probably start writing papers about those papers now. Or perhaps we should just wipe away the cobwebs and see the movie for what it is, which is a barn-burner of a tale about an overworked mom (Essie Davis, who deserved all of the awards for this performance) and her anxious little boy Samuel (Noah Wiseman, really earning that "World's Most Annoying Brat" mug) unraveling together hand-in-hand in the wake of family tragedy. The performances keep everything almost too relatable, and Kent's eye for gothic weirdness summoned a new horror icon right out of thin air. <em>&mdash; J.A.</em></p><p><strong>How to watch:</strong> <a href="https://zdcs.link/L37E0?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=The%20Babadook%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Netflix.&object_type=article&object_uuid=01HrszmAfWrcHdPZrGm7els&short_url=L37E0&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>The Babadook</u></em><u> is now streaming on Netflix</u>.</a></p><h2>11. <em>Bodies Bodies Bodies</em></h2><p>Director Halina Reijn's <a href="https://mashable.com/article/bodies-bodies-bodies-movie-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Bodies Bodies Bodies</em></a> is a spin on the "Old Dark House" trope &mdash; get a bunch of pretty people trapped inside a space and then start picking them off one by one, until the survivor(s) can suss out the killer(s) and their motive(s).

<p>Directed by Zak Hilditch and based on Stephen King's novella of the same name, <em>1922 </em>tackles classic themes of guilt, envy, and evil through the grim lens of the American Dust Bowl. Thomas Jane and Molly Parker square off to striking effect, painting a portrait of a marriage that is as at once remarkably absurd and nauseatingly plausible. The couple's son, played by Dylan Schmid, is just as compelling, with a heartbreaking storyline you won't soon forget.

<p>Writer-director Remi Weekes' <em>His House </em>is easily my favorite scary Netflix release from 2020.

<p>It was exiled in cult-ville for a while, but <em>Jennifer's Body</em> finally seems to have secured its rightful place as a stone-cold teen-horror classic. Directed by Karyn Kusama (<em>The Invitation</em>) and written by Diablo Cody (<em>Juno</em>), the film centers on nerdy teen girl Needy (Amanda Seyfried) and popular queen bee Jennifer (Megan Fox) and their unlikely BFF love affair. Their friendship becomes unlikelier still when Jennifer finds herself assaulted by a Satan-worshipping rock band and accidentally turns into a literal man-eating succubus.</p><p>As the pile of dead horny teen boys begins piling up, Needy must stop her bestie from bleeding the entire high school class dry. And all of teenage-dom's fraught bullshit becomes weaponized in a teen girl duel to the death that could've only come from the keyboard of Diablo Cody. &mdash; <em>J.A.</em></p><p><strong>How to watch: </strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/avxmn0?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Jennifer%27s%20Body%20is%20streaming%20on%20Hulu.&object_type=article&object_uuid=030Hz39N5Yn3cIFrQAVob8o&short_url=avxmn0&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Jennifer's Body</u></em><u> is streaming on Hulu.</u></a></p><h2>4. <em>Hatching</em></h2><p>A perfect companion piece to <em>Black Swan</em>, <em>Hatching</em> is a Finnish horror film from 2022 about a tween girl ballerina named Tinja (Siiri Solalinna) whose overbearing influencer mother (Sophia Heikkil&auml;) is far more concerned about presenting a perfect image to the world than any well-being, mental or physical, of her daughter's.

<p>The first feature written and directed by British actor Romola Garai (<em>Atonement</em>), <em>Amulet</em> is a gothic chiller about an ex-soldier named Tomaz (Alec Secareanu of <em>God's Own Country</em>) who's being chased by the ghosts of his past. Not literally &mdash; this is not a ghost movie &mdash; but via the very bad memories he carries with him from his unnamed war-torn homeland. Ones which we become privy to via flashback, and ones that become gradually more disturbing as the film goes on. Unable to accomplish much in his life, he ends up on the streets of London, where a nun named Sister Claire (Imelda Staunton) takes pity on him and gets him a job as the live-in helper to a young woman named Magda (Carla Juri) who's taking care of her ill mother, hidden away in the attic. That's never a warning sign!</p><p>Yes, this gig turns out to be not exactly what he was sold on, and his discoveries about these two women become as scary as anything bubbling up from his disturbing past. Before he even realizes it, Tomaz finds himself trapped in a whole new sort of nightmare. It's not so surprising, given there's an actor in the director's chair, that <em>Amulet</em> prioritizes the slow and unsettling build of its performances, taking time to establish a sturdy and enviable relationship between Tomaz and Magda that we come to care about. Right before horribly ripping that rug out from under us and revealing the shrieking chasm of horror that's been right beneath their feet &mdash; or in this case, up in the attic &mdash; all along. &mdash; <em>J.A.&nbsp;</em></p><p><strong>How to watch: </strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/91byEx?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Amulet%20is%20streaming%20on%20Hulu.&object_type=article&object_uuid=030Hz39N5Yn3cIFrQAVob8o&short_url=91byEx&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Amulet</u></em><u> is streaming on Hulu</u>.</a></p><h2>6. <em>The First Omen</em></h2><p>Not that these habits deserve defending, but if one were so inclined, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-first-omen-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>The<a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-first-omen-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em> First Omen</em></a></u></a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-first-omen-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u> is a good movie to point to</u></a> when people say that Hollywood's insistent reliance on IP is totally fruitless. This is one of the (few and far between) good examples in which adding onto an iconic story bore some fruit. Presented as a direct prequel to Richard Donner's 1970 film, director Arkasha Stevenson &mdash; whose fine work on the two streaming horror series <em>Brand New Cherry Flavor </em>and <em>Channel Zero</em> should not go unspoken &mdash;&nbsp;suffuses <em>The First Omen</em> in a sense of dread that proves worthy of its forebear.</p><p>The movie tells the story of an American nun-in-training named Sister Margaret (Nell Tiger Free from <em>Servant</em>) sent to Rome to work at an orphanage. After bonding with Carlita (Nicole Sorace), the resident weirdo orphan who's kept locked in her room so she can devote all her time to drawing weirdo drawings, Sister Margaret becomes convinced that there is a plot surrounding the girl. Specifically, her fellow nuns and the priests in charge mean to sacrifice Carlita in some sort of pact with the devil. And if you do know <em>The Omen,</em> you can probably guess where this is all going, but Stevenson packs the film to the rafters with wildly unsettling imagery, and Free is such a terrific actress that you're drawn into this nightmare anyway, deeply dreading those final moments that you know are looming ahead. &mdash;<em> J.A.&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How to watch: </strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/z7b374?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=The%20First%20Omen%20is%20streaming%20on%20Hulu.&object_type=article&object_uuid=030Hz39N5Yn3cIFrQAVob8o&short_url=z7b374&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>The First Omen</u></em><u> is streaming on Hulu</u>.</a></p><h2>7. <em>Villains </em></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

It's basically a Western, just with sleek snowy parkas standing in for chaps. But it is very much how director Kim Jee-woon stages it all &mdash; a brutal knife fight between three men inside a moving car turns violence into poetry. As each man thinks they've gotten one over on the other, we watch them twist and turn toward hell together &mdash; it hits its marks but with such style. <em>I Saw the Devil </em>is thrilling, bloody, and extremely scary when it wants to be&hellip; which is thankfully very often. &mdash; <em>J.A.</em></p><p><strong>How to watch:</strong> <a href="https://zdcs.link/znOJd8?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=I%20Saw%20the%20Devil%20is%20streaming%20on%20Hulu.&object_type=article&object_uuid=030Hz39N5Yn3cIFrQAVob8o&short_url=znOJd8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>I Saw the Devil </u></em><u>is streaming on Hulu</u>.</a>&nbsp;</p><h2>10. <em>Crimes of the Future</em></h2><p>You think you know what you're getting into, with <em>Crimes of the Future </em>being hailed as the movie that finally saw legendary Canadian director David Cronenberg dipping his toe back into the Body Horror well that he so thoroughly defined, thanks to films like <em>Videodrome</em> and <em>The Fly</em>, that it became known as "Cronenbergian." And yet <em>Crimes of the Future </em>&ndash; which shares a title with a film Cronenberg made in 1970 but is not a remake &ndash; is even weirder and funnier and more out-there than you can imagine.&nbsp;</p><p>Reuniting with his muse Viggo Mortensen, <em>Crimes of the Future</em> is really a rumination on the making of art. But in a way only Cronenberg could've come up with. Viggo plays Saul Tenser, a futuristic performance artist who has his deformed organs harvested on stage by his partner Caprice (Lea Sedoux) before growing new, even more bizarre organs in their place. Through no fault of his own, Saul becomes enmeshed in the battle between a group of evolutionary terrorists and the shady bureaucrats (including a hysterically strange Kristen Stewart) trying to stop them.

Writer-director Mark Jenkin's experimental 2020 twist on the folk horror genre stars a terrific Mary Woodvine as an unnamed scientist who's been left totally alone on a remote island off the coast of Cornwall, England, to study local plant life. Specifically, a kind of flower that only grows there, and the lichen that is devouring it.

It kicks right off with its titular amphibious monstrosity, the size of a city bus, leaping out of the Han River in downtown Seoul in the middle of the day and gobbling up a fleet of locals. Immediately, you know you're in for something new with <em>The Host</em>; usually monster movies take the <em>Jaws</em> route and conceal their beastie until the end. But Bong goes far above and beyond. Per usual.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides being chock-full of incredible creature attack action sequences, <em>The Host</em> also manages to be an alternatingly heartbreaking and heartwarming family drama, with South Korean legend Song Kang-ho in the lead and <em>Sense8</em> star Bae Doona kicking ass as his archer sister. As if that isn't enough, the movie is an act of political activism to boot, pointing its finger straight at the American military complex for poisoning Korea's waters.

<p>Vibing on similar themes as <em>The Babadook</em> and <em>Coraline</em>, director Samuel Bodin's debut feature stars <em>C'mon C'mon</em>'s Woody Norman as a bullied eight-year-old named Peter whose overprotective parents Carol (Lizzy Caplan) and Mark (Antony Starr) don't much help matters. Refusing to let him partake in normal childhood activities like trick-or-treating, they keep him cooped up in the house most of the time, constantly warning him about a young girl who went missing in their neighborhood some years before.&nbsp;</p><p>And then one night as Peter tries to sleep, a tap-tap-tapping on the inside of his bedroom wall begins, followed soon thereafter by a little girl's voice. And this little girl has nothing nice to say about Peter's parents. Slowly, Peter starts sensing his parents' strange behavior might be covering up a horrible secret, and before you can say "yellow wallpaper," the boy's suspicions begin unraveling his entire home life around him.

<p>Juan Carlos Fresnadillo's 2007 sequel to Danny Boyle's revolutionary zombie movie <em>28 Days Later</em> has never gotten the proper appreciation it deserves. Yes, tonally, it's a different beast, but I've always dug its concept of society crumbling all because of one man's simpering cowardice. Doesn't it just feel that way sometimes?&nbsp;</p><p>Starring <em>Trainspotting</em>'s Robert Carlyle as a man guilt-stricken over having run from a horde of infected and having left his wife to die, the film admittedly has a bit of a <em>Jaws IV</em> thing going on where the plague (slash shark) seems to have it out for one particular family, thereby straining all logic. But logic be damned, this one feels more like poetry, like a fairy tale turned to terrible life. <em>&mdash; J.A.</em></p><p><strong>How to watch:</strong> <a href="https://zdcs.link/MjkYL?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=28%20Weeks%20Later%20is%20streaming%20on%20Hulu.&object_type=article&object_uuid=030Hz39N5Yn3cIFrQAVob8o&short_url=MjkYL&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>28 Weeks Later</u></em><u> is streaming on Hulu.</u></a></p><h2>20. <em>Alien</em></h2><p>Witness the birth of three, yes three, horror icons!

<p>Sara (Laura Gal&aacute;n) is an overweight teenager living a deeply unhappy existence in a rural Spanish town; she can't even go for a swim on the hottest day of the summer without being mercilessly bullied by a gang of mean girls. (The film's title is their cruel nickname for Sara.) Those mean girls get theirs, though; they're kidnapped by a mysterious man who leaves behind one witness who could help save them: Sara herself.&nbsp;</p><p>And so writer/director Carlota Pereda's 2022 film, a feature-length reenvisioning of her own short film from a few years earlier, introduces its troubling moral quandary &mdash; should Sara show mercy for those who tormented her? Or should she give in to her thirst for revenge and leave them to rot on the vine? Pereda manages to complicate our feelings on the matter with every twist, all while delivering a terrific and tense exercise from the small-town drama surrounding the mystery of the missing girls. Gal&aacute;n gives a wonder of a performance, making Sara difficult to love but tremendously easy to empathize with. <em>&mdash; J.A.&nbsp;</em></p><p><strong>How to watch:</strong> <a href="https://zdcs.link/kpoV5?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Piggy%20is%20streaming%20on%20Hulu.&object_type=article&object_uuid=030Hz39N5Yn3cIFrQAVob8o&short_url=kpoV5&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Piggy</u></em><u> is streaming on Hulu.</u></a></p><h2>22. <em>Suitable Flesh</em></h2><p>When director Stuart Gordon died in 2020, a lot of horror fans feared they'd never again get a goopy and gross and downright disgustingly sexy H.P. Lovecraft adaptation again. With <em>Dagon</em>, <em>From Beyond</em>, and his <em>Re-Animator</em> movies, Gordon had proven the clear master of those cherished 1980s classics. Enter director Joe Lynch in 2023, who crafted <em>Suitable Flesh</em> as an ode to all things Gordon-ian, and gave us one of the most entertainingly sickening examples of them all.&nbsp;</p><p>An adaptation of the Lovecraft story "The Thing on the Doorstep," <em>Suitable Flesh</em> stars Heather Graham as the psychiatrist Elizabeth Derby, who's busy leading a perfect life with her hot, sweet husband Eddie (Johnathon Schaech). Perfect, that is, until she starts finding herself drawn, somewhat erotically, to a new patient named Asa (Judah Lewis), who's convinced his dying father has been possessing him. From there it all turns into a ton of bloody body-swapping fun that all of the actors have a hell of a good time playing with, especially once horror icon Barbra Crampton (star of several of Gordon's classics) swings in as Elizabeth's own psychiatrist.

<p>The conservative argument that disturbing content (like horror movies, for instance) will rot a person's brain and turn them into a psychopath is brought to diabolical life in writer/director Prano Bailey-Bond's psychedelic 2021 thriller <em>Censor</em>. Set in the mid-'80s, when controversy over <a href="https://www.bfi.org.uk/sight-and-sound/features/history-british-video-nasties" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>"video nasties"</u></a> has taken England by storm, <em>Censor</em> stars a stellar Niamh Algar (<em>Mary &amp; George</em>) as a prim woman named Enid who works for the British Board of Film Classification. Basically, it's her job to watch all of the really fucked-up movies and tell the filmmakers what they have to edit out if they want to be certified for public exhibition.&nbsp;</p><p>So day after day, Enid sifts through the worst stuff imaginable, going frame by repulsive frame. It doesn't help that she's got her own childhood trauma involving a missing sister lurking about, which one film that she watches in particular seems to trigger a few repressed memories of real hard. And before you know it, our precious Enid finds herself falling down the filthy rabbit hole of exploitation cinema, her sanity a mere splatter upon its walls. And thank goodness nobody was around to censor <em>Censor</em>, because this is one fucked-up good time. <em>&mdash; J.A.&nbsp;</em></p><p><strong>How to watch:</strong> <a href="https://zdcs.link/JpByq?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Censor%20is%20streaming%20on%20Hulu.&object_type=article&object_uuid=030Hz39N5Yn3cIFrQAVob8o&short_url=JpByq&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Censor</u></em><u> is streaming on Hulu.</u></a></p><h2>24. <em>The Feast</em></h2><p>One of the <a href="https://in.mashable.com/entertainment/21037/sxsw-the-feast-review-an-eerie-welsh-movie-served-with-a-side-of-eco-horror" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>best of the recent folk horrors</u></a> that we've seen in the wake of <em>Midsommar</em> and <em>The Witch</em>, Lee Haven Jones' Welsh 2021 fright-fest <em>The Feast</em> is deeply creepy, stuffed to its tippy-top with hair-raising imagery that I dare you to forget anytime soon after. Set against a small dinner party at the country estate of a rich and powerful family, led by politician-father Gwyn (Julian Lewis Jones), it's easy enough to see pretty much where <em>The Feast</em> is going from its start. Anyone would clock these rich people as immediately awful, and the local girl Cadi (Annes Elwy) who's been hired to help out with the party has some sort of off-kilter and sinister vibe from the moment she steps onto their property.&nbsp;</p><p>And yet the disturbing depths Jones takes everything to still shock &ndash; it's basically <em>Triangle of Sadness</em> meets <em>The Wicker Man, </em>but with way more booby-trapped genitals then that equation might at first imply. And to cap it all off, the mossy nightmare vibes of Bjorn Stale Bratberg's cinematography are absolutely breathtaking.

<p>The absolutely vicious first film from director S. Craig Zahler (who went on to make the also-vicious action flicks <em>Brawl in Cell Block 99</em> and <em>Dragged Across Concrete</em>) remains his best work to date, somewhat by leaps and bounds. <em>Bone Tomahawk</em> is a 2015 Western set in 1890s California about two morons (David Arquette and Sid Haig) who stupidly desecrate a Native American burial site and end up dragging their entire town into utter hell for it.&nbsp;</p><p>Their blunder sets into a chain of events that forces the sheriff (Kurt Russell) and a pack of local men (among them Matthew Fox, Richard Jenkins, Patrick Wilson) to head out into hostile territory to save the wimmin-n-chillin', as the saying goes. Oh and did I mention that the tribe they're up against are inbred troglodyte cannibals that all the other Native Americans steer super clear of? That's probably an important detail. Featuring one of the most grotesque scenes of violence put on screen in the last 20 years, <em>Bone Tomahawk</em> makes the "hard" in "Goes Hard" work extra extra hard y'all. &mdash; <em>J.A.</em></p><p><strong>How to watch:</strong> <a href="https://www.hulu.com/movie/33141423-0614-40b8-897d-75a4496689c5" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Bone Tomahawk</u></em><u> is now streaming on Hulu</u></a>.</p><h2>26. <em>When Evil Lurks</em></h2><p>Another one <a href="https://mashable.com/article/when-evil-lurks-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>that goes super duper hard</u></a>, Demi&aacute;n Rugna's <em>When Evil Lurks</em> lurched its monstrous way toward us in 2022 out of Argentina, telling us of the apocalyptic outbreak that happens after an evil spirit is not sufficiently disposed of by brother-farmers Pedro and Jaime (Ezequiel Rodr&iacute;guez and Demi&aacute;n Salomon).

The first round sees you trying to guess the word, with correct, misplaced, and incorrect letters shown in each guess. If you guess the correct answer, it'll take you to the next hurdle, providing the answer to the last hurdle as your first guess. This can give you several clues or none, depending on the words. For the final hurdle, every correct answer from previous hurdles is shown, with correct and misplaced letters clearly shown.</p><p>An important note is that the number of times a letter is highlighted from previous guesses does necessarily indicate the number of times that letter appears in the final hurdle. </p><p>If you find yourself stuck at any step of today's Hurdle, don't worry!

Words can be made from linked letters &mdash; up, down, left, right, or diagonal, but words can also change direction, resulting in quirky shapes and patterns. Every single letter in the grid will be part of an answer. There's always a theme linking every solution, along with the "spangram," a special, word or phrase that sums up that day's theme, and spans the entire grid horizontally or vertically.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>On the teen series spectrum, <em>Heartstopper</em> has always felt like a younger sibling of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/sex-education-season-3-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Sex Education</em></a>, a less dramatic companion of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/never-have-i-ever-season-3-netflix-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Never Have I Ever</em></a>, and the polar opposite of darker teen shows like <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-british-tv-shows-hulu" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Skins</em></a> or <a href="https://mashable.com/article/euphoria-season-2-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Euphoria</em></a>. And this season, though the characters move further into maturity, <em>Heartstopper</em> maintains its tendency for tenderness through life's complicated turns.

As in Season 2, <em>Heartstopper</em> subtly and tactfully shows how difficult everyday situations can be for Charlie: a picnic with friends, a casual crisp offer at lunch, a day at the beach in swimming costumes. Locke is expertly understated and nuanced in his portrayal of Charlie's concealed pain, with Oseman's animated illustrations helping to convey his inner tension. Episode 4, one of the best episodes of the season (and of the year, in my opinion) shows Charlie's decision to ask for help and get treatment through both his and Nick's points of view in their journals. It's a sensitive insight into a very interior struggle.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>At the same time, the show portrays the complexities of caring for someone you love who has an eating disorder. Connor is superb this season, conveying Nick's deep feelings for Charlie but also his deep fear over getting things wrong &mdash; there's a brilliant scene involving a conversation with Nick's kick-ass Aunt Diane (welcome series addition Hayley Atwell) about not needing to have all the answers; it should be mandatory viewing. Thankfully, the series also gives us way more time with Charlie's concerned, stoic sister Tori (Jenny Walser), Oseman's original protagonist, meaning some brilliant scenes between Locke and Walser. And through some deeply moving moments &mdash; I'm still recovering from Tao's (William Gao) film project for Charlie &mdash; we see Charlie's friends turn up for him, too.</p><div id="related-video" class="mx-auto mt-8 mb-12 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans md:mt-12 md:mb-16 text-primary-400">

<p>Lik<em>e Everything Now</em>, <em>Heartstopper</em> shows that Charlie's recovery isn't without setbacks, especially when he returns home from treatment. His family often <em>does</em> say the wrong thing, and Charlie's frustration at being treated as "fragile" results in understandable anger. Importantly,<em> Heartstopper </em>tackles another considerable issue for people living with eating disorders: <a href="https://mashable.com/article/body-image-self-esteem-sex-life-tips" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>body dysmorphia and anxiety over body image, especially when it comes to sex</u></a><u>.</u></p><h2><em>Heartstopper</em> approaches early sexual experiences with trust, respect, and curiosity.</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Having set itself apart from other teen dramas as more sugary and PG, <em>Heartstopper</em> has somewhat distanced itself from conversations around sex. Season 1 was about as far away from the frank likes of <em>Sex Education</em> as you could get, and Season 2 only hinted at the possibility of characters taking things further. But this season, <em>Heartstopper</em> is all raging hormones, while maintaining the show's well-worn status as a safe, nonjudgmental, pressure-free space. It's incredibly refreshing to see insecurity in intimacy met with compassion.&nbsp;</p><p>In Season 3, as in Oseman's graphic novel, the characters tentatively figure out their sexual desires and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-set-sexual-boundaries" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">boundaries</a> in very sweet scenes. Charlie and Nick, who left the "L" word hanging at the end of Season 2, fall headfirst into their feelings and desires this season, namely figuring out if they're ready for their first sexual experiences. While Connor and Locke thrive in realising their characters' complex inner turmoils alone, together they're dynamite romantic leads.</p><p>Like <em>Sex Education</em>, <em>Heartstopper</em> makes plain the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/uk-sex-education-politics" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>crisis of sex education in the UK</u></a> through complete classroom nonsense (yes, we're talking cucumbers and condoms). But by learning from one another with trust and respect, the Paris Crew stumbles through their first experiences with apprehension, curiosity, and patience. That is, when their parents and siblings aren't barging in on them.</p><h2>The rest of the Paris Crew go through it,&nbsp;too.</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Charlie and Nick aren't the only ones managing maturity and heavier things this season; Elle (Yasmin Finney) navigates gender dysphoria, Darcy (Kizzy Edgell) explores their gender identity and trying new pronouns, Tara (Corinna Brown) struggles with anxiety, Imogen (Rhea Norwood) confronts her internalised heteronormativity, and Isaac (Tobie Donovan) combats loneliness among his coupled-up friends while further exploring his asexuality.</p><p>Finney is a particular highlight this season, with Elle's sense of identity really tested publicly and privately. When Elle unpacks her gender dysphoria being triggered with Tao, the conversation is comfortable and respectful. But when she's lambasted on a community radio show with anti-trans rhetoric, Elle's sense of herself is rattled, and Finney gives her best performance yet. "It feels like the whole world is against me," she tells Tao, and it's not out of place, with trans young people <a href="https://www.stonewall.org.uk/system/files/lgbt_in_britain_hate_crime.pdf" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>continuing to face abuse, harassment, and discrimination</u></a> on a daily basis in the UK.</p><p>Ultimately, <em>Heartstopper</em> shifts into more grown-up territory this season, to moving and enlightening effect. And the show manages to do so while maintaining the sense of curiosity and compassion that makes Oseman's comics so relatable and enduring. With the cast at their very best yet, it's another superb season for <em>Heartstopper</em>, one we're delighted to say "hi" again to.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/a5bGod?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Heartstopper%20Season%203%20is%20streaming%20on%20Netflix%20Oct.%204.&object_type=article&object_uuid=01MMADbpQLhwQFJpFZRYib0&short_url=a5bGod&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Heartstopper </em>Season 3 is streaming on Netflix Oct. 4.</a></p><p><em>If you feel like you'd like to talk to someone about your eating behavior, in the U.S. you can call the National Eating Disorder Association's helpline at 800-931-2237.

<p>I can confirm that the outage was real, personally.

<h2>Use AI to build and unify your brand&nbsp;</h2><p>One of the things AI is particularly good at is getting you past that dreaded blank-page moment. Squarespace Blueprint AI is the perfect example of that &mdash; it can transform basic information about you and your brand into a fully bespoke website you can easily edit or add to.</p><p>Consistency is key to building a brand, so Squarespace's new approach to web design &mdash; aptly titled Design Intelligence &mdash; uses your brand attributes to generate a cohesive, unified online presence in just a few steps. Plus, their AI writer can use your brand voice to generate on-brand copy across placements like SEO site descriptions, video descriptions, and even client documents. &nbsp;</p><h2>Market your brand like a pro</h2><p>You&rsquo;ll want to get that fresh website out there fast.&nbsp;</p><p>Squarespace makes it easy with two tools. First up is the Marketing Automation Builder, which helps you create and trigger emails based on audience actions and the rules you set. This ensures your content and brand stay top of mind at the right moments, helping you scale more effectively.</p><p>The other tool is Bio Sites, which centralizes your content, store, and more within one link in bio, to easily share your world with your followers.

The satellite will then send the information to one of its ground stations, which routes the call to a local dispatch center or relay center if the dispatch center is unable to receive 911 text messages. These relay centers consist of third-party and Apple-employed specialists who are trained in emergency protocol to communicate with dispatchers and relay the information back and forth. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Testing this feature out is a bit of a catch-22. Apple hopes you're never in an emergency where you have to use it, and it <em>really</em> doesn't want you testing it out when you're not in an emergency. Did you know prank calling 911, which is essentially what you'd be doing, is a felony? (Yeah, Apple doesn't want you doing that.) That said, the best time to learn how to use Emergency SOS via satellite is when you're not in an actual emergency. When facing mortal peril, the last thing you need to deal with is scrolling through your settings to find the feature.&nbsp;So Apple has developed a demo mode for users to test it out in a non-emergency situation. </p><p>Mashable was able to demo the feature in a controlled environment. Here's how it works. </p><h2><strong>Emergency SOS on iPhone: How to use it</strong></h2><p>You'll find this feature when you call, text, or use <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-siri-voice-assistant-dropping-hey-command" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Siri</a> or <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-iphone-14-crash-detection-feature-test" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Crash Detection</a> to contact 911 in an area where there's no cellular service or Wi-Fi. It can also be activated via Fall Detection with <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-watch-ultra-too-big" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple Watch</a> if you have it set up to route emergency services through your iPhone. </p><p>Emergency SOS via satellite is prepared to activate when the SOS icon appears at the top right-hand corner of the screen, which indicates there's no cellular/Wi-Fi connectivity and satellite service is available. A combination of hardware and software components power the feature, which is why it's only available on iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro models. </p><p>You activate the feature by dialing 911. When the call doesn't go through because there's no connection, the green circular icon at the bottom right of the screen will read, "Emergency text via Satellite." Tap this icon to activate the feature. It's important to note that because the feature is messaging a satellite, there is going to be a latency. Apple says it takes about 15 seconds for a message to be sent and could take up to a minute if you're under some trees with foliage. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 max-w-3xl">

<h2>Provide details about the emergency</h2><p>Next, the feature will ask you a series of questions to gather information about the nature of the emergency. Remember: If you are unable to fill out the report, as long as you have made it to this step, emergency services will be notified regardless. For the purpose of the demo, it helped to come up with a specific emergency situation, so I imagined I had broken my leg while hiking in a remote mountain range.

<p>The final step in the emergency report was the option to notify emergency contacts. This uses a pre-existing feature called Medical ID that notifies designated people in the event of an emergency and emergency services if you have any medical conditions, allergies, or take medication. Theoretically, I would have filled this out before my doomed excursion, and my emergency contact would be alerted of my traumatic injury. Your emergency contacts will also have access to a text conversation between you and emergency services, so that they can follow the dialogue in real time (although they can't reply in the chat). </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 max-w-3xl">

<h2>Texting with emergency services via satellite</h2><p>Once all of the details of the emergency were sent, which included my medical information and location, a new conversation was created with the relay center responding to my request. A status bar at the top of the screen showed that the iPhone was still connected and reminded me to keep pointing the phone in the same direction to remain connected. After about 30 seconds, I received a text from the relay center asking me to describe my location and if I had any medication with me (because the Medical ID had been filled out to say I took medication). </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>Demo mode </h2><p>If you want to be extra prepared, you can test the feature for yourself in demo mode. Access this by going to Settings, then Emergency SOS, and tapping Try Demo. The demo will temporarily disable your cellular connection and connect to a real satellite to walk you through the feature. This is so you can get a realistic sense of where to position your phone and understand the latency time to send and receive messages via satellite. It's also a good way to know what questions to expect if the unthinkable happens. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 max-w-3xl">

<h2>Takeaways</h2><p>Between Fall Detection, Crash Detection, and Emergency SOS via satellite, Apple is really concerned about its users' safety. Would I feel better knowing that I have this feature at my fingertips on a hike or even driving through a dead zone in a remote area? Absolutely. It increases the likelihood that I'll be able to get help.</p><p>That said, it's a lengthy process that requires me to complete a lot of steps in order to get the help I need. It follows a similar emergency protocol conversation that a 911 dispatcher is trained to follow, so it isn't much different than that, but something about tapping and texting in a crisis feels like more of an obstacle to overcome &mdash; especially if I'm physically incapacitated. </p><q>
    It's a lengthy process that requires me to complete a lot of steps in order to get the help I need.

<p>There's also the privacy issue: <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213426" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple says</a> your messages are sent to the satellite in an encrypted form and then decrypted by Apple to send to the emergency dispatcher. It also says your messages may be saved by emergency services and relay centers "to improve their services." It's not unlike the privacy risk of a typical <a href="https://recordinglaw.com/are-911-calls-public-records/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">911 call, which is considered public record</a> (access to such records depends by state). Still, before using this feature, you need to consider the fact that your information could be retained. </p><p>It's something to keep in mind, but even for a privacy advocate, it's an exception you might be willing to make in an emergency. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Wi-Fi calling does not use up your mobile data.</p><p>Enjoy better quality phone calls moving forward.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

Do you have bad service? No &ndash; in fact, you have <em>no</em> service. The service bars on your iPhone aren't just low, they are completely missing.&nbsp;</p><p>In place of the bars? "SOS."</p><h2><strong>What does 'SOS' mean?</strong></h2><p>SOS mode is a way for your iPhone to make emergency calls even when you are completely out of service.&nbsp;</p><p>It's obviously good that this SOS feature exists. But seeing it often means that something is wrong with your cellular service and your iPhone can't make calls, receive calls, send messages, access the internet, nor do anything else that requires a cellular connection.</p><p>But even without any cellular service, SOS mode allows iPhone users to call 911 and share their location in the case of an emergency.</p><h2><strong>How does SOS mode work?</strong></h2><p>If you have no cellular connection, how do calls to emergency services still receive calls?</p><p>SOS mode has evolved a bit with newer iPhone models. Previously, if SOS mode was activated, your iPhone would be able to access any service provider's network &ndash; not just your service provider &ndash; in order to connect with 911.</p><p>Since iPhone 14 and later, Apple has been able to utilize satellites in order to connect with emergency services when needed.</p><p>Based on spiking trends on search engines, it appears many users are still unaware of the SOS mode features. Seeing "SOS" on your iPhone usually means doom at first sight. There are outages with your carrier and you won't be able to use your phone at the moment. </p><p>But the fact that iPhone users can still get help in an emergency should still be a welcome sign &ndash; even if the "SOS" message itself isn't.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>Phone stuck in SOS mode: What to do</h2><p>To be honest, there is no real fix beyond Verizon's network coming back online. We will update this story when that is the case. </p><p>You could try putting your phone in airplane mode &mdash; or turning it off entirely &mdash; to try to reconnect to the network. Though if the network remains down, you will likely still be unable to connect. </p><p>You could also use <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/108066#:~:text=To%20turn%20on%20Wi%2DFi,will%20use%20Wi%2DFi%20Calling." target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Wi-Fi calling</a>.

<p>According to Media Matters' research, AI-generated audios have accumulated millions of views, which include videos mocking the leader or those that have turned the audio into a meme. Other accounts appeared to be dedicated to creating and sharing these audios earnestly, sometimes with outrightly anti-Semitic messaging. Popular videos using said audio, often stylized with slowed down and "reverbed" audios, go as far back as April 2024, with several improperly translated. Following the publishing of the report, TikTok removed the account of one known uploader and began directing related searches to a <a href="https://www.latintimes.com/tiktok-redirects-users-holocaust-info-page-after-hitlers-ai-translated-speeches-go-viral-560287" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">"Facts About the Holocaust"</a> page, which documents Hitler's slaughter of millions of civilian Jews, disabled people, political prisoners, LGBTQ+ people, and those of Romani origin. </p><p>The <em>Washington Post</em> reported that known fascist groups have praised the use of AI to spread bigoted propaganda, citing a growth in "red-pilled" young people engaging with hate speech and right-wing communities online.

Two days of glorious deals on almost every product imaginable including headphones, tablets, laptops, robot vacuums, and the list goes on and on.

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>The Amazon Echo Show 5 works as a smart home hub that's more than just a speaker. It displays music, recipes, and even video calls with its built-in camera. While we normally prefer the Echo Show 8 over the 5, ahead of Prime Big Deal Days, we're thoroughly pleased with the $50 discount on the Echo Show 5.</p><p>With <strong>code ECHOSHOW50</strong>, score the Amazon Echo Show 5 for just $39.99. That saves you $50, for 55% off.</p><h3>More Echo deals</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/aDVMqR?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Amazon%20Echo%20Pop&object_type=article&object_uuid=009CYHJ9ykSAvEhTOWHlO2x&short_url=aDVMqR&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Amazon Echo Pop</a> &mdash;

The 11-in-1 multicooker is basically all of your kitchen appliances wrapped up into one magical device. It can pressure cook, steam, slow cook, air fry, sous vide, roast, saut&eacute;, broil, dehydrate, keep foods warm, and make yogurt. It's also dishwasher safe and large enough to fit a five-pound chicken or three pounds of fries. Regularly retailing for $200, you can score it on sale ahead of October's Prime Day for just $129.99. That's 35% in savings and the lowest price we've seen since Black Friday.</p><h3>More kitchen deals</h3><p><strong>Air fryer deals</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/9ywZMe?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Chefman%20TurboFry%20Touch%20air%20fryer%20%284-quart%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=009CYHJ9ykSAvEhTOWHlO2x&short_url=9ywZMe&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Chefman TurboFry Touch air fryer (4-quart)</a> &mdash;

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>Mashable reporter RJ Andersen <a href="https://mashable.com/review/samsung-galaxy-buds-fe" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">reviewed the Samsung Galaxy Buds FE</a> and was pleasantly surprised, noting that even Apple users should consider them. "The sound quality from the Galaxy Buds FE is unmatched for earbuds at this price range," she wrote, adding that the customizable fit, solid battery life, and great active noise cancellation are all major selling points for these buds. Usually $99.99, you can grab a pair ahead of October Prime Day for only $79.99. That's 20% in savings and their lowest price on record. </p><h3>More Samsung Galaxy deals</h3><p><strong>Galaxy Book deals</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/aMvpKk?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%2016-inch%20Galaxy%20Book4%20Pro%20%28Intel%20Core%207%20Ultra%2C%2016GB%20RAM%2C%201TB%20SSD%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=009CYHJ9ykSAvEhTOWHlO2x&short_url=aMvpKk&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung 16-inch Galaxy Book4 Pro (Intel Core 7 Ultra, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD)</a> &mdash;

That includes Prime events not officially called Prime Day, like Prime Big Deal Days <a href="https://mashable.com/article/when-does-october-prime-day-start-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">coming up on Oct. 8 and 9</a>.

<p>The universalization of the self-emptying dock has also made it a much more affordable feature in general, even when no discount is present &mdash;&nbsp;so Prime Day deals on these robovacs means you may not have to pay more than $300 or $400 to be off dustbin duty for a few weeks.</p><p>If you do have a more flexible budget, though, the automatic maintenance feature to look for this Prime Day would be self-washing and drying mopping pads. iRobot, Shark, Roborock, Eufy, Ecovacs, and more all have at least one <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-robot-vacuum-and-mop-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">robot vacuum and mop combo</a> that deals with its own dust <em>and</em> dirty mopping pads all in the same dock. These are obviously pricier than hybrids that make you do this manually, so to have a few hundred dollars knocked off the price during (or before) Prime Day is game-changing. </p><p>We've pulled all of the best early deals on self-emptying robot vacuums live at Amazon ahead of the official Prime Big Deal Days kickoff on Oct. 8. This list will be updated daily as more options go on sale, so be sure to check back throughout the next week.</p><h2>Best early Prime Day self-emptying vacuum and mop deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>Ecovacs wasn't lying when it came up with the term "all-in-one cleaning hub" here, considering that this robot vacuum not only empties itself and washes and dries its own mopping pads, but also has another sweet feature tacked onto the dock: a handheld cordless vacuum. If your main hesitation with robot vacuums was that they can't scale a staircase, sweep under couch cushions, or detail corners up to your standards, this is the one robot vacuum purchase that <em>can</em> &mdash; now for less than $1,000.</p><h3>More early deals on self-emptying robot vacuums</h3><p><strong>Robot vacuums that don't mop</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/a5bOYN?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Eufy%20L60&object_type=article&object_uuid=009ZCMKFxjAYr6RoqpZ6TED&short_url=a5bOYN&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Eufy L60</a> &mdash;

<h2>Design: We like color options</h2><p>The Echo Dot and the Echo Pop are nearly the same size, but while the Echo Dot is round the Echo Pop has a flat face. It basically looks like a cross-section of the Dot.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The Echo Dot also comes in three fairly muted colors (gray, white, and blue), but the Echo Pop is available in some, well, <em>pop</em>pier colors (lavender and teal in addition to gray and white).</p><p>Overall, I like the appearance of the Echo Pop a little better. The brighter colors can add a cute splash of color to a corner shelf, or the Pop can serve as a more discreet <a href="https://mashable.com/category/amazon-alexa" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Alexa assistant</a> than the Echo Dot (which is fairly universally recognized as a smart home device).</p><p>Both have a modern, sleek appearance that can easily complement or blend into any style of decor.</p><p><strong>Winner: Echo Pop</strong></p><h2>Setup and ease of use</h2><p>Amazon has made setting up these devices extremely easy. You&rsquo;ll need the Alexa app on your phone, and it walks you through setup step-by-step. The app is also where you&rsquo;ll connect other apps like Spotify or Audible to stream them on your Echo devices using Alexa voice commands.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>The devices themselves are also very straightforward. The physical buttons on them allow you to mute and unmute the microphone and adjust the volume. Everything else is done through voice commands or through the Alexa app. I had no problems setting up either device and both were highly responsive to my &ldquo;Hey, Alexa&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Winner: Tie</strong></p><h2>Sound quality is almost identical</h2><p>Amazon describes the Echo Pop&rsquo;s sound as a &ldquo;full sound&rdquo; that&rsquo;s a good fit for bedrooms and small spaces and the Echo Dot&rsquo;s sound as a &ldquo;bigger vibrant sound&rdquo; for any room.</p><p>In my side-by-side comparisons of the Echo Dot and the Echo Pop, I couldn&rsquo;t detect a difference in sound quality between the two devices. Both devices were excellent for playing background music in my office or listening to podcasts while doing housework, providing fuller, clearer sound and increased volume compared to my smartphone.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>The Echo Pop does have an ever-so-slightly larger speaker. However, the Dot&rsquo;s round shape can help it to fill a space with sound no matter where it&rsquo;s placed.</p><p><strong>Winner: Echo Dot</strong></p><h2>Alexa integration and smart home connectivity</h2><p>Both the Echo Dot and the Echo Pop integrate with Alexa through the Amazon Alexa app. You can use Alexa to ask questions, check the weather, set timers and alarms, and open connected apps (like music or streaming apps including Spotify, Pandora, Audible, and Amazon Music).&nbsp;</p><p>Personally, I have always found Alexa devices most handy in the office and in the kitchen. They provide a hands-free, screen-free way to set timers (for productivity or pizza) or to stream audio. A centrally-located Echo device is also a great way to free up space in your brain. I&rsquo;ve used Alexa to remind me to water my plants, put birthday cards in the mail, and check the water level in the pool at regular intervals when filling it up for the season.</p><p>However, the Echo Dot edges out the Echo Pop here in two key ways: temperature sensing and motion detection. So your Echo Dot can execute Alexa Routines that involve temperature or motion, while the Echo Pop can&rsquo;t. Some examples:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>The Echo Dot can adjust your smart thermostat settings when it reaches a certain temperature</p></li><li><p>The Echo Dot can turn on smart lightbulbs when it senses motion in a room</p></li></ul><p><strong>Winner: Echo Dot</strong></p><h2>Considering additional features</h2><p>The Echo Dot and the Echo Pop can both serve as WiFi extenders if you have an existing Amazon Eero network, adding up to 1,000 square feet of additional WiFi coverage.</p><p>However, once again the Echo Dot edges out the Echo Pop in terms of extra features. As mentioned above, the Dot comes equipped with motion and temperature detection capabilities.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/NM5Ey?pageview_type=RSS&template=comparison&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Echo%20Dot%20with%20Clock&object_type=comparison&object_uuid=06cZbeAuOwKQ9cQhwV2IYAn&short_url=NM5Ey&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Echo Dot with Clock</a> ($59.99) comes with all the features of the 5th gen Echo Dot and a simple LED display that can show the time, temperature, and timer countdowns. The Echo Dot With Clock served me well for a time as my alarm clock, but it wouldn&rsquo;t have earned that spot on my nightstand without the LED display so I could glance at the time.</p><p><strong>Winner: Echo Dot</strong></p>]]></content:encoded>

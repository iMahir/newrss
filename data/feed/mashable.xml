<p>"The First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States," the court&rsquo;s opinion, which was written by Judge Douglas Ginsburg, read, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-ban-court-ruling-china-6bfd505295ad44126df0544fc083d6a6" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">according to the Associated Press</a>.

If the decision does make it all the way up the justice system, TikTok is confident the court will side with them.</p><p>"The Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans' right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue," TikTok said in a statement to Reuters.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

He has often been critiqued for his seemingly pro-Russia and anti-Ukraine positions as well as fearmongering over a potential World War III.</p><p>However, Sacks and Musk actually have history with each other &mdash; and a similar background. Like Musk, Sacks emigrated to the U.S. from South Africa. And in 1999, Sacks worked with Peter Thiel at PayPal, joining Musk as a member in the "PayPal Mafia," a group of early PayPal employees and founders who went on to find greater success founding their own tech startups.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

Microsoft would go on to integrate Yammer within its Microsoft 365 products.</p><p>Since then, Sacks has invested in a number of tech startups and companies. He founded a VC firm called Craft Ventures in 2017. In 2020, Sacks started the <em>All-In</em> podcast alongside Jason Calacanis, Chamath Palihapitiya, and David Friedberg. The podcast, where the four entrepreneurs discuss business and current events, has gained popularity in tech circles.

<p>I wasn't sure how a 7.0 magnitude earthquake hundreds of miles north of me could prompt a warning like the one I received from the National Weather Service. </p><p>But I also know enough about earthquake science and the west coast's seismic, <a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/plate-tectonics-ring-fire/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">volcanic "ring of fire,"</a> to understand that my state exists on the precipice of tectonic plates, both underground and deep in the sea. And that the tension in those plates can translate to unimaginable power.</p><p>One day, those underwater plates may cause a catastrophic rupture, one that leads to a deadly tsunami. Was this the day? </p><p>I needed to get more information about our risk, but doing so proved more difficult and confusing than I expected. I ultimately encountered an alarming map that indicated my family was indeed in a warning zone, but I had no guidance about what to do as a result. </p><h2>Why so many people got the tsunami warning</h2><p>I didn't know it at the time, but that warning map was not quite correct for my location and "not the best warning decision tool," according to David Snider,<em> </em>the tsunami warning coordinator for the National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration. </p><p>In an interview, Snider also explained that the federal agency's tools for alerting the public to a tsunami are more imprecise than we might expect, thanks to the way that geographical boundaries are drawn. </p><p>If I'd been enjoying a day on the coast, I would've been grateful for the potentially lifesaving text message. But based on my location at the time, I probably shouldn't have gotten the blaring alert. Snider said this message is sent automatically via the Wireless Emergency Alert System following a tsunami warning. </p><p>Meanwhile, some people in the Bay Area didn't get that alert on their phones, but received news via text from their counties that it had been canceled. Others received nothing at all. </p><p>A "critical need in our next level of service is communicating to folks&nbsp;in exactly the right areas," Snider said, "and helping people know who don't need to move, that they don't need to move."</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

    </div>
<p>Snider added that the tsunami warning center website is undergoing major upgrades to improve the way that warning maps are visualized, which should clarify risk levels in the future.  </p><p>But he also noted that those boundaries reflect the NWS' weather forecasting and alert zones, among other factors. Here's what that can mean: people who live near the shoreline or coastal waterways may be lumped into the same geographical area of people not far from the ocean but closer to elevated terrain, such as the Oakland and Berkeley Hills. </p><p>The result: a terrifying warning map where the entire San Francisco Bay Area is blanketed in red.</p><h2>A crisis in believability</h2><p>As a journalist with science reporting experience, I have a high tolerance for nuance and caution in moments of crisis. I understand that warnings are necessary to prevent death and disaster, even if the worst possible outcome never transpires. </p><p>But to be caught in limbo, with a serious warning and not much else, is to feel a unique kind of terror. It's the kind of fear, multiplied by thousands of individuals, that can generate widespread distrust of government experts and authorities. Over time, that mistrust can curdle into resentment. </p><p>For example, look at the replies to the National Weather Service's <a href="https://x.com/NWSBayArea/status/1864761327237107812" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">announcement on X</a> that the tsunami warning had been canceled. One user accused the federal agency of lying to protect their "fat salaries / pensions / benefits." Another paged DOGE, the X account for Elon Musk's new government-slashing initiative otherwise known as the Department of Government Efficiency. </p><p>Tsunami warnings are rare, compared to other natural disasters like hurricanes and wildfires. And as Snider pointed out, people in immediate potential danger on the coast appeared to have heeded the alarm, followed directions, and started evacuating. In that sense, the system worked. </p><p>But if there were ever a time for disaster and emergency authorities to be highly communicative with the public, this moment was it. </p><h2>Was I at risk? </h2><p>Personally, I couldn't wait to confirm whether or not I was truly in danger. My family's emergency bag, which I'd needed to be ready if the tsunami waves arrived at San Francisco by 12:10 p.m., as they'd been forecast, was incomplete. </p><p>It was during that frantic hour of packing the emergency bag, while searching for information, that I came across the NWS' tsunami warning system map. </p><p>The San Francisco Bay Area was covered in ominous red, indicating that everything in its domain &mdash; including my own home and my children's school &mdash; was subject to the warning. </p><p>This was hard to square with the phone alert I received, which said I needed to move to high ground, or inland, immediately. But what if I was already there and still under threat?</p><p>Plus, here's where a little knowledge might be a dangerous thing. I'd seen <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/tsunami-evacuation-zones-alameda-california" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">a different government map of the local tsunami risk</a>, made several years ago. That map identified coastal waterways as the only danger areas. </p><p>So which map was right? </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Later, Snider told me that the tsunami warning system map didn't show precise tsunami hazards at the community level, so it's not "the complete story which helps all end users have a total answer in that moment." </p><p>But at the time, my mind scrambled for answers. </p><p>I imagined that a major tsunami-level surge in the Bay, which covers 1,600 square miles, could send water and debris rushing inland. The <a href="https://nctr.pmel.noaa.gov/Articles/5th_anniversary.html" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">2004 Indian Ocean tsunami</a>, which killed 230,000 people, led to flooding three miles inland in some places. Images from that tragedy are still seared into my memory. </p><p>Still, I couldn't find any trustworthy explanations for why this warning covered so much of the Bay Area, or what I should do next. </p><p>Should I simply drive east, away from the Bay and ocean? That would take me through the Berkeley and Oakland hills, <em>very</em> high ground, the kind you'd assume was safe &mdash; but the hills were also technically covered by the warning. The text alert didn't point recipients to a website or resource for real-time updates or instructions. </p><p>I heard from no government official after the warning was issued. Looking at California Gov. Gavin Newsom's X account later, I discovered that he didn't post about the tsunami warning until it was canceled. </p><p>My children's school district sent a message out nearly an hour after the initial warning. "We are being advised to keep everyone in place," it said. </p><p>Though the National Weather Service is my go-to source during natural- and weather-related events and disasters, the <a href="https://x.com/NWS_NTWC" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">agency's tsunami alerts account on X</a> had posted only the warning. </p><p>The NWS Bay Area X account posted a single update between when the warning was issued and when it was cancelled. "We are still waiting for magnitudes of water rise," it read. "We will update you as we learn more". </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Friends reported trying to find the same information I had, but said that reliable websites timed out on them. Then, just before noon, the <a href="https://tsunami.gov/events/PHEB/2024/12/05/24340001/2/WEPA40/WEPA40.txt" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">warning was canceled</a>. </p><p>"Based on all available data... the tsunami threat from this earthquake has now passed," said the statement. It took about 15 minutes for county officials to text and email me that news. </p><h2>What happens next time? </h2><p>I don't know the most effective way to warn millions of people about a possible tsunami. The most important thing is that the people living on the coast got the alert as quickly as possible. But I do worry that what happened could undermine trust in the warning system. </p><p>Snider said that future updates to <a href="http://Tsunami.gov" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Tsunami.gov</a> could better reflect tsunami hazard areas, which are already well known and are currently available in map form at the state and local level. </p><p>He understands that the public wants and needs information specific to their location that's streamlined and easy to access. Snider indicated that some of this work was already underway, in addition to upgrades to the tsunami warning system website. </p><p>The response to the earthquake and potential tsunami will be evaluated, Snider promised, with a focus on how information reached the public. </p><p>The forecasting and warning services that the National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration provides are vital, but some members of the public may just assume the worst about what happened. Maybe they'll think the government sometimes tries to scare us for its own nefarious reasons. Perhaps they'll think the hard-working scientists behind the models that warn of potential disaster don't know what they're doing, and they'll turn to cranks or grifters making false pronouncements for clicks on social media instead. </p><p>Neither of these outcomes is good for the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/06/24/public-trust-in-government-1958-2024/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">eroding state of trust in officials</a>. Nor is the possibility that people will wave off future tsunami warnings if they felt like this one was unnecessary. Just because the threat of a tsunami was over just as quickly as it began doesn't mean people won't remember how they were warned &mdash; for all the wrong reasons.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>iOS 18.2 release notes: 4 features to get excited about</h2><p>Per <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/12/05/ios-18-2-release-notes/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">9to5Mac</a>, these are the big features Apple included in its release patch notes for <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ios-18-2-apple-mail-biggest-updates" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">iOS 18.2</a>.</p><h3>Genmoji</h3><p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-use-genmoji-on-ios-18" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Genmoji</a> allows users to create their own custom emoji with text prompts.

If you ask Siri something and it feels ChatGPT is more qualified to give an answer, you'll be prompted to optionally consult OpenAI's chat bot instead. This is done within Siri and does not require a ChatGPT account. Have fun!</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nowhere has that been more documented than on Reddit. According to a <a href="https://www.404media.co/brian-thompson-social-media-reactions-reddit-facebook-twitter/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">404Media report,</a> the platform has removed dozens of posts about the CEO's death, tracked by a platform subbreddit known as r/undelete which grabs content that reaches the top 100 most popular on the site before being deleted. Many of the posts, the publication found, had thousands of upvotes and even more still exist on industry related subs like r/nursing and r/medicine. Subbredit moderators are struggling to curb the plethora of posts, which they say will inevitably be removed by Reddit for violating anti violence policies, if not first removed by moderators for violation of "no politics" and "no death" rules. </p><p>There isn't resounding agreement on whether posts like this should be removed, however. In posts and statements to 404Media, users and moderators alike have argued that discussion of the assassination do not violate Reddit's content policies given that it is a "newsworthy" event covered by reputable outlets. </p><p>Meanwhile, sites like Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) have struggled to spot and remove online reactions, as well. An official Facebook post from UnitedHealthcare announcing Thompson's death was the subject of online fodder once users realized the healthcare giant's post of condolence was being "ratio'd" by laughing reactions. As of Dec. 5, the post had more than 31,000 "haha" responses, compared to just 1,900 "sad" reacts. United Healthcare later locked down its post, as well as similar ones on LinkedIn, from further commenting. </p><div class="reddit">

<p>Some have equated the resoundingly positive reaction online to the digital celebration of controversial Secretary of State Henry Kissinger's death in Nov. 2023 &mdash; a similarly meme-filled event that even got its own <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/30/henry-kissinger-death-copypasta-text-creator-interview" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">sexually-charged copypasta</a>. </p><p>But while thousands interacted with and posted their United Healthcare memes, others online warned that they might want to cool their partying &mdash; or at least be prepared to deal with the possible repercussions.

<p>These earbuds have a great battery life (up to eight hours of listening time without the case and 24 additional hours with), and the fast-charge feature will give you two extra hours of playtime with just a ten-minute charge. The controls are fairly standard and easy to pair and unpair with your other devices. </p><p>They&rsquo;re also surprisingly comfortable: &ldquo;I have fairly small ears, which makes finding comfortable headphones a challenge, and I was impressed that the Vibe Beam earbuds didn&rsquo;t slip out of my ears while I was working out,&rdquo; Andersen writes. &ldquo;They also didn&rsquo;t leave my ears aching when I finally stepped off the treadmill.&rdquo;</p><p>While these earbuds aren&rsquo;t the absolute best true wireless options out there, they&rsquo;re still a solid choice for anyone who&rsquo;s on a budget and doesn&rsquo;t need a symphony orchestra-level soundstage. </p>]]></content:encoded>

However, Apple just threw us for a loop with a bigger price drop on Dec. 6. The fourth-generation earbuds with noise cancellation are now down to $138.99 at Amazon, a savings of 22% and the best price we've seen yet. Wondering if they're worth the upgrade? Our reviewer Kim Gedeon said, "I love them so much, they have replaced my AirPods Pro as my new daily driver earbuds."</p><p><a href="https://mashable.com/review/airpods-4" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Check out our review of the AirPods 4</em></a>.</p><h2>Audible 3-month subscription</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row pogoClear">

<p>The Wonderboom 4 from Ultimate Ears is a tiny powerhouse that comes out on top as our <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-bluetooth-speakers" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">favorite sub-$100 Bluetooth speaker</a>. It packs a well-rounded sound profile that is quite powerful for a speaker of its size and can last for up to 14 hours on a full charge. Not to mention, the rugged design can endure drops from up to five feet or be submerged in water for up to 30 minutes. We wish it offered a companion app for more customization, but it's still overall a solid pick &mdash;&nbsp;especially while it's 20% off.

<p>Top of the line iPads are great, but not everyone needs a tablet that competes with their computer. If you want a tablet that's reliable and can handle basic everyday tasks proficiently and is budget-friendly, you can't go wrong with the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+. It's nothing fancy, but it checks all the right boxes a low-cost tablet should. It features an 11-inch display, quad speakers powered by Dolby Atmos, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 processor, and expandable storage up to 1TB.

Usually the 64GB version with WiFi is $219.99, but as of Dec. 6, it's down to only $149.

<p>The Echo Pop is the least expensive way to add Alexa to your home &mdash; especially when it's down to its best-ever price of $17.99. Basically an Echo Dot lite, the Pop is made "for people who like to keep music playing, and who also use Alexa as a home assistant." Plus, it adds a fun pop of color (get it?) to your home. While it's not particularly groundbreaking for the Echo lineup, as our reviewer noted, it is a budget-friendly speaker that sounds great in any room of your home. </p><p><a href="https://mashable.com/review/echo-pop" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Check out our full review of the Echo Pop</em></a>.</p><p><em>None of these deals catching your eye?

<p>We're all in agreeance that life is expensive these days. Sure, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-cyber-monday-amazon-deals-still-available-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">lingering deals from Cyber Monday</a> are still kicking around which helps with holiday gifting. But prices for traveling during the holiday season are soaring. Think $700 for a one-way flight from Seattle to Atlanta on Dec. 20 level of ridiculousness. But if you're between the ages of 18 and 24, Amazon has a special ticket for you this holiday season.</p><p>From <strong>Dec. 9 through Dec. 13</strong>, Amazon is partnering with StudentUniverse to offer <a href="https://zdcs.link/9Ydjwm?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=%2425%20flights%20for%20the%20holidays%20to%20Prime%20young%20adult%20members&object_type=article&object_uuid=05TOilc0rHjkYLP4F0U1N0i&short_url=9Ydjwm&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">$25 flights for the holidays to Prime young adult members</a> who fall between the ages of 18 and 24. Beginning at <strong>10 a.m. PT on Dec. 9</strong>, StudentUniverse will offer 1,000 domestic flight tickets for just $25 each per day, for a total of 5,000 booking opportunities over the five-day sale window. To snag this deal, you'll need to be within the eligible age range and an Amazon Prime member. </p><p>Phone your family because maybe you <em>will </em>actually make it home for the holidays this year. This epic deal for young adults gives the opportunity to fly domestically within the U.S. for just $25. But you'll need to be ready to pack your bags ASAP because the deal comes with a short travel period. </p><p>The sale will include outbound travel that falls between Dec. 9 and Dec. 25 and inbound travel dates from Dec. 9 to Jan. 14, 2025.</p><p>Of course, you'll need to be a current Prime member to be eligible for this deal, but Amazon has a nice price for young adults. For starters, those between 18 and 24 can sign up for a free 6-month trial period and after that, Prime will auto renew at just $7.49 per month. That's a 50% discount off the standard Prime membership.</p><p>If you hope to snag this deal, head to <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp6MVg?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=studentuniverse.com&object_type=article&object_uuid=05TOilc0rHjkYLP4F0U1N0i&short_url=Qp6MVg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">studentuniverse.com</a> on Monday morning. Keep in mind that you don't need to be an active student to score a $25 ticket because anyone aged 18 to 24 is eligible, so long as you're a Prime member. And if you're not already a Prime member, it's wise to sign up this weekend since 10 a.m. on Monday morning might be a bit chaotic.</p><p>In a world where prices seem to off the rails, this deal on <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp6MVg?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=%2425%20flights&object_type=article&object_uuid=05TOilc0rHjkYLP4F0U1N0i&short_url=Qp6MVg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">$25 flights</a> for young adults is pretty amazing and one we definitely recommend jumping on it. Head home for the holidays or gather some friends to have a perfect getaway over winter break. Bon voyage!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[Google's AI Overviews, launched 6 months ago, remain error-prone, especially producing false results for uncommon queries, which risk amplifying misinformation, and often lack clarity, but Google claims improvements have addressed systemic issues.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/0216WWLmUZoGiypJe9QqENs/hero-image.jpg" alt="The Google logo on a phone."><p>It's been six months since <a href="https://mashable.com/category/google" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Google</a> started adding <a href="https://mashable.com/category/artificial-intelligence" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">AI</a>-generated text to the top of many Google Search queries by default, and this <em>experiment &mdash;</em> that's what a disclaimer at the bottom of each AI Overview says it is &mdash; hasn't entirely been a rip-roaring success, Google acknowledged to Mashable.</p><p>While "AI overviews on balance&nbsp;and at large are very compelling sets of things&nbsp;that are helpful to the users," said Hema&nbsp;Budaraju, Google's senior director of product management for Search, "we have work to do on the quality side of things,&nbsp;which is an ever growing need."</p><p>AI Overviews launched with a slogan of sorts: "<a href="https://blog.google/products/search/generative-ai-google-search-may-2024/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Let Google do the searching for you</a>," but<strong> </strong>after some controversy at the start &mdash; notably that couple of weeks where stories kept coming out about <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-ai-overviews-weird-responses-explained" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Google Search telling people to eat rocks and put glue on pizza</a> &mdash; the company appears to have pulled back a bit. At launch, AI Overviews showed up in about 15 percent of Google Search results pages, but that number was reduced to about 7 percent by the end of June, <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-ai-overviews-visibility-new-low-444048" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">according to Search Engine Land</a>.</p><p>So has quality improved over the past six months? </p><h2>Are AI Overviews getting better?</h2><p>It would be hard to argue point-blank that there's been a significant uptick in quality. Overviews materialize less often, and errors are still rampant, but I did find some very limited evidence of improvements: the AI Overviews for the queries I highlighted to Google for this article all improved while I was working on it.</p><p>For what it's worth, Budaraju says, across all types of queries, from the everyday to the weird, AI Overviews work, "especially when there is no single answer and it's multiple perspectives." Or at least that's what Google thinks based on internal data about quality, which comes from A-B testing, but not focus groups, Budaraju said.</p><p>Quotidian searches tend to get acceptable AI Overviews in my experience. "What do almonds taste like," for instance, may produce a reasonable AI Overview like the one I got: "Almonds can taste sweet, slightly bitter, or bitter, depending on their chemical composition." Fine.</p><p>But if you're an information fiend who uses Google Search more expansively, there's a good chance you still encounter bizarre errors. This November example from BlueSky user @coopercooperco is a decent summary of Google Gemini's unfortunate lingering tendency to put the truth in a blender from time to time.</p><div class="raw-embed">

<p>When queried for the<em> Twin Peaks </em>episode where Cole kisses Shelly, the AI Overview blurts out quite confidently and wrongly that there is no such scene. Without knowing with any certainty what went wrong, one can only assume the model's training data includes at least fleeting mentions &mdash; if not the full script &mdash; of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPXC9c2HfA0" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">famous <em>Twin Peaks</em> scene</a> about (David Lynch shouting voice) "two adults sharing a tender moment!" in which<em> </em>Cole and Shelly<em> </em>are seemingly interrupted by Bobby Briggs, but then clearly and unambiguously do kiss. The model likely isn't drawing from any faulty blogs or counterfeit scripts saying Cole never kisses Shelly (To what end would anyone write such a thing?). It's just making this up and sticking it at the very top of the Google Search results page. </p><p>The Bluesky user above is clearly making what Google <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/24/technology/google-ai-overview-search.html" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">frequently calls</a> an "uncommon query." Hallucinations "tend to arise" when the query is uncommon, Budaraju said. "Even though the systems are trying to be helpful, there is some misinterpretation,&nbsp;some inherent lack of high-quality information on the web," she explained while speaking to Mashable about AI Overviews in general, not this particular one. Plenty of prominent, <a href="https://twinpeaks.fandom.com/wiki/Gordon_Cole" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">high-quality information online confirms</a> that Cole and Shelly kiss, so "misinterpretation" of Bobby Briggs' unsuccessful interruption makes more sense as an explanation.</p><h2>If you search based on faulty information, AI Overviews may make things significantly worse</h2><p>According to Budaraju, improving AI Overviews involves "sentiment surveys" that are not exactly A-B tests. "We just give people an option to choose between one versus the other and get their expression of satisfaction," she said.&nbsp;</p><p>But a nightmare scenario for AI Overviews is one in which a searcher starts out with less-than-perfect information, and the AI Overview makes it even less perfect. </p><p>If the basis for a search is wrong or flawed, and the AI Overview doesn't catch the problem, then it stands to reason the user won't notice it either. The result would be a satisfied user who is now even more ignorant than before. Admittedly, the problem of using Google Search to find misinformation is much older than AI Overviews, but AI Overviews could be a formula for supercharging this process.</p><p>For a vivid-but-fairly-benign example of what I mean, here's the result for the query "How to use baking soda to thicken soup." Someone might only have the fuzziest notion that one of the powders in the cabinet can give their chowder a heartier mouthfeel, but they might guess wrong. According to the AI Overview, "Baking soda can be used to thicken soup by making it silkier and smoother."</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>This won't work, and has the potential to make your soup taste weird. </p><p>When I showed this example to a Google representative, they told me Google would use it to improve their product. </p><p>But separating good and bad information becomes more of a muddle if you're searching for the paranormal. For instance, I tried searching "how to teach a dog to communicate telepathically," and the AI Overview began with the heading "Here are some tips for communicating with your dog telepathically," and then provided a bulleted list cobbled together from the writings of believers in the paranormal, like "animal communicator" Pea Horsley. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>If you're inclined to read them, it's Google Search's job to steer you to <a href="https://animalthoughts.com/blog/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">the writings of people like Horsley</a> &mdash; in fact, I recommend them. They're entertaining. But when the AI Overview at the top of a Google results page reads "Here are some tips for communicating with your dog telepathically," it gives the users the impression that this information is authoritative and trustworthy, rather than being "<a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=For%20entertainment%20purposes%20only" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">for entertainment purposes only</a>." </p><p>A Google representative pointed out that AI Overviews are dynamic. They showed me their AI Overview for the same search, and it didn't say "Here are some tips for communicating with your dog telepathically," but instead mentioned that there's no scientific evidence that dogs can communicate telepathically, before transitioning into another Pea Horsley-influenced list of instructions. If I try this search today, I get a similarly improved result.</p><p>Finally, what if a user noticed that cow meat is called "beef," and pig meat is called "pork," and wondered what dolphin meat is called. Stranger things have happened. When I used Google Search to find answers, the AI Overview seemingly let slip the dark truth about mahi-mahi:</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

    </div>
<p>The AI Overview begins "The name for dolphin meat depends on the region and the type of dolphin" and then provides a bulleted list. The first item on the list is "Mahi-mahi."  </p><p>If the user reads on, they'll see that mahi-mahi is also known as "dolphinfish" (because, to be clear, mahi-mahi is not dolphin. It's a fish). But the result is confusing to say the least. When I showed it to a Google representative they told me this was a reasonable interpretation of the search &mdash; in other words that a user searching for "dolphin meat name" really might be looking for the fish known as a "dolphinfish." </p><h2>It's a good idea to click the source</h2><p>Since, as I mentioned above, every single one of the searches that produced a problematic AI Overview that I featured here improved to some degree, I suspected Google was cleaning them up as I went along, but Budaraju claims otherwise. "We don't fix queries one by one. That's not how we operate.&nbsp;We actually think about it as <em>what are the patterns of issues that we're seeing, and how would we actually solve them at scale?</em>" </p><p>But she also told me Google remains focused on steering users toward the sources of AI Overviews &mdash; y'know, the old fashioned links on your Google Search results page? "To some extent," she said, "I think we are also hoping that our users have the right links, links for them to also pursue." She wonders if, in response to an AI Overview, the user would "actually pursue that path and look at the links that led to the overview that you've created."</p><p>If AI Overviews are never going away, then until they never hallucinate, it's probably a good idea to take Budaraju up on this suggestion, and cultivate a habit of clicking those links next to your AI Overviews whenever you see them. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Undercover, she's married to defence secretary Wallace Webb (<a href="https://mashable.com/article/broadchurch-best-british-crime-drama" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Broadchurch</u></em></a>'s Andrew Buchan) who's completely unaware of that last part, as are their children.

Yes, she knew Jason, and yes, it's the spark of a potential geopolitical crisis that'll have Helen reunited with her old colleague, triggerman Sam (Ben Whishaw), to uncover answers. And they're both reporting to the show's M, spymaster Reed (<a href="https://mashable.com/article/happy-valley-season-3-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Happy Valley</u></em></a>'s Sarah Lancashire).</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>It's classic thriller material here: Seemingly unconnected high profile murders abound! The Chinese ambassador is dead and his daughter is missing! There's an assassin in the kitchen! And for reasons you should just enjoy, it's all set at Christmas time &mdash; we're talking rainy cabs through Oxford Street's lights, shady dealings within the bauble-clad Liberty department store, furious kitchen fights with candy-striped tea towels, tinsel surrounding the overtly signed ROASTED CHESTNUTS being sold on the Thames. Characters even wear tinsel scarfs and Santa hats firing guns on a job.&nbsp;</p><p>While <em>Black Doves</em> by no means reinvents the espionage thriller, the series boasts solid twists, strong action, and electric performances from its superb cast, all of whom seem to have a genuinely great time. And at the heart of it all are two delightful BFFs.</p><h2>Knightley and Whishaw are brilliant, modern spy-assassin besties</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Knightley and Whishaw have effortless chemistry as old espionage colleagues, with flashbacks giving them plenty of bickering banter, training moments, close calls, and in-jokes to build a long friendship for their characters. For the most part, this is Knightley in <em>Official Secrets</em> mode, not her formerly signature period drama mode, and she makes her own mark on the well-worn character of a covert operative (think <em>Homeland, The Americans, </em>with less traumatic exploration of secret identity guilt). Mastering hand-to-hand combat and unnerving interrogations, delivering lived-in spy dialogue, and downing tequila "like a Russian submarine captain" Knightley seems to have a ball as Helen.</p><p>Meanwhile, a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/paddington-movies-moving-cities" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">marmalade-free</a> Whishaw delights as heart-of-gold assassin Sam, a far cry from his previous spy thriller work as <a href="https://mashable.com/article/no-time-to-die-bond-characters-guide" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>James Bond's gentle gadget master Q</u></a>. Like Eddie Redmayne's character in<em> Day of the Jackal</em>, Sam's murder work is meticulous, cold, and nonchalant, while his social self is debonair, warm, and vulnerable. Swilling champagne in most scenes, understandably pining for his Big Ex, and grappling with murdering people for money, Sam has to figure out what his code is. But Knightley doesn't get to do all the hand combat, as Whishaw gets to throw punches too.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Lancashire, meanwhile, is a brilliant pick for the show's spymaster, her steely glare and subtle threat ringing through every scene and unsettling her reports.

<p>As of Thursday, agency officials said they had determined the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/missions/artemis/nasa-identifies-cause-of-artemis-i-orion-heat-shield-char-loss/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>root cause</u></a> of the damage. Rather than scrap the heat shield, though, the agency plans to change the reentry trajectory to avoid a recurrence.&nbsp;</p><p>"While the capsule was dipping in and out of the atmosphere as part of that planned skip entry, heat accumulated inside the heat shield's outer layer, leading to gasses forming and becoming trapped inside the heat shield," said Pam Melroy, NASA's deputy administrator. "This caused internal pressure to build up and led to cracking and uneven shedding of that outer layer."</p><p>Nelson emphasized that the new schedule for Artemis would still position NASA to put boots on the lunar surface before China, which plans to send its own astronauts to the moon in 2030.&nbsp;</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>But the delays could be the tipping point for those on Capitol Hill who would like to rein in spending on the Artemis campaign and NASA generally. The agency's SLS, sometimes dubbed the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nasa-mega-moon-rocket" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>mega moon rocket</u></a>, costs about <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nasa-rocket-cost-sls-artemis-space" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>$4 billion</u></a> each time it launches.

<p>Under Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX's chief operating officer, the commercial launch company has been a boon for the International Space Station, Nelson said, providing reliable rides for astronauts and cargo.&nbsp;</p><p>"The proof's in the pudding," he said.

But it passed into view two hours earlier than expected. That's strange for a planet, as they are usually quite predictable.</p><p>It turns out that a previously unknown world, and its potent gravity, altered Kepler-51d's orbit. Now there are four known planets orbiting the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nasa-sun-solar-maximum-activity-forecast-impacts" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">sun</a>-like star Kepler-51, located some 2,556 light-years away. And at least three of them are puffy.</p><p>"If trying to explain how three super puffs formed in one system wasn&rsquo;t challenging enough, now we have to explain a fourth planet, whether it&rsquo;s a super puff or not. And we can&rsquo;t rule out additional planets in the system either," Jessica Libby-Roberts, an astronomer at Penn State who led the observation, said in a statement. </p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>The research was recently published in <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ad83d3" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>The Astronomical Journal</em></a>. </p><p>Based on previous observations, the astronomers calculated that the distant world Kepler-51d would pass in front of its star on June 26, 2023, at 2 a.m. It was a valuable opportunity to use starlight shining through the planet's atmosphere to reveal what's transpiring on this mysterious orb. (This starlight passes through the exoplanet's atmosphere, then through <a href="https://mashable.com/category/space" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">space</a>, and ultimately into instruments called spectrographs aboard Webb, a strategy called "transit spectroscopy." They're essentially hi-tech prisms, which separate the light into a rainbow of colors. Certain molecules, like water, in the atmosphere absorb specific types, or colors, of light. If a color doesn't show up for Webb, that means it got absorbed by the exoplanet's atmosphere &mdash; revealing its presence.)</p><p>But nothing came at 2 a.m. "Thank goodness we started observing a few hours early to set a baseline, because 2 a.m. came, then 3, and we still hadn&rsquo;t observed a change in the star&rsquo;s brightness with APO [the Apache Point Observatory also used during these observations]," Libby-Roberts explained.</p><p>Their data, however, captured a dip in the star's light around midnight. What could have caused the surprise orbital change? Only the gravitational influence of a large, previously unknown fourth planet, the researchers concluded. It's now earned the name "Kepler-51e."</p><p>"We were really puzzled by the early appearance of Kepler-51d, and no amount of fine-tuning the three-planet model could account for such a large discrepancy," Kento Masuda, a study coauthor and associate professor of earth and space science at Osaka University, added. "Only adding a fourth planet explained this difference. This marks the first planet discovered by transit timing variations using JWST."</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>It's unknown if Kepler-51e is a puffy world, too. Astronomers will need to gather valuable observations from a transit in front of its star. What's known is that its orbit travels a little wider than Venus' orbit around the sun, and dwells on the edge of its solar system's habitable zone &mdash; a temperate region where liquid water could exist on a world's surface.</p><p>Any puffy world is a curiosity: They might evolve, for example, into a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nasa-super-earth-planet-discovery" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">super-Earth</a> planet. In this star system, scientists already have <em>at least</em> three to continue observing. What will the fourth reveal?</p><h2>The Webb telescope's powerful abilities</h2><p>The Webb telescope &mdash; a scientific collaboration between <a href="https://mashable.com/category/nasa" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">NASA</a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/asteroid-detection-spacecraft-juice" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">ESA</a>, and the Canadian Space Agency &mdash; is designed to peer into the deepest cosmos and reveal new insights about the early universe. But as shown above, it's also examining <a href="https://mashable.com/article/james-webb-space-telescope-exoplanet-discovery-1" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">intriguing planets</a> in our galaxy, along with the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/james-webb-space-telescope-uranus-polar-cap" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">planets and moons in our solar system</a>.</p><p>Here's how Webb is achieving unparalleled feats, and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/james-webb-space-telescope-meteoroid-damage-nasa" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">likely will for decades to come</a>:</p><p><strong>- Giant mirror: </strong>Webb's mirror, which captures light, is over 21 feet across. That's over two-and-a-half times larger than the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/space-hubble-most-distant-star" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Hubble Space Telescope's</a> mirror. Capturing more light allows Webb to see more distant, ancient objects. The telescope is peering at stars and galaxies that formed over 13 billion years ago, just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang. "We're going to see the very first stars and galaxies that ever formed," Jean Creighton, an astronomer and the director of the Manfred Olson Planetarium at the University of Wisconsin&ndash;Milwaukee, told Mashable in 2021.</p><p><strong>- Infrared view: </strong>Unlike Hubble, which largely views light that's visible to us, Webb is primarily an infrared telescope, meaning it views light in the infrared spectrum. This allows us to see far more of the universe. Infrared has longer <a href="https://scied.ucar.edu/learning-zone/atmosphere/wavelength" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">wavelengths</a> than visible light, so the light waves more efficiently slip through <a href="https://mashable.com/article/carina-nebula-james-webb-space-telescope" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">cosmic clouds</a>; the light doesn't as often collide with and get scattered by these densely packed particles. Ultimately, Webb's infrared eyesight can penetrate places Hubble can't.</p><p>"It lifts the veil," said Creighton.</p><p><strong>- Peering into distant exoplanets: </strong>The Webb telescope <a href="https://webbtelescope.org/news/webb-science-writers-guide/webbs-scientific-instruments" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>carries specialized equipment called spectrographs</u></a> that will revolutionize our understanding of these far-off worlds.

Among the most valuable heists in Canadian history (and arguably the most Canadian heist ever), the robbery earned the title of the Great Canadian Maple Syrup Heist.</p><p>Now, the Great Canadian Maple Syrup Heist gets its own TV adaptation with Prime Video's <em>The Sticky</em>. Created by <em>American Housewife </em>team Brian Donovan and Ed Herro, <em>The Sticky </em>stars Margo Martindale, Chris Diamantopoulos, and Guillaume Cyr as an unlikely trio of maple syrup hustlers. The three have incredible chemistry &mdash; but in the end, is it enough to counteract <em>The Sticky</em>'s long, winding road to the notorious heist that spawned it?</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p><em>The Sticky </em>may draw inspiration from true events, yet as a title card reminds us at the beginning of each episode, what we're seeing is "absolutely not" the true story. Yes, people will work to steal maple syrup from a governing syrup body in Quebec, but that's basically where the similarities begin and end. Notably, every member of <em>The Sticky</em>'s aspiring heist crew is fictional.</p><p>Every member of the heist crew is also down on their luck, and growing more desperate day by day. There's syrup farmer Ruth Landry (Martindale), whose husband Martin lies in a years-long coma, and whose farming land is on the verge of being seized by the corrupt association that governs the local maple syrup supply. Security guard Remy Bouchard (Cyr) is the organization's sole security guard. Overworked, underpaid, and unappreciated by boss Leonard Gauthier (Guy Nadon), Remy takes revenge where he can &mdash; by stealing one barrel of syrup a month from the stockpile. Rounding out the team is Bostonian mobster Mike Byrne (Chris Diamantopoulos), who's looking to pull off a job unaffiliated with the U.S. crime family that hounds him. </p><p>Pushed together by circumstance, these three decide to take down those who have wronged them by executing the sweetest heist known to mankind. But of course, as we've come to expect from any heist story, things rarely go according to plan, and Ruth, Remy, and Mike are in for a hell of a lot of sticky situations. </p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>You may be drawn in by the promise of maple syrup mayhem, but the true heart of <em>The Sticky </em>is just watching Martindale, Cyr, and Diamantopoulos become the most dysfunctional heist crew in all of Canada. The three give delightful performances separately, but put them together, and you get dynamite.</p><p>Martindale's Ruth is ferocious as can be, unafraid to storm the association's offices with a downed tree in tow or curse out Leonard in front of his staff. Cyr's Remy becomes a perfect foil for her, not just because of his links to the organization but also because of his mild-mannered demeanor, which can sometimes lead to others taking advantage of him. However, that mildness flies out the door in most of his interactions with the hot-tempered Mike, who tries to assert himself as the dominant cool guy in charge of the operation. But despite all that posturing, Mike's often just as inept as his compatriots. Don't just take my word for it: Feast your eyes on Diamantopoulos' many icy pratfalls, which somehow get funnier over time, no matter how often Mike bites it in the Quebec snow.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>The lead-up to <em>The Sticky</em>'s heist gives our trio plenty of time to bond, from planning sessions to car trips to an accomplice's storage unit. It also gives them plenty of opportunities to cross each other, building tension &mdash; and some very fun sap-related arguments &mdash; along the way. Yet among all <em>The Sticky</em>'s many twists and turns, it can sometimes feel like the heist itself has gotten lost in the syrup... er, sauce.</p><h2><em>The Sticky</em>'s heist feels more like an afterthought.</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Despite <em>The Sticky</em>'s lightning-fast first season (six episodes, each less than 30 minutes), the series can sometimes feel like it's wading through syrup in its efforts to get to the heist proper. Ruth and Remy drop out of the heist at separate points, only to get pulled back in mere moments later. Elsewhere, new wrinkles out of our trio's control keep pushing the planned heist date back. Some, like the arrival of new security guard Gary (Meegwun Fairbrother), spawn riotous side quests. Others, like the intrusion of Mike's Bostonian colleagues &mdash; including mobster Bo (Jamie Lee Curtis) &mdash; feel like <em>The Sticky </em>stalling for time, or clawing for a great antagonist for a potential second season.</p><p>Here's the thing, though: I'm far more interested in the small-town dynamics <em>The Sticky </em>initially sets up than whatever hell Boston has to rain down on Mike. The series briefly explores the solidarity between Ruth and the other syrup farmers and townspeople, including a scene where a diner refuses to give Leonard any syrup with breakfast. But otherwise, it barely fleshes out the rest of them.</p><p>By the time <em>The Sticky </em>finally gets to its heist, the season has almost run out of steam, and it shows. Prior iterations of the heist plan play out in snappy, darkly funny sequences of what the crime might look like. Yet that energy dissipates for the real deal, which seems almost grim in comparison to everything that's come before it.</p><p>But while the final destination of <em>The Sticky </em>Season 1 may be underwhelming, at least the characters who brought us there are anything but. Martindale, Cyr, and Diamantopoulos have created a trio of lovable, flawed criminals who are fully-fledged right off the bat, and watching their dynamic evolve over the course of the season is a sweet treat all by itself.</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/98bWR7?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3B%3Btemplate=video&amp%3B%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3B%3Belement=offer&amp%3B%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3B%3Belement_label=The%20Sticky%20hits%20Prime%20Video%20Dec.%206.&amp%3B%3Bobject_type=video&amp%3B%3Bobject_uuid=02xr7g2s31yUeuxsnzLIP7z&amp%3B%3Bshort_url=98bWR7&amp%3B%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Fvideo%2Fthe-sticky-trailer-prime-video&amp%3Btemplate=video&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=The%20Sticky%20hits%20Prime%20Video%20Dec.%206.&amp%3Bobject_type=video&amp%3Bobject_uuid=02xr7g2s31yUeuxsnzLIP7z&amp%3Bshort_url=98bWR7&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Fvideo%2Fthe-sticky-trailer-prime-video&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=All%20episodes%20of%20The%20Sticky%20are%20now%20streaming%20on%20Prime%20Video.&object_type=article&object_uuid=07Crmlkne3zMzxzHdahJVsc&short_url=98bWR7&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">All episodes of <em>The Sticky </em>are now streaming on Prime Video.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2><em>Nightbitch</em> howls for the frustrated mothers.&nbsp;</h2><p>Heller's adapted screenplay gets off to a solid start with a grocery trip that introduces both the mundane and thankless duties of this unnamed mother (Adams, who is referred to as Mother in the credits) and the undercurrent of intellectual frustration boiling beneath her pleasant smile. When a former colleague in chic business attire asks how she likes "getting to be at home" with the baby all day, this pale and frazzled mother launches into a rant of her unrealized ambitions, her fear that mommy brain is killing her creativity as an artist, and her concern that there's no going back. But then the film leaps back a few moments, effectively creating a temporal record scratch that takes us back to the end of the question. This time, Mother answers with what she's <em>supposed </em>to say: "Yeah. I love it."&nbsp;</p><p>That she loves her son (also unnamed, and played by twins Arleigh and Emmett Snowden) is a given. He's adorable, yes, even when he's drinking out of the toilet or throwing paint all over her kitchen walls. What plagues her is the endless cycle of breakfast, diapers, bedtime, and mommy-and-me storytime at the library. There, she might find community among the other mothers, but she resists the warm invitations from these cheerful moms (<a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-afterparty-season-2-review-apple-tv-plus" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>The Afterparty</u></em></a>'s Zo&euml; Chao, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaFfLV51w4Y" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Happiest Season</u></em></a>'s Mary Holland, and Archana Rajan). Perhaps&nbsp;because to accept their friendship would be to surrender to this confining mom space?</p><p>Her resentment builds against her husband (<a href="https://mashable.com/article/speak-no-evil-2024-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Speak No Evil</u></em></a>'s Scoot McNairy), who is the embodiment of weaponized incompetence and emotional idiocy. Then she begins to grow fur. Heller expertly weaves in elements of body horror grotesquely mimicking to comedic effect the physical transformation of a body throughout early motherhood. A particularly impactful scene involves Mother probing at a lump on her tailbone, which oozes a thick, milky pus, then long hair, and finally, an undeniable tail. The audience at the TIFF world premiere audibly gagged and groaned as Adams pulled fur and pus from her lower back! Both here and later &mdash; when Mother discovers she's grown four new nipples down her torso &mdash; Heller's heroine is not repulsed but empowered by her ability to transform. It's a thrilling beginning to a tale of finding your inner animal. But frustrating, <em>Nighbitch</em> fails to go fully feral.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Nightbitch</em> lacks bite.&nbsp;</h2><p>Mother finds fresh empowerment in her unusual behavior, like nighttime runs with runaway dogs, a carnal hunger for meat, outbursts at her stereotypically smug child-free friends, and an urge to strike back violently at her awful husband, who dares to chirp the deeply unhelpful advice, "Happiness is a choice!" There's an engaging build-up as she begins to move away from fantasizing about emotional outbursts and begins to act them out. But despite a bit of bloodlust in the form of small animal kills, there's no real sense of threat to the film.&nbsp;</p><p>This brings me back to Jennifer Kent's brilliant maternal horror movie <em>The Babadook</em>, which <a href="https://mashable.com/video/babadook-jennifer-kent-lgbtq-icon" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>celebrates its 10th anniversary this year</u></a>. While the films are tonally different, they have a lot in common. Both follow a woman trying desperately to play by the rules of being a "good mother," but finding the sacrifice of self demanded for this role absolutely suffocating.&nbsp;</p><p>Both have young sons, who they love but also resent. Both have murderous eyes toward the family pet, and both fear they are being taken over by some mysterious primal force. But <em>Nightbitch</em> won't embrace the darkness like <em>The Babadook </em>dared to. Heller's Mother might be bitchy, but she'll never go so far that she'll scare the audience. Admittedly, <em>The Babadook </em>is a nightmare of motherhood, where <em>Nightbitch </em>is meant to be a fantasy of liberation. So, there's understandable cause for Heller not to go as hard as Kent did. Still, without probing deeply to a point of true peril, which would require Mother destroying the things she loves, the low point in <em>Nightbitch</em> just doesn't hit as hard as it could. As the film turns to climb back to a happy ending, the change feels frustratingly mild instead of transgressive or revolutionary.&nbsp;</p><p>There are moments where <em>Nightbitch</em> seems on the verge of tearing down the ideals of "good motherhood" from its damning pedestal and ripping the concept to pieces, freeing Adams' Mother for good. Most of these come through the narration, presumably much of it pulled directly from Yoder's prose. The story illustrates the constraints of the role of mother, where sacrifice is taken so much for granted that moms don't even have a socially sanctioned space to complain about the hardships they endure. While Adams' harried (and hairy) heroine begins to discover some of these constraints are self-imposed, the film refuses to explore what it would mean to dismantle the expectations of others. Without what that could look like, the critique feels incomplete, suggesting some solid me-time is all that's needed to achieve a balance, ignoring the greater societal pressures put upon mothers specifically.&nbsp;</p><p>To Adams' credit, she's committed to playing Mother with an intense authenticity. Throughout the film, her character's hair is dull, her face unpolished by standard movie make-up, her body bigger than model-sizing would allow. She looks a lot like the mothers you might see any given day at the playground. And that makes her delight in her secret hidden tail and bonus nipples uniquely thrilling, punctuated by Adams' beguiling glee at these discoveries. There is much more to her than meets the eye.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet Adams balances this absurdity with earnest monologues about the incredible power of a body that can create life. And at times, this is electrifying. But all of this peculiarity and growing power sets up a promise of something extraordinary that is not delivered on. This mother never gets truly angry, so despite her canine quirks, she feels contained to a chipper maternal narrative. In the end, <em>Nightbitch </em>feels unfinished.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Nightbitch </em>was reviewed out its World Premiere at the 2024 Toronto International Film Festival. <a href="https://zdcs.link/Q4bx5X?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Nightbitch%20opens%20in%20theaters%20Dec.%206.&object_type=article&object_uuid=04D2s0KMLrHsY3oqpw5lrRc&short_url=Q4bx5X&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Nightbitch</em> opens in theaters Dec. 6. </a></p><p class="mx-auto">

<p>What follows is certainly not for everyone. Some critics I spoke with at TIFF complained that Oppenheimer's musical is indulgent in its runtime, ugly in its relentless blue-gray palette, and even infuriating in its plotting. Others see the length, the dismal colors, and that frustrating plot to be precisely the point, and embrace it as such. I am in the latter camp, finding this mournful and fanciful musical utterly captivating, jarringly funny, and savagely profound.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>The End</em> is doomsday prepping by way of <em>Downton Abbey.</em></h2><p>Forget what you think you know about bunkers. Deep, deep underground this family &mdash; whose names are never uttered &mdash; has built something not metal and cold but very old-money. Housed within a cavernous salt mine with spiraling walls and noisy ventilation systems lies their home away from apocalypse. It contains crown molding, classic works of art in gilded frames, a wood-paneled library, a grand dining room, a complicated model train set-up, an inexplicably endless food supply, and above all, pristine order down to the paper-flower bouquets arranged in delicate vases.</p><p>Here, a 25-year-old man born in the bunker (George MacKay) has only ever known his doting mother (Tilda Swinton), his chummy father (Michael Shanon), their devoted butler (Tim McInnerny), a cheeky chef (Bronagh Gallagher), and a dour doctor (Lennie James). And despite possibly being the last people on Earth, they seem happy enough, singing songs of gratitude for their circumstances. Well, when they're not conducting dramatic emergency drills, that is. (You can never be too careful.)</p><div id="related-video" class="mx-auto mt-8 mb-12 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans md:mt-12 md:mb-16 text-primary-400">

</div>
<p>The absurdity of their profound privilege is made all the clearer when an above-ground survivor (Moses Ingram) stumbles upon them. Understandably, she is utterly bewildered by all they possess while people on the surface scrape and starve. The political commentary only gets more overt as this young Black woman hears the selective history the white son's been taught, like how the oil industry that made its fortune definitely didn't contribute to the climate crisis that forced the family underground as they left everyone else to burn! With a cocked eyebrow and a patient tone, she not only pushes back on this propaganda but also brings a dry humor to the household.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>The End</em> offers a bleak view with winsome song and dance.</h2><p>While the son is in awe of the stranger, who speaks openly about her own regrets and urges the others to do the same, a raw tension emerges between her and the mother, who would rather the family's skeletons stay neatly tucked away in the closet, thank you very much. Anxieties rise as a romance blooms between the son and the stranger. Happily for us, this leads to a charming duet and a dance number where salt is kicked about the mines, which sit cold and unimpressed by the pair's passion. Such energy surrounded by the towering, uncaring setting echoes <a href="https://mashable.com/article/west-side-story-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>West Side Story</em></a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/west-side-story-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">.</a> But with nowhere to escape but a dying world above, where can this story go?&nbsp;</p><p>Oppenheimer and co-writer Rasmus Heisterberg mire the audience in the push-and-pull between the mother's strategic repression and the stranger's emotional outbursts. Reflecting her character's emotional strain, Swinton sings in a shrill falsetto, as if her mother might crack at any moment. MacKay has a Broadway-bright performance style, while Ingram delivers soulful ballads of loss and hope. Shannon and McInnerny join in with vaguely vaudevillian numbers of tap and banter, but the jocularity of this bit is undercut by the father cruelly reminding his butler buddy of his rank.</p><q>
    'The End' traps us in a ruthless loop, where its core family risks change or growth, only to deny it. 
    </q>
<p>Trapped in this beautiful bunker under unblinking blue light, they are all specimens trapped under glass. Here are the last people on Earth, preserved but without purpose, objects in a museum of their own making. Still, there are moments where it seems these characters might just break out &mdash;&nbsp;not of the bunker but from the pretty molds they've built to survive in the guise of civility. A brutal verbal battle in the parents' bathroom gives Shannon's signature intensity a place to explode. Swinton's eyes, bright and on the brink of tears, show the deep hurt hiding behind this mother's practiced smile. MacKay, with a frantic enthusiasm that trembles into nerve-rattling, seems often on the brink of breaking this cycle of deranged self-mythologizing. But then Oppenheimer will quick-cut to some time later, when the drama has passed and routine has reasserted itself. The tension is bled out, and we bleed with it.</p><p><em>The End </em>traps us in a ruthless loop, where its core family risks change or growth, only to deny it. Both those who liked and loathed the film agree this cycle makes for a very frustrating viewing experience. But this feels intentional. As he did in his two Oscar&ndash;nominated documentaries, <em>The Look of Silence </em>and <em>The Act of Killing</em>, Oppenheimer is itching his way under our skin with incredible artistry to expose the revolting reality of human capabilities &mdash; not just what horrors we can do to each other, but also what we can ignore to maintain even a fragile sense of civility.&nbsp;</p><p>In <em>The End,</em> even as the director presents us with people who have done horrible things, Oppenheimer doesn't lose empathy for them. While their lies are abundant, this incredible cast makes their pain feel real, so even in spite of our vexations or political opinions, you might well ache for the mother who fears she's losing her son. And yet &mdash;&nbsp;as absurd as this sounds &mdash; the most devastating line in the whole movie is about cake. Literal cake.&nbsp;</p><p>Defying expectations of genre, both musical and apocalypse narrative, <em>The End </em>is a challenge thrown down to audiences. The songs and dances are not glistening perfection, but occasionally clunky or tinny. But this works because each instance is a reflection of that character, and where they fall short of their projection of perfection and happiness. The suffocatingly dull colors bleach the rosiness out of flushed cheeks, making everything feel vaguely dead, or maybe even embalmed. The film's plot leads to a place that is well earned and yet hard to bear. Yet it's thrilling to see a musical take so many risks, especially when movie studios seem afraid to even promote that a movie <em>is </em>a musical.

<p>Kitchen-sink realist Mike Leigh, now in his eighties, may have come to the bitter realization that at a certain point, some things (and people) may never change. However, with his latest social drama, he paints an acerbic and empathetic portrait of what hitting your limit looks like. The film, and Jean-Baptiste's rankled performance as a wife and mother who just can't catch a break, seem to exist just beyond an invisible point of no return &mdash; a line that <em>Hard Truths</em> walks with stunning precision.</p><h2>What is <em>Hard Truths</em> about?</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>While her husband is away at his plumbing job, and while her unemployed 22-year-old son Moses (Tuwaine Barrett) is locked away in his bedroom, the dispirited fifty-something Pansy likes to clean &mdash; perhaps a little too much &mdash; if only to create a temporary sanctuary for herself, where she can nap without having to worry about the outside world.</p><p>This paradise never lasts. The real world always comes knocking sooner or later, whether in the form of a stray fox in her yard or the men in her life asking for their next meal. The next inconvenience to her, and her next vicious speech about the state of the world and its selfish people, are always just moments away, and she wants it all to stop.&nbsp;</p><p>There's a quote from the TV series <em>Justified</em> that has since become a common truism: "If you run into an asshole in the morning, you ran into an asshole. If you run into assholes all day, you're the asshole." It is, on the surface, applicable to Pansy and how she navigates the world &mdash; her sharp barbs at innocent strangers in public, while funny, are a sudden and irreverent release valve &mdash; leaving people to walk on eggshells when she's around. But it isn't quite so simple and binary; in reality, everyone is an asshole to some degree. Pansy is ready to snap at a moment's notice, but she wasn't born this way. Something or someone (perhaps multiple somethings and someones) molded her over time, an idea that Leigh slowly unveils and explores over the course of 97 minutes.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>But before there's ever a hint of Pansy's real psychology, the film also presents an upbeat contrast across several scenes, in the form of her hairdresser sister Chantal (Michele Austin) and the parallel life she lives. Chantal, a single mother, lives with her two adult daughters, young professionals Kayla (Ani Nelson) and Aleisha (Sophia Brown), in a cramped apartment filled with love and cheer. Through scenes that follow both sisters across daily interactions, <em>Hard Truths</em> details how people on the same journey can end up in remarkably different destinations, living lives in which they put out into the world that which they receive &mdash; or perceive, or think they deserve.</p><p>As Mother's Day approaches, both women's lives as homemakers shift slowly into focus, but they also plan to visit their mother's grave, a scenario that proves surprisingly emotionally charged. Whatever Pansy's problem with the idea, she first and foremost makes excuses.

<p>What makes Leigh's film such a joyful watch is its vignette-like approach to both families, though it eventually sharpens its focus when digging into difficult emotional territory. Several of these scenes are set at Chantal's hair salon, following daily gossip that sketches out the details of her life, and those of her clients, all of them middle-aged Black women dealing with the daily drudgery of life. However, their sense of community keeps them afloat.</p><p>Leigh, on numerous occasions, cuts from the noisy hustle and bustle of the salon to the eerie silence of Pansy's home, a contrast that lures the viewer into her orbit before she launches into her next series of condemnations &mdash; even against dogs, babies, and so on. She's pissed off with the world at large, doesn't have the tools to deal with it, and ignores any kind of support she's offered.</p><p>The characters' communal instincts are also accompanied by specific cultural details, which speak to the movie's granular nature. These are women who all appear to belong to England's Caribbean diaspora; they might speak with English accents, but on occasion, they code-switch to the occasional Patois or West Indian intonation, which tells its own story too. For Chantal, her clients, and her daughters, this switch usually occurs during laughter, or during the lively recounting of stories. But in Pansy's case, code-switching is a means of tapping into more creative insults, and into furious, lock-jawed responses to the mundane, as the film seats its jet-black humor right next to its notions of people's deep and complicated personal history.</p><p>There also exists a sense of pride in achievement for these characters, and of pushing one's children to be their best selves. Chantal has ostensibly succeeded at this with her well-adjusted daughters, who enjoy varying levels of success (though they still hide their failures from their mum, and from one another). Moses, on the other hand, represents the flip side to this story. He seems aimless, and spends all his time eating, making a mess, playing video games, and reading books about airplanes. Apart from his occasional strolls, he barely leaves the house, and lacks professional prospects. All Pansy does is yell at him in the hopes of motivating him, but deep down, she thinks he may be a lost cause.</p><p>Pansy even describes his behavior to Chantal in dismissive terms &mdash; his fixations, his social awkwardness, and his inability to maintain eye contact in particular &mdash; that hint towards Moses being on the autism spectrum, or having some kind of cognitive disability that his parents cannot or do not recognize. But even Pansy's love as a mother can (and will) only go so far, given the harshness of her own upbringing by a disciplinarian single mother.</p><h2><em>Hard Truths</em> centers on a tremendous lead performance.</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Teaming with Leigh for the first time since 1996's <em>Secrets &amp; Lies</em> &mdash; a role that won her a Best Supporting Actress nomination at the Oscars, BAFTAs, and Golden Globes &mdash; Jean-Baptiste delivers career-best work in what may be one of the most challenging performances this year. The biggest challenge for both actress and director is maintaining a familiar sense of humanity during even verbose, borderline Shakespearean outbursts about how much Pansy loathes the world &mdash; and by implication, what it has done to her.</p><p>Each and every actor delivers fine-tuned work, as characters swallowed up by Pansy's orbit (and in the case of Curtley and Moses, characters who have contributed to the black hole at her center). But Jean-Baptiste is a magnet for the camera, luring it in with her eyes, and making it watch &mdash; unblinking, unbroken &mdash; as she puts on a clinic of self-loathing turned outward.</p><p>A volatile undercurrent runs just beneath Jean-Baptiste's physical being, leaving Pansy on the verge of either explosion or implosion. Sometimes, she reaches both these difficult places at once, as the camera interrogates her, practically forcing confessions from her about what made her this way. The more Leigh lingers, holding back on any sort of formalist flourish, the more he allows his performances to take charge. The result is mesmerizing to watch, and sure to remind you of the worst flashes you might have seen of friends and loved ones.</p><p>In the process, <em>Hard Truths </em>becomes a complex showreel for humanity at its most bitter and pained, with characters forced to turn inward and at least recognize (if not introspect and improve upon) the worst corners of themselves. Through long, unbroken close-ups and scenes of familial interaction in which tensions subtly build, Leigh's stark naturalism is brought slowly and fiercely to the fore by an accomplished actress<strong>&nbsp;</strong>at the height of her power, and at the height of her vulnerability. Scene by scene, she slowly chips away at Pansy's armor until all that's left is sinew, blood, and bone, leaving her exposed to the world in all its cruelty and kindness and indifference. It&rsquo;s harrowing to watch, but Jean-Baptiste makes it impossible to look away.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/98bXXw?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Hard%20Truths%20will%20have%20a%20qualifying%20run%20in%20New%20York%20City%20on%20Dec.%206%20before%20opening%20in%20limited%20release%20Jan.%2010%2C%202025.&object_type=article&object_uuid=01FjUrVZl9RKrbE7IxKr7Tu&short_url=98bXXw&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Hard Truths </em>will have a qualifying run in New York City on Dec. 6 before opening in limited release Jan. 10, 2025.</a></p><p class="mx-auto">

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/02ugrZO4v7B5CZkqTENeY2Y/hero-image.jpg" alt="Jude Law in "The Order.""><p>The year is 1983. Talk radio host Alan Berg (Marc Maron) is on the Colorado airwaves comically dressing down racist callers, while elsewhere across the Pacific Northwest, a series of armed robberies becomes a matter of concern &mdash; even more than usual &mdash; because of possible white supremacist ties. This is the backdrop of <em>The Order</em>, Justin Kurzel's highly engrossing (if politically slight) police story, in which fictitious FBI officer Terry Husk (Jude Law) begins pulling on real-world threads with disturbingly modern implications.</p><p>Written by Zach Baylin, the film is based on Kevin Flynn and Gary Gerhardt's late-'80s nonfiction book <em>The Silent Brotherhood</em>, which tells of a real white supremacist splinter group known as "the Order" (or "the Silent Brotherhood"), whose concerns with preserving white supremacy led them to meticulous acts of terror. It is, first and foremost, an incredibly fun movie, even if "fun" may not seem like the right approach for such volatile material.</p><p>This is, in part, because Kurzel finally discards his perpetually dour cinematic mindset, and replaces it with the thrills and frills of a Hollywood action drama. However, the film's success is also owed to Law's central performance as a lonely, no-nonsense cop for whom the work comes first, even if it drives him up the wall, and keeps him constantly on the verge of explosion.</p><h2>What is <em>The Order</em> about?</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Within its opening minutes, <em>The Order</em> depicts the dueling danger and ridiculousness of white supremacy, thanks to Maron's distinctly Maron-esque version of Berg, a Jewish radio personality who fields calls from frustrated bigots looking for an outlet. His sharp and witty barbs can be heard even before the first images appear, though once they do, they present a stark contrast to this lively soundtrack. In the dead of night, a pair of neo-Nazis guns down one of their own for talking too much about their plans.</p><p>Berg is only shown on-screen a handful of times, but his show is the film's de facto narrator, appearing at a handful intervals to remind us of the everyday form that antisemitism and white supremacy can take. While this makes for necessary comic relief, it's also a vital contrast. Much of the movie depicts the more far-flung extremes of white supremacy, through fringe militias ready and willing to take violent action, but the recurrence of Berg's voice keeps the Overton window from shifting too greatly; he reminds us that his easily dismissed callers and the movie's armed factions bloom from the same seed.</p><p>Those familiar with Berg's life will know how his story eventually intersects with that of the Order &mdash; a disorienting instance of narrator and narrative coming into contact &mdash; but outside of this moment, the movie mostly tells the story of two people. The first is Husk, appropriately named for his new lot in life after putting in for a transfer. The temperamental agent sits in the FBI's sparse Idaho branch, waiting for his wife and children to join him, though they may as well be phantoms. He's empty, and has nothing but the job.</p><p>The movie's second major character is Robert Jay Matthews (Nicholas Hoult), who goes by Bob; he leads the Order through planning and pulling off armed robberies in order to fund a weapons stockpile. In contrast to Husk, Bob is charismatic, well-liked and always surrounded by people. The neo-Nazis he recruits consider him a brother. He has a wife and son at home, and even a pregnant mistress. Right from its basic premise, <em>The Order</em> establishes the allure of his cult: community and togetherness.</p><p>Husk, upon spotting suspicious "white pride" flyers around town, makes inquiries at the local sheriff's office, though no one seems concerned except for rookie cop Jamie Bowen (Tye Sheridan), who more willingly spots these red flags since he has mixed race children, and is married to woman of color (Morgan Holmstrom, an actress of First Nations and Filipina ethnicity). With Bowen's help, Husk begins making inquiries around town in the hopes to identifying the group's ringleader, but Bob is always one step ahead, leading to a an exhilarating cat-and-mouse game involving deviously enjoyable heists and shootouts, albeit at the cost of examining the more challenging corners of its subject matter.</p><h2><em>The Order</em> takes a functional approach to white supremacy.</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>As a period-specific film about a white supremacist cult, <em>The Order</em> resembles Spike Lee's <a href="https://mashable.com/video/spike-lee-oscar-nom-director" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>BlacKkKlansman</em></a> at a distance, down to their use of shifting comedic and dramatic tones, urging viewers to take even the most ludicrous facets of white supremacy seriously. Distinguishing them is, of course, the fact that Lee's film was about infiltration from within, while Kurzel's is more of a chase &mdash; and the fact that Black experiences and perspectives are central to <em>BlacKkKlansman</em>.</p><p><em>The Order </em>doesn't necessarily have to follow the same path &mdash; its one Black FBI agent, played by Jurnee Smollett, delivers forceful dialogue but is mostly perfunctory &mdash; though it often leaves material on the table. <em>BlacKkKlansman</em> was by no means an expos&eacute; on white supremacy within policing (Lee has been <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/boots-riley-pens-essay-on-problems-with-blackkklansman-713144/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>criticized</u></a> for this), but its haunting conclusion suggests that even the heroic actions of its Black police detective have done little to stymie the rise of American neo-Nazism in the long term. <em>The Order</em> avoids the question of race within policing altogether &mdash; the concept barely seems to exist outside of the confines of the cult &mdash; but these shortcomings also help streamline <em>The Order</em>, making it a worthwhile pulp procedural.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The film's approach to white supremacy is best labeled "utilitarian." Little by way of action or dialogue works to unearth the group's underlying ideology &mdash; neo-Nazi characters discuss America no longer being "our country," and hint at the economic downturn that may have driven them into Bob's open arms &mdash; but <em>The Order</em> has an intense an unrelenting focus on the white supremacist playbook. Which is to say: <em>The Order</em> prominently features <em>The Turner Diaries</em>, William Luther Pierce's 1978 neo-Nazi novel that lays out a detailed plan to overthrow the U.S. government, culminating in "The Day of the Rope," i.e. the hanging of traitors at the U.S. Capitol.</p><p>If this fiction is eerily reminiscent of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/capitol-riot-trump-election-social-media" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>the January 6, 2021 insurrection</u></a>, that's no coincidence. <em>The Turner Diaries</em> has long informed white supremacist rhetoric in America, as well as QAnon-like conspiracy theories. The book and its pages appear throughout the film, both as a blueprint for Bob and a not-so-subtle clue for Husk and Bowen, who use its pages to convince the FBI to divert its resources to taking down the Order. In centering the book to this degree, the film becomes a premonition of sorts, a warning that events which have recently come to pass &mdash; and might again, in the near future &mdash; don't exist in a vacuum.</p><h2><em>The Order</em> is Kurzel's most accomplished piece of filmmaking.</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>There's an argument to be made that <em>The Order</em> is a B-movie in the body of a prestigious "issue" drama. There's just as valid an argument that it's Kurzel's best movie, a metamorphosis akin to the last decade of M. Night Shyamalan's career &mdash; which include films like <em>The Visit</em>, <em>Glass</em>, <em>Old</em>, and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/trap-movie-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Trap</em></a> &mdash; in that both filmmakers have finally gotten out of their own way and embraced cinematic "trash."</p><p>Kurzel's films have, for the most part, been steeped in grief and death. This has led to some intriguing experiments, like his 2015 <em>Macbeth</em> adaptation, in which Lady Macbeth's plot is born out of mourning the loss of a child (the film, while pleasing to the eye, is far too long). On the other hand, it has also led to oddities like 2016's <em>Assassin's Creed</em>, a video game movie that forgets to have fun. With <em>The Order</em>, Kurzel remembers that fun is still possible even within macabre confines, and he shoulders Law with embodying this energetic paradox.</p><p>Law's character, Husk, is a sad sack on the verge of madness. His "bad cop" routine is his baseline, and though he doesn't bounce off the walls like, say, Nicolas Cage in <em>Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans</em>, he belongs in the same conversation. His nose bleeds at regular intervals (due to his medication, he claims), though at one point, when he's particularly eager to "lean on" a suspect, he does so quite literally, going freak-mode during an impromptu interrogation and bleeding all over him. It's wildly silly, though thank God for Law's refusal to artificially repair his hairline; the actor's widow's peak not only makes Husk a more realistic presence, but a more menacing one as well.</p><p>In contrast, Hoult crafts Bob as a charming, measured, and ostensibly "regular" guy. He would be downright affable, were it not for the Nazi swastikas in his garage. While Husk and Bob have few on-screen meetings, their dichotomy is discomforting. Hoult &mdash; who's playing Lex Luthor in James Gunn's just-wrapped <em>Superman: Legacy</em> &mdash; plays his neo-Nazi character as though he were a Boy Scout, like Superman. Meanwhile, Law's approach to his altruistic, obsessive lawman can be oddly frightening, as though joining the Order had borne more immediate fruits and payoffs than trying to bring them down; you can see why people join.&nbsp;</p><p>However, this upside-down approach to hero and villain also plants the seeds for a typically Kurzel turn. In the film's final act, the unrelenting fatalism of his films like <em>Nitram</em>, <em>True History of the Kelly Gang</em>, and <em>The Snowtown Murders</em> returns with a vengeance, as though he couldn't resist the delayed gratification. Only this time, rather than adding mere texture, the late arrival of this tonal despondency feels earned, as if an extension of these characters' lives. It's reminiscent of Michael Mann's <em>Heat</em>, in that Husk and Bob are men so driven and obsessed with their goals that they push everyone away in the process.</p><p><em>The Order</em> seldom slows down, skillfully building to each new action crescendo with the help of Jed Kurzel's rumbling, unrelentingly energetic score. It may not have anything novel to say about race in America &mdash; whether then or now &mdash; but its broad reminders of the mechanics of neo-Nazi terror feel mostly justified by the movie's brisk, deftly modulated pace. That it's an action movie in the body of something more "prestigious" or important ought to feel insulting, but really, it's been the key to Kurzel's necessary transformation all along.</p><p><em>The Order</em> was reviewed was reviewed out of its world premiere at the 2024 Venice International Film Festival.&nbsp;<a href="https://zdcs.link/7bJPD?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=It%20opens%20in%20select%20theaters%20Dec.%206.&object_type=article&object_uuid=02ugrZO4v7B5CZkqTENeY2Y&short_url=7bJPD&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">It opens in select theaters Dec. 6.</a></p><p class="mx-auto">

<p>Set in 1969, <em>Fly Me to the Moon </em>follows an enemies-to-lovers plot line that pits the noble ambition of a moon-landing mission against marketing. In the corner of scientific endeavor stands beefy but taciturn NASA launch director Cole Davis (Tatum); in the other corner swishes metropolitan advertising maverick Kelly Jones (Johansson). He is trying to get America on the moon. She's trying to sell America on the moon landing. But shucks! The news of late is super caught up with that Vietnam War!&nbsp;</p><p>There's a jarring disconnect between the movie's would-be winsome romance and its clumsy handling of the era's hard-hitting horrors. The jumbled screenplay from Rose Gilroy doesn&rsquo;t just have its heroine cynically lament about how this grim war's news cycle distracts from their PR efforts (though she does). Berlanti also douses his sometimes-comedy with reminders of the horrid war. So, anytime his love story might start heating up, real-life carnage hits like a cold shower. The tragedy of the Apollo 1 mission, in which three astronauts were killed, is also a heavy thread, knitting together the life-or-death stakes of Apollo 11 and giving Cole a series of scenes to grieve as that failed launch's haunted director.&nbsp;</p><p>This remorse explains why he has no patience for Kelly's relentlessly can-do attitude, the white lies she employs in the name of "selling," and the persistent distraction she is to his work. (She literally pulls his astronauts away from training for product-placement photo shoots.) However, without her skills at selling NASA to the public, the mission could see its funding pulled. So, selling out is regarded by <em>Fly Me to the Moon</em> as a necessary evil &mdash; a point driven home by a climactic kiss that features OMEGA&reg; watches in its cozy close-up of the headlining co-stars.&nbsp;</p><p>The total dissonance of the film might be intentional; perhaps it's meant to reflect the conflict between the idealistic Cole and the jaded Kelly. While that might be clever on paper, on screen it makes for a deadly tedious film. There is absolutely no flow or momentum to the storytelling, as one scene of utter despair leads into one of of light-hearted flirtation, then to one of clumsy comic mayhem.&nbsp;</p><h2>Is star power dead?&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Critics have been debating this for years now, and <em>Fly Me to the Moon </em>might be further proof that a eulogy is overdue. </p><p>Scarlett Johansson gives a lot to this film, including an arsenal of wheedling accents, a megawatt smile that Julia Roberts would be proud of, and a performance that ranges from plucky punchlines to a tearful monologue about a tragic childhood. Yet she can't dazzle thoroughly through all the shenanigans and tonal turns. Con woman Kelly is so throughly constructed of false fronts that even when she gets to her tender truth, it seems just another scheming schtick &mdash; amusing but shallow. &nbsp;</p><p>Tatum is similarly shackled by a script that deflates the himbo allure he perfected in the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/magic-mikes-last-dance-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Magic Mike</a> movies, offering instead a stale archetype of a serious science man. Despite some early antics involving a flaming broom and a black cat, Cole never quite manages to solidify into a compelling fussbudget, molded from the likes of Spencer Tracy, Cary Grant, or Rock Hudson.&nbsp;</p><p>Johansson and Tatum don't share a chemistry that can make this movie work for all its faults. Neither is helped by a plot line that runs in circles of highs and lows rather than a compelling three-act trajectory. As Berlanti has a storied history in television, with credits that include <em>Everwood, Arrow, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/you-season-4-part-1-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">You</a></em><em>, </em>and <em>Legends of Tomorrow</em>, I began to wonder if this premise was originally conceived as a miniseries. This could explain the confounding structure that, at two hours and 10 minutes long, feels agonizing.</p><p>Broken up into 30-minute episodes, these jarring tonal shifts might've felt less severe, the quirky comedy bits could have been grounded, the dramatic stings given the space to hit with impact. But Berlanti, who won praise at the helm of romantic dramedies like <a href="https://mashable.com/video/love-simon-cast-bullies-clapback" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Love, Simon</em></a> and <em>The Broken Hearts Club</em>, doesn't have the cinematic vision to pull off all these elements. Instead, he takes a tale of love and lies and space, and creates something that is often astonishingly visually flat and uninspired. The whimsy of '60s comedies and its candy-colored fashion is lost here. </p><h2><em>Fly Me to the Moon</em> is nearly saved by its supporting cast.&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>While Johansson and Tatum struggle, the players around them manage to shine. Jim Rash certainly delivers the flashiest performance as Lance Vespertine, a unrepentantly flamboyant and narcissistic commercial director. Rash brings a welcomed chaotic energy to his scenes, issuing outlandish demands and withering remarks with the rapid-fire spray and viciousness of a tommy gun. In him, <em>Fly Me to the Moon </em>scratches at showbiz satire, gleefully mocking the indulgences allowed an arrogant director. But as Rash is used chiefly for breezy comic relief, the finer points of the critique are lost amid the screeching.&nbsp;</p><p>Elsewhere, Ray Romano pops up as a pal of Cole's to deliver exposition dumps and hit plot points with a practiced efficiency and sly oafishness; Romano turns a thankless role into a needed source of heart. Meanwhile, Woody Harrelson strolls into the vaguely threatening authority role he's played across genres, this time as a mysterious yet intimidating government agent called Moe. He's on cruise control here, with a fedora doing half the work. Nonetheless, Harrelson is amusing, especially as he casually threatens Kelly, then erupts into the title song as he saunters away.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the standout amid these big names (and Mr. Scarlett Johansson, Colin Jost, who pops by in a brief yet excruciating cameo) is Anna Garcia, a brilliant comedic actress who plays Kelly's plucky, politically minded assistant. </p><p>Plotwise, her Ruby is a confidante to whom Kelly can spill secrets of the fake moon landing, among other ploys. But in execution, Garcia brings a crisp comedy styling that is bright and intoxicating,&nbsp;whatever mess is going on around her. With guest stints on shows like <em>It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,</em> the <em>Party Down</em> reboot, and various <a href="https://mashable.com/article/game-changer-dropout-sam-reich-interview" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">DROPOUT</a> productions, Garcia first caught my eye in the interview parody show <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5UW76dMdbE" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Very Important People</em>.</a> Here, Garcia played an eccentric Eurotrash pop star so convincingly that I looked for Princess Emily's Spotify artist page.

In <em>Fly Me to the Moon, </em>she steals scenes with sharp asides and eye-catching reactions. Regrettably, as the film plunges into ham-fisted pathos, radiant Ruby is flung off on a lazy romantic subplot involving a character who can be most kindly written off as Nerd Number Two.&nbsp;</p><h2>Berlanti aims for the moon and falls far short.&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>By taking on a '60s-style romcom, Berlanti stacks himself against the talents of such influential directors as Blake Edwards (<em>Breakfast at Tiffany's)</em>, Norman Jewison (<em>Send Me No Flowers</em>), William Wyler (<em>How to Steal A Million</em>), Stanley Donen (<em>Charade, Funny Face</em>) and George Cukor (<em>Adam's Rib, My Fair Lady)</em>. By folding in so many earnest elements of space travel drama, he invites comparisons to the celebrated filmmaking of Stanley Kubrick (<em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>), who is repeatedly name-dropped in the film because of those <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nasa-stephen-curry-moon-landing-conspiracy" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">exhausting conspiracy theories</a>. And in every instance, this clunky dramedy pales in comparison, lacking the visual splendor, the emotional resonance, and the incorrigible wit of those that came before.&nbsp;</p><p>With this genre-blending script, Berlanti has a wide sandbox to play in but no idea what to do with all these toys. In the end, <em>Fly Me to the Moon </em>is not just a misfire but a cataclysmic miscalculation, turning out to be far more tedious than enchanting.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/9YdEEj?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Fly%20Me%20to%20the%20Moon%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Apple%20TV.&object_type=article&object_uuid=05zIoTkbHX1BQ1kfY1Zqmo7&short_url=9YdEEj&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Fly Me to the Moon </em>is now streaming on Apple TV.</a></p><p class="mx-auto">

<p>The tale of a documentary filmmaker on his deathbed who becomes the camera's subject, the film is based on the 2021 novel <em>Foregone</em> by Russell Banks. (Schrader previously adapted Banks' novel <em>Affliction</em> in 1997.) The author would sadly pass away in January 2023, a few months before filming began, and shortly after Schrader himself had a brush with death thanks to COVID-19.</p><p>This proximity to grief, and to the grave, informs <em>Oh Canada</em>'s storytelling, which plays like a recollection of regrets. Its structure and narrative POV shift in beguiling ways, as though the movie's main character &mdash; played by two actors at different ages &mdash; was rushing to absolve himself of sin. Along the way, he confuses and collapses his many confessions into a single, muddled mythology that constantly shifts through elliptical editing, as if to reflect the character&rsquo;s disoriented state of mind. The details may be unreliable, but his story pulses with riveting emotional truths, born from lifelong remorse.&nbsp;</p><h2>What is <em>Oh, Canada</em> about?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>Now confined to hospice care, Canadian filmmaker Leonard Fife (Richard Gere) agrees to an interview conducted by his former film students, Malcolm (Michael Imperioli) and Diana (Victoria Hill), during his final weeks of life. Cancer has ravaged his body, and his treatment has left him tired, but as an artist who has always used his camera to unearth people's truths, he hopes Malcolm and Diana's lens will do the same for him, and help him unburden himself as his wife, Emma (Uma Thurman), looks on.</p><p>Many details of Leonard's life are publicly known, especially his conscientious Vietnam draft-dodging, after which he left the U.S. for the Great White North as a political asylee. However, just as much of his story remains shrouded in mystery, which he now unpacks as last rite. In flashbacks set in the '60s and '70s, Leonard is played by Jacob Elordi (of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/priscilla-movie-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Priscilla</em></a> fame), though on occasion, Gere himself strides through scenes where Elordi ought to be, a swap that occurs either through straightforward cuts, or the occasional <a href="https://kottke.org/21/09/the-texas-switch" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Texas Switch</u></a>.</p><p>The seamlessness with which the older Leonard replaces his younger self has an eerie effect, as though something in the fabric of his story were deeply amiss. As he reveals some particularly shameful and macabre family secrets, Emma remains in denial over his revelations and insists that Leonard must be confused about the details. He is, in a way, given the overlap between events and characters he recalls, but all of these revelations come from a place of deep pain and repression. Whether or not they're logistically true, Gere makes their emotional truth feel undeniable via a towering, career-defining performance as a man both afraid and determined to stare at the camera and be seen by it, as he struggles to purge himself of demons that have long been eating at his soul.</p><h2>Paul Schrader brings a thoughtful filmmaking eye to <em>Oh, Canada</em>.</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Throughout <em>Oh, Canada</em>, Leonard's regret is enhanced by Schrader's interrogative filmmaking, which draws from numerous documentarian techniques. The film for which he provides his personal testimony &mdash; about his own life, and his work as anti-war activist after his illegal border-crossing &mdash; takes the form of a traditional interview talking head, albeit with an aesthetic twist that yields several haunting close-ups.</p><p>In order to pay tribute to Leonard, his students film him with the use of a camera set-up he invented. In reality, this is the<a href="https://nofilmschool.com/2012/09/interrotron-errol-morris-documentary" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"> <u>Interrotron</u></a> developed by <em>The Thin Blue Line</em> director Errol Morris; it&rsquo;s a teleprompter that allows the subject to meet the interviewer's eye (or rather, a reflection of it) while staring directly down the camera's lens. By attributing the tool to the fictitious Leonard, Schrader creates a double-edged sword. The technique has long afforded Leonard the comfort of sitting behind a video monitor, rather than meeting his subjects' gaze directly. But now, as the subject of his own camera, his confession occurs in a darkened, lonely room.</p><p>There are people nearby, like the filmmakers, and Leonard's wife, Emma, whose reflection theoretically appears in the teleprompter, but we only ever glimpse this briefly. For the most part, Schrader locks us into a trio of close-ups of Leonard from three angles (two profiles, and one directly head-on), which appear on side-by-side video screens for Malcolm and Diana, and whose angles Schrader often cuts between. This triptych framing makes the cameras feel incredibly invasive, and by almost never cutting away from Leonard's close-ups, Schrader forces us to view his self-reflections the way the aging documentarian sees them. His interviewers' faces may be visible to him on a screen, but he recognizes his own filmmaking facade, and he knows just how lonely he is, here at the end of his life.</p><p>This loneliness takes stirring form during Leonard's flashbacks, too. In isolated moments, Elordi and Gere's attention occasionally drifts from the characters to whom they're speaking, and their gaze falls upon nothing in particular, as though they know they're trapped in a framing device. People from other points in the story sometimes appear where they shouldn't, and on occasion, a white light consumes the frame, as though hypoxia (or the embrace of death) had threatened to provide Leonard with respite from his confessions.</p><p>The question then remains: Does Leonard want to die without having exposed the worst parts of himself?</p><h2>Schrader's shifting narrative makes <em>Oh, Canada</em> a holistic self-reflection.</h2><p>Like Schrader's most recent works &mdash; especially <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-films-of-2018-so-far" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>First Reformed</em></a>, <em>The Card Counter</em>, and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/master-gardener-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Master Gardener</em></a>, a similarly confessional trilogy &mdash; <em>Oh, Canada</em> makes frequent use of voiceover. But in the aforementioned films, these narrations took the form of diary entries by each protagonist, whereas in the latest, the framing device is not only a camera this time, but one that isn't in Leonard's control.</p><p>Sometimes, the movie's voiceover comprises snippets from Leonard's filmed confession. Other times, it draws from an impassioned inner monologue. And on some occasions, the voiceover is spoken by a different character entirely, revealed to be a person who feels deeply betrayed by Leonard. In a literal sense, this patchwork of perspectives helps unearth Leonard's story from multiple points of view, as Schrader deconstructs both a man and the mythology around him.</p><p>However, this shifting POV also serves a spiritual purpose. In essence, it blends the known and the imagined, and plays as though Leonard were in a desperate grasp at absolutely, slowly stepping outside himself and finding sudden empathy for someone he had deeply &mdash; perhaps knowingly &mdash; wronged.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p><em>Oh, Canada</em> is a work of deep-seated guilt frothing to the surface, and while its story is largely fictional, Schrader's presentation takes strikingly personal form. On one hand, the older Leonard is styled to resemble Banks &mdash; Schrader&rsquo;s friend of many years, who requested the filmmaker to adapt <em>Foregone</em> before he died &mdash; but from many angles, this man with short, graying hair and an unkempt beard also resembles Schrader himself, who made the film when it seemed like the nearly 80-year-old filmmaker might not win his long battle with COVID and pneumonia. (He was hospitalized, and suffered breathing difficulties in the aftermath.)</p><p>But there's another personal element to the movie, too, one made far less apparent on screen. Around the time of Banks' death and Schrader's illness, the director also <a href="https://www.curbed.com/article/paul-schrader-assisted-living-coterie-hudson-yards-nyc.html" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>moved into</u></a> an assisted living facility with his wife, Mary Beth Hurt, whose Alzheimer's had been worsening. <em>Oh, Canada</em> is as much a film about death and elusive truths as it is about memory and its fleeting nature, and it's hard not to read the visual manifestations of Leonard's confusion as Schrader's depiction of his wife's condition.</p><p>Moreover, it depicts a filmmaker whose confessions to his wife &mdash; a woman who knows him better than anyone, but still doesn't know his darkest moments &mdash; don't seem to stick, both because of his illness and his inability to properly articulate them. While Schrader's avatar suffers from distortions of recollection in the film, and is assisted by his wife, the reverse is true in reality. The idea of a man unable to fully give himself over to the woman he loves because of the impermanent nature of memory is the tragic result, regardless. While <em>Oh, Canada</em> talks through (but quickly skips past) many of these central themes &mdash; en route to a conclusion that wraps up too quickly, and too neatly &mdash; it stands as one of Schrader's most personal, most moving, and most impactful films.</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/QODll2?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Oh%2C%20Canada%20is%20now%20playing%20in%20theaters.&object_type=article&object_uuid=02oZ5c5L7BYedN1AjN2Rr46&short_url=QODll2&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Oh, Canada </em>is now playing in theaters.</a></p><p class="mx-auto">

<p>The sci-fi logic of the film is basically non-existent, though Zegler's Laura is saddled with a series of hacker exposition dumps that half-heartedly set up some rules. But <em>Y2K </em>refuses to take science-fiction seriously. The premise is an excuse to goof on 2000s culture and chuck some teen archetypes into silly shenanigans. So Eli reluctantly leads a motley band of survivors out of this house of horrors and into a plan to save not just their high school but the whole world.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Y2K</em> is radiant in '00s nostalgia.&nbsp;</h2><p>Much like <a href="https://mashable.com/article/pen15-hulu" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>PEN15</em></a><em>, Y2K </em>plunges audiences back into a time where AIM away messages were pretentious poetry, dial-up squawked, T-shirts were worn inexplicably oversized, and burning CDs was a meaningful tool of self-expression. The opening sequence is littered with such nostalgic '00s details, which aptly set the era and earned much laughter and cheers from the SXSW audience at the film's world premiere. Props to Mooney for crafting such a crowd-pleasing beginning, but upon reflection, there's few actual jokes there. It's all about the joy of recognition, which could mean this comedy won't play for Gen Z at all, despite <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nostalgia-on-tiktok" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">their recent Y2K revival</a>.&nbsp;</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Other references play a bigger role in the plot, like Danny learning Tae-Bo via Billy Blanks' once unavoidable workout videos and a musician cameo that &mdash;&nbsp;while funny and surprising &mdash;&nbsp;wears out its welcome by beating the same joke into the ground. Actually, that's a bit of a recurring problem. Mooney doesn't have a great sense of when enough is enough so several bits drag, making the movie feel a bit meandering even at one hour and thirty-three minutes. But the bigger issue is <em>Y2K</em> hangs itself on its least interesting character.&nbsp;</p><h2>Julian Dennison outshines Jaeden Martell.&nbsp;</h2><p>Winter's script is woefully lazy in developing Martell's Eli as a character. Established as shy and vaguely nerdy (he likes computer games and modifying action figures), Eli is identifiable as the lovestruck nerd archetype. However, he's not weird enough to be interesting in this world where electronics are suddenly transforming into gnarly killing machines. Likewise his crush Laura is regarded as extraordinary because she's pretty, popular, and into computers while being a girl. There's admittedly a self-awareness in other characters pointing out this supposed dissonance, but <em>Y2K </em>doesn't go any deeper into Laura's personality. So the jokes at her expense are more a lampshade of the issue rather than challenging it.&nbsp;</p><p>Where the teen comedy aspect comes alive is in Danny as the charismatic wild card bestie, Franco as a rock-rap-loving bully, and Lachlan Watson as a surly alt chick. But sadly, the script sidelines them for way too much of the movie. While Zegler has undeniable screen presence, Martell offers a blank stare for much of the movie that just squashes its emotional pull. The frantic action and spurts of bright-red blood helps revive the movie's chaotic energy, but you might wish that Dennison had been given more to do here.&nbsp;The New Zealand actor is a dynamo, and it&rsquo;s a shame to see him shunted to the side in a quirky bestie role.&nbsp;</p><p>As a first watch, <em>Y2K </em>is a lot of fun. Its teen cast overall has terrific energy, and a supporting cast that includes Alicia Silverstone, Tim Heidecker, and Mooney &mdash; as a burnout video store clerk &mdash;&nbsp;brings welcomed microdoses of weirdness. The celebration of all things '00s is undeniably charming, even if used superficially. Jokes come fast and frantic, so even if some don't land, there's plenty of laughs to be had. But on reflection, the movie suffers under its lack of emotional depth. This is a solid stoner comedy, gleefully dumb and unapologetically wacky. But as a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-teen-movie" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">teen comedy</a>, <em>Y2K </em>lacks the emotional awareness of classics like <em>Clueless, </em>the original <em>Mean Girls, </em>or <em>Superbad.&nbsp;</em></p><p>In short, <em>Y2K </em>is a good time, but falls short of greatness.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/QPbD6P?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Y2K%20is%20now%20in%20theaters.&object_type=article&object_uuid=03cqwVnaDlv8IvYfR4Knkqf&short_url=QPbD6P&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Y2K</em> is now in theaters.</a></p><p class="mx-auto">

<p>With these earbuds you'll get up to 8.5 hours of listening time on the go, and with a quick 20-minute top-up charge, you get an extra two hours. Style-wise, like most, these earbuds come with multiple ear tips so they fit comfortably and give you the maximum possible listening ability. Not to mention, a secure fit means they are better for sports such as running or gym workouts. </p><p>And one of our top features is the customizable tap controls. Choose whether you want these to adjust the volume, skip tracks, or pause your music. Do this in the Bose QCE app, where you'll also find more personalization options to tweak EQ settings and check battery life.</p><p>Grab this <a href="https://zdcs.link/QddjkK?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=great%20earbud%20deal&object_type=article&object_uuid=06kStH6tEHaM1ow0Lkyu8S5&short_url=QddjkK&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">great earbud deal</a> from Amazon.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The H2 chip is AirPods 4 secret weapon, powering an impressive mix of Active Noise Cancellation, Adaptive Audio, and Transparency Mode. These modes work together to adjust your audio experience on the fly. For example, conversation awareness will automatically lower the volume when speaking to someone nearby, so there is no need to manually pull out an earbud or change a setting.</p><p>Upgrades don&rsquo;t stop there. The Personalized Spatial Audio feature creates a 360-degree soundscape with dynamic head tracking, making it feel like you&rsquo;re in a private theater. Binging out your favorite series and checking out the new Killswitch Engage album takes immersion to the next level. Always on the go, the Voice Isolation feature improves call quality by reducing background noise, ensuring your voice is heard clearly, even in loud environments.</p><p>The redesigned USB-C Charging Case is the smallest in the industry and has multiple charging options. Apple Watch chargers, Qi-certified pads, and USB-C cables are all fair game. The AirPods 4 offer up to four hours of listening time per charge with ANC enabled and up to 30 hours of total playtime when paired with the case and ANC turned off.</p><p>This Apple AirPods 4 deal is best for the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/dec-5-apple-airpods-pro-2-deal" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">newest model</a>.

<p>If you're shopping for a TV upgrade that blends premium features with an accessible price tag, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/ao5AZ0?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=TCL%20Q5%2065-inch%20Smart%20Fire%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=05wTau1kAPzdmOvLJZf3f1H&short_url=ao5AZ0&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">TCL Q5 65-inch Smart Fire TV</a> is a strong contender. I've tested plenty of budget-friendly TVs, and this one consistently punches above its weight. Right now, it's available for $399.99 at Best Buy. That's a full $150 off its regular price of $549.99. This is a solid opportunity to snag a high-performance QLED for under $400.</p><p>Let's be real: not all TVs in this price range are created equal. Some give you flat colors and clunky interfaces, but the TCL Q5 throws a party on your screen. With its QLED display powered by Quantum Dot technology, this TV serves up vibrant colors and strong brightness that makes everything from rom-coms to Marvel marathons feel like a front-row experience. Dolby Vision and HDR PRO+ tech ensure every scene gets the love it deserves.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Game Accelerator 120 ensures your refresh rate is as smooth as your skills (or as close as it gets). Auto Game Mode (ALLM) automatically optimizes your setup for a lag-free experience. Gunning for leaderboard glory or getting absolutely wrecked in <em>Call of Duty</em>? This TV won't slow you down. And thanks to Motion Rate 240, action sequences and fast-moving sports look buttery smooth instead of blurry messes.</p><p>The TCL Q5's sound game is no slouch either. Dolby Atmos and DTS Virtual:X deliver quality audio. Feel like keeping it to yourself? Bluetooth Personal Audio lets you hook up your favorite headphones so you can binge your guilty-pleasure reality shows without judgment.</p><p>Fire TV is baked right in, giving you instant access to all the big streaming apps. Alexa voice controls make it even easier. It even works with Apple AirPlay 2, so you can stream videos, photos, and TikToks (we won't judge) directly from your iPhone.</p><p>Wrapped in a sleek, bezel-less design, this TV looks as good off as it does on. At $399.99, you're not just saving $150, you're getting a deal that feels almost criminal. Sales like this never last long; do pull the trigger if you've been waiting for an affordable living room beast.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>What is Salt Typhoon?</h2><p>Salt Typhoon is a hacking group which is reportedly sponsored by the Chinese government. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/cybersecurity/u-s-wiretap-systems-targeted-in-china-linked-hack-327fc63b" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Active since 2020</a>, the group has carried out attacks against targets in the U.S. as well as globally.</p><p>The group typically uses <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/cybersecurity-101/threat-intelligence/advanced-persistent-threat-apt/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">advanced persistent threat (APT) attacks</a>, covertly gaining access to targeted networks and remaining there undetected for a lengthy period of time. Such methods allow attackers to gather extensive information about their targeted organisation.</p><p>Though commonly referred to as Salt Typhoon, the group has also been dubbed <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/microsoft-threat-actor-naming" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">GhostEmperor, FamousSparrow</a>, <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/24/k/earth-estries.html" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Earth Estries, and UNC2286</a>. The name "Salt Typhoon" was given to it by Microsoft, which uses "Typhoon" to label all nation-state threat actors from China.</p><h2>What is the Salt Typhoon telecom hack?</h2><p>On Wednesday, the U.S. government disclosed that at least eight telecommunications companies have been infiltrated by Salt Typhoon's hackers, following reports emerging <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/08/27/chinese-government-hackers-penetrate-us-internet-providers-spy/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">earlier this year</a> of a state-sponsored Chinese cyberattack on internet service providers.</p><p>The 2024 Salt Typhoon hack is believed to have actually been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/12/05/fcc-salt-typhoon-cybersecurity-china/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">ongoing for one or two years</a>, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/12/03/china-hack-salt-typhoon-telecom/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">remains active even now</a>, with Salt Typhoon allegedly still able to access many telecommunication systems. While officials are working on ridding systems of the intruders, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has said it is "impossible" to tell when all the hackers will be completely evicted.</p><p>According to U.S. officials, the Salt Typhoon hack is an espionage campaign sponsored by Chinese authorities. The Chinese government has denied any involvement in the cyberattacks.</p><p>"The U.S. needs to stop its own cyberattacks against other countries and refrain from using cyber security to smear and slander China," <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-hacking-salt-typhoon-trump-fbi-41ca253307e3eba2c34b3dc34dadcbeb" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">a spokesperson from China's embassy in Washington said in a statement to the Associated Press.</a></p><h2>Which U.S. telecoms are impacted by the Salt Typhoon hack?</h2><p>A full list of organisations impacted by the Salt Typhoon hack has not been released, however we do know that the campaign targeted telecommunications companies across the globe. Anne Neuberger, U.S. Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Tech, stated on Wednesday that "dozens of countries" have been affected, with the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand all confirmed targets.</p><p>In the U.S., Salt Typhoon allegedly breached at least eight telecommunications companies. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/dozens-of-countries-hit-in-chinese-telecom-hacking-campaign-top-u-s-official-says-2a3a5cca" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reports</a> that this list includes:</p><ul><li><p>Verizon</p></li><li><p>AT&amp;T</p></li><li><p>T-Mobile</p></li><li><p>Lumen Technologies</p></li></ul><h2>Am I impacted by the Salt Typhoon hack?</h2><p>U.S. officials stated that while they believe the Salt Typhoon hack did not affect every American, it has impacted "a large number" of people, most of whom were located in the greater Washington area. The hackers reportedly accessed these individuals' metadata, such as records of numbers which had contacted each other, but not the content of such communications.</p><p>On its own merit, most of this compromised metadata appears to be of little interest to Salt Typhoon. Instead, the hackers are believed to have used such information to identify the communications of particular targeted individuals. Salt Typhoon is alleged to have been searching for corporate intellectual property as well as specific government and political targets, which reportedly included <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/11/21/salt-typhoon-china-hack-telecom/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=wp_main&amp;utm_source=twitter" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Donald Trump, Senator J.D. Vance</a>, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/10/25/trump-vance-phone-hack-china/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">people from within both Trump and Kamala Harris' presidential campaigns</a>.</p><p>Upon identifying them, the hackers focused on accessing these individuals' communications, reading texts and listening in to audio calls. As of November, approximately 150 individual targets had been identified and notified, most of them within the Washington, D.C. area.</p><p>"The actors stole a large volume of records, including data on where, when, and with whom individuals were communicating," <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/12/03/china-hack-salt-typhoon-telecom/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) official told the <em>Washington Post</em></a>.</p><p>Salt Typhoon's hackers reportedly also <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/cybersecurity/u-s-wiretap-systems-targeted-in-china-linked-hack-327fc63b" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">accessed the U.S. law enforcement's system for requesting wiretaps</a>. Though officials told the <em>Washington Post</em> that there's <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/11/21/salt-typhoon-china-hack-telecom/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">no evidence the hackers were able to listen in on the network</a>, they may have been able to identify individuals the U.S. government is investigating.</p><p>The full scope of the Salt Typhoon hack still isn't entirely clear. Fortunately, Neuberger has stated that no classified information is believed to have been compromised.</p><h2>How is the U.S. government responding to the Salt Typhoon hack?</h2><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Following nows of the Salt Typhoon cyberattack, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has said it is <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-408015A1.pdf" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">"taking decisive steps to address vulnerabilities in U.S. telecommunications network."</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Specifically, the FCC has proposed clarifying laws which require telecommunications companies to secure their networks against hackers. This would make clear that such security measures not only include equipment, but also how the telecommunications carriers manage their networks.</p><p>The FCC has also proposed a new annual certification requirement for telecommunications companies, including certified compliance with new cybersecurity risk management plans.</p><p>"While the Commission&rsquo;s counterparts in the intelligence community are determining the scope and impact of the Salt Typhoon attack, we need to put in place a modern framework to help companies secure their networks and better prevent and respond to cyberattacks in the future," <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-408013A1.pdf" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">said FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel.</a></p><p>A Senate Commerce subcommittee will hold a hearing on the Salt Typhoon hack on Dec. 11 to examine security threats and protective measures.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>What is Connections Sports Edition?</h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has launched in association with <em>The Athletic</em>, the New York Times property that provides the publication's sports coverage. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

    </a>
</blockquote>
<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer.</p><p>If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. Like <em>Wordle, </em>you can share the results with your friends on social media.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

Words can be made from linked letters &mdash; up, down, left, right, or diagonal, but words can also change direction, resulting in quirky shapes and patterns. Every single letter in the grid will be part of an answer. There's always a theme linking every solution, along with the "spangram," a special, word or phrase that sums up that day's theme, and spans the entire grid horizontally or vertically.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

        </a>

<p>By providing an opaque hint and not providing the word list, Strands creates a brain-teasing game that takes a little longer to play than its other games, like <a href="https://mashable.com/category/wordle" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Wordle</a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/category/connections" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Connections</a>.</p><p>If you're feeling stuck or just don't have 10 or more minutes to figure out today's puzzle, we've got all the NYT Strands hints for today's puzzle you need to progress at your preferred pace.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Upon launch, $HAWK jumped to a market cap of $500 million. Within minutes, the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/hailey-welch-hawk-memecoin-launch" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">token crashed</a>. Its current market cap is around $36 million. Hawk Tuah fans quickly took to social media to share how they lost thousands of dollars.</p><p>Things are starting to look a lot like 2021 all over again.&nbsp;</p><h2>Celebrity crypto is a scam</h2><p>During the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/influencers-altcoin-scams" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>last crypto rush of 2021</u></a>, some celebrities and online influencers quickly saw that there was money to be made. Some musicians, reality TV stars, and e-sports names endorsed altcoins or even went ahead and made their own branded memecoins.</p><p>Cryptocurrency is a risky investment to begin with. Crypto tokens are a highly volatile speculative asset. There is currently very little governmental oversight or regulation when it comes to the crypto market. Even Bitcoin, seen as the most "safe" bet in the crypto world, has had major ebbs and flows. If you have to sell during one of the down periods, you might lose a chunk of change.</p><p>Furthermore, now anyone can create a crypto token. Over the past few years, there have been platforms that have helped make the process very easy. Dogecoin, easily the most popular memecoin, set a standard of success that no other memecoin has been able to replicate.</p><p>Yet, the allure of making easy money and getting rich quick through crypto tokens and memecoins have drawn in lots of money from people.&nbsp;</p><p>Back in 2021, memecoins created by celebrities and influencers were all the rage. As Mashable <a href="https://mashable.com/article/influencers-altcoin-scams" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>reported then</u></a>, many turned out to be a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/influencer-cryptocurrency-giveaways" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>scam</u></a>.</p><p>Rug pulls are quite common with memecoins, especially those created by influencers and celebrities.&nbsp;</p><p>Here's what often happens: A famous or notable individual launches a memecoin. Their fans are encouraged to purchase to support their favorite creator while also making money for themselves. However, before the memecoin is officially launched, the memecoin creator puts aside a certain amount of tokens for themselves or their friends. They either give these out freely or provide an unadvertised pre-launch sale at well below the price that the token will go for at launch. When the token does go on sale, the public buys, pushing the value of the memecoin up. But, as soon as that happens, those who received coins at pre-launch dump their holdings for profit, plummeting its value and eventually crashing the memecoin. The celebrity or influencer's fans are often then left holding the bag, their money tied up in a now-worthless token that they will never be able to sell.</p><p>It may seem obvious that one should not accept financial advice from celebrities. Way back in 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a stark warning about the speculative machinations of public figures. "Investors should be skeptical of investment advice posted to social media platforms, and should not make decisions based on celebrity endorsements," Enforcement Division Co-Director Steven Peikin wrote in the same <a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2018-268" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">statement announcing Floyd Mayweather Jr. and DJ Khaled were charged</a> with illegally touting initial coin offerings. "Social media influencers are often paid promoters, not investment professionals, and the securities they&rsquo;re touting, regardless of whether they are issued using traditional certificates or on the blockchain, could be frauds."</p><p>However, in an age or parasocial relationships, many fans feel like they can trust their favorite influencers. There's a feeling that "they wouldn't scam me." But, time and time again, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2018-268" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">celebrity memecoins have failed</a>, with insiders making money off of the influencer's fans.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Take the aforementioned and recently launched $HAWK. In a <a href="https://x.com/DramaAlert/status/1864585278469390809" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>X Spaces stream</u></a>, YouTuber Coffeezilla who investigates cryptocurrency scams, confronts Welch and the developers behind her crypto token about how things played out after the launch. Its a tale we've heard before. The vast majority of the tokens were held by just a few crypto wallets before the public launch. After it launched, according to Coffeezilla, those insiders dumped the token. $HAWK's value plummeted and all of those buyers who got in at launch are left with a significant financial loss.</p><p>There is no recourse for those memecoin buyers. There are no refunds, no way for them to get their money back. Most memecoins have zero utility, so there's no use case for the tokens either. The only way they're getting back what they put in is if Welch and her team can somehow convince another group of suckers to put their money into this worthless token.</p><p>Hopefully, after reading this, you won't be one of those suckers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>OpenAI clarified to the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/12/04/openai-anduril-military-ai/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Washington Post</em></a> that the partnership will only cover systems that "defend against pilotless aerial threats" (read: detect and shoot down drones), notably avoiding the explicit association of its technology with human-casualty military applications. Both OpenAI and Anduril say the partnership will keep the U.S. on par with China's AI advancements&mdash; a repeated goal that's echoed in the U.S. government's "Manhattan Project"-style investments in AI and "<a href="https://mashable.com/article/trump-elon-musk-doge-department-of-government-efficiency" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">government efficiency.</a>"</p><p>"OpenAI builds AI to benefit as many people as possible, and supports U.S.-led efforts to ensure the technology upholds democratic values," wrote OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. "Our partnership with Anduril will help ensure OpenAI technology protects U.S. military personnel, and will help the national security community understand and responsibly use this technology to keep our citizens safe and free."</p><p>In January, OpenAI <a href="https://mashable.com/article/open-ai-no-longer-bans-military-uses-chatgpt" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">quietly removed policy language</a> that banned applications of its technologies that pose high risk of physical harm, including "military and warfare." An OpenAI spokesperson told Mashable at the time: "Our policy does not allow our tools to be used to harm people, develop weapons, for communications surveillance, or to injure others or destroy property. There are, however, national security use cases that align with our mission. For example, we are already working with <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2023-08-09" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>DARPA</u></a> to spur the creation of new cybersecurity tools to secure open source software that critical infrastructure and industry depend on. It was not clear whether these beneficial use cases would have been allowed under 'military' in our previous policies."</p><p>Over the last year, the company has reportedly been pitching its services in various capacities to the U.S. military and national security offices, backed by a former security officer at software company and government contractor Palantir. And OpenAI isn't the only AI innovator pivoting to military applications. Tech companies Anthropic, makers of Claude, and Palantir recently announced a <a href="https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2024/Anthropic-and-Palantir-Partner-to-Bring-Claude-AI-Models-to-AWS-for-U.S.-Government-Intelligence-and-Defense-Operations/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">partnership with Amazon Web Services</a> to sell Anthropic&rsquo;s AI models to defense and intelligence agencies, advertised as "decision advantage" tools for "classified environments."</p><p>Recent rumors suggest President-elect Donald Trump is eyeing Palantir chief technology officer <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/12/05/who-trump-pick-shyam-sankar-pentagon/76764531007/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Shyam Shankir</a> to take over the lead engineering and research spot in the Pentagon.

<p>OpenAI also unveiled o1 pro mode, which is an exclusive feature for ChatGPT Pro that can handle more compute for complex math, programming, and writing problems. OpenAI says o1 pro mode performs better on machine learning benchmarks for math, coding, and PhD-level science questions. ChatGPT Pro is built for "power users," said CEO Sam Altman. Given the level of complexity for tasks, o1 pro mode will take longer to respond, which is why it will show a progress bar. </p><p>The price hike is not entirely unexpected.

<p>OpenAI says the o1 model is 50 percent faster and outperforms o1 preview on "difficult real-world questions" by 34 percent.

<p>Blaho also leaked another page about the ChatGPT Team plan which included "limited preview of GPT-4.5" as part of its offerings. The reference has since been taken down, but it might be a hint of what's to come over the next few weeks. </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[TikTok is covering the Mom Jeans song "Scott Pilgrim vs. My GPA." It's a great micro trend, if a bit random.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00ixsKx2e4ZnQ8gsxXBLS3e/hero-image.png" alt="Screenshots of TikToks of three people playing acoustic guitars, covering a Mom Jeans song"><p>There's no real way to predict TikTok trends. If you could, you'd be both fabulously wealthy and an out-of-touch, IRL social pariah incapable of integrating into polite society. It'd be impossible to foresee, for instance, that an emo song I enjoyed in 2016 would resurface on my TikTok FYP in 2024. And yet that's exactly what's been happening with Mom Jeans and their nearly decade-old song "Scott Pilgrim vs. My GPA."</p><p>Now if you're unfamiliar <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chd31lOa6xg" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">with Mom Jeans</a> &mdash; the band, not the style of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/clear-knee-mom-jeans" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">denim slacks</a> &mdash; they're an indie, Midwest emo band out of California. I enjoy their music, so my FYP might be a little biased, and I think "Scott Pilgrim vs. My GPA" is a really good song. Here's the studio version of the track, off of the 2016 album <em>Best Buds. </em></p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-Scg413squjY"></div>
</div>


<p>So, yes, the song is good, but why are people covering an eight-year-old track on TikTok? The best reason I can decipher begins with the fact that the song has a quite nostalgic feel to it. It starts primarily with an acoustic guitar and heartfelt lyrics, then layers in a trombone and loud drums. The song also has great sing-along moments and a distinctive style, all while addressing the ideas of moving on and being content with that. Those facts in mind, the song's been used in a number of TikTok edits made to elicit nostalgia like &mdash; randomly enough &mdash; <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@forbesszn/video/7439754823429360926?q=scott%20pilgrim%20vs%20my%20gpa&amp;t=1733420254127" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">a compilation of highlights</a> from former NFL star Todd Gurley.</p><blockquote class="tiktok-embed" data-video-id="7439754823429360926" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;">

<p>So, with the song on lots of folks' FYPs, it tracks that suddenly there'd be lots of people covering the song. And that's how we got the trend of covering a relatively obscure indie rock song from 2016. But the covers rule. My personal favorite comes from the account <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@pattakerhasnopats" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">@pattakerhasnopats</a>, a kid seemingly playing the song during gym class or at a sporting event while sitting in the bleachers. The background din of other teens really adds a nostalgic haze to what's already a great cover. </p><blockquote class="tiktok-embed" data-video-id="7439472826131795242" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;">

<p>That cover from <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@pattakerhasnopats" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">@pattakerhasnopats</a> &mdash; who has just over 2,000 followers on TikTok &mdash; has racked up nearly half a million views, which is effectively an identical number <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxy0aP5m03c" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">to the views on Mom Jeans' most popular live version</a> of the song on YouTube. In other words, that cover of the song has become as popular as the song itself. And it's far from the only "Scott Pilgrim vs. My GPA" cover racking up hundreds of thousands of views. </p><blockquote class="tiktok-embed" data-video-id="7442078479304183071" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;">

<p>Every TikTok in this article is from the last month or so, and it feels as if the viral moment for the song is hitting its crescendo &mdash; basically, the moment the horns come in on "Scott Pilgrim vs. My GPA." </p><p>So if you enjoy this kind of music, you might see covers on your FYP for a bit longer. But soon enough, it stands to reason, you'll be looking back on this moment fondly. If only there were a song for that. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>My love for coffee began in college. Not only did caffeine fuel my studies, I started working as a barista during my sophomore year. I learned a ton about coffee during my time there because not only did we pull creamy espresso shots all day long, we roasted our own coffee beans. Coffee roasting is pretty magical (and precise) art that led me deep into the world of coffee, flavors, and what makes it taste so good.</p><p>While I no longer work at a coffee shop, the lessons remain: good coffee requires good equipment. (You'll also need good beans but that's an entire TED talk). Coffee is a particular thing, and while it might seem that all coffee makers and espresso machines could do the job just fine, that's not really the case. If you're looking to make coffee-house quality drinks at home, these are the deals I recommend buying at Amazon this week.</p><h2>Best espresso machine deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row pogoClear">

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>Coffee is very picky about water temperature which is why many drip coffee makers don't do the beans justice. If you're in the mood for some drip coffee that's full of flavor and neither under or over brewed, Moccamaster makes some of the most impressive machines. Thanks to today's deal at Amazon, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/ao5AmY?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Technivorm%20Moccamaster%20Coffee%20Brewer%20with%20a%2040-ounce%20thermal%20carafe&object_type=article&object_uuid=01D74GQvhnVylcHIonRJEDC&short_url=ao5AmY&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Technivorm Moccamaster Coffee Brewer with a 40-ounce thermal carafe</a> is on sale for $237.30, down from the typical price of $339. That's a 30% discount and the <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B002S4MUHM" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">lowest price</a> we've ever seen at Amazon on this model. </p><p>With an impressive 40-ounce brewing capacity, the Moccamaster takes as little as four minutes to brew into the thermal stainless steel carafe. That means if you wake up an hour after someone brewed coffee, you'll still be treated to a hot cup.</p><p>The Moccamaster excels when it comes to precise water temperature, using a copper boiling element that heats water to a temperature between 196 and 205 degrees Fahrenheit. Plus, it automatically shuts off once the water reservoir is empty.</p><p>Moccamaster also uses a unique method of coffee extraction that's similar to what you'd get with a pour-over coffee method, which includes an initial blooming of the ground coffee for a better flavor.</p><h2>Best coffee grinder deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row pogoClear">

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>Great coffee beans call for using a great coffee grinder. It's likely the one in your grocery store's coffee aisle isn't all that great. Instead, you'll want a reliable burr grinder which is where the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QrpWlG?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=OXO%20Brew%20Conical%20Burr%20Coffee%20Grinder&object_type=article&object_uuid=01D74GQvhnVylcHIonRJEDC&short_url=QrpWlG&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">OXO Brew Conical Burr Coffee Grinder</a> comes in handy. While the grinder usually costs $99.95, it's on sale at Amazon for just $67.99 which comes within $3 of the <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B07CSKGLMM" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">lowest price</a> we've ever seen at Amazon. To get this sale price, select the silver colorway.</p><p>With 15 grind settings and additional micro-settings, the OXO burr grinder is capable of giving you perfectly ground fresh coffee each day. Go super fine for pulling espresso shots or opt for a coarse grind for the French press. Whichever route you go, the OXO has a large-capacity hopper that can hold 16 ounces of beans. The hopper's UV-blocking tint is also designed to help keep your coffee beans fresh because light is an enemy of roasted coffee beans.</p><p>Inside, stainless steel conical burrs work hard to give you a perfect grind that's uniform in size. The one-touch timer ranges from 1 to 30 seconds, which means you can grind the exact amount you'll need.</p><h3>More coffee deals that are worth your money at Amazon:</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/QVDvgO?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=OXO%20Brew%20Single%20Serve%20Pour-Over%20Coffee%20Maker&object_type=article&object_uuid=01D74GQvhnVylcHIonRJEDC&short_url=QVDvgO&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">OXO Brew Single Serve Pour-Over Coffee Maker</a> &mdash; <strong>$14.39</strong> <s>$17.95</s> (save $3.56)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qm247y?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=AeroPress%20Original%20Coffee%20Maker&object_type=article&object_uuid=01D74GQvhnVylcHIonRJEDC&short_url=Qm247y&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">AeroPress Original Coffee Maker</a> &mdash; <strong>$29.95</strong> <s>$39.95</s> (save $10)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/9YdEVl?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Instant%20Pot%20Milk%20Frother&object_type=article&object_uuid=01D74GQvhnVylcHIonRJEDC&short_url=9YdEVl&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Instant Pot Milk Frother</a> &mdash; <strong>$29.99</strong> <s>$49.99</s> (save $20)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/QWdVWW?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=OXO%20Brew%20Rapid%20Brewer&object_type=article&object_uuid=01D74GQvhnVylcHIonRJEDC&short_url=QWdVWW&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">OXO Brew Rapid Brewer</a> &mdash; <strong>$31.99</strong> <s>$39.95</s> (save $7.96)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/9ywdkw?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Bialetti%20Moka%20Express%20%286%20cups%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=01D74GQvhnVylcHIonRJEDC&short_url=9ywdkw&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Bialetti Moka Express (6 cups)</a> &mdash; <strong>$37.13</strong> <s>$50</s> (save $12.87)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/QKDro8?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=OXO%20Good%20Grips%20Cold%20Brew%20Coffee%20Maker&object_type=article&object_uuid=01D74GQvhnVylcHIonRJEDC&short_url=QKDro8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">OXO Good Grips Cold Brew Coffee Maker</a> &mdash; <strong>$41.59</strong> <s>$51.95</s> (save $10.36)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/QddjVj?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Nespresso%20Vertuo%20Next&object_type=article&object_uuid=01D74GQvhnVylcHIonRJEDC&short_url=QddjVj&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Nespresso Vertuo Next</a> &mdash; <strong>$104.99</strong> <s>$179.95</s> (save $74.96)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/9g37p8?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=KitchenAid%20Fully%20Automatic%20Espresso%20Machine&object_type=article&object_uuid=01D74GQvhnVylcHIonRJEDC&short_url=9g37p8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">KitchenAid Fully Automatic Espresso Machine</a> &mdash; <strong>$899.99</strong> <s>$1,199.99</s> (save $300)</p></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

Copilot Vision is your AI companion that can visually process what you're browsing and help you out along the way. </p><p>On Thursday, Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/?p=3831&amp;preview=true&amp;_thumbnail_id=3834" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">announced</a> a preview version of Copilot Vision for Copilot Pro subscribers. Microsoft introduced Vision in October as a solution to the problem that users have to explain what they're seeing to Copilot. </p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Vision sits on the bottom of your Microsoft Edge browser and, when enabled, "it sees the page you're on, it reads along with you, and you can talk through the problem you're facing together." </p><p>Vision is one of the first features to debut in Copilot Labs, its testing ground for AI projects. Labs, which has a noticeably softer and warmer look is Microsoft's way of sharing "works-in-progress" geared towards helping users with everyday tasks. </p><p>One demo shows Copilot Vision helping a user find the right place to stay, another helps a user make sense of photos of their grandmother's handwritten recipes. It can also help you out in a Minecraft game or with holiday shopping by pointing out the right products on the page. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

<h2>How Copilot Vision handles privacy</h2><p>If Copilot Vision reminds you of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/recall-ai-microsoft-black-mirror" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Windows Recall</a>, Microsoft's "<a href="https://mashable.com/article/windows-recall-microsoft" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">privacy nightmare</a>" tool that consistently takes screenshots of your computer screen, there are several key differences. First, Vision is opt-in, so you can choose if you want to use it. Second, as soon as you end the session, you Copilot conversation is deleted. That said, "only Copilot&rsquo;s responses are logged to improve our safety systems," read the announcement. </p><p>Microsoft has also thought through some of the sticky issues of web browsing when it comes to paywalled and sensitive information. Vision only works with a select set of websites for now, and it is programmed to "to not provide responses based on paywalled content," according to its FAQs page. </p><p>Crucially, Microsoft says Copilot Vision does not store or use any publisher content to train its models. Microsoft also says Vision "honors website controls for usage of their content by Copilot," which presumably means sites with robots.txt code that block web crawlers. Mashable has reached out to Microsoft for further clarification of Vision's data controls and will update this story with a response.</p><p>Starting today, Copilot Vision is rolling out to a limited set of Copilot Pro subscribers. A Copilot Pro subscription costs $20 a month.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>We're huge fans of the Lego Icons Botanical collection, but like most Lego sets, they can get pretty expensive. In other words, when we see a good deal, it's always worth highlighting. As of Dec. 5, the Lego Icons Poinsettia building kit is down to just $34.99 from $49.99. That's 30% in savings and a new low price. The 608-piece set builds out into a realistic Lego interpretation of a Grande Italia poinsettia plant inside a woven basket flowerpot. You can pose the flowers however you desire and use the finished product as a centerpiece for your holiday celebrations. No maintenance required.</p><h2>Shark SmoothStyle</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row pogoClear">

<p>Essentially a fancier version of <a href="https://mashable.com/review/revlon-one-step" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Revlon's One-Step</a>, the Shark SmoothStyle serves as a round hot air brush that can take your hair from wet to styled without frying it. Starting with your hair wet, you can use the three preset air temperatures to dry and style. Once it's dry, use it like a thermal brush, with one preset heated smoothing comb setting. The comb itself has ceramic-coated plates to prevent damage to your locks. It's typically $100, but you can still get it for $69 at Amazon post-Cyber Monday. That's 31% in savings and its best price ever. Plus, you'll get a $2.60 Amazon credit with your purchase.</p><h2>Bose SoundLink Flex </h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row pogoClear">

<p>The small-but-mighty SoundLink Flex got an upgrade earlier this fall, making the go anywhere portable speaker even better. It features the same rugged texture, waterproof and UV light resistant build, up to 12-hour battery life, and bold sound as its predecessor. However, the latest generation streamlined the controls and offers customizable EQ in the Bose app. It's usually $149, but you can snag it on sale for $119 at Amazon as of Dec. 5. That's a 20% price drop &mdash; its first discount since its September release.</p><h2>Amazon Fire HD 10</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row pogoClear">

<p>If you're looking for a no frills tablet to browse the web, watch your favorite shows, answer some emails, or read on the go, the Amazon Fire HD 10 is still sitting at its best-ever Black Friday price. Mashable reviewer SaVanna Shoemaker says it's "lighter and faster than its predecessors, with a long battery life and vivid picture that makes it great for on-the-go entertainment." It's regularly pretty affordable at $139.99, but as of Dec. 5, you can slash the cost by 46% and pick it up for only $74.99.</p><p><a href="https://mashable.com/review/amazon-fire-hd-10-2023-release" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Check out our full review of the Amazon Fire HD 10</em></a>.</p><h2>AeroGarden Harvest 2.0</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row pogoClear">

<p>Want to try growing your own herbs and veggies? The AeroGarden Harvest 2.0 is down to only $45 at Amazon, its lowest price on record, making it 50% more affordable for the curious home gardener. It's just 10.6 inches wide and 16.4 inches tall (including the adjustable light height), so it doesn't demand a ton of counter space. However, it has enough room to grow six different plants using its hydroponic system. You don't need to buy soil or nutrients; it comes with liquid plant food and otherwise just requires water. The second-generation Harvest model also features a one-button control nutrient reminder and a detachable 15W grow light.</p><p><em>None of these deals catching your eye?

<p>In 2024, Grindr users sent over 130 billion chats and almost 10 billion taps, according to the app's data. Grindr also surveyed 10,000 worldwide users on questions ranging from sex position of the year to mother of the year, and here's what it found:</p><p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/sex-positions" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Missionary</a> won sex position of the year, with backshots (from behind), 69, side, and spooning rounding out the top five. Kissing was Grindr users' favorite foreplay activity of 2024, followed by oral (if you count oral sex as foreplay...), rimming, "hand stuff," and frotting (penis-to-penis rubbing). </p><p>As for mother of the year, Charli XCX won over Lady Gaga, Beyonc&eacute;, Celine Dion, and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/chappell-roan-pop-star-tiktok-viral" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Chappell Roan</a>.

<p>Sick and tired of bog-standard biopics? Well, let Robbie Williams and company entertain you with a rags-to-riches musical biography that plays like <em>Billy Elliot </em>meets <a href="https://mashable.com/article/rocketman-elton-john-analysis" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Rocketman</em></a> meets <em>Planet of the Apes</em>.</p><p>The English pop icon not only provides a cheeky narration to <em>Better Man, </em>but he also embraces <em>The Greatest Showman </em>director Michael Gracey's wild idea to transform its central subject from bad boy to rowdy chimpanzee. Actor Jonno Davies (<em>Hunters</em>) and the W&#275;t&#257; FX team collaborate to create a portrait of Williams that is as outrageous as it is riveting. </p><p>But that's not all. <em>Better Man </em>also boasts extraordinary musical numbers that combine Williams' hits with spirited choreography and awe-inspiring staging that turns everything from double-decker buses, glamorous yachts, and dodgy drug dens into a stage fit for a king of showmanship.

<p>Craving some kick-butt comedy?

The film's first teaser gave a sense of the kind of fight scenes, family funniness, and enthralling chemistry its headliners share. It's a fine-looking movie, but it's especially exhilarating to see Diaz and Foxx back on screen. </p><p><strong>Starring: </strong>Jamie Foxx, Cameron Diaz, Kyle Chandler, Andrew Scott, Jamie Demetriou, McKenna Roberts, Rylan Jackson, and Glenn Close</p><p><strong>How to watch:<em> </em></strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qm2ZVy?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Back%20in%20Action%20debuts%20on%20Netflix%20Jan.%2017.&object_type=article&object_uuid=05nEybyOoW4rbsHJR7JMllg&short_url=Qm2ZVy&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Back in Action </em>debuts on Netflix Jan. 17.</a></p><h2>One of Them Days</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

<p>How far would you go to be beautiful or fit in? Director Sasha Rainbow chases this question down in the grisly horror-thriller <em>Grafted. </em></p><p>This stomach-churning story of self-discovery (and self-destruction) begins with Wei (Joyena Sun), a Chinese student who travels to New Zealand on a scholarship to pursue medical research. There, she is beguiled by her popular cousin Angela (Jess Hong) and her friends, but is swiftly shunned because of her social awkwardness and a facial difference that she views as a curse.

<p>Neil Burger (<em>Limitless, Divergent</em>) helms an espionage thriller about the ties that bind (and maybe suffocate). </p><p>After the death of her mother, a young woman named Maya (Phoebe Dynevor) sees her estranged dad (Rhys Ifans) re-enter her life. But it's more a business proposition than a loving father-daughter moment. As seen in the trailer above, he offers her a gig as a spy, and when he goes missing, she finds herself on the run, trapped in a web of subterfuge, globe-trekking, and conspiracy.

<p>Soderbergh himself shoulders the camera, providing a first-person (or first-spirit) point of view for the whole of <em>Presence</em>. As I wrote in <a href="https://mashable.com/article/presence-review-steven-soderbergh" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">my review</a> out of TIFF, "<em>Presence </em>is extraordinary for all it tells through its moving camerawork alone."</p><p>The film follows a family whose interpersonal dramas fascinate the unseen and unheard (but not unfelt!) presence that floats among them. Who is the ghost? What does it have to do with the often-bickering family of four? <em>Presence </em>will reveal its secrets in theaters. </p><p><strong>Starring:</strong> Lucy Liu, Julia Fox, Callina Liang, Eddy Maday, West Mulholland, and Chris Sullivan</p><p><strong>How to watch:</strong> <a href="https://zdcs.link/QbnOnx?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Presence%20opens%20in%20theaters%20Jan.%2024.&object_type=article&object_uuid=05nEybyOoW4rbsHJR7JMllg&short_url=QbnOnx&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Presence </em>opens in theaters Jan. 24.</a></p><h2>You're Cordially Invited</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

<p>Josh Ruben has steadily been carving out a name for himself in horror-comedies. In 2020, he wrote, directed, and starred in the clever and creepy anthology offering <em>Scare Me </em>alongside the enchantingly smirking Aya Cash. The following year he unleashed <em>Werewolves Within</em>, a lupine whodunnit filled with comedy notables. Now, he's taking aim at Valentine's Day with the slasher <em>Heart Eyes. </em></p><p>The film's first teaser gives a glimpse of the titular killer, along with some of the tropes it'll hit &mdash;&nbsp;like a lovers' lane slaying. But chiefly, this preview gives a great sense of the gore in store and a glimpse at Ruben's sick sense of humor.

With Mortensen essentially cornered, Crealy inflicts on him a twisted game he calls "the Rule of Jenny Pen," employing an odd doll as an instrument of torment.

They're rebooting <em>Naked Gun. </em>And if you &mdash;&nbsp;like me &mdash;&nbsp;grew up with the dynamically dopey Leslie Nielsen as Detective Sergeant Frank Drebin, you might be dubious of any attempt at recasting. To that I say: They got Liam Neeson.

In <em>The Lego Movie, </em>he expertly pivoted between voicing the two-faced Good Cop/Bad Cop. In <em>Derry Girls, </em>he played Chief Constable Byers, who was befuddled by the rants of the annoying Uncle Colm. And if you want to go way back, he played a horny, homicidal, and hilarious ghost in 1988's haunted house comedy <em>High Spirits. </em>Simply put, we're optimistic about this curious comedic reboot. </p><p><strong>Starring:</strong> Liam Neeson, Paul Walter Hauser, Kevin Durand, Pamela Anderson, Danny Huston, and Cody Rhodes</p><p><strong>How to watch:</strong> <em>The Naked Gun </em>opens Aug. 1. </p><h2>Nobody 2 </h2><p>In 2021, <a href="https://mashable.com/video/better-call-saul-bob-odenkirk-ending" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Better Call Saul</em></a> star Bob Odenkirk turned action hero in <em>Nobody</em>, a dark comedy about a former assassin turned office worker who falls back into that violent life &mdash;&nbsp;whether he likes it or not.

<p>So, how exactly do we "date forward"? Hinge's director of relationship science Logan Ury says it's all about prioritising quality over quantity. </p><p>According to a new survey by the company, 47 percent of Hinge daters say that going on more dates is their top dating goal for 2025. But, as anyone who's been on a dating app lately will know, the real challenge lies in turning matches into conversations, then converting those chats into real-life dates. That's not even mentioning the journey that ensues once you've connected IRL. </p><h2>Hinge's five tips for dating forward in 2025</h2><h3>Focus on the present</h3><p>73 percent of Hinge daters admit to overthinking past dating experiences. Hinge wants daters to refocus their attention to present and future dating experiences. </p><h3>Set yourself dating goals</h3><p>When you're spending a decent chunk of time on the apps, it's useful to think about what you want to get out of that. 42 percent of Hinge daters say they need to set clearer intentions for what they're looking for. </p><h3>Prioritise quality matches over quantity</h3><p>Stop racking up matches with no intention of talking to people. Instead, try slowing things down and evaluating each match before turning back to scrolling through profiles. Hinge introduced <a href="https://mashable.com/article/hinge-your-turn-limit-feature-cap-on-unanswered-messages" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Your Turn Limits in 2024</a> to cap the number of unanswered messages in a bid to beat dating fatigue. If you have too many pending replies, the feature will ask you to respond to or end those conversations before connecting with new people. </p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h3>Meet ASAP </h3><p>Many of us know how it feels to get <a href="https://mashable.com/article/online-dating-apps-pen-pal-messaging" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">stuck in a pen pal situationship</a> with someone who has no intention of meeting you in person. Chat to someone too long and you can quickly lose interest in meeting up. Hinge research has found that three days of chatting is the "sweet spot to ask someone out." </p><h3>Plan activity-based dates </h3><p>Gone are the days of boring dates that feel like job interviews. Why not plan a date around an activity you find fulfilling? If the date goes well: great. But if it doesn't: you still had fun and got to do an enjoyable activity. 31 percent of Hinge daters think that planning dates that centre around activities they like would help them stay focused on dating. You could try going to museums, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/offline-dating-event-life-drawing" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">art classes</a>, or an event where you try your hand at a new skill. </p><p>Go forth and date forward. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As you can see from the chart above by blockchain data analytics visualiser Bubblemaps, $HAWK spiked to a market cap of almost $500 million just minutes after its launch, before dumping down just as quickly again. At the time of writing the coin has a market cap of $36.6 million. In short, most people who bought the coin in those opening hours have lost money on it.</p><h2>What has Haliey Welch said about $HAWK?</h2><p>Welch and the overHere team attempted damage control in the hours after the launch, saying that "Haliey's team has sold absolutely no tokens whatsoever" and <a href="https://twitter.com/HalieyWelchX/status/1864448384326881713" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">trying to place the blame on snipers</a> (people who use bots to quickly buy tokens at the cheapest price possible).

<p>As someone who picked up an LG C4 TV for themselves this year, it's worth every penny. Games look stunning and smooth on it and movie nights are unbeatable when it comes to the OLED display and 4K resolution. I recently re-watched <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> trilogy and let me tell you, those films look even more gorgeous on this OLED. Filmmaker Mode really made them shine, as did Dolby Atmos for excellent sound.</p><p>Deals like this likely won't stick around for long as we inch closer to the holidays, though. So, if you want to jump into OLED with a smaller display for your home, have a look at this <a href="https://zdcs.link/aMvZyL?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=42-inch%20LG%20C4%20deal%20at%20Best%20Buy&object_type=article&object_uuid=06ysI2VoRjlET5EXCwynFNS&short_url=aMvZyL&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">42-inch LG C4 deal at Best Buy</a>.</p><p>While some of the bigger deals may have gone by now, there are still a few hanging on after Cyber Monday.

      <description><![CDATA[The best treadmills for your home gym, including models from top brands like Peloton and NordicTrack.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/roundups/016EJNxFgsmPO7V76zBdacr/hero-image.png" alt="person walking on treadmill"><p><em>This content originally appeared on Mashable for a US audience and has been adapted for the UK audience.</em></p><p>We all love a bit of <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-ellipticals-for-your-home-gym-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">exercise gear</a> around the house. Especially now that so many of us are still working from home and living more sedentary lifestyles.</p><p>But there&rsquo;s one exercise machine that&rsquo;s still daunting: the terrifying treadmill. Maybe it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re big, bulky, and there&rsquo;s no escape once you&rsquo;re on them, but the treadmill has always been the scariest of all exercise equipment. Modern home treadmills, however, are actually sleek, smart, and interactive.</p><p>Whether you&rsquo;re looking to do some interval workouts or simply reach the highest level of calorie burn, this new class of fitness equipment has the lot: sound systems, tablet holders, compatibility with fitness apps, advanced heart rate monitoring, and more. </p><h2>What are the health benefits of a treadmill?</h2><p>Having a treadmill at home means all the benefits of good cardio &mdash; improved cardiovascular health, calories burnt, weight loss, low blood pressure, improved sleep, and more. A good quality treadmill will also take it easy on your joints, with a design that absorbs impact. That means <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-massage-guns-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">fewer injuries</a> that you might pick up from running on regular streets. It&rsquo;s not only health benefits, of course. Treadmills are hugely convenient, making it easier to workout whenever you like, and modern tech features allow you to customise workout your specific fitness needs.</p><h2>How big is a treadmill?</h2><p>That&rsquo;s perhaps the biggest question of all when it comes to treadmills. Because you only have so much space, and they&rsquo;re not exactly small &mdash; though they&rsquo;re also not necessarily as big and cumbersome as you might think. The average treadmill is just under two metres long and just under a metre wide. If you are struggling for space, consider a foldable model. That means you can store it away between workouts.</p><h2>What are most important features on a treadmill?</h2><p>Most modern treadmills come with some kind of console and/or display screen. This is where it feeds back vital info to keep track of your performance and progress &mdash; stats such as calories burned, heart rate, distance, and speed. Available stats will vary depending on how expensive and advanced the treadmill is. </p><p>More advanced treadmills will also connect to smart devices via Bluetooth and sync with fitness apps &mdash; or have a tablet-style screen that links to live workout classes, as made popular by <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-peloton-alternatives-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Peloton exercise bikes</a>. If they don&rsquo;t have screens, let&rsquo;s not overlook how important it is to have some sort of clip or holder for securing a tablet, just in case you need distracting with your favourite show to get through those last few miles. Other key features include different levels of incline.</p><h2>What is manual and automatic incline?</h2><p>Here&rsquo;s a term that might confuse you if you&rsquo;re a treadmill newbie. Incline is basically how steep the running deck is. Using an increasingly steep incline helps burn more calories and build muscle. Some models have a manual incline, which means you change it with a lever &mdash; this is more common on budget models. Automatic incline is activated by a simple press of a button, which you can pump up or down depending on how intense you want your workout to be.  </p><h2>How much does a treadmill cost? </h2><p>This all depends on the quality you&rsquo;re looking to buy. If you want a basic model that folds away into the downstairs cupboard, you can pick one up for under &pound;200. But if you&rsquo;re looking to get serious about state-of-the-art tech and high quality design, you can spend into the thousands. This list includes a range of price points. Spend as little (or as much) as required to suit your fitness needs.</p><h2>What is the best treadmill?</h2><p>The answer, ultimately, is whatever suits your home and workout style. In order to find the best options for you, we have scoured the web for write-ups and left no treadmill review unread. Whether you want a heavy-duty piece of training equipment or are thinking of exploring folding treadmills to find a rainy-day fit, we&rsquo;ve got suggestions in your price range.</p><p>These are the best home treadmills for 2024.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA["Stardew Valley" creator ConcernedApe checked in on the latest update to his next game "Haunted Chocolatier".]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/02wEa524xLpvObJacrKOHwD/hero-image.png" alt="A scene from "Haunted Chocolatier" showing the titular chocolatier's home with rows of vegetables."><p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/stardew-valley-cookbook-recipe" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Stardew Valley</em></a> fans, there's been an update on the developer's highly awaited next <a href="https://mashable.com/category/gaming" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">game</a>, <em>Haunted Chocolatier</em>. But before you get too excited, remember these things take a SquidFest's worth of work to create.</p><p>The farming/role-playing game's designer, Eric Barone, who works under under the alias ConcernedApe, published a <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/2024/12/04/update/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">blog post</a> on Wednesday checking in about <em>Haunted Chocolatier</em>'s development and reminding fans that it takes time to make a game like this from scratch &mdash; and notably solo.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

        </a>
    </div>
<p>Barone said he'd been working on the recently released <a href="https://mashable.com/article/stardew-valley-update-details" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Stardew Valley</em></a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/stardew-valley-update-details" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"> 1.6 update, originally announced in April 2023</a>, which meant he had to bench <em>Haunted Chocolatier </em>for a moment as he added new content and fixed bugs. But the developer said he has "created a 'vertical slice' of <em>Haunted Chocolatier</em>, essentially a skeleton of the game with most (not all) of its bones in place."</p><p>"It&rsquo;s been a little sad to see <em>Haunted Chocolatier </em>getting dusty on the shelf&hellip; but this is the reality of my situation," he wrote. "<em>Stardew Valley</em> is a big and popular game, and I have a lot of attachment to it. I also feel a strong sense of duty and obligation to all the people who have bought <em>Stardew Valley</em> over the years, granting me this rare opportunity to be an indie game developer. So it&rsquo;s hard to 'let go' of <em>Stardew</em>, even temporarily, to work on something that isn&rsquo;t already established and meaningful to people."</p><p>For fans, Barone shared a little of the "vertical slice" he's created so far for <em>Haunted Chocolatier</em>, with screenshots he noted were "'work in progress' and likely to change before release." Barone is coding the game himself in the Microsoft platform C# (as <em>Stardew Valley</em> was) and entirely from scratch.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>In the post, you can see an adorable hovering ghost character, a scene showing the titular chocolatier's home with rows of vegetables suggesting that requisite farming element, a scene showing the player fighting off a giant horde of incoming pink and purple blobs with a sword (Barone has <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/2021/10/30/combat-shields-stuns-my-approach/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">previously said</a> the game will have "a greater focus on combat" than <em>Stardew</em>), an inventory menu, and two characters (one with purple hair, one blonde). </p><p>These are just the latest additions to the sneak peeks we've seen in <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/media/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">ConcernedApe's existing screenshots which you can check out on the website</a>.

    <div id="video-container-kJy7LF789lo"></div>
</div>


<p>Barone explained there will be no preorders, crowdfunding, or early access of any kind with <em>Haunted Chocolatier</em>, "so I don&rsquo;t feel a ton of external pressure to finish the game on a timeline. The major source of external pressure is the fact I announced the game kind of early (I had my reasons for doing this), which built up excitement, meaning that if I take a long time, people might become sad. And that is a real pressure to me. But ultimately, I will not release a game unless it is complete and I am very happy with it, and I think that&rsquo;s what most people would want, anyway."</p><p>Enjoy the snippet and head back to your cauliflowers, folks.

<p>Not only are these earbuds great for listening to podcasts, music, and audiobooks, but I really love the active noise cancelation. Sometimes while I'm working I'll just put on noise cancelation to help me focus. And for when I need to keep an ear out for what's going on around me, especially if I'm traveling, Transparency mode works wonders so I can hear what's happening around me without skipping a beat.</p><p>Our <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-airpods-pro-2-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">review</a> said, "The AirPods Pro (2nd generation) are a great pair of wireless earbuds.

<h2>What is Connections?</h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

    </a>
</blockquote>
<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer.</p><p>If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple.

<p>I've reviewed my share of TVs, but this <a href="https://zdcs.link/ao5Agl?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%2065-inch%20Q80C%20QLED%204K%20Smart%20TV%20deal&object_type=article&object_uuid=04qrPwOlz8MYcHyMLbg6W5X&short_url=ao5Agl&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung 65-inch Q80C QLED 4K Smart TV deal</a> gives buyers bang for their buck. It's available at Walmart for $748 &mdash; a hefty $250 off its regular price. This is a steal for anyone looking for a mid-range price tag and flagship performance.</p><p>A Direct Full Array QLED display means solid contrast, even in rooms filled with natural light. Watching a movie? You'll notice the difference. Gaming? The Motion Xcelerator Turbo+ keeps every frame smooth and sharp up to 4K 120Hz. And for streaming or live TV, its Neural Quantum Processor ensures every scene is rendered in crisp detail.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>The Quantum HDR+ sealed the deal for me. It brings colors to life, delivering theater-level brightness and depth to your favorite shows and movies. Pair that with Dolby Atmos&trade; sound, and you'll feel right in the action. The same goes for gaming on consoles and PCs that support it.</p><p>I also love how this TV is designed for modern living. There's a built-in Gaming Hub (no console required) or the SolarCell Remote that charges itself; Samsung has thought of everything. Plus, features like ConnecTime makes taking video calls from your big screen easy. RememberDon't that Samsung TVs have the Game Pass app built in, which means cloud gaming without an Xbox console.

<h2>What is Connections Sports Edition?</h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has launched in association with <em>The Athletic</em>, the New York Times property that provides the publication's sports coverage. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer.</p><p>If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple.

Words can be made from linked letters &mdash; up, down, left, right, or diagonal, but words can also change direction, resulting in quirky shapes and patterns. Every single letter in the grid will be part of an answer. There's always a theme linking every solution, along with the "spangram," a special, word or phrase that sums up that day's theme, and spans the entire grid horizontally or vertically.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>By providing an opaque hint and not providing the word list, Strands creates a brain-teasing game that takes a little longer to play than its other games, like <a href="https://mashable.com/category/wordle" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Wordle</a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/category/connections" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Connections</a>.</p><p>If you're feeling stuck or just don't have 10 or more minutes to figure out today's puzzle, we've got all the NYT Strands hints for today's puzzle you need to progress at your preferred pace.</p><div class="flex mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

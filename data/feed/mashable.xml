In a statement on <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-members-who-work-video-games-go-strike" target="_blank">its website</a>, SAG-AFTRA said, with no uncertainty, that artificial intelligence protections are the "sticking point." </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse A.I. to the detriment of our members," union president Fran Drescher said in the statement. "Enough is enough. When these companies get serious about offering an agreement our members can live &mdash; and work &mdash; with, we will be here, ready to negotiate."</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>In a statement to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24206352/sag-aftra-video-game-performer-strike-ea-disney-activision" target="_blank">Polygon</a>, a spokesperson for the gaming companies' side Audrey Cooling claimed the AI terms that SAG-AFTRA did not agree to are "among the strongest in the entertainment industry." According to Cooling, the two sides have agreed to 24 of 25 contract proposals, leaving AI as the final nail to be hammered down.</p><p>While the exact contract language that both sides have been trying to agree to for the last 18 months is not public, the issue is familiar to anyone who has followed AI and the arts in recent years. Put simply, voice actors and motion capture performers are worried that, without proper labor protections, video game companies could use their work to train AI models that could then replace their labor. </p><p>As the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/25/artificial-intelligence-sagaftra-ai-video-games/d01249ae-4abc-11ef-9149-c75da5dd9201_story.html" target="_blank">Washington Post</a> also pointed out, the use of AI could negatively impact young performers who are trying to break into the industry. If the kinds of background, non-player character roles that usually go to those people were instead relegated to AI, it may be harder to break into the industry. </p><p>It's worth noting that SAG-AFTRA <a href="https://mashable.com/article/sag-aftra-ai-voiceover-agreement-video-games-ces-2024" target="_self">struck a side deal</a> with an AI company earlier this year, so the union has not been inherently opposed to AI up to this point.</p><p>This is not the first time SAG-AFTRA's gaming workers have gone on strike. In 2016, voice actors started a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/voice-actor-strike" target="_self">work stoppage</a> that lasted almost an entire year. That particular strike had more to do with "old" problems like bonuses, royalties, and worker safety than new, rapidly developing technology. In other words, it could theoretically be a while before these two sides come to an agreement.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This year's entry in this long-running annual show coincides with the warmest nights and early mornings of the year in the Northern Hemisphere, which will be a good one.&nbsp;</p><p>2024's display comes with impressive &mdash; possibly even blockbuster &mdash; viewing conditions.&nbsp;</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>Exactly what are the Perseids?</h2><p>The Perseid meteor shower is our planet's annual run-in with the trail of debris left behind by a comet called 109P/Swift-Tuttle, which, like us, is orbiting the sun, but on a different course that happens to intersect with ours. As the Earth orbits through this trail of tiny granules called meteoroids, they slam into our atmosphere at blistering speeds and ignite. The meteoroids become what we call meteors only for a moment, during their spectacular deaths.&nbsp;</p><p>This all happens about 60 miles above your head during your meteor-gazing session. For reference, the moon is roughly 24,000 miles away, and Mirfak, the brightest star in the constellation Perseus, is 510 light-years away. The meteors are very close, in other words &mdash; so close that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/13/us/meteor-salt-lake-city-boom.html" target="_blank">you can sometimes hear them.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle, with its 16-mile-wide nucleus, is colossal &mdash; the largest object known to repeatedly pass by our planet, which it won't do again until 2126. Will this giant ever smash into Earth? Not in 2126, and possibly not ever. But <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/360623a0.pdf" target="_blank">there's a tiny chance it could &mdash; catastrophically &mdash; at some indeterminate point in the distant future</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>When to catch the Perseids at their peak in 2024</h2><p>The show will crescendo, with 100 meteors per hour sometimes visible, in the pre-dawn hours of August 12.</p><p>For best results, stay up late the night of Sunday, August 11, and into the early hours of Monday, or look up when the sky is dark any time until the end of August. Viewing conditions depend on how dim the moon is, and in 2024 we're in luck: it will only be at 50 percent illumination at the peak. It's also set to dip below the horizon around midnight, meaning the wee hours of the morning will be essentially moonless for your meteor viewing pleasure.&nbsp;</p><p>As always, the moon's precise schedule differs depending on where you are, so <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/usa" target="_blank">check your local listings</a>.</p><p>It's worth noting that as one of the more drawn-out meteor displays, the Perseids linger for well over a month every year, meaning activity is visible from mid-July to late August. Peak activity is when you'll theoretically see the most meteors, assuming favorable moon and weather conditions, but any clear night during the shower's active period is a chance to see the Perseids. For instance, the new moon on August 4 will darken the skies, providing another possible opportunity for great off-peak viewing.&nbsp;</p><h2>How to spot the Perseids in 2024</h2><p>The Perseids get their name from the fact that they appear to radiate from the constellation Perseus. This can be a little deceptive, however, because you don't have to worry about finding Perseus; meteors seem to streak across the whole sky during a shower. Pointing out Perseus during your viewing session will make you the hand-raising, A+ student of your stargazing party &mdash; but it probably won't help anyone see more meteors.&nbsp;</p><p>For optimum viewing, get to a dark location away from city lights. Even suburban or exurban lights can pollute the precious darkness, so get to the deep wilderness if you can. Give your pupils about 30 minutes to widen, initiating your body's too-seldom-used night vision mode. Telescopes and binoculars are fun but unnecessary, or even counterproductive since they limit your peripheral vision.&nbsp;</p><p>But I'm making this too complicated. Is it your first time stargazing in a while? Just do what they do in movies: lie back on a blanket, relax, and stare up at the dang sky.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

The robot collected a sample, and inside scientists spotted a telltale composition that suggests the <em>potential</em> of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/mars-life-survive-bacteria-space" target="_self">ancient microbial life</a>. "The rock exhibits chemical signatures and structures that could possibly have been formed by life billions of years ago when the area being explored by the rover contained running water," NASA said in a <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-perseverance-rover-scientists-find-intriguing-mars-rock" target="_blank">statement</a>. But, crucially, much more research, over many years, is needed to confirm this possibility.</p><p>Indeed, regions on <a href="https://mashable.com/article/mars-nasa-image-spacecraft" target="_self">Mars</a> once gushed with water, with <a href="https://mashable.com/article/mars-nasa-rover-river-water" target="_self">roaring rivers</a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nasa-mars-water-video" target="_self">expansive lakes</a>.

<p>In the image below, you can see the novel Martian structures NASA scientists observed in this rock. They're white splotches surrounded by black halos dubbed "leopard spots."</p><p>"These spots are a big surprise," David Flannery, an astrobiologist at the Queensland University of Technology and member of the Perseverance science team, said in a statement. "On Earth, these types of features in rocks are often associated with the fossilized record of microbes living in the subsurface."</p><p>That's quite an intriguing connection. These spots are formed by chemical reactions on <a href="https://mashable.com/article/earth-unique-alien-life" target="_self">Earth</a>, which can release iron and phosphate (an important nutrient), and supply microbes with energy. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>NASA planetary scientists are certainly excited. </p><p>"As a rock geek/scientist and as the Director of @NASAJPL &mdash; this is the kind of discovery you hope for &mdash; where mind-bending observations make your heart beat just a little faster," NASA's Laurie Leshin <a href="https://x.com/LaurieofMars/status/1816572464421589010" target="_blank">posted online</a>. </p><p>"This is more than intriguing, it&rsquo;s really exciting! We must bring that sample to Earth for analysis in our best labs!" Rosaly Lopes, a senior research scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, <a href="https://x.com/rosaly_lopes/status/1816552522171183117" target="_blank">wrote</a>.</p><p>But, of course, the space agency has also tempered expectations until more is known. Non-biological processes could have created the leopard splotches, such as mineral deposits from past flows of water. In the announcement, the agency included the helpful graphic below, showing the Confidence of Life Detection scale, or CoLD. With this detection, NASA is at number one. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>And, crucially, to move up the scale, the sample (from a rock named Cheyava Falls) must be closely analyzed in labs on Earth, with far more instruments than the distant, car-sized rover can carry. This can prove if non-biological factors actually formed the structures, confirm the presence of past life, rule out other hypotheses, and beyond. NASA's <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nasa-mars-sample-return-status" target="_self">Mars Sample Return</a> mission, however, is in jeopardy. It would cost around $11 billion, a price the <a href="https://mashable.com/category/space" target="_self">space</a> agency can't afford. The agency now seeks a financially feasible plan for the complex endeavor, which would retrieve samples and rocket them back to Earth.</p><p>Until then, these compelling structures will largely remain just that.</p><p>"We have <a href="https://mashable.com/article/mars-sounds-perservance-rover" target="_self">zapped that rock with lasers</a> and X-rays and imaged it literally day and night from just about every angle imaginable," said Perseverance project scientist Ken Farley. "Scientifically, Perseverance has nothing more to give. To fully understand what really happened in that Martian river valley at Jezero Crater billions of years ago, we'd want to bring the Cheyava Falls sample back to Earth, so it can be studied with the powerful instruments available in laboratories."</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03WoGL9Cm0GkMjQmwUrgo2P/hero-image.jpg" alt="A Greenland shark swimming in ocean."><p>There are <a href="https://mashable.com/article/greenland-shark-discovered-caribbean" target="_self">Greenland sharks</a> older than the United States.</p><p>This <a href="https://mashable.com/article/deep-sea-ocean-discovery-2023" target="_self">deep sea</a> species has an expected lifespan of at least 270 years. Some may live longer than 500 years. And biologists have identified an important reason for their impressive longevity. The sharks, an Arctic species dwelling thousands of feet underwater, do not age like other <a href="https://mashable.com/article/extinct-species-animals-2023" target="_self">animals</a>: Their metabolisms should slow as they grow older, resulting in cellular changes. But the researchers' analysis of differently aged Greenlands sharks show their metabolisms don't diminish. They are a biological curiosity.</p><p>"Every detail about this animal is fascinating and the more I find out about them, the further I am motivated to continue my work," Ewan Camplisson, a biologist pursuing a PhD at the University of Manchester, told Mashable.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

        </a>
    </div>
<p>Camplisson presented this new research at the Society for Experimental Biology Annual Conference in July. </p><p>The sharks don't just grow profoundly old. They're also the only shark species capable of living in the frigid Arctic year-round. And that's not all. "They are one of the slowest swimming fish when accounting for size, the females only become sexually reproductive at approximately 150 years old, they have tiny brains yet can seemingly hunt and navigate vast distances, the majority of the population live most of their lives with parasites in their eyes and their flesh is so full of toxins such as TMAO and urea that they are poisonous to eat for humans," Camplisson marveled.</p><p>Scientists have suspected the sharks' extremely slow movement and life in the cold may contribute to the species' unusual age &mdash; and these are likely important factors. But Camplisson noticed that other <a href="https://mashable.com/article/arctic-climate-change" target="_self">Arctic</a> fish species, such as the northern wolffish, also dwell in cold waters, are predatory, and move relatively little. But this fish only lives for some 20 years. Another deep sea species, the dominant <a href="https://mashable.com/article/sixgill-shark-tag-deep-ocean" target="_self">sixgill shark</a>, is predatory, slow-moving, lives in the cold deep sea (but found in oceans around the world), yet lives for 80 years &mdash; <em>not centuries</em>.</p><p>"Therefore we thought that there must be other factors also involved in the Greenland sharks' longevity," Camplisson said.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

        </div>
    </div>
<p>So Camplisson and his team investigated the sharks' metabolism. They used preserved Greenland shark red muscle, from 23 sharks of different ages, to observe how metabolic enzymes would react when activated. The sharks ranged in age from around 60 to 200 years. As illustrated above, the muscle samples were suspended in a liquid that reacted to the enzyme's changes; the more activity, the more shift in color. A machine called a spectrophotometer, which assesses changes in light intensity, measured these changes. And as described earlier, sharks of all ages didn't show signs of any metabolic slowdown. </p><p>It's clear these Arctic <a href="https://mashable.com/article/sharks-chagos-archipelago-population-declines-human-impact" target="_self">sharks</a> live a long time. But it's unclear why. It's possible that gradually growing and maturing for over a century simply sets them up for adult success. </p><p>"My best guess would be that the deep waters of the Arctic can be a challenging environment to live in, where an animal such as the Greenland shark may not have consistent access to plenty of food and they may not frequently be in contact with other Greenland sharks," Camplisson explained, noting they swim slowly in a vast ocean environment. And, crucially, they have few predators. There's not much to stop them from thriving in the depths. "Therefore, as a species with low natural mortality rates, their optimal life strategy would be one of a slow growth and building reserves of energy, so that when they do interact with the opposite sex they are in a suitable condition to reproduce," he said.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

    </div>
<p>Wielding such intriguing research results, Camplisson intends to further analyze these sharks' tissues, and their anti-aging metabolisms. It won't just satisfy deep sea biological curiosity. </p><p>"I believe that if we can work out how the Greenland shark lives so long and how they seem to be so resilient to age related diseases (such as cardiac disease), we may be able to improve the quality of life within the elderly human population," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2><strong>What is really killing U.S. birds</strong></h2><p>A host of human-caused factors kill <a href="https://mashable.com/article/extinct-animals-2023-bird" target="_self">birds</a>. The most damaging, by far, live among us.</p><p>"The worst of these are feral or outdoor pet cats, estimated to kill as many as <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms2380" target="_blank">4 billion birds per year</a>, including many of the backyard songbirds that people value and control our insects," Clark explained. (At minimum, cats probably kill well over 1 billion birds in the U.S. annually.)</p><p>This is why biologists urge people to keep their cats inside. "Just one person keeping their cat indoors can save hundreds, maybe thousands, of birds. That&rsquo;s a no-brainer," bird biologist Nico Arcilla previously told Mashable.</p><p>The next-highest bird killer in the U.S. are buildings (and their windows), estimated to <a href="https://bioone.org/journals/the-condor/volume-116/issue-1/CONDOR-13-090.1/Birdbuilding-collisions-in-the-United-States--Estimates-of-annual/10.1650/CONDOR-13-090.1.full" target="_blank">kill some 365 to 988 million birds</a> each year. "Those kills range from the tiniest hummingbirds to large owls," Clark said. (Here's <a href="https://www.birds.cornell.edu/home/seven-simple-actions-to-help-birds/" target="_blank">how to limit the number of birds</a> that crash into your windows.) And it's not just towering buildings. Any structures or objects in the path of bird flight &mdash; power lines, communication towers, and cars &mdash; contribute to the millions of avian deaths annually, Clark added. Cars kill an estimated 214 million birds each year.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>And then there are innumerable culprits that are difficult to count because they require collecting and assaying bird bodies for toxins. These include rodenticides, agricultural pesticides, water pollution, and beyond. </p><p>Wind turbines, however, are a relatively small player in bird mortality. "Research shows&nbsp;that wind projects rank near the bottom of the list of human-related bird mortalities, resulting in far fewer annual deaths than those caused by house cats, building collisions, or vehicle impacts," the Department of Energy explains. Turbines on land, with huge spinning blades, kill an estimated 234,012 birds annually, <a href="https://www.fws.gov/library/collections/threats-birds" target="_blank">according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</a>.</p><h2><strong>Wind farms limit bird deaths</strong></h2><p>Abundant wind energy, which supplies <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/wind/advantages-and-challenges-wind-energy" target="_blank">125,000 jobs in the U.S.</a> and <a href="https://climate.mit.edu/ask-mit/would-getting-all-our-electricity-wind-and-solar-power-raise-price-electricity" target="_blank">cheap energy</a>, is growing.</p><p>Fortunately, we can build or operate wind farms to curb avian deaths. "There are all sorts of ways that we can limit risks to birds," Jeff Buler, a wildlife ecologist at the University of Delaware, told Mashable.</p><p>This includes locating wind farms away from migratory passages, painting blades black (a visual aid that slashed bird deaths at a Norway wind farm by <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.6592" target="_blank">70 percent</a>), adding sound, and using fewer but larger turbines. Turbines can also be turned off on the handful of nights many birds are migrating through a specific region. Buler and other researchers found that by <a href="https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/conl.12887" target="_blank">observing radar data</a>, the migration of birds through corridors like the Great Lakes region can be well-predicted, allowing turbine operators the ability to temporarily shut down operations. "You can reduce collisions," Buler said.</p><q>
    "It's way easier to make false claims than back up claims with evidence."
    </q>
<p>While wind farms aren't free of environmental costs, they almost certainly kill far fewer birds than the <a href="https://mashable.com/feature/carbon-footprint-pr-campaign-sham" target="_self">fossil fuel sector</a>, which requires intensive mining and burning of fuels.</p><p>"Coal-, oil-, and natural gas-fired power plants induce avian deaths at various points throughout their fuel cycle: upstream during coal mining, onsite collision and electrocution with operating plant equipment, and downstream poisoning and death caused by acid rain, mercury pollution, and climate change," according to a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1943815X.2012.746993#d1e244" target="_blank">research article</a> in the <em>Journal of Integrative Environmental Sciences</em>. The study concludes that "fossil-fueled facilities are about 35 times more dangerous to birds on a per GWh basis than wind energy." (A GWh, or Gigawatt hour, is a measurement unit for the production or consumption of energy.)</p><p>In the coming months and beyond, you're likely to see more misleading claims about renewable energy and a host of other topics. Beware the soundbites and spurious talking points.</p><p>"It's way easier to make false claims than back up claims with evidence," Buler said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Literally who?<em>*</em> &mdash; <em>Angie Han, Deputy Entertainment Editor</em></p><h2><strong>44. Dormammu (<em>Doctor Strange</em>)</strong></h2><p>I still don't entirely understand what Dormammu is, and I don't care. And if you're about to launch into an explanation based on the comics, my point is that the movie doesn't do a good job of explaining what he is or why I should care.<em>*</em> &mdash; <em>A.H.</em></p><h2><strong>43. Ivan Vanko (<em>Iron Man 2</em>)</strong></h2><p>With his gold teeth, thick Russian accent, and pet cockatoo, Vanko is basically a latter-day Johnny Depp character &mdash; and as with most latter-day Johnny Depp characters, there doesn't seem to be anything like an actual person underneath all those tiresome affectations.<em>*</em> &mdash; <em>A.H.</em></p><h2><strong>42. The Dweller-in-Darkness (<em>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings</em>)</strong></h2><p>The Dweller-in-Darkness is the CGI manifestation of studio executives flipping through the screenplay of <em>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings</em> and realizing that there&rsquo;s nothing in there that would make a cool Lego set. It&rsquo;s not on the very bottom of the list because all it wants to do is eat snacks (relatable), and everyone after this entry is in Marvel&rsquo;s clown car of <em>really</em> bad villain ideas. &mdash; <em>Alexis Nedd, Senior Entertainment Reporter</em></p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2><strong>41.

Not even Killian's embittered-nerd backstory can make him a compelling foil to Tony Stark.<em>*</em> &mdash; <em>A.H.</em></p><h2><strong>40.

<p>Ronan gets more laughs than most of the other villains on this list, which could push him up a couple slots. But that's mostly because he's just in a funnier movie than most of the other villains on this list, not because he himself is all that funny. So he moves back down toward the bottom.<em>* </em> &mdash; <em>A.H.</em></p><h2><strong>39. Justin Hammer (<em>Iron Man 2</em>)</strong></h2><p>Justin Hammer is essentially another Tony Stark, only inferior in every possible way. Which shouldn't be that interesting, except that Sam Rockwell makes him kind of an odious oddball. It's fun to watch him try to take down Stark, and even more satisfying to watch him fail again and again.<em>*</em> &mdash; <em>A.H.</em></p><h2><strong>38. Abomination (<em>The Incredible Hulk</em>)</strong></h2><p>There's the germ of something interesting in Emil Blonsky, an aging soldier who agrees to undergo a painful experimental procedure in order to achieve Hulk-like power. Unfortunately, <em>The Incredible Hulk</em> never gets there, and by the end has reduced him to a mindless CGI monster.<em>*</em> &mdash; <em>A.H.</em></p><h2><strong>37. Ayesha (<em>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2</em>)</strong></h2><p>Ayesha is essentially just a superiority complex dipped in gold, but so much of the fun of her character comes from seeing her haughty grandeur rub up against the goofy, grimy world of the Guardians. Here's hoping she'll get more to do <a href="https://mashable.com/article/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-2-end-credits-scenes" target="_self">once Adam emerges</a>.* &mdash; <em>A.H.</em></p><h2><strong>36.

<p>She&rsquo;s got a cool warhammer (the universal weapon), some powerful jewelry (quantum band), and some tooth bling for extra flair. But this revenge-fueled wannabe savior of the Kree just feels like a retread of lesser cosmic villains who&rsquo;ve come before, like Malekith and Ronan. Angry, conquering, blah. Uncluttered by egregious prosthetic makeup, Zawe Ashton&rsquo;s performance isn&rsquo;t swallowed up like those of her predecessors. Still, there&rsquo;s not much there there.&nbsp;&mdash;<em> Kristy Puchko, Entertainment Editor</em></p><h2><strong>35.

<p>Carol Danvers' fragile masculine captor isn't particularly interesting, but not for the first time Marvel gets by on some inspired casting &mdash; and in this case, a few well-placed twists. When Carol is about to blast him to Kree-Kingdom-Come during their final showdown, Yon-Rogg encourages her to strike him, to defeat him. It's so hubristic and patronizing (what's the Kree word for "mansplain?") that Carol decides she'd rather just dip. &mdash; <em>Proma Khosla, Entertainment Reporter</em></p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2><strong>34. Obadiah Stane (<em>Iron Man</em>)</strong></h2><p>Obadiah Stane fits so many of the MCU villain tropes we've become familiar with: He's a greedy businessman and a false father figure, and he's vastly less interesting than the superhero he's out to get. What makes him first among equals is that he was literally the first, setting the mold for years to come.* &mdash; <em>A.H.</em></p><h2><strong>33. Goliath and Ghost (<em>Ant-Man and the Wasp</em>)</strong></h2><p>Sharing a spot on the list because they share so many villainous goals, the foes of <em>Ant-Man and the Wasp</em> are pretty textbook. Goliath, aka Bill Foster, has beef with Hank Pym (a man who specializes in beef) and wants revenge, while Ghost, aka Ava, just wants to stop phasing and not die. They team up to harness the energy of the Quantum Realm, which interferes with Hank and Hope's plan to rescue Janet, but by the end of the movie everyone realizes what a viewer probably caught early on: There's a version of this plan where everyone wins. &mdash; <em>P.K.</em></p><h2><strong>32.

<p>Now we're really getting down to the dregs. Kaecilius is yet another MCU antagonist who lusts after some abstract notion of power. However, he wins a couple points for <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/doctor-strange-kaecilius-makeup-tutorial--81275968256840638/" target="_blank">that flawless eye look</a> and hilarious who's-on-first routine. &mdash; <em>A.H.</em></p><h2><strong>31. Arishem the Judge (<em>Eternals</em>)</strong></h2><p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/eternals-review" target="_self">The Eternals'</a> Celestial space-robot daddy is one of the most powerful beings on this list, but fails to make a proportionate impression because he is in fact a CGI space robot with no face. Arishem is the reason the Eternals even <em>exist. </em>He makes villains of them and their Deviant foes by basically using everyone as chess pieces &mdash; if a game of chess ended with the Earth being destroyed to create a cosmic superbeing. Arishem isn't evil in the way of someone like Thanos; Celestials operate on ancient universal laws, while Thanos acted out of hubris &mdash; but what they all have in common is the view that most mortal life is unremarkable and therefore unessential. Hopefully Sersi, Kingo, and Phastos can convince him otherwise. &mdash; <em>P.K.</em></p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

Thunderbolt Ross (<em>The Incredible Hulk</em>)</strong></h2><p>General Ross doesn't get the big showdown with Hulk (that dubious honor goes to Abomination), but for the first two-thirds of the movie, he's a rather chilling portrayal of a man so obsessed with revenge that he's blind to the fact that he's become a monster in his own right. &mdash; <em>A.H.</em></p><h2><strong>29.

<p>Don't get me wrong, Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) is a ton of fun. This golden battle mage swoops into <a href="https://mashable.com/article/guardian-of-the-galaxy-volume-3-review" target="_self"><em>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</em></a><em> </em>early on and basically pounds them into the dirt. After that, though, we see he's more of a childlike himbo than a supervillain. For the rest of the movie, he mostly screams "Mother!" (which, fair, when you're talking about Elizabeth Debicki as Ayesha) and hangs out with <a href="https://mashable.com/article/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-3-blurp" target="_self">furry cutie Blurp</a>. Good news, though: By the end of the film, he's become a new Guardian of the Galaxy, so we're in for more non-villainous Adam down the line. &mdash; <em>Belen Edwards, Entertainment Reporter</em></p><h2><strong>28. Dreykov (<em>Black Widow</em>)</strong></h2><p>While far from the most charismatic or memorable villain on this list, Dreykov is pretty damn sinister when you think about what he's done. He kidnapped orphans to turn them into soldiers, and he made a point to pick children with uteruses so he could forcibly sterilize them. He turned his own daughter into a barely-sentient killing machine and seemed pleased as punch &mdash; incidentally, Natasha (and the rest of us) really want to punch him. Eff this guy. &mdash; <em>P.K.</em> </p><h2><strong>27. Yellowjacket (<em>Ant-Man</em>)</strong></h2><p>He's essentially Obadiah Stane Redux, minus the shock of realizing that, holy shit, it's <em>Jeff Bridges</em> under that chrome dome. Yellowjacket was just one too many wounded male egos plotting against the MCU's heroes, which perhaps mercifully led to the new era that followed. Sorry, Corey Stoll. We love you, just not this role for you.<em>* </em>&mdash; <em>A.H.</em></p><h2><strong>26. M.O.D.O.K. (<em>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania</em>)</strong></h2><p>Darren Cross/Yellowjacket gets an upgrade after being banished to the Quantum Realm, where he is remade by Kang the Conqueror (more on him later) to be a Mechanized Organism Designed Only for Killing. M.O.D.O.K. is mostly a gag villain thanks to his teeny little arms and legs and frankly massive head &mdash; apologies should be in order for nightmarishly stretching Corey Stoll's face like this. But M.O.D.O.K also has some of the funniest lines in <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-marvel-review" target="_self">an otherwise meh movie</a>, and Stoll is clearly having a blast. At least he died an Avenger, right? Right? &mdash; <em>B.E.</em> </p><h2><strong>25. Trevor/The Mandarin (<em>Iron Man 3</em>)</strong></h2><p>To this day, the reveal of the Mandarin's true identity is one of the most shocking twists that the MCU has ever pulled off &mdash; and Ben Kingsley plays both sides beautifully. He's chilling as the Mandarin but delightfully daft as Trevor, the party-bro actor who has no idea what's really going on.* &mdash; <em>A.H.</em></p><h2><strong>24. Taskmaster (<em>Black Widow</em>)</strong></h2><p>Taskmaster is <em>Black Widow&rsquo;</em>s main antagonist for most of the movie, and while they don&rsquo;t do much beyond showing up and kicking ass, that ass-kicking is some of the best in the MCU. Tasky&rsquo;s fight scenes are a highlight reel of every Avenger&rsquo;s coolest moves, and half the fun of watching Black Widow is seeing how Natasha would actually fare if she squared up against Captain America, Bucky (again), Black Panther, and herself. Also, points awarded for having a cool third act reveal. Best wishes to you, Taskmaster. &mdash; <em>A.N.</em></p><h2><strong>23. Alexander Pierce (<em>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</em>)</strong></h2><p>Like Vulture and Zemo, Alexander Pierce is a relatively understated villain. But he's got gravitas, because he's played by Robert Freakin' Redford, and he raises some genuinely complicated questions about security versus freedom. Well, at least until it's revealed that he's been a Hydra agent all along, and therefore unambiguously evil. Oh, well.* &mdash; <em>A.H.</em></p><h2><strong>22. Red Skull (<em>Captain America: The First Avenger</em>)</strong></h2><p>Red Skull is a really good representation of another annoying MCU villain trend: squandered promise. He's played by Hugo Weaving and based on a popular comic book character, so he seems like he <em>should</em> be amazing. But onscreen, he comes across as just another generic nemesis.* &mdash; <em>A.H.</em></p><h2><strong>21. Ulysses Klaue (<em>Avengers: Age of Ultron</em>, <em>Black Panther</em>)</strong></h2><p>Ulysses Klaue is a villain who died before he really got to live. Mostly in the sense that it would've been wild to see Andy Serkis' take on the comics, but Klaue served his purpose in the MCU's ongoing story. It's Klaue who smuggled vibranium out of Wakanda, a singular act that directly leads to Killmonger's plot to establish Wakanda as a fearsome ruling superpower. Without that vibranium, where would Ultron's consciousness end up after he escaped Tony's computer system? It's impossible to know what the MCU would look like without Klaue's impact, and that's what makes him one of the saga's essential villains. &mdash; <em>Adam Rosenberg, Senior Entertainment Reporter &amp; Weekend Editor</em></p><h2><strong>20. Ego (<em>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2</em>)</strong></h2><p>Talk about villains grounded in painful reality. Kurt Russell is perfect as Ego, the personification of every dashing deadbeat who's ever refused to let minor details like "a child" stand in the way of his grand ambitions. It's just that his grand ambitions involve remaking the entire galaxy.* &mdash; <em>A.H.</em></p><h2><strong>19.

<p>Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors) is one of Marvel Comics' biggest villains, <em>and </em>he's been hyped up as the big bad of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/mcu-phases-5-6-timeline" target="_self">Phases 5 and 6 of the MCU</a>. So why was he such a letdown? Maybe it's the fact that his <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-marvel-review" target="_self">introductory movie simply isn't very good</a>, or maybe it's that his power set isn't defined well beyond "shooting blue beams" and "blathering on and on about how he can see time." <em>Or </em>maybe it's that you need to have watched <a href="https://mashable.com/article/loki-season-1-finale-multiverse-whats-next" target="_self"><em>Loki </em></a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/loki-season-1-finale-multiverse-whats-next" target="_self">to have even the slightest understanding of who he is</a>.

<p>Bucky is only a true villain in <em>Winter Soldier</em>, and then just because he's been brainwashed by Hydra. Maybe that's a shame, because it turns out he's pretty good at being bad. He's all ruthless efficiency and controlled intensity, but his real secret weapon as a supervillain is his tragic backstory.* &mdash; <em>A.H.</em></p><h2><strong>17. Ultron (<em>Avengers: Age of Ultron</em>)</strong></h2><p>A sort of sentient robot son to Tony Stark, Ultron sounds cooler in theory than he actually is in execution. But he<em> is </em>voiced by James Spader in mustache-twirling villain mode, and he's the kind of unapologetic drama queen who insists on having his own throne. That's not nothing.* &mdash; <em>A.H.</em></p><h2><strong>16. Hela (<em>Thor: Ragnarok</em>)</strong></h2><p>Odin&rsquo;s firstborn and the goddess of death, Hela is a formidable foe for Thor. She breaks Mjolnir! She kills the Warriors Three with her knife-y powers! She&rsquo;s played by Cate Blanchett! Even though Hela is sidelined for much of <em>Thor: Ragnarok</em>, Blanchett imbues her with delightfully chilling villainy. Also, her outfit is among the best villain outfits in the MCU &mdash; talk about being dressed to kill. &mdash; <em>B.E.</em></p><h2><strong>15. Gorr the God Butcher (<em>Thor: Love and Thunder</em>)</strong></h2><p>Say what you will about <a href="https://mashable.com/article/thor-love-and-thunder-review" target="_self"><em>Thor: Love and Thunder</em></a>, there's no denying that Christian Bale makes for an amazing villain. Drape that man in a sinister cloak, put the Necrosword in his hand, and give him a tragic backstory, and you're looking at MCU villain gold. Gorr's grief-fueled quest to kill all gods in the universe is <em>Love and Thunder</em>'s most compelling storyline. While the film doesn't examine it quite as much as I wish it would, it still gives us Gorr being the world's most terrifying babysitter. Absolutely immaculate villain vibes. &mdash; <em>B.E.</em></p><h2><strong>14. Mysterio (<em>Spider-Man: Far From Home</em>)</strong></h2><p>On paper, Mysterio looks like a pedestrian amalgam of Vulture, Justin Hammer, and Aldrich Killian &mdash; but the formula doesn't account for Jake Gyllenhaal chewing the absolute heck out of this role. In Mysterio, Gyllenhaal finds layers of sincerity (with Peter), egomania (with his team), and outright unhinged madness that is nothing short of delightful to behold.

<p>Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum) may not be <em>Thor: Ragnarok</em>'s main villain, but the hedonistic leader of Sakaar more than steals the show.

<p>Some Marvel villains have been given mystical armies, unnerving prosthetic makeovers, and/or elaborate backstories sparked from petty grievances. Mr. Paradox doesn't need any of that to be a terrific villain. Sure, at first glance, he just seems like a British suit with a smug attitude. But props to <em>Succession</em>'s Matthew Macfadyen, who's made being a power-hungry weasel into an art. Paradox's plan is one of timeline annihilation, coldly killing off millions of beings because <em>he </em>thinks the timelines are tidier that way. That's deeply evil and unhinged. But what makes Paradox marvelous is Macfadyen's delivery. Whether he's providing a dense exposition dump, dressing down Deadpool for relying on the "Worst Wolverine," or squawking for help when his master plan goes kabluey, the theatrical energy and snarling self-satisfaction makes for a foe that's an absolute hoot to hate.<em> &mdash; K.P.</em></p><h2><strong>9. Vulture (<em>Spider-Man: Homecoming</em>)</strong></h2><p>Vulture is a basically normal dude grappling with the fact that he lives in a superpowered world &mdash; but unlike our heroes, Adrian Toomes isn't inspired by example to become one of the good guys. He channels that rage into a successful black-market enterprise selling alien weaponry, but what's fascinating about Adrian is there's much more to him than supervillainy. He doesn't seem to be playing a role in the way that, say, Obadiah Stane was only pretending to be Tony's friend so he could stab him in the back later. Adrian really is a family man, and he really is an illegal arms dealer. He contains multitudes, and <em>Homecoming</em> doesn't shy away from it.* &mdash; <em>A.H.</em></p><h2><strong>8. Namor (<em>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever)</em></strong></h2><p>With his winged ankles, green hot pants, and strength to rival the Hulk's, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/black-panther-wakanda-forever-shuri-review" target="_self"><em>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever's</em></a> Namor (Tenoch Huerta) bursts onto the scene with a tremendous amount of flair. But Namor is so much more than his appearance. A backstory involving his Yucatec-Mayan people fleeing from European colonizers sets the stage for his compelling motivations: wanting to keep his people and their home of Talokan safe. Like <em>Black Panther</em>'s Killmonger, his reasoning makes sense and initially positions him more as an antihero. Also like Killmonger, his violent methods quickly plunge him into villainy, making for a layered Marvel antagonist who is also a blast to watch. &mdash; <em>B.E.</em></p><h2><strong>7.

<p>She's the evil twin of X-Men leader Charles Xavier, which means Cassandra Nova (Emma Corrin) shares his skills for telepathy and telekinesis. But you know, without all those pesky moral codes weighing her down. Content to rule over the temporal wastelands, Cassandra developed a creepy crew of X-men villains while building a fort in the rotted-out suit of a lost Giant Man. But once she meets Deadpool and Logan, her ambition grows from dystopian tyrant to eradicator of all existence. And if that goal alone isn't enough to commend her as a top-tier MCU villain, consider how her superpower involves stretching her fingers deep into her victims' brains. Watching Paradox's eyes wiggle as she treats his skull like a bowling ball is one of the creepiest things the MCU has offered yet. &mdash; <em>K.P. </em></p><h2><strong>6.

<p>We can discuss at length how Wanda Maximoff deserved better throughout her time in the MCU, but we can also give her major props for being an exceptional villain in <a href="https://mashable.com/article/doctor-strange-multiverse-of-madness-spoiler-free-review" target="_self"><em>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</em></a>. Elizabeth Olsen is clearly having the time of her life as the film's big bad, channeling horror film legends like Samara from <em>The Ring </em>and Carrie White from <em>Carrie</em>. She also <a href="https://mashable.com/article/doctor-strange-multiverse-of-madness-fan-service" target="_self">annihilates years' worth of fan service</a> in the film's most diabolical sequence. On top of all that, Wanda's villainy comes after several movies and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/wandavision-finale" target="_self">an entire TV show</a>'s worth of character development. So, our attachment makes her turn to the dark side both engrossing and painful to watch. Hats off to Olsen for a killer performance, and here's hoping Wanda is having a better time somewhere else in the multiverse. &mdash; <em>B.E.</em>  </p><h2><strong>5. Green Goblin (<em>Spider-Man: No Way Home</em>)</strong></h2><p><em>No Way Home</em> may have brought back every notable Spider-Man villain since 2002 (sorry, Hobgoblin), but Willem Dafoe&rsquo;s Green Goblin is a magnificent standout as he urges them all to go rogue. This character once laid the groundwork for the misguided-scientist-who-turns-into-a-bad-experiment that every Spidey villain followed until Vulture, and his performance is as unhinged and spectacular as it was 20 years ago. Sliding back into Goblin&rsquo;s armor, madness, and signature cackle, Dafoe reminds us that he all but invented the modern comic book movie villain, that everyone else here is in the house that Goblin built. It&rsquo;s a hell of a legacy to leave behind in the first place, and even mightier to live up to it yourself. &mdash; <em>P.K.</em></p><h2><strong>4. Loki (<em>Thor</em>, <em>The Avengers</em>)</strong></h2><p>There's a reason Loki is the rare baddie to stick around for more than one movie (<a href="https://mashable.com/article/loki-review-marvel-disney" target="_self">and a whole TV show</a>). He's the only MCU supervillain who's as fully developed as the MCU superheroes &mdash; and with his sad tale of familial angst, he's almost as sympathetic. Plus, Tom Hiddleston gives Loki a slippery, smirky charisma that's hard to resist. You listen to one of his faux-Shakespearean monologues and tell me you're not tempted to cross over to the dark side.* &mdash; <em>A.H.</em></p><h2><strong>3. Wenwu (<em>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings</em>)</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">
    <div class="flex justify-center">

<p>Leave it to Hong Kong cinema icon Tony Leung to show up 25 movies into the MCU and proceed to wipe the floor with almost every other villain the franchise has come up with. Wenwu is a fascinating villain because he&rsquo;s a bad guy who isn&rsquo;t always a bad <em>person</em>, and the real tragedy of <em>Shang-Chi</em> is knowing Wenwu is mourning more than the loss of his wife &mdash; he&rsquo;s mourning the lost possibility of his own redemption. Also, he&rsquo;s a Marvel villain who keeps another Marvel villain as a human pet. That&rsquo;s god-tier villainy right there. &mdash; <em>A.N.</em></p><h2><strong>2. Eric Killmonger (<em>Black Panther</em>)</strong></h2><p>Hot off the heels of Vulture revolutionizing MCU villainy came Michael B. Jordan's legendary turn in <em>Black Panther</em>. Eric is everything T'Challa isn't: vengeful, embittered, and deeply isolated. His methods might be villainous, but his message is compelling. Growing up in Oakland, far from the promise of Wakanda, he mourns generations of injustice that Black people have experienced around the world, seething with envy at T'Challa and his supposedly charmed life. Killmonger's pain stays with us long after the credits roll on <em>Black Panther</em>, as does his chilling final line. &mdash; <em>P.K.</em></p><h2><strong>1. Thanos (<em>Avengers: Infinity War</em>, <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>)</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Here we go. The big bad. The <em>biggest</em>&nbsp;bad. In one *snap,* Thanos erased half of the known universe from existence &mdash; but it's more than that. The build-up to Thanos pretty much defined the entire pace of the MCU's first truly sprawling story arc, from <em>Iron Man</em> to <em>Endgame</em>. Marvel spent 10 entire years teasing and setting up this massive villain before 2018's <em>Avengers: Infinity War</em>&nbsp;gave him an outwardly significant role to play. It was a hell of a trick, and it wouldn't have worked without the decade of buildup making it clear that a larger, more malevolent puppet-master was always pulling the strings just out of view. There are more exciting villains in the MCU, but Thanos is, as ever, inevitable. &mdash; <em>A.R.</em></p><p><em>*This blurb appeared on a previous list.</em></p><p class="mx-auto">

The game is all about finding the "common threads between words." And just like <em>Wordle</em>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-20-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> resets after midnight and each new set of words gets trickier and trickier&mdash;so we've served up some hints and tips to get you over the hurdle.</p><p>If you just want to be told today's puzzle, you can jump to the end of this article for July 26's <em>Connections</em> solution. But if you'd rather solve it yourself, keep reading for some clues, tips, and strategies to assist you.</p><h2><strong>What is <em>Connections</em>?</strong></h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. Like <em>Wordle, </em>you can share the results with your friends on social media.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>With the sun setting over Paris, and French President Emmanuel Macron officially opened the 2024 games, Dion was yet to be seen. Still, the ceremony continued with a spectacular laser light show illuminating the Eiffel Tower. Glitter sparkled across the glowing Olympic rings, and a speedboat brought in even more Olympic icons, including Serena Williams.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The option refers to X's AI chatbot Grok, which the company <a href="https://mashable.com/article/x-twitter-elon-musk-grok-upcoming-features-discovered" target="_self"><u>continues to integrate throughout the platform</u></a>.</p><p>The fine print under the Settings option text goes on to say that the data is used to "continuously improve your experience" on X, but that the user's data will also be shared with Musk's AI company, xAI, which powers Grok.</p><p>It's good that X informs users of how it uses their data. It's also positive that X provides users with a choice on whether they want to share their data with xAI and X for AI training.</p><p>It's bad, however, that X <em>opts users in by default</em>. It's also not great that users had to seemingly discover these opt-in and opt-out options on their own.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2><strong>How to opt out of X's AI training</strong></h2><p>To stop X from using your data to train its AI, there are a few steps you need to take. (Note: It appears that this setting can only be disabled on X for the web, not via X's iOS or Android apps.)</p><ol><li><p>Click the <a href="https://x.com/settings/account" target="_blank"><u>Settings and Privacy option</u></a> on the left-hand sidebar menu on X.</p></li><li><p>Once in the Settings tab, click on the <strong>Privacy and Safety tab</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Scroll down to the Data sharing and personalization section and click on the <a href="https://x.com/settings/grok_settings" target="_blank"><u>Grok option</u></a>.</p></li><li><p>You should now see the <strong>"Allow your posts as well as your interactions, inputs, and results with Grok to be used for training and fine-tuning" </strong>setting with the checkmark box ticked. Click on the checkmark to deselect and opt out.</p></li></ol><p>Under that setting, there's also an option to delete any conversation history that you have with the X's Grok AI chatbot.</p><p>Musk has big plans for his AI company. He recently <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/24/elon-musk-wants-tesla-to-invest-5-billion-into-his-newest-startup-xai-if-shareholders-approve.html" target="_blank"><u>floated</u></a> his idea to have Tesla invest $5 billion into his xAI, which powers Grok. If X users don't want their data to be used to train Musk's next big project, they should follow the steps above.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The big names aside, it was also a unique opening ceremony in the <em>way </em>it was carried out. It was not held in a stadium like usual.

<p>"Did I just watch the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/challengers-review-zendaya" target="_self">Challengers</a> hotel scene at the Paris Olympics Opening Ceremony," wrote Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/kasiakovacs" target="_blank">@kasiakovacs</a>, referring to a "steamy" (the words of opening ceremony commentators) scene in which three neon-clad dancers stared longingly at each other and then quickly ran into a private room &mdash; getting up to something NSFW, certainly. </p><p>The tweet captures what has been months of fervor over director Luca Guadagnino's tennis <a href="https://mashable.com/article/challengers-twilight-similarities-zendaya-mike-faist-josh-oconnor" target="_self">threesome blockbuster</a>, starring Zendaya, Josh O'Connor, and Mike Faist as star-crossed paramours in the world of professional sports. It's kind of a topical nod, as Paris's own tennis competitors float on by. It's also proof that "Challengers Summer" is far from over. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

      <description><![CDATA[When it comes to "Mothers' Instinct," not every movie needs to be ART. Review.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/05V22iiZbeeC3aduuXGIvXC/hero-image.jpg" alt="Jessica Chastain puts a pearl necklace on Anne Hathaway in "Mothers' Instinct.""><p>Somewhere between <em>What Ever Happened to Baby Jane</em>? and <em>Carol</em> lies <em>Mothers' Instinct. </em>Set vaguely in the early 1960s, this psychological thriller thrusts two of America's most thrilling actresses at each other in a queer-coded battle of wills and mental illness.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://mashable.com/video/the-idea-of-you-anne-hathaway-michael-showalter" target="_self">Anne Hathaway</a> and Jessica Chastain star as a pair of (mostly) happy homemakers who live side by side in charming suburbia. Established cinematographer Beno&icirc;t Delhomme makes his directorial debut here, draping the film in a dreamy pastel palette that cools as the plot kicks in. An untimely death throws these very, very close friends into a spiral of suspicion that threatens to not only end their bond but maybe even several lives along the way.&nbsp;</p><p>Steeped in tension and twisted possibilities, <em>Mothers' Instinct </em>is a deliciously deranged drama that's destined to find an audience that appreciates its brand of camp.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Mothers' Instinct </em>delivers a tale of motherhood and jealousy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-4ltU9ooQ8x0"></div>
</div>


<p>Hathaway stars as Celine, an unflappably chic housewife who is as beloved by her dashing husband Damian (Josh Charles) and chipper son Max as she is by the local PTA. But no one loves her as much as Alice does. Played by Chastain, the next-door neighbor/best friend looks at Celine with a yawning awe, not only for all Celine's capable of but also how easy she makes it look.&nbsp;</p><p>While Celine is utterly content with her picture-perfect domesticity, Alice pines to return to work, hungry to be "more" than a wife and mother. Their differences fester when a tragic accident robs Celine of her only child, leaving her bereft and staring at the greener grass on her neighbor's lawn &mdash;&nbsp;where a little boy still frolics.&nbsp;</p><p>Celine's attitude chills so sharply toward Alice that she begins to wonder if her friend resents her. Desperate to reconnect, Alice gives all she can to her grief-stricken bosom buddy. But before long, she begins to wonder if Celine is scheming to take something more from her... maybe even revenge.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Mothers' Instinct </em>has a Lifetime movie plot with a queer undercurrent.&nbsp;</h2><p>Based on Barbara Abel's 2012 novel <em>Behind the Hatred, Mothers' Instinct </em>plunges unapologetically into domestic terror, pitting two young mothers against each other in a war of emotion and manipulation. Because Alice has a history of mental illness,&nbsp;Celine's hesitant to confess her suspicions to her husband, Simon (Anders Danielsen Lie). Which is probably for the best, as Simon is an insensitive oaf, ever ready to ignore his wife's inconvenient feelings.&nbsp;</p><p>However, as bodies begin to pile up around the ballet flats of lovely Celine, Alice won't be <em>ignored</em>. But how can she hit back at the woman she loves, even if that woman is turning homicidal?</p><p>A queer undercurrent brings a juicy layer to this plot line. The menfolk bop about the lawns and dining rooms, chortling and considering themselves kings of their castles, intentionally two-dimensional. They are nowhere near as real or alive to their wives as their wives are to each other. A sex scene between Alice and her husband is cut short when he declares he wants to impregnate her, a turn-off to a woman who dreams of passion, not more dirty diapers. Meanwhile, simple scenes where Alice and Celine dance together or console each other throb with intimacy and even (potentially one-sided) desire. Combined with Delhomme's romantic palette, <em>Mothers' Instinct </em>feels more Todd Haynes than Alfred Hitchcock. And it's easy to imagine if circumstances were a little different, Alice might take Celine to lunch and declare her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyhHil49kHA" target="_blank">"flung out of space."</a>&nbsp;</p><h2>Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain are <em>Mothers' Instinct</em> biggest asset and its greatest obstacle.&nbsp;</h2><p>Both actresses ably hip-swivel through the dastardly dance that is the movie's most vicious turns. Hathaway offering a chilliness that is enticingly enigmatic, while Chastain is often on the brink of tears, eyes on fire. Together, they play a battle of love and hatred that is so twisted, intense, and entertaining that it recalls Robert Aldrich's iconic psycho-biddy thriller <em>What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? </em>Hathaway and Chastain don't go as theatrical as Bette Davis and Joan Crawford once did, but rightfully so; their at-war heroines are not decades into their festered bond. Still, their performances shimmy knowingly into camp.&nbsp;</p><p>But this might be the problem. Not the performances themselves, which are divinely committed and juicy, but the simple fact that Hathaway and Chastain are so respected and so damn famous. When Davis and Crawford went off the rails in that hagsploitation classic, they were aging leading ladies using their fading status to fuel the subtext of the showbiz horror gem. Watching them go feral was a bold and educated choice. (And it paid off, earning Davis a Best Actress Oscar nomination ten years after her last, plus a slew of other horror roles.)</p><p>Hathaway and Chastain are far from fading; they are still undeniable headliners and Oscar winners. So when they join forces for a movie, audiences might not expect something as willfully tawdry as <em>Mothers' Instinct</em>. This is not a sophisticated thriller on par with <em>Vertigo </em>or even <em>Dial M for Murder</em>,<em> </em>but neither does it need to be to satisfy.&nbsp;</p><p>Hathaway is too interesting an actress to be relegated only to prestige pics. Recently, she elated critics in the flirty rom-com <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-idea-of-you-movie-review" target="_self"><em>The Idea of You</em></a> and the gnarly thriller <a href="https://mashable.com/article/eileen-review-hathaway" target="_self"><em>Eileen</em></a>. But personally, I most love her big swings, like when she played a toxic femme fatale in the psycho-sexual thriller <a href="https://mashable.com/article/serenity-bad-movie" target="_self"><em>Serenity</em></a> or an alcoholic who accidentally manifests a rampaging kaiju in <a href="https://www.pajiba.com/think_pieces/lets-talk-the-surprise-twist-of-anne-hathaways-colossal.php" target="_blank"><em>Colossal.</em></a><em> </em>Meanwhile, Chastain has mixed it up, leaping genres from the superhero flick <em>X-Men: Dark Phoenix </em>to the horror movie <a href="https://mashable.com/article/it-chapter-two-movie-review" target="_self"><em>IT Chapter Two,</em></a><em> </em>to the utterly forgettable espionage thriller <em>Ava</em>. But after her <a href="https://mashable.com/article/jessica-chastain-oscars-speech-2022" target="_self">Oscar win </a>for her <a href="https://mashable.com/video/eyes-of-tammy-faye-trailer" target="_self">transformative performance in </a><a href="https://mashable.com/video/eyes-of-tammy-faye-trailer" target="_self"><em>The Eyes of Tammy Faye</em></a><em>, </em>it's about time she gets to cut loose with some trashy thrills. And she does just that in <em>Mothers' Instinct.&nbsp;</em></p><p>All this is to say, <em>Mothers' Instinct </em>doesn't reach the glorious heights of Hitchcock, or Haynes, or even Aldrich. Rather, Delhomme builds his domestic thriller in a valley in between. His heroines don't reach the delicious camp hysteria of Davis or Crawford. They don't pose in the elegant and openly queer yearning of Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara. They might be formed in the mold of Hitchcock's femme fatales, but to their credit, Hathaway and Chastain make these roles their own.&nbsp;</p><p>In the end, <em>Mothers' Instinct </em>might not be great cinema, but it is great fun. Spiked with twisted turns, explosive emotions, and a feud that's frightening and fun to behold, it's a thriller well worth its gnashed teeth and salty tears.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/ZRPvg?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Mothers%27%20Instinct%20opens%20in%20select%20theaters%20July%2026%20and%20on%20digital%20Aug.%2013.&object_type=article&object_uuid=05V22iiZbeeC3aduuXGIvXC&short_url=ZRPvg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><em>Mothers' Instinct </em>opens in select theaters July 26 and on digital Aug. 13.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2><strong>ChatGPT Voice Mode update: 3 new features</strong></h2><p>The new update for ChatGPT Voice Mode will purportedly allow users to have realistically paced voice conversations with ChatGPT, thanks to newly reduced response times. There are also some other neat utility features it can do now. According to <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/ai/chatgpt/openai-to-make-gpt-4o-advanced-voice-available-by-the-end-of-the-month-to-select-group-of-users" target="_blank">Tom's Guide</a>, the Voice Mode update will add at least three new features to ChatGPT:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Live translate between languages</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Create sound effects while telling stories</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Do custom character voices</strong></p></li></ul><p>It's been a big week for ChatGPT, which announced the imminent rollout of its <a href="https://mashable.com/article/openai-searchgpt-chatgpt-announcement" target="_self">SearchGPT</a> search engine just days ago. Whether it's through voice conversations or text searches, OpenAI's signature chatbot is certainly getting a workout as 2024 goes on.</p>]]></content:encoded>

It's more than capable of running multiple programs at once, or if you're a heavy internet user, several tabs that might normally sap another laptop of memory. Bending it backwards is the real attraction here as it can also be used as a "normal" laptop, but being able to fold it like a tent or use it as a tablet is a major plus when it comes to portability. This hybrid laptop makes for a great back to school buy.

<h2><strong>How to get Deadpool to appear on your phone</strong></h2><p>First things first, this feature is only available on Android devices.

<p>Before the Mashable Shopping team shares a deal with our readers, we check to make sure it's <em>actually </em>a good deal. Major retailers (we're looking at you, Amazon), sometimes use the word "deal" a bit liberally. We find a lot of always-on discounts when hunting for deals, and we typically skip over these in favor of new and notable discounts. But we're making an exception today for this adorable Lego building set.</p><p>Right now, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/DdP8g?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Lego%20Disney%20and%20Pixar%20Up%20House&object_type=article&object_uuid=01uY4v7Um2QmpXIwzeMJF8u&short_url=DdP8g&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Lego Disney and Pixar <em>Up </em>House</a> building set is discounted 20% to a sale price of $47.99. Technically, that <em>is</em> a deal compared to the MSRP of $59.99, but Amazon almost always sells the Lego <em>Up </em>House at this discounted <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0BLJ2ZB3H" target="_blank">price</a>. </p><p>While this sale doesn't meet our normal deals standards, we couldn't resist sharing this set. Anyone who shed a few tears (or bawled) during <em>that </em>scene in <em>Up</em> will understand. Plus, it's still a genuine bargain compared to the full price of $59.99 listed on the <a href="https://zdcs.link/norBy?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Lego%20site&object_type=article&object_uuid=01uY4v7Um2QmpXIwzeMJF8u&short_url=norBy&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Lego site</a>. </p><p>The Lego Disney and Pixar Up House is a colorful display of Carl Fredricksen's iconic home, complete with balloons anchored to the chimney. Ready to fly off to Paradise Falls, the set also comes with Carl, his dog Dug, and his new pal Russell. With 598 pieces, the set is designed for Lego fans ages nine and up. The house measures about 10.5 inches tall, 6 inches wide, and 4 inches deep, so it's compact enough to display on a bookshelf once you're done building. Let the adventure and imagination of <em>Up</em> live on in your home. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

            'Deadpool and Wolverine' review: Can Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman save the MCU?

<p>Well before Marvel's multiple realities grabbed a hold of pop culture, the X-Men movies had their own messy continuity, including an ostensible multiverse before this was really a fad. After kicking off with a trilogy set more or less in the modern day, followed by a Wolverine spin-off, the story moved firmly into prequel territory. It soon brought its older and younger casts together through a time travel story, all but erasing its original timeline and starting afresh. However, the desire to retread and retool the film series while also maintaining the appearance of a single, continuous franchise has led to, shall we say, <em>complications</em>.</p><p>For instance: How is the diamond-skinned telepath Emma Frost both a teenager in the 1980s, in <em>X-Men Origins: Wolverine</em> (2009) and an adult in the 1962-set prequel movie <em>X-Men: First Class</em>, released just two years later? Series producer Lauren Shuler Donner <a href="https://archive.ph/20141130075156/http:/emmafrostfiles.com/misc/faq/how-is-emma-in-both-x-men-origins-wolverine-and-x-men-first-class/" target="_blank"><u>claims</u></a> the two characters are only coincidentally named Emma and happen to share the same powers &mdash; okay, <em>sure</em> &mdash; but the real answer is that two different filmmakers simply opted to use the character in different contexts, continuity be damned.</p><p>These discrepancies haven't always mattered to general audiences. But in light of Marvel's new rules about character "variants" and the emergence of timeline "branches," the fourteenth X-Men entry can't help but recontextualize these creative decisions. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/deadpool-and-wolverine-review" target="_self"><em><u>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</u></em></a> also features Marvel's Time Variance Authority, or the TVA &mdash; keepers of continuity introduced in the streaming series <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHd4duyCFHk" target="_blank"><em><u>Loki</u></em></a> &mdash; so it only makes sense to dive in and unpack what exactly is going on with the winding X-Men timeline. After all, the much-awaited team-up between Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool and Hugh Jackman's Wolverine is actually the second time these actors and characters have crossed paths on-screen, but those were also different versions of each character who have long since died.

<p><strong>Established canon</strong>: Released in 2000 and set in "the near future," Bryan Singer's <em>X-Men</em> introduced a sprawling ensemble of X-Men, under the guidance of telepathic, wheelchair-using headmaster Professor X/Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart). When the film series begins, our heroes have been locked in a quiet battle for recognition and rights with both the U.S. government and the antagonistic Mutant Brotherhood, led by metal-bending radical Magneto/Erik Lehnsherr (Ian McKellen), a survivor of the Holocaust. This premise runs through nearly all the mainline X-Men movies.</p><p>The first film is also where we meet Jackman's Wolverine, a loner with no memory of his origins who soon joins up with the X-Men, a shifting roster that expands with every entry. The mainstays include Professor X, his telekinetic protege Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), the weather witch Storm/Ororo Munroe (Halle Berry) and the laser-eyed Cyclops/Scott Summers (James Marsden). Later entries saw the addition of the metal-skinned Colossus (Daniel Cudmore) in <em>X2: X-Men United</em> (2003), followed by the wall-phasing Kitty Pryde (Elliot Page), the animalistic yet erudite Beast/Hank McCoy (Kelsey Grammer), and the burdened, winged Angel (Ben Foster) in <em>X-Men: The Last Stand</em> (2006).&nbsp;</p><p>The X-Men are teachers and students, but they're also a paramilitary force with their own stealth jets and black leather uniforms. This comes in handy when they fight villains like the feral Sabretooth (Tyler Mane), the shape-shifting Mystique (Rebecca Romijn), the rampaging Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones) and the ruthless Col. William Stryker (Brian Cox), an old man tied to Logan's mysterious origins.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p><strong>Retcons</strong>: Continuity is largely linear for these first three films. Characters recur without much fuss, or disappear between entries &mdash; like teleporting circus attraction Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) &mdash;and no one is the wiser. The film series' minor Easter eggs pose only the tiniest of problems. For instance, Beast cameos on a TV screen in human form in <em>X2</em> (played by Steve Bacic), but by the time Grammer plays him in the third movie, he appears in all his blue and furry glory, and he seems to have been that way for some time.</p><p>Deaths and major events, however, all seem to be built with wiggle room, just in case they need to be undone. <em>X2'</em>s ending, in which Jean sacrifices her life to save the X-Men, dovetails into <em>Last Stand</em>, where she's resurrected under the ''Phoenix'' moniker &mdash; a powerful cosmic force in the comics, reimagined as an alternate persona. And as the third entry wraps up, it drops hints that its radically altered status quo might not be permanent. &nbsp; Magneto, who's been de-powered by a mutant "cure," appears to move a metal chess piece with his mind in the trilogy's closing frames. Even Xavier's violent death is poised to be rewritten in a post-credit scene, when a long-comatose body speaks to Dr. Moira MacTaggert (Olivia Williams) in Stewart's distinct tenor.</p><p>Without a fourth linear X-Men film on the horizon, these were little more than wishes destined to remain unfulfilled, though they would eventually come into play a few entries down the line. In the meantime, the franchise was all set to venture into the past, with a string of origin stories based on specific characters.</p><h2><strong>The X-Men prequels and spin-offs: 2009 to 2013&nbsp;</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p><strong>Established canon</strong>: In 2009, <em>X-Men Origins: Wolverine</em> was the test case for mutant spin-offs. Director Gavin Hood's poorly received action prequel attempts not only to fill the gaps in Logan's memory, but also to recast and reimagine several existing characters.&nbsp;</p><p>After detailing Wolverine's childhood in 1845,<em> X-Men Origins</em> is set largely in the mid-1980s, and turns hints of flashbacks from previous films into their own narrative centerpieces. These explain how Wolverine lost his memory, and how he had the indestructible metal adamantium grafted onto his bones, creating his signature<strong> </strong>claws, by a middle-aged Stryker (Danny Huston), leader of the Weapon X program. <em>Origins</em> was also the movie that introduced a teenage Emma Frost (Tahyna MacManus), as well as the sword-wielding mercenary Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds), albeit as a mute, mind-controlled villain largely ignored by the character's more comedic entries.&nbsp;</p><p>The plan, at the time, was to follow Wolverine's solo film with a similar "Origins" story about Magneto. But this idea was eventually folded into Matthew Vaughn's 1962-set ensemble prequel, <em>X-Men: First Class </em>(2011). While a more colorful film than its predecessors,<em> First Class</em> made distinct overtures towards being deeply entwined with the original X-Men trilogy, beginning with its opening scene of a young Erik in a Nazi concentration camp &mdash; practically a shot-for-shot recreation of the first film's prologue &mdash; before focusing, once more, on the ideological rift between Xavier (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender). Shortly thereafter, <em>The Wolverine</em> (2013), Logan's second solo spin-off, would take the character to Japan long after the events of the original trilogy. There, he loses himself in mourning over a long-dead Jean Grey, and subsequently has his adamantium claws hacked off by a giant robot samurai.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p><strong>Retcons</strong>: Perhaps the biggest liberty taken by <em>X-Men Origins</em> is its reimagining of Sabretooth &mdash; now played by Liev Schreiber &mdash; as Wolverine's half-brother, and his comrade during every American war. That Wolverine has no memory of this in previous entries makes sense, thanks to his amnesia. The fact that Mane's version of Sabretooth (in 2000's <em>X-Men</em>) doesn't acknowledge this either is a gap in continuity that, while irksome, is ultimately forgivable, since it led to Schreiber's delightfully evil performance.&nbsp;</p><p><em>X-Men: First Class</em> similarly reimagines Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) as Xavier's adopted sister; this is another sibling relationship that isn't acknowledged in films set decades later, and the first of many instances in which the prequel plays fast and loose with continuity. Some of its narrative liberties, like MacTaggert (Rose Byrne) showing up as a CIA agent rather than a doctor, or Emma Frost (January Jones) being an adult character 20-plus years before appearing as a teenager in <em>X-Men: Origins</em>, don't matter quite as much. However, they start to become noticeable if you're paying close attention. Some changes to the timeline even <em>fix</em> inconsistencies elsewhere: Hank McCoy (Nicholas Hoult) transforms into his furry, blue form, aligning <em>First Class</em> with Grammer's later appearance while ignoring the character's minor human cameo in <em>X2</em>. Other changes, however, have a more adverse impact: while <em>Origins</em> and <em>The Last Stand</em> feature scenes of Xavier walking around in the '80s and '90s, <em>First Class</em> ends with him being paralyzed from the waist down for dramatic effect, several decades prior.</p><p>Xavier and McCoy's continuity, however, becomes even more fluid thanks to a future entry &mdash; the time-travel crossover <em>X-Men: Days of Future Past</em> &mdash; first teased in the post-credit scene of <em>The Wolverine</em>. Logan's solo sequel is isolated enough from the rest of the series, both narratively and geographically, that it doesn't impact continuity, but its credit tag promises monumental changes when the character is visited by not only a re-powered Magneto (McKellan), but also a mysteriously resurrected Professor X (Stewart), who warn him of oncoming dangers.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>The alternate X-Men timeline: 2014 to 2017</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p><strong>Established canon</strong>: Singer, who helmed the first two X-Men movies, returned to the director's chair for <em>X-Men: Days of Future Past</em>, and brought with him his signature black leather outfits. In his grim future timeline &mdash; a dystopian 2023, about a decade after <em>The Wolverine</em> is set &mdash; mutants are hunted and killed, thanks to the domino effects of Mystique assassinating a weapons developer in the 1970s.&nbsp;</p><p>The aged Magneto (McKellan) and Xavier (Stewart) have teamed up once more, and their survival depends on Kitty Pryde using her inexplicable time-travel powers. Logan, who somehow has his adamantium claws back &mdash; another unexplained return to status quo &mdash; has his consciousness psychically transported by Pryde into his younger body in the 1970s. Here, he meets up with a younger Xavier and McCoy (played by prequel actors McAvoy and Hoult), who have figured out how to suppress their powers. Xavier can also temporarily walk again, while McCoy retains his human appearance, ensuring that any future discrepancies on this front can be easily hand-waved.</p><p>The film, in essence, resets the entire X-Men timeline as we know it, erasing the past continuity before our eyes and yielding the '80s- and '90s-set sequels <em>X-Men: Apocalypse</em> (2016)<em> </em>and<em> Dark Phoenix</em> (2019). These films, while they don't feature Wolverine except in a cameo capacity, see the re-introduction of trilogy mainstays, now played by younger characters: Storm (Alexandra Shipp), Jean Grey (Sophie Turner), Cyclops (Tye Sheridan), and Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee).&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p><strong>Retcons</strong>: Despite starting afresh, and having the ability to pull from any corners of the vast comic catalog, this ostensibly new X-Men series retreads characters and concepts already seen. However, the changes it makes along the way don't always add up. The point of divergence between the two timelines (in <em>X-Men: Days of Future Past</em>) is 1973, which should only affect the future, at least in theory. However, the 1980s-set <em>X-Men: Apocalypse</em> happens to feature a version of Angel (Ben Hardy) as a young adult, around the age he already appeared in <em>The Last Stand</em> in the 2000s. He would have already had to have been born by <em>Days of Future Past </em>for this to happen, which kind of implies that the team's time-travel antics didn't just impact the future, but the past as well (cue Michael Keaton's kooky spaghetti monologue from <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-flash-movie-review" target="_self"><em>The Flash</em></a>).</p><p>The new film series does gesture towards a brand new story in some ways, like the ending of <em>X-Men: Days of Future Past</em>, which sees Wolverine waking up in an alternate 2023 where Jean, Scott, and the other X-Men are still alive, though he remembers the original timeline in which they died. The ripple effects of his time travel also mean it's no longer a young Stryker (Josh Helman) who captured him but Mystique in disguise. Therefore, it ought to follow that Wolverine doesn't become a subject of Weapon X, but he's seen right back in its clutches &mdash; memory wipe and all &mdash; in <em>Apocalypse</em>, the very next entry. The more things change in the X-Men film series, the more they seem to stay the same.</p><h2><strong><em>Deadpool</em>, <em>Logan</em>, and the TV shows you forgot</strong>: <strong>2016 to 2020</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>A similar approach is taken in the somber Wolverine spin-off <em>Logan</em> &mdash; the question of when and where it takes place could have multiple explanations &mdash; albeit with a more story-centric reason in mind. On one hand, since the events of the original trilogy (and the dystopia of <em>X-Men:</em> <em>Days of Future Past</em>)<em> </em>have been deleted from continuity, this rules <em>Logan</em> out as a direct sequel to them. It's more likely that the spin-off<em> </em>emanates from the alternate future glimpsed at the end of <em>Days of Future Past</em>. But since that version of Wolverine seemed to remember the original timeline, <em>Logan</em> works as a character-centric sequel to those films as well. It's a neat way for the series to have its cake and eat it too, thus creating an all-encompassing sequel that draws on the audience's general familiarity with the X-Men movies, whether they've been "erased" or not.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Retcons</strong>: At the end of the day, trying to decipher a linear approach to <em>Logan</em>'s continuity runs counter to the film's own themes. Its take on the X-Men canon becomes all but explicit in a key exchange between Wolverine and his clone/adopted daughter Laura (Dafne Keen), when she presents him with a series of vibrant X-Men comics. "You do know they're all bullshit, right?" he tells her. "Maybe a quarter of it happened, and not like this."&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The movie's neo-Western lens frames Wolverine as an aged gunman at the end of his life, a man about whom legends have been whispered around campfires over the years. While the events of all the previous movies "happened" in some fashion, whether literally or just in the character's memory, <em>Logan</em> all but instructs the audience not to get bogged down by these details. The emotional truths therein are what matter most, i.e. that Logan was once an X-Man who went on grand, whiz-bang adventures, but ended up partially (if not wholly) responsible for the deaths of his colorful comrades.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>The New Mutants </em>(2020) features fleeting archival footage of Laura, thus setting it in the same continuity as <em>Logan</em>, but chances are you didn't remember that movie exists until just now.</p><p>The past, in the X-Men movies, is entirely fluid. This has long been the case in superhero comics, where writers being selective about decades of continuity is practically a given, if anyone's going to even attempt a new story. This pliability is a perfect fit for a film like <em>Logan</em>, which captures Wolverine through a mythic lens and treats the X-Men tales as folklore. However, this is remarkably (if unintentionally) similar to how the Deadpool<em> </em>movies treat continuity too, as parodies that don't bother taking canon too seriously.&nbsp;</p><p>When exactly are Tim Miller's <em>Deadpool</em> (2016) and David Leitch's <em>Deadpool 2</em> (2018) set in relation to the X-Men films? The answer, as with <em>Logan</em>, is "it doesn't really matter," since the series is too busy poking fun at superheroes to figure that out. But if you really want to do the math, it isn't hard. </p><p>By process of elimination, they definitively <em>do not</em> take place in the same continuity as <em>X-Men Origins: Wolverine </em>(and thus, the original trilogy), given their more comic-accurate Deadpool and a supporting roster that features much more cartoonish versions of characters seen in other films, like Colossus (Stefan Kapi&#269;i&#263;) and Juggernaut (Reynolds). And since the main cast of <em>X-Men: Apocalypse</em> makes a brief cameo in <em>Deadpool 2</em> &mdash; albeit as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wfxn7OBLAs" target="_blank"><u>a fleeting gag</u></a> about how the production can't afford them &mdash; it's safe to assume the two movies are at least nominally connected, even though it makes no real sense for characters from the 1980s to show up in present day. This places the Deadpool films in the new timeline created by <em>Days of Future Past</em>. Voila!</p><p>However, the story of the X-Men movies' doesn't end there. As it turns out, <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em> does actually provide a definitive answer about where the Deadpool movies fit in, where one really wasn't clear before, or even really needed.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong><em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em> (2024)&nbsp;</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>In <a href="https://mashable.com/article/deadpool-2-queer-representation" target="_self"><em>Deadpool 2</em></a>, Wade uses a time-travel device to save his girlfriend Vanessa (<a href="https://mashable.com/video/deadpool-2-morena-baccarin-love" target="_self">Morena Baccarin</a>), which theoretically creates another branched reality in which she doesn't die. In <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em>, the TVA agent. Paradox (Matthew Macfadyen) clearly establishes that the Deadpool<em> </em>movies take place in the same universe as <em>Logan</em>, since the Wolverine of Wade's reality is dead and buried in a shallow grave.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, <em>Logan</em> theoretically takes place in the new reality where Deadpool's time-travel antics caused a further shift in continuity, though the Deadpool movies' timeline fudging do shift around some existing specifics. According to on-screen text in <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em>, the film is set in 2024, but dialogue in <em>Logan </em>sets that film in 2029. So, when did Wolverine die, exactly? Well, in keeping with <em>Logan</em>, it depends on who you ask &mdash; or in this case, which movie studio you ask, since this appears to be a definitive retcon under Disney.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>However, the Wolverine in the yellow suit seen in all the trailers is from<em> another</em> different timeline, which seems to be unconnected to the X-Men movies altogether. However, this "Worst Wolverine" &ndash; as Paradox declares him &mdash;&nbsp;harbors the same rage and self-doubt as the Logan we've seen before.</p><p>This is a must, if Jackman's return is to have any emotional resonance for the audience. For better or worse, the nitty-gritties of the X-Men timeline may actually be important for once, if only to make sense of Wade and Logan's MCU debuts.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>Why we like it</h2><p>Logitech makes some of the best webcams on the market, and this 4K Pro model proves it. With this cam, you'll get up to four times the resolution of a standard HD webcam, up to 90 frames per second, and multiple field of view presets. In addition, the webcam comes with a nifty privacy shade, automatic lighting adjustment tech, and a built-in noise-cancelling microphone. At $50 off, this is a fantastic deal for streamers and WFH professionals.</p><h2>More 4K webcam deals</h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/W0P6m?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=AnkerWork%20C310%204K%20webcam&object_type=article&object_uuid=05B6ExnfUisWtzuyCjxxnA4&short_url=W0P6m&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">AnkerWork C310 4K webcam</a> &mdash; <strong>$84.99</strong> <s>$99.99</s> (save $15 with on-page coupon)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/ZRPAR?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Insta360%20Link%20PTZ%204K%20webcam&object_type=article&object_uuid=05B6ExnfUisWtzuyCjxxnA4&short_url=ZRPAR&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Insta360 Link PTZ 4K webcam</a> &mdash; <strong>$224.99</strong> <s>$299.99</s> (save $75)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/dM28p?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Lumina%204K%20webcam&object_type=article&object_uuid=05B6ExnfUisWtzuyCjxxnA4&short_url=dM28p&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Lumina 4K webcam</a> &mdash; <strong>$175</strong> <s>$250</s> (save $75)</p></li></ul><h2>HD webcam deals</h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/MVPKO?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Razer%20Kiyo%20Pro%20HD%20webcam&object_type=article&object_uuid=05B6ExnfUisWtzuyCjxxnA4&short_url=MVPKO&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Razer Kiyo Pro HD webcam</a> &mdash; <strong>$119.99</strong> <s>$199.99</s> (save $80)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/kn01Y?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Logitech%20HD%20Pro%20webcam&object_type=article&object_uuid=05B6ExnfUisWtzuyCjxxnA4&short_url=kn01Y&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Logitech HD Pro webcam</a> &mdash; <strong>$59.99</strong> <s>$99.99</s> (save $40)</p></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As our friends at PCMag (which is owned by Mashable's publisher, Ziff Davis) noted in their <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/jbl-tune-230nc" target="_blank">review</a>, "Only a handful of affordable noise-cancelling true wireless earphones are worth your attention, but you can add JBL&rsquo;s Tune 230NC earbuds to that list." For budget earbuds, the JBL Tune 230NCs offer solid audio and active noise cancellation. Plus, they'll last you up to 40 hours with the charging case. At $47.95, they're over half off and just $3 away from their record-low price.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

In May, they released "A Futurist View into the Future of Love, Sex, and Relationships: LELO Report on Trends in the Following Decade." The title is pretty long-winded, but the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14zqq-PICUj-SLkFac1yVxKZsZ8zgqM8k/view?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">15-page report</a> offers a glimpse into how technology is reshaping the way we connect, experience intimacy, and find pleasure both emotionally and physically.</p><h2>A futurist's sexy prediction approach </h2><p>To create this report, Cheesewright used "Scenario Planning" &mdash; a methodology where current trends are identified and projected into the future, typically over a long time horizon (in this case, 50 years). This establishes a "baseline scenario" where these trends continue, though not necessarily at the same pace or intensity.</p><p>He then "bent" this baseline into three directions to see how sex might look under each possible scenario: </p><ul><li><p><strong>Digital unbound: </strong>This imagines a world where we spend 10 hours a day in "mixed reality," where AI avatars are "near indistinguishable" from our friends and family. While this offers new ways to experience "connection," it raises concerns about loneliness, isolation, and the potential for extreme fantasy roleplay.</p></li><li><p><strong>Natural forces: </strong>This looks at a future in which a backlash against technology leads to a renewed focus on real-world, flesh-and-blood relationships &mdash; where empathy, authenticity, and personalized handmade goods are valued more highly. </p></li><li><p><strong>Resurgent traditionalism: </strong>This considers a future where societal anxieties and political shifts lead to a return to traditional gender roles and relationship structures. This could manifest as a "false nostalgia" for the past, with government incentives encouraging people to commit to long-term, monogamous relationships and start families.</p></li></ul><p>"I tried to imagine the answer to the questions posed to me by LELO under these [three] scenarios, then aggregated the answers to try to find some probabilities that were the most interesting to explore,&rdquo; Cheesewright explains.</p><h2>What does the future hold for sex and relationships? </h2><p>Before I go into the specifics, I want to note that I reached out to a few experts on my own to see if they had any thoughts to add to the conversation. It led to a thought-provoking discussion that one could argue is never-ending.</p><p>Here's what the LELO report envisions for the future of sex and relationships <em>and </em>what the experts I spoke with had to say:</p><h3>We'll have more partners, but not at the same age as the generations before us</h3><p>According to the report (page six), today's youngest sexually-active generation is <a href="https://mashable.com/article/decline-sexual-frequency-public-health" target="_self">having less sex</a> and fewer partners. But Cheesewright and LELO predict that we'll be more promiscuous in our 30s and beyond. </p><p>This shift is attributed to a trend of "extended adolescence," where milestones like marriage and parenthood are happening later in life. A combination of factors, including a more health-conscious younger generation, economic uncertainty (particularly the inability to buy homes and start families), and a low tolerance for risk, means many of us are waiting longer to settle down.</p><p>The report suggests that instead of "frantic coupling" and partnering in our youth, we're likely to experience more partners later in life as we gain confidence and grow into ourselves. This could happen in our late 20s and early 30s as we search for long-term partners or even older, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/mourning-lost-time-breakups-relationships" target="_self">after previous relationships end</a>.</p><h3>We'll have less sex with our current partners</h3><p>Thanks to<strong> </strong>never-ending distractions, work, and finding time to relax, the report states that sex with our partners might be getting pushed down our priority list. However, there's a potential upside: this could lead us to value sex more when it does happen.</p><p>That said, staff sexologist at sex toy shop Good Vibes, <a href="https://www.goodvibes.com/content/c/carol-queen" target="_blank">Carol Queen</a>, Ph.D., points out that this positive outcome is only possible if we are emotionally healthy and prioritize consent within our relationships.</p><p>"Some researchers think that social media impairs the kinds of emotional states and skills needed to make Cheesewright's POV a solid prediction, while others do not. If nothing else, it's pretty clear that some people conduct a lot of their social lives online now!" Queen tells Mashable. Queen also points out that this isn't the only factor that impacts how much sex we have and how much we value it; different people have different values, and likely will in the future too.</p><p>"To me this prediction is so full of caveats: the dangers that sex can bring, the frequency with which some people find sex to be just meh, and the fraught ways sex and emotional intimacy can be tangled up. And I may see those things from quite a different angle given my AFAB [assigned female at birth] history too," she continues.</p><h3>We'll have more virtual sex</h3><p>Instead of the oh-so-clich&eacute; nurse or fireman roleplay, the report predicts that as technology advances and integrates into our lives, a "mixed reality" could become the norm. Imagine avatars and artificial intelligence projected directly into our surroundings through smart glasses or lenses, creating a fully immersive experience with limitless possibilities for sexual content (so, aliens and elves).</p><p>This level of immersion opens up new and potentially "worrying" possibilities, allowing us to reshape our environments and even our partners. Cheesewright explains, "We can build characters around toys, robots, and AIs. There will be a lot of temptation."</p><h3>We'll continue to make friends with inanimate objects</h3><p>Although the report doesn't predict that robots will gain consciousness (page eight), they may be able to provide a convincing imitation of life. However, this raises ethical concerns about relationships with robots, as it risks reducing one to an "object" <a href="https://mashable.com/article/parasocial-relationships-definition-meaning" target="_self">rather than an equal partner</a>. </p><p>"The benefits are obvious," sex and intimacy coach <a href="https://www.leahcarey.com/" target="_blank">Leah Carey</a> tells Mashable. "Soothing touch hunger, giving people an outlet for both connection and sexual appetite&hellip;" But Carey also acknowledges complications, such as, "Does having an always-willing partner impair people's ability to negotiate consent?&rdquo; </p><p>Carey also notes that while <a href="https://mashable.com/article/cybrothel-fulfills-a-fantasy-but-may-have-risks" target="_self">robots could allow people to explore kinks</a> that might otherwise be inaccessible, the power dynamics in such scenarios become inherently imbalanced.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

        </a>
    </div>
<p>Beyond these ethical concerns, relationships with robots could also create (and encourage) unrealistic expectations. With customizable body shapes and appearances, robots might reinforce harmful ideals about human partners and allow people to act out "dangerously extreme fantasies," potentially necessitating regulation.</p><p>"The ability to construct your partner's perfect physique could reinforce cultural beauty standards to an extreme degree, but there's another possibility that concerns me more: removing options for fat people," Carey says. "In my work, I encounter a lot of people who prefer people in fat bodies, or who are agnostic about body size. But it's so stigmatized in culture, it's not unusual for them to have a fuck-buddy on the side who is large, while publicly dating people in more conventionally acceptable bodies in public," she adds. </p><p>"If the desire for a larger body can be filled by a life-like robot, those people get pushed even further out to the fringes. To be clear," Carey clarifies, "the fuck-buddy-in-the-dark phenomenon is hugely problematic on its own; this would just make it even worse."</p><h3>Sex toys will evolve</h3><p>It's not just robots; the report envisions <a href="https://mashable.com/article/sex-toys-vibration-sensations" target="_self">sex toys</a> that feel and move more naturally, respond to virtual fantasies, and become more integrated into partnered sex. As it is, people are already using <a href="https://mashable.com/article/bluetooth-sex-toys-vr-how-people-are-having-sex-in-virtual-reality" target="_self">bluetooth sex toys</a> to mimic real-life sensations in VR.</p><p>"Our understanding of the smallest molecules of matter is allowing us to create new materials with incredible properties &mdash; not just look and feel, but an ability to move, change shape, and store energy," Cheesewright writes. "This creates endless possibilities for future sex toys that take advantage of our growing understanding of human pleasure."</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

        </a>
    </div>
<p>The report also predicts that more people will embrace "unselfish" sexual behavior, overcoming any insecurities about <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-use-sex-toys-with-partner" target="_self">using toys in the bedroom</a>. However, Carey says this is entirely dependent on whether or not our culture can come to terms with the fact that <a href="https://mashable.com/article/instagram-shadowbanning-lgbtq-sex-educator-accounts" target="_self">sex education</a> needs to not only exist but be far more comprehensive than it currently is.</p><p>"If we want to decouple the idea that a toy isn't needed if you have an excellent lover, we need people to understand a lot of basics that many people don't currently have: how to ask for what they want in the bedroom; how to truly understand your partner's turn-ons; understanding the difference between giving touch and receiving touch and the purposes for both, etc."</p><h2>There's a lot this report covers, but it&rsquo;s missing a few important details</h2><p>LELO's report is undoubtedly extensive, but this subject is so<em> </em>much more nuanced and complex. There are pieces missing or glossed over that are worth digging into, mainly: </p><ul><li><p><strong>Reproductive rights: </strong>"I was surprised to see no mention of reproductive rights, abortion access, etc. since <em>Roe v. Wade</em> was struck down in 2022, and the fallout has been devastating for people with uteruses in the [U.S.]," Kate Sloan, sex journalist, author of <a href="https://zdcs.link/b151G?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=101%20Kinky%20Things%20Even%20You%20Can%20Do&object_type=article&object_uuid=02UyjlXXm1ieHG7EwnNNHcZ&short_url=b151G&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><em>101 Kinky Things Even You Can Do</em></a>, and host of the podcast miniseries<em> <a href="https://makingmagicseries.com/" target="_blank">Making Magic</a></em><em>, </em>tells Mashable.&nbsp;"Again, if there isn't sufficient pushback against and reversal of these legal changes in the coming years, life will continue to get much more dangerous and unsettling for anyone who's capable of getting pregnant." Sloan also mentions that if we're seeing women having less sex than before, it may very well be a result of having our reproductive rights taken away from us.</p></li><li><p><strong>The LGBTQ community: </strong>Sloan points out that the report entirely overlooks <a href="https://mashable.com/category/lgbtq" target="_self">LGBTQ</a> rights and identities. "More and more people are coming out as queer and trans over the years, as the general public learns more about what it means to be queer or trans," she says. "That being said, more visibility has not translated to more rights or more protections, and queer and trans people still face discrimination and exclusion every day...This will affect the future of sexuality insofar as unless we are all able to lead the sex lives we want, none of us are really free." </p></li><li><p><strong>Sex workers and sexual education: </strong>The report also fails to address the continued criminalization and stigmatization of sex work, which has far-reaching consequences on sexual rights and well-being. "I was surprised to see no mention in the report of laws like <a href="https://decriminalizesex.work/advocacy/sesta-fosta/what-is-sesta-fosta/" target="_blank">SESTA/FOSTA</a> that have harmed and targeted sex workers, the porn industry, etc., as these puritanical laws have already affected our sexual culture massively and will continue to do so,"  Sloan adds. "If there isn't sufficient pushback and reversal of these laws in the coming years, working and living conditions will get even more precarious for sex workers &mdash; and anyone who enjoys porn, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/uk-sex-education-politics" target="_self">sex education content</a>, informational kink resources, and so on will have less information and entertainment available to them as a result. It will be a less safe, less free, and less sexually-expressive world."</p></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

Thankfully, the process is really easy. (If you already know how to do this, feel free to keep scrolling to get straight to the latest DoorDash coupons.)</p><p>All you need to do is load up your shopping cart with whatever is on the menu for the night and head to the checkout screen.

<p>For athletes like runners and cyclists, fitness trackers and smartwatches make it easy to track your heart rate. Of course, they also track your steps, your sleep, your stress, and your text messages, which is why they're so expensive. If you're not keen on adding yet another wearable or smart device to your life, there are still ways to track your heart rate as you exercise. </p><p>Today at Amazon, the popular <a href="https://zdcs.link/GdPrW?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Garmin%20HRM-Dual%20Heart%20Rate%20Monitor&object_type=article&object_uuid=03QBN4MhuMbW4s3qKkIXNgZ&short_url=GdPrW&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Garmin HRM-Dual Heart Rate Monitor</a> is on sale for just $46.93. This brings the list price of $69.99 down by 33%, just a hair above its lowest-ever price, according to Amazon price tracker <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B07N3C5WRG" target="_blank">camelcamelcamel</a>. If you're looking for a good heart rate monitor deal, today is a smart time to click "Add to cart."</p><p>The Garmin Heart Rate Monitor is a hit among athletes and Prime shoppers. Amazon reports that 7,000 people bought this wearable heart rate monitor last month, The HRM-Dual makes tracking your heart rate while you exercise super simple. The wearable device has a soft and washable strap that fits snugly below your chest, positioning it for an accurate read. The heart rate module picks up real-time data and uses Bluetooth to send it to your fitness app, device, or smart exercise machine of choice.</p><p>Incredibly, this device has a 3.5-year battery, so you may <em>never </em>need to charge it once you set it up. We also appreciate that the strap is removable, so you can toss it in the washing machine after a heavy workout. Some users have complained about connectivity problems with Garmin Connect on iOS or certain devices, but workarounds are available. Syncing apps like Zwift with other Garmin devices seems to do the trick.</p><p>If you're an athlete who wants to track their heart rate, or if you already use a Garmin smartwatch or bike computer, the HRM-Dual is a no-brainer.</p><p>Prioritize your heart health when you score the <a href="https://zdcs.link/GdPrW?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Garmin%20HRM-Dual%20Heart%20Rate%20Monitor&object_type=article&object_uuid=03QBN4MhuMbW4s3qKkIXNgZ&short_url=GdPrW&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Garmin HRM-Dual Heart Rate Monitor</a> for $46.93 at Amazon.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<hr><p>Technology and gadgets have changed the way we live everyday. No longer do we have to track down a pay phone or print out driving directions, and we don't have to burn CDs full of our favorite songs. Instead, we rely on modern tech like our smartphones and earbuds for everyday life. However, these devices require charging up the battery pretty consistently. Depending on battery function, you might need to recharge just to make it through the day. </p><p>If you tend to run low on battery or are looking for an upgrade to your current laptop battery, check out these great Anker deals.</p><h2>Best overall charger deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>Need something new to watch? The Disney Plus, Hulu, and Max streaming bundle is finally available. This cost-cutting deal brings all three <a href="https://zdcs.link/kn0KW?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=streaming%20platforms&object_type=article&object_uuid=01o0nAzeBm8q9pNwnX7kll6&short_url=kn0KW&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">streaming platforms</a> together to bring you big savings on a wide selection of TV shows and movies that you don't have to shell out the big bucks to take advantage of. In fact, you can save up to 38% when you subscribe, a significant drop when compared to signing up for all three services independently of one another. </p><p>As of July 26, you can get the <a href="https://zdcs.link/kn0KW?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Disney%20Plus%2C%20Hulu%2C%20and%20Max%20Bundle&object_type=article&object_uuid=01o0nAzeBm8q9pNwnX7kll6&short_url=kn0KW&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Disney Plus, Hulu, and Max Bundle</a> starting at just $16.99 per month for the ad-supported tier. That's 34%, or $8.98, off its normal price of $25.97. Alternatively, you can get the ad-free tier for $29.99 monthly, which is 38%, or $17.98, off its normal price of $47.97. This bundle deal is open to everyone, even if you're a previous subscriber. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Each subscription grants access to content from Disney, ABC, HBO, Hulu, FX, Warner Bros., Pixar, and more. You'll also get access to B/R Sports, though there's no ESPN Plus available as with the Disney Trio bundle. It's important to note that with these services, you'll still get ads even if you choose the ad-free bundle on some content, as the services note when you sign up for your account. You'll also need to sign in to each service separately, as they're only united in terms of pricing, not logins (though MyDisney lets you log in to Hulu and Disney Plus with the same email address). </p><p>If you've been waiting for a good reason to sign up for or resubscribe to any of these services, now's a good time to do so. </p>]]></content:encoded>

This brings the price down from $99.99 to $69.99, saving you $30. This is the iced coffee maker's lowest price on record according to price tracker <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0BS4KVNBH" target="_blank">camelcamelcamel</a>. The last time we saw the price dip this low was back in December, so we don't recommend waiting around for it to pop up again. </p><p>The Keurig K-Iced takes iced coffee seriously: to brew the perfect cup, it brews at a hotter temperature to start in order to get the most flavor out of the coffee, then cools down so there's minimal melt from the ice. Mugs up to seven inches tall can fit with the Keurig, perfect for your tall travel tumblers. You can elect for a stronger brew, and adjust the cup size. We also love that it has a 42-ounce reservoir, allowing you to brew up to four cups before you have to refill. </p><p>Start making delicious iced coffee at home when you score the <a href="https://zdcs.link/MVPJg?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Keurig%20K-Iced&object_type=article&object_uuid=03a6x83kJTSXynoYJoUn0Mq&short_url=MVPJg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Keurig K-Iced</a> at its lowest price today at Amazon. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you have an <a href="https://mashable.com/article/xbox-series-x-review" target="_self">Xbox</a>, tacking on a Game Pass membership is a necessity. At least, we think it is &mdash; it's one of the best deals in gaming, after all. Who wouldn't want unlimited access to a <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-streaming-services" target="_self">Netflix-style</a> library of games to download and play from whenever you please? That's true gaming freedom right there (and a huge money-saver). </p><p>Luckily, one of our favorite deals in gaming consistently becomes an even better deal by going on sale, and right now is one of those times. As of the time of this writing, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate memberships are on sale at Amazon for up to $15 off the usual price (Amazon has their MSRP prices listed incorrectly &mdash; you can find the accurate prices on <a href="https://zdcs.link/joApq?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Xbox%27s%20direct%20site&object_type=article&object_uuid=01xthu0b1QYRaXjyidAtsPX&short_url=joApq&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Xbox's direct site</a>).

<p>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is simple in its concept. You pay a monthly fee, and in return you get access to a massive library of games both old and new to download and play from whenever you want. It's that simple. It's a fantastic deal for anyone who plays <em>a lot</em> of games, or for those who prefer to test out new titles before committing to playing the whole thing (and without paying full price). </p><p>With the Ultimate version of Game Pass, you'll also get some extra perks like online play, access to the PC Game Pass library, exclusive deals and discounts, and more. How could you pass all that up? We certainly couldn't.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Hell, even <em>Deadpool 2 </em>got a PG-13 edit with <a href="https://mashable.com/video/once-upon-a-deadpool-ryan-reynolds" target="_self"><em>Once Upon a Deadpool</em></a><em>. </em>But when the R-rated violence and gore of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/logan-movie-review-film-wolverine-hugh-jackman-x-men" target="_self"><em>Logan</em></a><em> </em>collides with the dirty mouth of Deadpool,&nbsp;do you want to bring your children the theaters?&nbsp;</p><p>That's a decision that we'll leave entirely up to you. After all, you know your kid better than us. But to help you make a decision that's best for your family, allow us to be your guide to the "mature" content of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/deadpool-and-wolverine-review" target="_self"><em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine,</em></a><em> </em>with minor spoilers.&nbsp;</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>If your kid has already seen <a href="https://mashable.com/video/cinefix-logan-timeline" target="_self"><em>Logan</em></a><em> </em>and/or the first two Deadpool movies, you might think there's nothing in this team-up offering that'll shock 'em. But as Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman resurrect the MCU through brute force and star power, they bring with them some genuinely jarring on-screen carnage.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, in the movie's opening, Wade Wilson (Reynolds) desecrates a certain iconic grave and uses the contents inside as weapons in a very bloody melee against some TVA soldiers. More graphic, though, is a later scene in which another (arguably less popular) hero is flayed alive.</p><p>Notably, both of these scenes have a comedic tone, so maybe that'll soften the blow for kiddos.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Is there drug use in <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em>?</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Drug references, yes. Plenty! Drug use? Very little.&nbsp;</p><p>Blind Al (Leslie Uggams) is back, and her drug of choice (cocaine) is the source of a lot of jokes once more. You can get a taste of that at <a href="https://mashable.com/video/deadpool-and-wolverine-trailer" target="_self"><u>the end of this trailer</u></a>.

<p>Yes. There's nothing so bawdy as the holiday-themed sex position montage of <em>Deadpool</em>. But there's plenty of references to the Merc with a Mouth's mound and its various states of arousal, including his mid-fight proclamation, "I am soaking wet right now."&nbsp;</p><p>Otherwise, there's some close-ups of Deadpool's red-clothed crotch in a suit-up montage, with the tailor's hand running over the area. Deadpool jokes the guy's a "predator." But the phrase that might get curious kiddos asking you an awkward question is when Deadpool uses the phrase "whiskey dick" when a drunk Wolverine's claws don't grow quite as long as we're used to.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How scary is <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em>?</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The graphic violence is often balanced with madcap humor, and its impact lessened by the simple fact that the titular heroes both have quick-healing abilities. But there's a new level of MCU WTF in the character of Cassandra Nova (Emma Corrin). The evil twin of Charles Xavier, Cassandra has all the telekinetic power of Charles with none of his pesky conscience to hold her back. Plus, her spin on probing minds is way more disturbing, because she really gets her hands into it. Literally. </p><p>We've seen Deadpool hop around with broken bones, regenerate baby legs, and blow himself to bits. But nothing in a Deadpool movie will prepare you (or the youngsters) for Cassandra probing her long fingers into a human skull as if it's Play-Doh. The way she grips Mr. Paradox (Matthew Macfadyen) by the face like he's a rotten piece of fruit she plans to drag across town may well bring nightmares. </p><h2><strong>How much cursing is in <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em>?</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>A fuckton. Take a look at the <a href="https://mashable.com/video/deadpool-and-wolverine-teaser" target="_self"><u>red-band trailers</u></a> for a sense of it.

Long before Twitter likes, Facebook statuses, or Instagram boyfriends, this early form of social media ushered millennials into a DIY HTML platform where you could share your likes, diary entries, and photos&nbsp;while <em>also</em> ruthlessly ranking your friends. This unique generational anxiety is captured with brilliant wit and poignancy in <em>D&igrave;di.</em>&nbsp;</p><p>The directorial debut of writer/director Sean Wang, <em>D&igrave;di</em> is a coming-of-age story that feels personal while avoiding the pitfalls of self-mythologizing or navel-gazing. The premise of a 13-year old Taiwanese American boy learning to be true to himself and nicer to his mother might sound a bit austere. Far from indulgent or meandering, it's radiantly vulnerable and utterly electrifying.&nbsp;</p><p>Wang rejects sentimentality and nostalgia, embracing a ruthlessly authentic look back at being a teen in the days of MySpace and <a href="https://mashable.com/archive/aim-not-dead-yet" target="_self">AIM</a>. More than just set dressing, these online elements offer an unguarded access to the fickle thoughts and reckless impulses of a teen desperate to be seen but terrified of being perceived. But there's much more to <em>D&igrave;di </em>than Wang's mindful employment of antique social media.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>D&igrave;di </em>is about the summers that define us.&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>It's the summer of 2008 in the cozy Northern California town of Fremont. Kids are throwing parties, flirting in parks, and skateboarding wherever they can. In the midst of all this is Chris Wang (Izaac Wang, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/raya-and-the-last-dragon-review" target="_self"><em>Raya and the Last Dragon</em></a>), who begins the summer by navigating the nightmare terrain of a boy/girl pool party. <em>D&igrave;di </em>won't deliver the soul-shaking secondhand embarrassment of Bo Burnham's heralded coming-of-age summer drama <a href="https://www.riotmaterial.com/bo-burnhams-eight-grade/" target="_blank"><em>Eighth Grade</em>.</a> Nor will it reach the lunacy of the 2000s-set buddy sitcom <a href="https://mashable.com/article/pen15-season-2-part-2-review-immigrant-moms" target="_self"><em>PEN15</em></a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/pen15-season-2-part-2-review-immigrant-moms" target="_self">.</a> Instead, Wang charts a course all his own by exploring the warring identities of its young hero through his many names.&nbsp;</p><p>Among his school friends, who are all Asian, he goes by Wang Wang, and he's a foul-mouthed goofball, game for anything. At home, he is D&igrave;di, which in Mandarin is a pet name meaning Little Brother. There he vacillates between being playful with his finger-wagging grandmother Nai Nai (Chang Li Hua), mercurial to his devoted mom Chungsing (Joan Chen), and in squawking battles with his surly older sister Vivian (Shirley Chen). But when he befriends some older skaters &mdash;&nbsp;most of whom are white &mdash; he code-switches, introducing himself as Chris and eagerly insisting he can be the "filmer" to capture their sick moves on video, so they might score a skateboarding sponsorship. (The dream of '00s teens before the rise of influencers!) Meanwhile, his AIM handle is Bigwang510.&nbsp;</p><p>So, when he gets some much-yearned-for face time with his crush Madi (Mahaela Park), this kid on the brink of high school is not sure how to introduce himself. He fumbles, telling her his name is Chris but that his friends call him Wang Wang. When Madi asks what she should call him, it's not an easy answer&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;because who will he be to her?&nbsp;</p><h2>Izaac Wang leads a terrific ensemble.&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The child actors of <em>D&igrave;di </em>had to be taught about T9 word, the antiquated texting tool demanded by old-school flip phones equipped with only 9 keys. But they show no struggles embodying the '00s-era dialogue of gleeful juvenalia with barbs like, "Your mom is gay," and the hushed (and hilarious) response, "Dude &mdash;&nbsp;his mom has <em>cancer!"</em> In these frantic exchanges, Wang welcomes us back into the teen world, where talk about dental braces and dead squirrels can make or break friendships.&nbsp;</p><p>Here's where AIM and Myspace come into play. When a group hang gets messy, Wang Wang worries his best friend Fahad (Raul Dial) has outgrown him. In the instant messenger window, he types, "Are we still friends?" but doesn't hit send. Admittedly, it's a cliche to have a character type out the feelings they can't say aloud, but it's a cliche for a reason. Who among us hasn't started to text someone and then second-guessed hitting send?&nbsp;</p><p>Across Wang Wang's countenance, there are flickers of frustration, sadness, and anxiety. But at his fingertips is technology that allows him to express what he can't bring himself to say out loud. A similarly revealing exchange with Madi over AIM ends with him blocking her instead of admitting his own vulnerabilities. These repressions fester into outbursts against his mom, where he's so sharp that even his new friends question why he's being so mean. Something's got to give, and even as we witness Wang Wang deliver some snarling burns and unfair insults, you can't help but root for him to figure himself out &mdash;&nbsp;and hug his mom!&nbsp;</p><h2><em>D&igrave;di </em>is a must-see coming-of-age movie, an instant classic.&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The way Wang weaves these elements of technology with his hero's rocky self-discoveries is elegantly done, even when the journey is purposefully not. There's a suitable chaos to <em>D&igrave;di </em>that reflects the tumultuousness of the teen mind. One moment Wang Wang is a loving goofball, playing the fool to make his friends and family laugh. The next, he's a sparkler of rage and recrimination, setting off fiery remarks until he runs out of fuel. Then he seems on the brink of an emotional breakthrough &mdash; or breakdown. And all of it is achingly raw and relatable.&nbsp;</p><p>Wang doesn't idealize or sanitize his teen characters, and thus they feel unflinchingly real. It's hard not to think of <em>Eighth Grade </em>or <em>Minding the Gap </em>or <a href="https://mashable.com/article/sundance-2018-movie-roundup" target="_self"><em>Skate Kitchen</em></a> while watching Wang Wang, as each of these excellent movies explore the heady joys and crushing despair of being young and impressionable. But <em>D&igrave;di </em>doesn't pale in comparison to any of these. Instead, it feels like a part of their friend group, vibrant in spirit, agonizing in anxiety, and cathartic in its journey. But most of all, like these other critically heralded films, <em>D&igrave;di </em>is unforgettable.&nbsp;</p><p>When I first walked away from the film, I was charmed. But I also haven't been able to shake it. Be it the joltingly authentic performances of its young ensemble, the shrewd edit that throws audiences back into '00s chat rooms and all the drama they entail, or the frenzied excitement that bursts through in Wang Wang's revels, my mind went back again and again, making me laugh and cringe once more.&nbsp;</p><p>In the end, <em>D&igrave;di </em>isn't just a good coming-of-age movie or a great coming-of-age movie. <em>D&igrave;di </em>is unquestionably one of the most poignant and very best movies of the year.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/gl6de?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=D%C3%ACdi%20opens%20in%20theaters%20July%2026.&object_type=article&object_uuid=07zFStaTbjKn4cpi5Htu702&short_url=gl6de&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><em>D&igrave;di </em>opens in theaters July 26.</a></p><p class="mx-auto">

<p>From the mind of Rose Glass (writer/director of 2020 standout <a href="https://mashable.com/article/saint-maud-ending-explained-hidden-details" target="_self"><em>Saint Maud</em></a>) comes the "gnarly masterpiece" <em>Love Lies Bleeding</em>. It stars Kristen Stewart, newcomer Katy O'Brian, Ed Harris, Jena Malone, Anna Baryshnikov,&nbsp;and Dave Franco sporting mullets, perms, and all things inherently '80s. A twisted romance that is "as harrowing as it is tender" and "as horny as it is horrifying," as <a href="https://mashable.com/article/love-lies-bleeding-review" target="_self">Mashable film editor Kristy Puchko</a> put it, <em>Love Lies Bleeding</em> has earned a top spot on our list of the best films of 2024. And now it's officially available to stream at home.</p><p>Here's everything you need to know about how to watch <em>Love Lies Bleeding</em>.</p><h2>What is <em>Love Lies Bleeding </em>about?</h2><p>Set in New Mexico in the '80s,<em> Love Lies Bleeding</em> follows the kismet relationship between loner gym manager Lou (Kristen Stewart) and amateur bodybuilder Jackie (Katy O'Brian), who is headed through town to Vegas in pursuit of her dream: dominating a bodybuilding competition. What follows is a lethally loyal love that ignites violence and pulls them deep into the dangerous web of Lou's criminal family. </p><p>"There are movies that grab you by the throat. There are movies that punch you in the gut. <a href="https://mashable.com/video/love-lies-bleeding-trailer-kristen-stewart" target="_self"><em>Love Lies Bleeding</em></a><em> </em>is both, and I fucking love it," Mashable's Kristy Puchko writes in her review.</p><p>Take a sneak peek at the <a href="https://mashable.com/video/love-lies-bleeding-trailer" target="_self">trailer</a>: </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

<h2>Is <em>Love Lies Bleeding </em>worth watching?</h2><p>After <em>Challengers</em>, we've named <em>Love Lies Bleeding</em> the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-movies-2024" target="_self">best movie of 2024</a> (so far) &mdash;&nbsp;and other critics largely agree. On <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/love_lies_bleeding_2024" target="_blank">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/love-lies-bleeding-rose-glass-interview" target="_self">Rose Glass-directed movie</a> has earned a "certified fresh" 94 percent critic rating and 82 percent audience rating. It wasn't exactly a <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt19637052/" target="_blank">box office</a> hit or anything, pulling in just $12.5 million total worldwide, but it was also a limited release. Plus, box office numbers aren't always reliable. </p><p>As Mashable's film editor put it, "<em>Love Lies Bleeding </em>is a gnarly masterpiece, and you're gonna want to see it on a big screen with the best sound system possible."</p><p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/love-lies-bleeding-review" target="_self"><em>Read our full review of Love Lies Bleeding</em></a>.</p><h2>Is <em>Love Lies Bleeding </em>streaming?</h2><p><em>Love Lies Bleeding</em> officially hit streaming on July 19, about four months after it made its theatrical debut.

<p>If you don't mind ads, a Max monthly subscription will cost you $9.99 per month. You can easily sign up for a single month and watch <em>Love Lies Bleeding</em> as many times as you want, then cancel before you're charged for another month. However, if you're in it for the long haul, you can save some money by signing up for an annual plan instead. It costs $99.99 per year, which breaks down to just $8.33 per month instead. That's 16% cheaper than paying monthly, but you'll have to pay it in full upfront.</p><h3><strong>Best Max deal with no ads:</strong> <a href="https://zdcs.link/XDP5y?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Save%2016%25%20on%20a%20Max%20Ad-Free%20annual%20subscription&object_type=article&object_uuid=020jxbSDY6WOb8PsO0FL3lC&short_url=XDP5y&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><strong>Save 16% on a Max Ad-Free annual subscription</strong></a></h3><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>For an ad-free viewing experience, you have two options: Max Ad-Free and Max Ultimate Ad-Free. The basic Max Ad-Free plan costs $16.99 per month, while Max Ultimate goes for $20.99 per month. If you choose to pay upfront for the year, however, it'll cost you just $169.99 per year (about $14.17 per month) or $209.99 per year (about $17.50 per month) instead. That's a total savings of 16% on either plan.</p><p><em>Note: Both tiers offer an ad-free viewing experience, but the Ultimate tier steps things up with 4K Ultra HD video quality and Dolby Atmos immersive audio.</em></p><h3><strong>Best Max deal for Cricket customers: <a href="https://zdcs.link/DdXMW?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Free%20Max%20with%20ads%20for%20customers%20on%20the%20%2460%2Fmonth%20unlimited%20plan&object_type=article&object_uuid=020jxbSDY6WOb8PsO0FL3lC&short_url=DdXMW&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Free Max with ads for customers on the $60/month unlimited plan</a></strong></h3><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>While obviously not the cheapest option for watching <em>Love Lies Bleeding</em>, you can get more bang for your buck in the long run by bundling Max with Hulu and Disney+. This new bundle offers all three services with ads for only $16.99 (reg. $25.97) per month &mdash; that's 35% in savings.

But over the course of 16 years and over 30 movies, the MCU has not only brought scads of comic book heroes and villains to theaters; it also changed the landscape of Hollywood releases as we know it. </p><p>Looking back, it's dizzying to recall all the details of the adventures and disasters of Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Black Panther, the Hulk, Doctor Strange, Ant-Man, Spider-Man, the Guardians of the Galaxy, Captain Marvel, and their ever-expanding ensemble. But for whenever you want to delve into a rewatch, we've got your back with this guide to the good, great, and the ugly. </p><p>With <a href="https://mashable.com/article/deadpool-and-wolverine-review" target="_self"><em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em></a><em> </em>hitting theaters, we've updated our ranking of the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe, factoring in epic action, crackling comedy, wowing star power, and harrowing disappointments. </p><p>Here are the MCU movies ranked worst to best. </p><h2><strong>34. <em>Iron Man 2</em> </strong>(2010)</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>A tepid followup to the sleek brilliance of <em>Iron Man</em>, <a href="https://youtu.be/BoohRoVA9WQ" target="_blank">the sequel gives us a sinister yet funny Mickey Rourke</a> but does the franchise no favors with its creative decisions. We meet Black Widow, but not without some classic 2010 misogyny, which is the root problem with <em>Iron Man 2</em>. The first film was all about Tony's growth as a person, and the second doesn't let him mature nearly as much. There's still a long road before this is the Tony we see in <a href="https://mashable.com/article/avengers-endgame-review" target="_self"><em>Endgame</em></a>, but it's too slow on that path. <em>&mdash; Proma Khosla, Entertainment Reporter</em></p><h2><strong>33.<em> The Incredible Hulk</em></strong> (2008)</h2><p>Sure, it's part of the MCU canon, but <em>The Incredible Hulk</em> was so aggressively meh that its title character got recast and was only made palatable by <em>The Avengers</em>. Since it's not an origin story, <a href="https://youtu.be/xbqNb2PFKKA" target="_blank">we don't get to watch Edward Norton as Bruce Banner becoming the Hulk</a>; he already is. We don't watch him fall in love with Betty (Liv Tyler), because he already is. What we do get is a lot of the big green guy getting angry, which may have been cool in 2008 but pales compared to the visual effects that followed.<em>&mdash; P.K.</em></p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2><strong>32.<em> Avengers: Age of Ultron</em></strong> (2015)</h2><p><a href="https://youtu.be/lPpfK1K1qNU" target="_blank"><em>Ultron</em></a><a href="https://youtu.be/lPpfK1K1qNU" target="_blank"> has a lot of good moments but is not overall a good movie</a>. It's sloppy and it drags, even with ambitious action sequences in Sokovia, and it struggles to build Ultron's disdain for humanity. The main Avengers have a fun dynamic &mdash; look no further than the party scene at Stark Tower &mdash; but the new characters don't fit in (especially since <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9GFyZ5LREQ" target="_blank"><em>X-Men: Days of Future Past</em></a> basically owns Quicksilver). Black Widow, at the time robbed of a solo movie, gets a disproportionate consolation prize of becoming Hulk's girlfriend and a woman defined by her biology. <em>&mdash; P.K.</em></p><h2><strong>31. <em>Thor: The Dark World</em></strong> (2013)</h2><p><em>The Dark World</em> brings back Natalie Portman as Jane, yet even as the physical host of a <em>literal Infinity Stone</em>, she's somehow underutilized. There's a lot of levity, particularly between Thor and Loki, and a surprising amount of gravity in Loki's "death" &mdash; which is once again undone before the movie ends. Oh, and some dude named Malekith is mad... Don't worry about it. <em>&mdash; P.K.</em></p><h2><strong>30.<em> Eternals</em> </strong>(2021)</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>With no familiar faces and little connection to the wider MCU, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/eternals-review" target="_self"><em>Eternals</em></a> had a gargantuan task set forth from the start. Helmed by Oscar&ndash;winner Chlo&eacute; Zhao, the film introduces no less than <a href="https://mashable.com/article/eternals-myth-names" target="_self">a dozen new characters</a>, a rushed history of their cosmic presence on Earth, an apocalyptic threat in the form of Earth becoming a Celestial, and&nbsp;an explanation for how the entire Marvel Universe was created. It's sometimes slow, sometimes muddled, and a little too enthralled with its white male antihero &mdash; but it's also a visual feast, a huge victory for representation, and a banger of a soundtrack. <em>&mdash; P.K.</em></p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>The third installment of the Ant-Man movies committed the crime of forgetting to be funny. Instead, the wackiest Avenger (Paul Rudd) was wedged into a convoluted plot and pounded with eyesore CGI by Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), <a href="https://mashable.com/article/marvel-villains-ranked" target="_self">a MCU villain who fell far short</a> of dazzling us with his dastardliness. Not even Michelle Pfeiffer as a badass superheroine could save this stinker. As I wrote in <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-marvel-review" target="_self">our review</a>, "<em>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania </em>has big stars, quirky cameos, action sequences, world-building, and even &mdash;&nbsp;on rare occasions &mdash;&nbsp;punchlines. But it's barely a movie, pulling threads together for a grander scheme of merchandizing and cross-promotion over character-based storytelling." &mdash; <em>Kristy Puchko, Entertainment Editor</em></p><h2><strong>28. <em>Doctor Strange </em></strong>(2016) </h2><p>Iron Man minus the charisma, it took five years for Marvel to retread this territory and make Strange interesting in time for Phase 4. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wfbh3eHbakY" target="_blank">Benedict Cumberbatch is great, but he's always great</a>, so let's not give out free brownie points. <em>Strange</em> received appropriate flack for whitewashing Asian characters and lore for the story, and tragically sidelines Rachel McAdams in every way.

<p>Writer/director James Gunn returns to the helm of the spin-off film series he began with 2014's <em>Guardians of the Galaxy. </em>But post-Snap, these rock-loving rascals who race through the universe on misadventures have become way less fun. </p><p>In <em>Vol. 3, </em>once-plucky Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) is in mopey, drunken mourning. Wise-cracking Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) is out of commission after an assault from newcomer baddie Adam Warlock (Will Poulter). Meanwhile, the rest of the crew must drag their captain around on a series of heists to save their ailing furry friend. Drax (Dave Bautista) and Mantis (<a href="https://mashable.com/video/guardians-of-the-galaxy-pom-klemtieff-mantis" target="_self">Pom Klementieff</a>) offer solid laughs, and big bad The High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji) brings a vivacious villain into play. However, Gunn has bogged down his plot with <a href="https://mashable.com/article/guardians-of-the-galaxy-3-bat-people" target="_self">bummer elements</a>, including eugenics, genocide, and a shocking amount of animal abuse and gore. If you're seeking humor and rollicking fun, keep looking. As I wrote in our<a href="https://mashable.com/article/guardian-of-the-galaxy-volume-3-review" target="_self"> full review of the film,</a> "<em>Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 3 </em>is a major disappointment." &mdash; <em>K.P. </em></p><h2><strong>26. <em>Thor: Love and Thunder </em></strong>(2022)&nbsp;</h2><p>Writer/director Taika Waititi and leading man Chris Hemsworth made magic with <em>Thor: Ragnarok, </em>leaning into the God of Thunder&rsquo;s lovable himbo vibe to create a rock 'n' roll romp. But when they reteamed for this fourth installment of the <em>Thor </em>franchise, the fun was sacrificed to a grim plotline of kidnapping, god-killing, and cancer. </p><p>On the plus side, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/thor-love-and-thunder-review" target="_self"><em>Thor: Love and Thunder</em></a> brought Natalie Portman back to the MCU as a brawny female Thor, cast Christian Bale in a grizzly villain role that he giddily sunk his teeth into, and tossed in a rowdy Russell Crowe for good measure. But amid the screaming goats and rumbling action sequences, <em>Love and Thunder</em> had an overstuffed plot that undercut its emotional moments, some notable <a href="https://mashable.com/article/thor-love-and-thunder-omnipotence-city" target="_self">wasted opportunities</a>, and a happy ending that was far more forced than feel-good. It&rsquo;s not <em>Dark World </em>bad, but it sure ain&rsquo;t good.&nbsp;&mdash; <em>K.P. </em></p><h2><strong>25. <em>The Marvels</em></strong> (2023)</h2><p>Directed by <a href="https://mashable.com/article/candyman-review" target="_self"><em>Candyman</em></a> helmer <a href="https://mashable.com/video/candyman-nia-dacosta-juneteenth-bts" target="_self">Nia DaCosta</a>, this sequel to <a href="https://mashable.com/article/captain-marvel-why-i-love" target="_self"><em>Captain Marvel</em></a><em> </em>brings together that eponymous heroine (Brie Larson), <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-marvels-review" target="_self">Ms. Marvel (Iman Vellani)</a>, and <em>WandaVision</em>'s<em> </em>Captain Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) for a star-trekking quest to save the universe from yet another rampaging alien conqueror (Zawe Ashton). Worlds and tones collide, making for an uneven romp through action sequences, far-flung planets, and a winsome duet featuring K-drama star Park Seo-joon. Plus, there's a fleet of cuddly, creepy space cats. But for all the fun these treats and rising star Vellani brings, <em>The Marvels </em>feels too rushed, wonky, and fitfully brooding to be truly stellar. &mdash; <em>K.P.</em></p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2><strong>24.<em> Thor</em></strong> (2011)</h2><p><em>Thor</em> isn't a top Marvel movie, but it's a classic fish-out-of-water story that teases how much fun this character will be in time. The film also gives us our first dose of Loki, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/spider-man-homecoming-vulture-mcu-villain-ranking" target="_self">one of Marvel's best villains to this day</a>. It's easy to forget the magnetism and subtlety of Hiddleston's original performance, and <em>Thor </em>is one of Loki's best arcs: The sensitive sibling growing up in Thor's shadow and coming to terms with the truth about his past.</p><p>(Also, Chris Hemsworth's eyebrows are blonde, and it's terrible.) <em>&mdash; P.K.</em></p><h2><strong>23. <em>Ant-Man and the Wasp</em></strong> (2018)</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>In some ways, <a href="https://youtu.be/UUkn-enk2RU" target="_blank"><em>Ant-Man and the Wasp</em></a> is more even-keeled and sure-footed than its predecessor. It delivers zippy action, tons of laughs, and the nicest cast of characters we've ever seen in the MCU. Mostly this movie is just so <em>sweet</em>, whether it's Scott bending over backwards to impress his darling daughter or Hope and Hank going to great lengths in memory of Janet. Oh, and speaking of Hope, she more than holds her own as the MCU movies' first true leading lady. &mdash; <em>Angie Han, Deputy Entertainment Editor</em> </p><h2><strong>22.<em> Iron Man 3</em> </strong>(2013)</h2><p><em>Iron Man 3</em> lets Tony get vulnerable as he faces his post-<em>Avengers</em> PTSD. The film gives ample time to guest stars Rebecca Hall, Guy Pearce, and Ty Simpkins, all the while remaining true to Tony's internal struggle and getting in a few CGI battles.

Set in a Wakanda still grieving the loss of King T'Challa, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/black-panther-wakanda-forever-shuri-review" target="_self"><em>Black Panther 2</em></a> smartly wove the weight of grief into its story, exploring mourning and legacy while setting up a thrilling new foe and sea-salty adventure. Letitia Wright, Lupita Nyong'o, Angela Bassett, Winston Duke, and Danai Gurira reprise their roles, while Dominique Thorne and Tenoch Huerta join the cast as kid genius Riri Williams and underwater overlord Namor. </p><p>By bringing in big emotions alongside big action, co-writer/director Ryan Coogler and company do right by the franchise Boseman once shouldered.

<p>The first Deadpool movie since Disney acquired 20th Century Fox &mdash; and with it, much more Marvel IP &mdash; <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine </em>teased a showdown comic book fans have been craving for ages. (Or at least since <em>X-Men: Origins: Wolverine </em>shit the bed in a disastrous fashion.) </p><p>Directed by Shawn Levy (<a href="https://mashable.com/article/free-guy-review" target="_self"><em>Free Guy</em></a>), this sequel saw the worlds of <em>Deadpool 2 </em>and <em>Logan </em>collide, bringing in familiar faces and new additions, like the vicious Mr. Paradox (Matthew Macfadyen) and the diabolical Cassandra Nova (Emma Corrin). But best of all was the reunion of Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman as the titular twosome. While the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/deadpool-and-wolverine-review" target="_self">movie wasn't as daring as we hoped for a Deadpool movie</a>, this threequel was still undeniably a deranged blast, packed with bonkers action, wild jokes, and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/deadpool-and-wolverine-cameos" target="_self">jaw-dropping surprises.</a> &mdash; <em>K.P. </em></p><h2><strong>17.<em> Ant-Man</em> </strong>(2015)</h2><p>Kudos to this film for bringing us Paul Rudd in the MCU, the thing you didn't know you needed. Rudd lends dimension and heart to his performance as Scott Lang, a reformed criminal and father to an adorable little girl. His chemistry with Evangeline Lilly crackles (even if they saved her good stuff for the sequel), and Scott's everyman persona makes him an irresistible addition to the hero roster. Michael Pe&ntilde;a shines as Scott's best friend, and Corey Stoll seems born to be a villain, even though it's Michael Douglas as Hank Pym who steals the show with his embittered quest for revenge. <em>&mdash; P.K.</em></p><h2><strong>16. <em>Spider-Man: Far From Home</em> </strong>(2019)</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Long before <em>Iron Man </em>hit, Sam Raimi was shaping the superhero genre with his wacky and wild <em>Spider-Man </em>trilogy.

This one polarized critics, with some celebrating Raimi bringing his weirdness to the MCU machine, while others fretted this massive franchise tamed the <em>Evil Dead</em> director&rsquo;s aesthetic. But fans were freaking out over the devious delights of Raimi's brand of horror and havoc, like ripping a beloved character to ribbons and finally bestowing on Elizabeth Olsen the meaty Scarlet Witch twist she'd been begging for. The result may be chaotic, but amid all the mayhem, there's plenty of madcap fun.&nbsp;&mdash; <em>K.P. </em></p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Cynics expected Marvel&rsquo;s first theater-exclusive film in over two years to fail. It introduced brand-new characters as well as a dense mythology and an unknown lead. Not to mention, a good chunk of it is in Mandarin. The movie ended up <a href="https://mashable.com/article/shang-chi-marvel-box-office-labor-day" target="_self">shattering box office records</a> and being <a href="https://mashable.com/article/shang-chi-and-the-legend-of-the-ten-rings-review" target="_self">one of the best MCU stand-alones in a long time</a>, with huge stakes, rich characters, and transfixing family drama. Its jaw-dropping action sequences flex some of the best fight choreography in the MCU and Hollywood at large (bus battle, anyone??). Simu Liu belongs in the MCU, and we can't wait to see more of him in future phases. Can we find a way to get more Tony Leung too? <em>&mdash; P.K.</em></p><h2><strong>10. <em>Captain America: Civil War</em></strong> (2016)</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p><em>Civil War</em> could be a tighter movie, but it's doing a hell of a lot. Picking up with the fallout of <em>Avengers: Age of Ultron</em> and <em>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</em>, this movie thoroughly interrogates the toll of our heroes' adventures and divides them harshly on how to move forward. Black Panther and Spider-Man make epic MCU debuts, while secondary Avengers like Vision, Scarlet Witch, and Ant-Man still get their moments. The final fight is brutal as Cap and Tony come close to actually killing each other, and don't even reconcile before the credits roll. <em>&mdash; P.K.</em></p><h2><strong>9. <em>Avengers: Endgame </em></strong>(2019)</h2><p>The final chapter of the Infinity Saga and of three phases, 22 movies, and 11 years of the MCU stuck the landing and made it look easy.

Downey is the perfect hubristic Tony Stark, an arrogant billionaire sobered by becoming a prisoner of war.

<p>After introducing Tom Holland as the MCU's Spider-Man in <em>Captain America: Civil War</em>, this Peter Parker got to standout in his first solo movie, and it was <a href="https://mashable.com/article/spider-man-homecoming-movie-review" target="_self">an absolute delight</a>. Co-writer/director Jon Watts combined the low-stakes high school drama of crushes and crushing embarrassment with a high-stakes battle against Michael Keaton's blue-collared supervillain, the Vulture. Add in Marisa Tomei, Jacob Batalon, Donald Glover, and Zendaya in charismatic supporting turns, and you've got a coming-of-age movie that is as charming as it is pulse-pounding. <em>&mdash; K.P. </em></p><h2><strong>4.<em> Thor: Ragnarok</em></strong> (2017)</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The MCU had S.H.I.E.L.D. infiltrated by Hydra and completely changed the game for the Avengers' alliance. <em>Winter Soldier</em> sets the stage for Cap and Iron Man's feud in <em>Civil War</em>, and for Steve and Bucky's <s>love affair</s> renewed friendship. It charmingly and skillfully introduces Falcon and has no less than four fighting female characters, none of whom functions as a love interest. <em>Winter Soldier</em> isn't trapped in one genre; it's a spy thriller disguised as a superhero movie and all the better for it. <em>&mdash; P.K.</em></p><h2><strong>2<em>. The Avengers</em></strong><em> </em>(2012)</h2><p>With this team-up, the MCU cemented itself as a force to be reckoned with. </p><p>The combined star power of Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, and Tom Hiddleston was dazzling. But this rousing narrative also showcased the complicated dynamics of the Avengers, their distinctive strengths and weaknesses, as well as the glory of Loki. The Marvel movies would go on to struggle to create a villain whose charms stood up to their dashing heroes, and the fan fervor for Hiddleston's spin on the god of mischief was so intense he'd not only be resurrected (repeatedly) but also would get <a href="https://mashable.com/article/loki-season-2-review" target="_self">his own spin-off series</a>.

<p>Even the worst MCU movies are kind of good, which means that the best ones are truly exceptional &mdash; none more than <em>Black Panther</em>. </p><p>Ryan Coogler, along with his talented cast and crew, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/black-panther-movie-review" target="_self">crafted a film that has something to say, that feels distinctive in its style and point of view</a> &ndash; while also delivering on the usual superhero movie goods, like lovable heroes, exciting action, and a compelling villain. Chadwick Boseman's T'Challa feels fittingly regal, surrounded by admirable supporting players like Michael B. Jordan, Letitia Wright, Angela Bassett, and Danai Gurira. Though it took far too long for Marvel to bet on a Black superhero at the box office, it paved the way for the kind of representation we want and need in future phases.</p><p><em>Angie Han, Alison Foreman, and Proma Khosla contributed to this article</em>.</p><p class="mx-auto">

For Sonos users, this was a big deal, as the Sonos app is an important way to interact with a home audio system and music library.</p><p>At first, Sonos was defensive, claiming that the app overhaul took "<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/9/24152675/sonos-new-app-bad-reviews-response-statement" target="_blank">courage</a>." Now, in an open <a href="https://www.sonos.com/en-us/blog/update-on-the-sonos-app" target="_blank">letter published on the company website</a>, Sonos CEO Patrick Spence admitted that the app overhaul has been a disaster. </p><p>"We know that too many of you have experienced significant problems with our new app which rolled out on May 7, and I want to begin by personally apologizing for disappointing you," he wrote. "I assure you that fixing the app for all of our customers and partners has been and continues to be our number one priority."</p><p>According to Spence, the numerous fixes the company has released since May have "enabled the majority of our customers to have a robust experience using the Sonos app."</p><p>He then lists a number of planned updates to be released from July to October and, frankly, one look at the items on that list and it's easy to understand just how botched this app update has been. The updates include "improving the stability when adding new products," "improving Volume responsiveness," "user interface improvements based on customer feedback," and "improving overall system stability and error handling."

"><p>As the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/paris-olympics-2024-opening-ceremony-livestream" target="_self">2024 Olympic Games</a> commence, the world's top athletes will float down the Seine, walk under the shadow of the Eiffel Tower, and compete in the 33rd iteration of the centuries old competition. Backing their push for the podium &mdash; resting in the technologically adept hands of coaches, athletes, and viewers, alike &mdash; is a more modern player: <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ai-child-sex-abuse-materials-dark-web-apple" target="_self"><u>AI</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The International Olympic Committee (IOC) published its "<a href="https://stillmed.olympics.com/media/Documents/International-Olympic-Committee/AI/Olympic-AI-Agenda.pdf" target="_blank">Olympic AI Agenda</a>" earlier this year, a "holistic approach to explore the great potential of AI, while mitigating the risks," the organization explained. The agenda set out a future-forward list of goals, which include game optimization, talent detection, and the "reduction of human bias." Many of those are being tested for the first time in Paris.</p><p><a href="https://mashable.com/category/intel" target="_self">Intel</a>, an Olympic Partner since 2017, is the event's 5G, Process, and AI platform partner, with the latter title more relevant than ever at the 2024 games.

<p>Sarah Vickers, head of Intel&rsquo;s Olympic and Paralympic program, told Mashable that she believes AI will have its biggest Olympic impact in areas like event operations, the data-hungry world of broadcasting, and the fan experience itself.&nbsp;</p><p>"The Olympic ecosystem has had a rough couple of years," Vickers said outside of the company's on-the-ground AI Lab in Paris. "Now, if you think about it, all of the dynamics of the traditional games are back. There&rsquo;s fans in the stands, there&rsquo;s lots of people moving around, there&rsquo;s a lot of operational challenges. The other thing is that the expectations of the user and of athletes have changed. They are used to having information at their fingertips. It&rsquo;s this perfect timing for us to be able to demonstrate how we&rsquo;re showing AI everywhere.&rdquo;</p><p>Intel isn't the only company fulfilling Olympic dreams through AI. On Monday, Google, Team USA, and NBCUniversal announced an <a href="https://www.nbcuniversal.com/article/google-team-usa-and-nbcuniversal-strike-new-partnership-using-google-search-and-other-ai-powered" target="_blank"><u>official partnership</u></a> that named the tech giant Team USA's "Official Search AI Partner." The deal will see Google's AI offerings combined with live NBC coverage, game explanations, and user Olympic searches.&nbsp;</p><p>The IOC is revving up its AI game in a period of intense growth across the tech industry, with the hope of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/21/olympic-viewership-2024-paris-olympics/" target="_blank"><u>bringing back historic viewer numbers</u></a> and, more subtly, cutting costs &mdash; but even they have to consider the wider implications of AI. In conversation with Vickers on Intel's <a href="https://www.iheart.com/podcast/1119-technically-speaking-an-i-122782029/episode/season-2-episode-8-the-smartest-196163236/" target="_blank"><u>Technically Speaking</u></a> podcast, Ilario Corna, Chief Information Technology Officer at the IOC, said that the IOC is thinking as intensely about trust as it is innovations, which may soon mean building their own "OlympicGPT."</p><p>As the IOC and its partners dive head first into AI, many of the games' biggest swings may go undetected by its audience, operating behind-the-scenes at the world's most historic sporting event.&nbsp;</p><h2>AI is helping digitize the competition</h2><p>Intel has been leading the game's growing technology investments for years, including the opening ceremony show at the 2022 Beijing games, which featured hundreds of Intel Premium drones. Those games also saw the arrival of artificially intelligent platforms. But Paris offers the first time many of Intel's tech will be deployed at scale.&nbsp;</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Generative AI, for example, will make its opening appearance in the hands of athletes, far away from viewers, as part of the Games' Athlete365 app. A brand new IOC Assistant Chatbot, powered by Intel's Gaudi 2 generative AI platform, can answer match and regulation questions for participants. Machine learning, meanwhile, is being used to create a safer environment for athletes. Both the IOC and Intel are hailing new AI-boosted tech used to detect cyber abuse and online harassment thrown at athletes from online hecklers &mdash; an issue highlighted by Simon Biles' frank <a href="https://mashable.com/article/simone-biles-olympics-mental-health" target="_self"><u>conversations about mental health</u></a> following the 2020 Olympics.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking at the IOC's AI Agenda launch, American skier Lindsey Vonn told attendees that this could be life-changing: "The fact that AI will be able to, in real time, take these comments down, and not only that, but also be able to help them prosecute people&hellip; that is huge. Because that will, I think, change the dynamics of social media."</p><p>The IOC's larger AI plans include platform support for anti-doping organizations and athlete education on health, safety, and technology. Intel's computer vision and other data visualization tech will also offer teams individualized analysis of performance that can build out better, safer recovery plans and even predict potential injuries, Corna explained &mdash; in addition to what many contend could be medal-winning coaching and training assistance and improved judging.</p><div class="content-block-mashable-video mt-8">

</div>
<h2>AI is finding ways to make the games more accessible&nbsp;</h2><p>AI and AR are stepping in to assist guests and athletes with disabilities, as well. Intel has launched new wayfinding tech, powered by onsite LiDAR devices and the company's OpenVINO technology, to provide turn-by-turn, real-time indoor navigation for those who are blind or have low vision. It's based on an ongoing Intel indoor navigation partnership with <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-goodmaps-safe-indoor-navigation.html#gs.cn3b6l" target="_blank"><u>GoodMaps</u></a>. The same gamut of Intel AI tech at the Olympic games are also supporting athletes at the Paralympic games, with Vickers and others seeing future potential for AI support in rapid on-site translation and accessibility needs.&nbsp;</p><p>AI is now being used to even out the playing field for Olympic hopefuls, too, through AI-supported scouting. The technology is known as 3D Athlete Tracking, or 3DAT, which captures computer vision data of athletes, processed on Intel's AI platform, and spits out 3D biomechanical reports. The IOC has tested this in areas with historic gaps in resources and funding, like among athletes in Senegal.&nbsp;</p><p>"The possibilities for the deployment of AI within sport represent a ground-breaking opportunity for the global accessibility of sport," wrote the IOC in the release of this year's AI Agenda.&nbsp;</p><h2>AI is leading the Olympics into a data-enhanced future&nbsp;</h2><p>Advancements in AI are bringing the Olympics up to par with other sectors. Vickers hailed the use of AI to create highly tailored highlight reels, selected and cut together based on the preferences and interests of viewers themselves, as one of the foremost ways AI will revolutionize the games. That's because it'll cut down on looming issues of speed and access, especially for broadcasters, and appeal to the growing desire for personalization among AI proponents.&nbsp;</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>There's industry-changing potential here, too. Intel's Deep Learning Boost is creating the Olympics' first end-to-end 8K live streaming experience for online audiences, and making mass data sets available to reporters and broadcast teams in real time. Meanwhile, Intel's volumetric capture technology is quite literally changing how athletes may appear on screens in the future.</p><p>Housed in the athlete Olympic village, Intel is powering a 360 degree, 3D image generating studio that can scan athlete's likenesses and render 3D versions of themselves &mdash; it's a fun AI-powered gag for athletes to send back home, but also the most likely way we'll engage with holograms on live TV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><q>
    "The AI experience is not changing what&rsquo;s at the heart of the games, which is the athletes."
            <footer>- Sarah Vickers</footer>
    </q>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll capture the athlete in the 3D studio, and that can be sent to anywhere in the world," Vickers explained. "It could be a virtual broadcast studio in the U.S., India, anywhere in the world. And it will look like the athlete is on stage with the host. It&rsquo;s going to look real, that they&rsquo;re standing side by side.&rdquo;</p><p>The IOC sees digital advancements like these as cost-cutting moves to make the game and its athletes more accessible to all, while also decreasing its "broadcast footprint," or the environmental impacts of live broadcasting at scale; That's, of course, ignoring AI's hotly debated environmental impact.&nbsp;</p><p>As viewers keep an eye on medal counts, the new Team USA and Google partnership will see Olympic information integrated into the search platform's new AI Overviews and generative AI assistant, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-io-2024-gemini-15-flash-pro-ai-model-update" target="_self">Google Gemini</a>. Actor and "Chief Superfan Commentator" Leslie Jones is set to use Gemini during her coverage of the games on NBC's Peacock.&nbsp;</p><p>The popularization of human-like AI assistants at large is joining with the tradition of Olympic commentators in other ways, too. Announced last month, NBC is offering customized, 10-minute long Olympic updates for Peacock users, all done in the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/al-michaels-ai-olympics-peacock-nbc" target="_self"><u>AI voice of famous sportscaster Al Michaels</u></a>. As NBC clarified again in a later press briefing, viewers don't need to worry in the age of nonconsensual deep fakes: Michaels gave full consent for the use of his voice and likeness.&nbsp;</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>And AI's being used before, during, and after the games' run. New, highly-detailed 3D models of Olympic facilities (known as "Digital Twins") allow broadcasters, event planners, and teams to navigate their Olympic experience ahead of time, or even design entire coverage plans virtually. This can make it easier to envision potential navigation hurdles for attendees and logistic coordinators considering accessibility. Looking to the future, this could involve a model for making real-time adjustments for those with disabilities, Vickers explained.</p><p>The list is far from over: AI is also powering Olympic archive digitization, so that the memorabilia of the games can live on forever in virtual repositories.&nbsp;</p><p>"The AI experience is not changing what&rsquo;s at the heart of the games, which is the athletes," Vickers said. "We&rsquo;re trying to improve the experience for everyone, whether that be the athlete or the fan, but it&rsquo;s not going to change the fun of the sport. It&rsquo;s only going to make it better."</p><h2>AI's Olympic efforts raise more questions of security and privacy&nbsp;</h2><p>But concerns about the integration of AI around the games remain. The French government has noted its plans to use private sector AI technology to "conduct pervasive and persistent surveillance before, during, and after the Games," <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91158664/paris-olympics-ai-mass-surveillance-security-privacy-laws-eu" target="_blank"><em><u>FastCompany</u></em></a> reported, as the growing Olympic stage spurs more and more security risk. In April, France's office of the Prime Minister negotiated a decree allowing the government expanded abilities to wiretap; collect geolocation, communications, and computer data; and capture even more visual and audio data from civilians. This adds to a far-reaching, experimental video surveillance system that uses AI-powered cameras to flag potential security risks.&nbsp;</p><p>Privacy advocates raised heads about similarly pervasive surveillance, as well as digital security risks, at the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/world-cup-ehteraz-hayya-app-privacy" target="_self"><u>2022 FIFA World Cup</u></a>.&nbsp;Vickers says the French government's AI plans have no overlap with what's happening inside the games. Intel's <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/opinion/how-intel-refining-approach-responsible-ai.html#gs.colqfw" target="_blank">Responsible AI</a> team is navigating a world of data privacy laws and internal security to keep their systems controversy free, she says, working in tandem with the Olympic planning committee. </p><p>As the multifaceted investments of the Paris games make clear, AI is all around us. &ldquo;It is everywhere," agreed Vickers. "But the athletes are core to what we&rsquo;re doing, and that&rsquo;s going to remain the same.&rdquo;</p>]]></content:encoded>

The game is all about finding the "common threads between words." And just like <em>Wordle</em>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-20-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> resets after midnight and each new set of words gets trickier and trickier&mdash;so we've served up some hints and tips to get you over the hurdle.</p><p>If you just want to be told today's puzzle, you can jump to the end of this article for July 26's <em>Connections</em> solution. But if you'd rather solve it yourself, keep reading for some clues, tips, and strategies to assist you.</p><h2><strong>What is <em>Connections</em>?</strong></h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. Like <em>Wordle, </em>you can share the results with your friends on social media.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

The game is all about finding the "common threads between words." And just like <em>Wordle</em>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-20-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> resets after midnight and each new set of words gets trickier and trickier&mdash;so we've served up some hints and tips to get you over the hurdle.</p><p>If you just want to be told today's puzzle, you can jump to the end of this article for July 25's <em>Connections</em> solution. But if you'd rather solve it yourself, keep reading for some clues, tips, and strategies to assist you.</p><h2><strong>What is <em>Connections</em>?</strong></h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. Like <em>Wordle, </em>you can share the results with your friends on social media.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Whether you need a digital copy of a book or to send in some late homework for uni, a scanner can be a great tool. But with your laptop, smartphone, earbuds, and other gadgets, not everyone has the budget for a dedicated scanner. iScanner is an iOS app that turns your iPhone into a scanner, letting you create high-quality scans and PDFs in seconds.&nbsp;</p><p>This is your chance to get a <a href="https://zdcs.link/71gp8?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=lifetime%20subscription%20to%20iScanner&object_type=article&object_uuid=07lmR3G5OEeXJ8HOJfRn5T7&short_url=71gp8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">lifetime subscription to iScanner</a> while it&rsquo;s 85% off.&nbsp;As of July 22, this app has been marked down to just &pound;23.31. And in addition to the app itself, you'll also get 200 MB of cloud storage included with your purchase.</p><p>It can't do your homework for you, but this app can at least make it easier to submit, make digital copies of readings from class, and quickly share files with your mates and teachers. iScanner is an OCR scanner, meaning it can recognise text from almost any scannable object. The benefit here is that you can basically take a picture of a page and turn it into a searchable document.&nbsp;</p><p>Once a document is scanned, users can edit, e-sign it, or even add stamps. iScanner&rsquo;s editing features are great for refreshing an old document into a new print. Colour correct, remove curves and warps, and minimise noise with a few clicks. Store scans as multipage PDFs or JPEG files that are easy to share, or add a password and protect confidential scans behind a PIN.</p><p>Documents aren&rsquo;t the only thing iScanner can read. Point it at a passport or ID and get a digital copy in moments. iScanner even counts similar objects and can solve typed or handwritten math equations. Use the area measurement feature to find out just how much room there actually is in a dorm or flat.&nbsp;</p><p>Scan a paper or a room with this versatile iOS app. Get a <a href="https://zdcs.link/71gp8?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=lifetime%20subscription%20to%20iScanner&object_type=article&object_uuid=07lmR3G5OEeXJ8HOJfRn5T7&short_url=71gp8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">lifetime subscription to iScanner</a> for your iPhone or iPad for just &pound;23.31 (reg. &pound;155.80) &mdash; no coupon needed.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After the credits roll on <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine </em>&mdash; accompanied by behind-the-scenes footage from prior Fox Marvel projects &mdash; we rejoin Deadpool at the Time Variance Authority's headquarters. He tells us he's had it with the accusations that he got Johnny Storm (<a href="https://mashable.com/video/chris-evans-roles-captain-america" target="_self">Chris Evans</a>) killed in an encounter with Cassandra Nova (<a href="https://mashable.com/video/netflix-the-crown-emma-corrin-josh-connor" target="_self">Emma Corrin</a>). </p><p>Remember, in that first meeting, Deadpool told Cassandra that Johnny went off on a nasty tirade about her. The insults sound like something straight out of the Deadpool playbook, so of course it seems like Deadpool is throwing Johnny under the bus. </p><p>Turns out, Deadpool did not utter a single lie. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>In the post-credit scene, Deadpool uses TVA technology to revisit his journey to Cassandra's lair with Johnny and Wolverine. We see Johnny deliver the anti-Cassandra rant word for word, including a bit at the end about how she could rip his skin off and reduce him to a pile of organs. Looks like he got his wish!</p><p>Even though Evans is playing Johnny Storm in this moment, <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine </em>is banking on audiences primarily associating him with the role of Captain America to get the biggest laugh here. Remember the guy who called out Tony Stark's (Robert Downey Jr.) language? Now he's saying someone can "lick [his] cinnamon ring." What a difference several years and a billion-dollar acquisition makes.</p><h2><strong>But wait, what happened to Thor in <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em>?</strong></h2><p>This is a fairly straightforward end-credit scene, but it is somewhat confusing that <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine </em>chooses to revisit this moment instead of paying off a gag from the first half-hour of the movie.</p><p>When Mr. Paradox (Matthew Macfadyen) first shows Deadpool scenes from the MCU at the TVA, we get a glimpse of a crying Thor (<a href="https://mashable.com/video/chris-hemsworth-hot-ones" target="_self">Chris Hemsworth</a>) holding a fallen Deadpool in his arms. Deadpool asks about it, but Paradox orders him not to get ahead of himself. Surely that means we'll get a Thor scene later, right? <em>Right</em>?</p><p>Wrong! Thor is nowhere else to be found in the rest of <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em>, not even in the end-credits scene. Is there a deleted scene out there? Is this 4D chess, teasing what's to come in a future Avengers<em> </em>movie? Or did <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine </em>just forget to give one of its many jokes a punchline? For now, we're going to guess the latter.</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/pgP8Z?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Deadpool%20%26%20Wolverine%20is%20now%20in%20theaters.&object_type=article&object_uuid=05AWoAFcz6kI4vVcGQwBYRR&short_url=pgP8Z&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine </em>is now in theaters.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The honor of First Cameo in <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine </em>goes to Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau), head of security at Stark Industries (and former chauffeur) who's appeared in the <em>Iron Man </em>movies, the <em>Spider-Man </em>movies, and <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>. </p><p>In a 2018-set scene, he rejects Wade Wilson's (Ryan Reynolds) application to become an Avenger.

<p>Our first <em>real </em>Avenger in <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em> is none other than Thor (Chris Hemsworth), the god of thunder himself. Deadpool sees him on one of the screens at the TVA, holding a wounded Deadpool in a scene that looks remarkably similar to Loki's (Tom Hiddleston) death in <em>Thor: The Dark World</em>. </p><p>The TVA's Mr. Paradox (Matthew Macfadyen) shuts the screen off before we can see more of the scene, telling Deadpool not to get ahead of himself. But the movie never revisits that moment &mdash; not even in the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/deadpool-and-wolverine-end-credit-scene-explained" target="_self">end-credits scene!</a> &mdash; leaving us without closure on Thor and Deadpool. &mdash; <em>B.E.</em></p><h2>Blink and you'll miss The Incredible Hulk.</h2><p>On Deadpool's quest across the multiverse to find a new Wolverine, he runs across a Logan  who is mid-fight with The Incredible Hulk. Since we see so little of this version of the Hulk, it's unlikely to be any iteration we've seen in Marvel's films. Instead, this moment pays tribute to the classic match-up between Wolverine and the Hulk, which we've seen in comics like the <em>Ultimate Wolverine vs. Hulk </em>miniseries, and even the 2009 animated film <em>Hulk Vs</em>. &mdash; <em>B.E.</em></p><h2>Henry Cavill is Wolverine (aka Cavillerine).</h2><p>The DCEU's former Superman crosses over into the MCU in <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em>, with Henry Cavill briefly showing up as a Wolverine variant. (This is the only one Jackman doesn't play in the film.) He shows up during Deadpool's hunt for a new Wolverine, and while nothing comes of <em>this </em>particular partnership, his presence is a bit of a mic drop for the rivalry between DC and Marvel. (The real question: Is his Wolverine more of a Man of Adamantium or a Man of Steel?) &mdash;<em> B.E.</em> </p><h2>Chris Evans is back as Johnny Storm, The Human Torch. </h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The Void is where the TVA pitches variants it doesn't want mussing up its sacred timeline. In <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em>, that means a motley crew of past X-Men foes, all united under the skull-probing fist of Charles Xavier's evil twin Cassandra Nova (Emma Corrin). Riding up on the dumped Deadpool and Wolverine all <em>Fury Road</em>-style are <em>X-Men'</em>s snarling Sabretooth (Tyler Mane) and tongue-slinging Toad (Ray Park), <em>X2's </em>fire-flinging Pyro (Aaron Stanford) and razor-fingered Lady Deathstrike (Kelly Hu), and <em>X-Men: First Class</em>' demonic Azazel (Jason Flemyng). Plus, they've got a version of the Juggernaut (not the one who got anally electrocuted in <em>Deadpool 2</em>). &mdash; <em>Kristy Puchko, Entertainment Editor</em></p><h2>Giant Man is there too!

<p>The Void isn't only for bad guys. When Deadpool and Wolverine battle to a breaking point in the wilderness, they're taken in by a kindly crew of four. And among them is the baddest vampire slayer the MCU has even known. </p><p>Beginning in 1998, Wesley Snipes played the eponymous dhampir across three movies: <em>Blade, Blade II, </em>and <em>Blade: Trinity</em> (in which Ryan Reynolds co-starred as Hannibal King!). Fans have been hoping for Blade to rise again for years. In 2019, the MCU promised a reboot that would recast the title role to Mahershala Ali. While Snipes publicly supported the move, affirming Ali would <a href="https://www.themarysue.com/wesley-snipes-shows-support-for-mahershala-ali-as-blade/" target="_blank">"do great"</a> in the part, there's no denying the thrill of seeing Snipes himself back in the sunglasses and leather cloak. And while the reboot is still <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/news/general-news/timeline-blade-reboot-delays-1235028358/" target="_blank">ostensibly set for 2025</a>, it's been hitting snags along the way. &mdash; <em>K.P</em>.</p><h2>Dafne Keen is all grown up but still our Laura/X-23.</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

But it's good for the soul to see her back with Jackman, growling and sharing hard truths over a campfire.  <em>&mdash; K.P. </em></p><h2>Channing Tatum is Gambit at long last. </h2><p>The sheer chaos of this! The card-slinging hottie with a heavy Cajun accent has been a fan favorite in the X-Men animated series, but he kept being excluded from the movies. While Tatum has been rumored to be attached to the part since the 2000s, it just never worked out. In 2009's loathed <em>X-Men Origins: Wolverine, </em>Gambit finally made the cut &mdash;&nbsp;but the role went to Taylor Kitsch. </p><p>For years, a Gambit solo movie was talked about but never came together. Perhaps it's fitting that <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine </em>is where Tatum finally stepped into the X-Men's cowl. After all, <em>Origins </em>was also where Reynolds debuted as Deadpool, albeit a version fans loathed who'd get killed off in the post-credits shenanigans of <em>Deadpool 2</em>. So, why not use this <em>Deadpool</em> sequel to right the wrong of missing out on Tatum's take on that accent, thicker than a granny's gumbo? <em>&mdash; K.P. </em></p><h2>Blake Lively stars as Ladypool.

<p>Being Deadpool is a family business: Look no further than the casting for Deadpool variants Ladypool and Kidpool. Blake Lively, who is married to Reynolds, takes on the role of Ladypool, while their daughter Inez Reynolds plays the foul-mouthed Kidpool.</p><p>These are far from the only Deadpool variants on display in the film. We also meet Nicepool (Reynolds), Dogpool, Headpool (aka Zombie Deadpool), Babypool, and so, so, so many more.

<p>Alioth isn't the only <em>Loki </em>star spotted in <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em>, as TVA agent Hunter B-15 (Wunmi Mosaku) shows up during the movie's climax to investigate Mr. Paradox's illicit activities. While she's not around for long, she does inform Deadpool that his universe is no longer doomed. We love a cameo who also doubles as the bearer of good news! &mdash; <em>B.E.</em></p><h2>Taylor Swift, Emma Stone, and Zazie Beetz are not in <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine. </em></h2><p>After charming as Domino in <em>Deadpool 2</em>, Zazie Beetz dipped to the DC side of superhero movies to play Arthur Fleck's caring neighbor in <em>Joker</em>. She's also set to appear in the sequel, <a href="https://mashable.com/video/joker-folie-a-deux-trailer" target="_self"><em>Joker: Folie &agrave; Deux</em></a><em>. </em>But sadly, Beetz didn't make the birthday party in <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine. </em></p><p>When images of Ladypool hit the web, fans were quick to speculate on who could be behind that mask and high ponytail. Lively was a popular pick, as was the couple's noted bestie, Taylor Swift, who's been known to walk with a slo-mo swagger in her music videos. Some speculated that Reynolds himself could be Ladypool, given Deadpool's dexterity in high heels as seen in the <em>Deadpool 2 </em>music video "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX11yw6YL1w" target="_blank">Ashes</a>."</p><p>The last actress at the center of fans' Ladypool speculation was Emma Stone, who played Gwen Stacy in <em>The Amazing Spider-Man</em> movies. Some pondered if Marvel might look to their Spider-verse for inspiration and bring Stone in as a nod to the comic book character Gwenpool. Sure, the colors for that merc are pink and white, but don't let things like simple facts stand in the way of your fancast dreams.  <em>&mdash; K.P. </em></p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/pgP8Z?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3B%3B%3Btemplate=video&amp%3B%3B%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3B%3B%3Belement=offer&amp%3B%3B%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3B%3B%3Belement_label=Deadpool%20%26%20Wolverine%20hits%20theaters%20July%2026.&amp%3B%3B%3Bobject_type=video&amp%3B%3B%3Bobject_uuid=01LOgWZ73pf12d0X1Yz6mHZ&amp%3B%3B%3Bshort_url=pgP8Z&amp%3B%3B%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Fvideo%2Fdeadpool-and-wolverine-teaser&amp%3B%3Btemplate=article&amp%3B%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3B%3Belement=offer&amp%3B%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3B%3Belement_label=Deadpool%20%26%20Wolverine%20hits%20theaters%20July%2026.&amp%3B%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3B%3Bobject_uuid=02sgrwGwNRAzCTK3lcsKfwt&amp%3B%3Bshort_url=pgP8Z&amp%3B%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Fdeadpool-wolverine-popcorn-bucket-dune-2&amp%3Btemplate=article&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=Deadpool%20and%20Wolverine%20is%20now%20in%20theaters.&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=05AWoAFcz6kI4vVcGQwBYRR&amp%3Bshort_url=pgP8Z&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fhelios-preview.mashable.com%2Farticle%2Fdeadpool-and-wolverine-end-credit-scene-explained&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Deadpool%20%26%20Wolverine%20is%20now%20in%20theaters.&object_type=article&object_uuid=03mmpFKU7tiJEeXOvIRUnBX&short_url=pgP8Z&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine </em>is now in theaters.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

Why? Many internet users have adopted the practice of adding "Reddit" to the end of whatever they are searching for so they can find conversations and opinions from real people. Whether it be product reviews or travel recommendations, many people are looking to search within Reddit's archives of discussions to find what they want.</p><p>Now, however, there seems to be only one search engine where users can actually do this.</p><p>As first discovered by the tech outlet <a href="https://www.404media.co/google-is-the-only-search-engine-that-works-on-reddit-now-thanks-to-ai-deal/" target="_blank"><u>404 Media</u></a>, Reddit has started blocking the vast majority of the internet's search engines from crawling and indexing their website. This means that Reddit posts are no longer coming up in search results for users on these platforms.</p><p>There is one exception though where users can still search Reddit &ndash; and that's Google.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2><strong>Which search engines are affected and why?</strong></h2><p>Searching Reddit now on popular search engines like Microsoft's Bing and DuckDuckGo turn up scant recent results from <a href="http://Reddit.com" target="_blank">Reddit.com</a>. As 404 Media reports, more recent Reddit links aren't turning up because they weren't crawled and indexed before Reddit made the change.</p><p>A Mashable attempt to search Bing for any result from <a href="http://Reddit.com" target="_blank">Reddit.com</a> using "site:<a href="http://reddit.com" target="_blank">reddit.com</a>" over the past week turns up zero results.</p><p>Reddit <a href="https://www.redditinc.com/blog/robot-txt-update" target="_blank"><u>announced</u></a> it was making a change to its Robots Exclusion Protocol (robots.txt) on its website on June 25. At the time, the company noted that it was making the change due to a surge of bots scraping its website. It did not seem from the statement at the time that this meant that organizations and platforms that legitimately help the broader internet and its users would be affected.</p><p>"Reddit believes in an open Internet, but not the misuse of public content," Reddit's protocol reads.</p><p>Blocking search engines entirely from Reddit would certainly be a controversial move on its own. However, there is one search engine that is pulling up recent search results from Reddit: Google, the search engine that has a financial relationship with the Reddit.</p><h2><strong>Google and Reddit's relationship</strong></h2><p>Earlier this year, Reddit and Google <a href="https://mashable.com/article/reddit-traffic-google-search-update" target="_self"><u>entered</u></a> into a $60 million deal that allows the search giant to use Reddit's content to train its AI models.</p><p>In statements provided to multiple outlets, Reddit states that its recent changes aren't related to its partnership with Google&nbsp;</p><p>"We block all crawlers that are unwilling to commit to not using crawl data for AI training, which is in line with enforcing our Public Content Policy and updated robots.txt file," Reddit said in a statement provided to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/search-engines-that-dont-pay-up-cant-index-reddit-content-172949170.html?src=rss" target="_blank"><u>Engadget</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Engadget also claimed a source indicated that Reddit was excluded from search because Microsoft would not agree to the platform's terms regarding AI.</p><p>Reddit's move &mdash; if the speculation is true &mdash; seems fairly unprecedented, and highlights the hazards of a potential future where search engines become pay-to-play for even organic search results. Mashable has asked Reddit for comment, and will update this story if we find out more.</p>]]></content:encoded>

She is the horticulturist of the <a href="https://mashable.com/video/stephen-colbert-kamala-harris-brat-coconut-tree-memes" target="_self">communal coconut tree</a> that we did <em>not</em> just fall out of. Or just as much the harvester of the apple tree that we <em>did</em> spawn from, if you live by the philosophy of British icon Charli XCX. It's a <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/story/kamala-harris-chappell-roan-femininomenon" target="_blank"><u>Kamalaminomenon</u></a>, in the words of skyrocketing pop star Chappell Roan.</p><p>When President Biden announced <a href="https://mashable.com/article/biden-dropout-kamala-reactions" target="_self">he'd be stepping off the campaign trail</a>, he threw his support behind Vice President Kamala Harris, pegged as the best choice to replace him in the 2024 presidential election.&nbsp;It was clear that Harris' team was poised and ready for the shake-up. Almost immediately<strong>, </strong>the Biden/Harris HQ social media branding was transformed into the newly "<a href="https://mashable.com/article/charli-xcx-brat-memes-lime-green" target="_self"><u>chartreuse</u></a>" green Kamala HQ, and a spot blasting the inspiring notes of Beyonc&eacute;'s "Freedom" hit screens days later.&nbsp;She <a href="https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-fundraising-democrat-president-biden-trump-434a55ea1eb29e5da92cc9b1f9cb401f" target="_blank"><u>broke fundraising records in the first 24 hours after Biden's announcement</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>It seemed the presidential hopeful was making a new claim in direct response to what the Biden administration represented: An aging ticket, against a similarly aged opponent, that simply wasn't up to speed with what the under-34 vote demanded. Brats and femininomenons and coconut trees were Kamala's &mdash; sorry, Harris' &mdash; weapons. They were Harris' &mdash; no, Kamala's &mdash; new PR strategy.</p><p>Therein lies the problem (or one of them, anyway). Past the memes and pop music, how were supporters supposed to refer to the Vice President now? "Vice President" surely wasn't pulling in the viral likes. Is it "Kamala HQ"? Or the "Harris campaign"? Is "<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/01/opinion/drew-barrymore-kamala-harris.html" target="_blank"><u>Momala</u></a>," as Drew Barrymore tried to make happen, <em>ever</em> appropriate?</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>"Now is a good time to pay attention to the way people are referring to her. Are they referring to her as Kamala? If so, this is a common practice which de-legitimizes a woman in politics. Making a more casual and informal reference to the politician, makes them appear softer and less of a contender. We see this very commonly throughout politics in the United States," said Maggie Perkins in the caption of a viral <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@itsmaggieperkins/video/7394212926632004895?_r=1&amp;_t=8oJiJfGP3kZ" target="_blank"><u>TikTok video</u></a> from July 22. Posting "Kamala 2024" is very different from "Harris 2024," said Perkins, drawing parallels to the use of acronyms like "AOC" and "<a href="https://mashable.com/article/ruth-bader-ginsburg-pop-culture-moments" target="_self">RBG</a>" and the marketing of the Stacey Abrams campaign. "If you think I am overreacting, I would encourage you to pay attention to the way that the media refers to her and the way that other politicians refer to her."</p><p>Non-Black creators flocked to the note, fearing that they were playing a part in the denigration of a potentially history-making campaign and forcing another woman of color into the trappings of respectability politics. As writer Charles M. Blow wrote in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/01/opinion/drew-barrymore-kamala-harris.html" target="_blank">a <em>New York Times</em> opinion piece</a> from May, following backlash to Barrymore's use of the term "Momala," "Black women and girls spend their entire lives in flight from a society insistent on de-individualizing and dehumanizing them, insistent on forcing them to fit broad generalizations... In this case, the stereotype at play is that of the mammy &mdash; the caretaker, the bosom in which all can rest, the apron on which we have a right to hang."&nbsp;</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>But others online, predominantly Black women and women of color, felt differently.

Her own campaign branding uses "Kamala," they pointed out, and, in many ways, it is a reclamation of her heritage to use her first name &mdash; especially as her own peers refuse to learn its <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/07/kamala-harris-name-how-to-pronounce-pronunciation-indian.html" target="_blank"><u>proper pronunciation</u></a>, decades into her political career. This was the least of our worries, they noted, and unhelpful virtue signaling.&nbsp;</p><p>Popular creators, like childhood educator <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mrs.frazzled" target="_blank"><u>@mrs.frazzled</u></a>, began referring their followers to a series of videos posted by Erika Harrison, also known as <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@blackgirlswhobrunch" target="_blank"><u>@blackgirlswhobrunch</u></a>. "We call [politicians] by their most distinct name. With Kamala, her last name Harris is not very distinctive, but her first name is," Harrison said in one <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@blackgirlswhobrunch/video/7394622228949634334?_r=1&amp;_t=8oJigFfd6fm" target="_blank"><u>video</u></a>. "Y'all are trying to defend her in this way that she never asked for, and it is ironic because she has always campaigned around her first name. I get what y'all are trying to do here, but I'm gonna be very direct here: White women, this is a waste of your time."</p><p>Harrison was one of nearly 44,000 Black women who attended a post-announcement virtual call with <a href="https://www.winwithblackwomen.org/" target="_blank">Win With Black Women</a> earlier this week &mdash; a <a href="https://19thnews.org/2024/07/win-with-black-women-zoom-call-harris-organizers/" target="_blank"><u>record-breaking meeting</u></a> that saw nearly Black women organizers convening to game-plan the Harris campaign and discuss the path forward.&nbsp;</p><p>In the span of just three days, online sentiments shifted: What started as a call to action that using the name "Kamala" was a form of systemic misogyny or even <a href="https://mashable.com/article/misogynoir-black-women-sexism-racism" target="_self">misogynoir</a>, became the idea that using her first name is a sign of cultural and political respect.

<p>In 2015, the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/06/the-mononymy-trap/395861/" target="_blank"><em><u>Atlantic</u></em></a> referred to the trend of "mononymy" (or single name usage) as a trap created by an "informal age of unearned familiarity" in society at large, but especially among voters. For the author, political candidates, who were ever more inclined to use their first names (Take "Jeb" for Jeb Bush, "Bernie" for Bernie Sanders, even "Beto" for Beto O'Rourke), were worryingly shifting into marketing themselves like celebrities. But voters have long clamored for the personalization of their elected leaders (as well as their <a href="https://people.com/all-about-kamala-harris-stepchildren-8681626" target="_blank">families</a>), and politicians, both men and women alike, seem to view the "first" versus "last" decision as a question of marketing.<strong> </strong>Long before the aughts trend and the Harris campaign's "<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/25/kamala-harris-election-tiktok-fancam/" target="_blank">meme army,</a>" there was a lineage of acronyms (JFK, RFK) and nicknames ("Ike" and "Teddy") that feel, in many ways, just as informal and just as famous. </p><p>All politicians are making carefully crafted branding choices, handpicked for the electorate that will put or keep them in power. When made by women leaders, and especially women of color, those decisions may just have father reaching implications.   </p><p>When former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ran in 2016, her "I'm With Her" and "Hillary for President" branding leaned into the familiarity, and femininity, of her first name; neither of these were the official slogan, "Stronger Together." There was debate even then: Was "Hillary" an important differentiator from her husband's presidential term, or yet another way to minimize her bid for leader of the free world? </p><p>Days after the announcement, Harris' and Clinton's campaigns were <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/the-lessons-of-hillary-clinton-for-kamala-harris-vs-trump.html" target="_blank">already under comparison</a>. Parallels to other notable female historical figures trickled through headlines, including <a href="https://www.kvue.com/article/news/history/kamala-harris-shirley-chisholm-black-woman-presidential-nomination/269-0189b144-1eaf-4399-80a7-c5c4f0db8dbf" target="_blank">Shirley Chisholm</a>, the first Black candidate for a major party nomination and first Black woman to run for the Democratic nomination. In 1972, Chisholm campaigned on just her last name and the slogan "Unbought and Unbossed." While much is the same, Harris is operating in a different world than Chisholm was, or even Clinton, one in which she is dividing her time between appealing to the honor-driven American masses and the fickle online contingent, not to mention her current duties as VP.&nbsp;</p><p>And many worry that institutionalized sexism and the <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/white-supremacy-returned-mainstream-politics/" target="_blank"><u>rise of white supremacy</u></a> in mainstream politics still create insurmountable odds for a progressive female President. </p><p>Harris is a seasoned politician, backed by a galvanized supporter bloc, and she has clearly drawn her own boundaries: According to her campaign's brand, Kamala is fine; in fact it might help her chances at the polls, and Harris is the professional title she'll don on stage and in session. "Brat," according to her cheeky Charli XCX-themed posting, is also fair game, as her campaign kicks off and pundits scramble to understand the "youth vote." But personal monikers, like "Momala" and even "Auntie," in her words, are a <a href="https://youtu.be/xz7rNOAFkgE" target="_blank">step too far</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The internet has received a pass on the discourse for now. The history of racism, sexism, and misogynoir in our country's politics, and the inequitable ways many of our nation's leaders have<strong> </strong>come into positions of power, aren't fodder for TikTok. And the name debate says more about our political landscape, now at the whim of online sentiments than ever before, than it does anything about the Harris campaign.</p>]]></content:encoded>

OpenAI stressed that this is a prototype &mdash; and the "best features" from the test period will eventually be integrated directly into ChatGPT. </p><h2><strong>How to try SearchGPT</strong></h2><p>Users who want to try SearchGPT can <a href="https://chatgpt.com/search" target="_blank">sign up now</a>, but the feature is not yet available for testing.</p><p>As for how SearchGPT works, it's similar to ChatGPT. You type in a query, the AI scours the internet, and then tries to bring back a variety of helpful results in a visually clean and appealing way. Users can allegedly respond to results with conversational follow-ups to get even more specific results.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>As always with OpenAI, there will be <a href="https://mashable.com/article/chatgpt-amazing-wrong" target="_self">concerns about accuracy and sourcing</a>, even before the product has launched. For instance, <a href="https://x.com/kifleswing/status/1816542216678179083" target="_blank">CNBC's Kif Leswing</a> pointed out on X (formerly Twitter) that some of the example search results given in the announcement post are inaccurate, misleading, or not helpful. OpenAI also promises "clear links to relevant sources" in results, but that can't be judged until the product is available.</p><p>OpenAI has a long way to go before it can reasonably call itself a Google competitor, but this may be a promising first step.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>Even without mopping capabilities, the self-emptying Roomba j7+ is still one of the <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-roombas" target="_self">best Roombas</a> that you could bring home &mdash;&nbsp;and it's somehow still nearly 50% off the week after Prime Day. (And for reference, its sale price <em>during</em> Prime Day was only $10 lower.) The j7 was the first Roomba to wield a front-facing camera and iRobot's stellar small obstacle avoidance technology, which I have found to be the most accurate of all the robot vacuums I've tested. On top of reliably smart mapping my apartment, the j Series Roombas have had next to no run<a href="https://mashable.com/article/prime-day-everything-you-need-to-know" target="_self"><em>-</em></a>ins with phone chargers, extension cords, or socks, and iRobot guarantees they'll steer clear of pet waste.

<p>Presented in partnership with Toyota and hosted by Savannah Sellers, the co-Anchor of NBC News' Morning News NOW, and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@bruontheradio?lang=en" target="_blank"><u>TikTokker</u></a> and radio host Josh "Bru" Brubaker, the show goes live Saturday.&nbsp;</p><p>"Our entire distribution strategy, whether it's linear streaming or social, is to make sure that we're reaching every American that we possibly can and giving them content on platforms in a voice that they're accustomed to hearing from," said Noval. <em>Spotlight on Paris</em> is just one piece of that. It's also hitting all its bases by sending 27 creators, known as "The Paris Creators Collective" to capture content in partnership with <a href="https://mashable.com/category/meta" target="_self">Meta</a>, Overtime, <a href="https://mashable.com/category/snapchat" target="_self">Snapchat</a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/category/tiktok" target="_self">TikTok</a>, and <a href="https://mashable.com/category/youtube" target="_self">YouTube</a>.</p><p>"In the last few years with the different games, [NBCUniversal] has focused on putting content out where young people already are. With [Spotlight on Paris], we want to bring the Olympic Games to them on [TikTok]," Sellers told Mashable.</p><p>Sellers says the episodes will be made with the idea that the show may be viewers' only engagement with the Olympics. "We want to make people feel like they're getting a slice of Paris, in addition to getting them to understand what's happening within the games and the events." Episodes will be filmed in front of a live audience of American fans and athletes' family members at Team USA house.</p><p>Past social partnerships, like a show run on <a href="https://mashable.com/category/twitter" target="_self">X</a>, weren't filmed on location but in NBC's studios in Stamford, Connecticut. <em>Spotlight on Paris</em> will lean heavily into the experience of being on the ground in Paris with an emphasis on culture, nightlife, food, and fashion.</p><p>Brubaker said he was brought on to bridge the gap between traditional broadcasting and the people who use their phones as their main screens. It's both Brubaker and Sellers first time covering the Olympics, and they say they are very excited about the opportunity.</p><p>"It's the Olympics, so it's gonna be gold medal standard," said Brubaker.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2><strong>How to dispose a mattress</strong></h2><p>There are several approved ways to dispose of mattress, starting with putting it out with the trash, but there are specific ways to do so without violating local disposal regulations. </p><h3><strong>Put your mattress out with the trash</strong></h3><p>In some cities like New York City, you can dispose of your mattress or box spring with your trash, but it must be sealed in a plastic bag of any color except red or orange. If you don&rsquo;t seal your mattress, it won&rsquo;t&nbsp;be picked up.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>However, it's imperative that you check out your local sanitation department website for region-specific guidelines on how to dispose a mattress. For our U.S. readers, <a href="https://restrightmattress.com/mattress-disposal/" target="_blank">click here</a> to find your state's point-of-contact that will answer all your questions regarding mattress disposal and how to do it right.</p><h3><strong>Donate your mattress</strong></h3><p>Mattresses can last for 10 years depending on the fabric, so if you&rsquo;re getting rid of yours before then, it may still have some life left in it and be worth donating. Charities that accept mattress donations include the Salvation Army, Habitat for Humanity Restore (make sure location accepts mattresses), and Furniture Bank Association of America. You can also check churches and charities near you you.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Recycle&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Recycling isn't just a trend &mdash; and it's lot easier than you may think. You can recycle your old mattress by getting in touch with a mattress recycling company that services your area. Some well-known ones are A Bedder World and Bye-Bye Mattress.&nbsp;</p><p>(Try contacting the furniture manufacturer; they just might recycle your mattress for you if you&rsquo;re purchasing a new one from them.)</p><h3><strong>Resell&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>A little extra cash never hurt anyone, so why not resell your mattress if it&rsquo;s in decent condition? You can use platforms such as Facebook Marketplace or post an ad on your social media account that could potentially intrigue a follower who may be interested in purchasing a new mattress from you. (People do it all the time, so don't think you're alone.)</p><h3><strong>Repurpose</strong></h3><p>You can get creative with the old parts of your mattress and turn them into something new.

<p>It's a dream for many of us to have our own home, or even an apartment that's large enough to require regular floor cleaning. The act itself of cleaning the floor, however, isn't usually on anyone's list of favorite activities. But in the last decade, we've seen major advances in tech that can help when it comes to keeping floors squeaky clean. Thanks to today's deal at Amazon, a do-it-all floor cleaner can be yours at a massive discount.</p><p>As of July 25, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/R0eJ1?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=dreame%20H12%20Pro%20wet%20and%20dry%20vacuum&object_type=article&object_uuid=00sk75ZqRzrG2qPP2ZPfBhz&short_url=R0eJ1&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">dreame H12 Pro wet and dry vacuum</a> is just $269.99, down from the normal price of $499.99. That's a whopping 46% discount, or a savings of $230. It's also the <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0BKZTZM19" target="_blank">lowest</a> price we've ever seen on this model at Amazon. </p><p>Welcome to the advanced world of the dreame H12 Pro wet and dry vacuum. Choose between three modes of operation: auto mode, ultra mode, and suction mode. Auto mode helps with basic cleaning, like a quick pass over the floors and rugs before friends arrive. Ultra mode is designed for deep cleaning, like when the dog comes inside after digging in the dirt. And suction mode magically vacuums up liquids without mopping. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>After you suck up spilled milk or whatever liquid off the floor, the dreame H12 Pro's ability to self-clean will certainly come in handy. This feature uses self-cleaning with hot air drying to get the brush back to its clean state and ready to take on another mess &mdash; no hand cleaning required.</p><p>The dreame H12 Pro has a max run time of 35 minutes, and it also aims to impress when it comes to cleaning hard-to-reach corners or getting close to edges and baseboards thanks to its dual-edge cleaning function. </p><p>If you dread cleaning the floors or are often left with liquid spills to clean, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/R0eJ1?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=dreame%20H12%20Pro&object_type=article&object_uuid=00sk75ZqRzrG2qPP2ZPfBhz&short_url=R0eJ1&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">dreame H12 Pro</a> might make life much easier.

When creating or editing a playlist, there might be a "Create Image" button that would let you generate art, similar to how you can <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-wwdc-keynote-2024-genmoji" target="_self">use AI to create emoji</a> in the new version of iOS.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2><strong>Can you test the new Apple Music feature now?</strong></h2><p>To be perfectly clear, the feature isn't actually usable in the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-install-ios-18-public-beta" target="_self">iOS 18 beta</a><strong> </strong>yet, so it's impossible to say exactly how it works or whether it operates smoothly. It's just referenced in some code. Heck, it may not even be ready for the launch of iOS 18 this year. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman, a prominent Apple prognosticator with a decent track record, wrote in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-16/when-is-apple-intelligence-coming-some-ai-features-won-t-arrive-until-2025-lxhjh86w?srnd=undefined" target="_blank">his newsletter</a> last month that some of Apple's AI features may be delayed into 2025. </p><p>But between AI-generated playlist art and the ability to <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-ios-18-photos-recovered-album" target="_self">potentially recover damaged images and video</a>, it's clear that iOS 18 has more left in the tank than what Apple has shown us so far.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/05f8dTFFlh0SCq0fo0UR9wh/hero-image.jpg" alt="eiffel tower with set up for olympics"><p>The <a href="https://mashable.com/category/olympics" target="_self">2024 Olympics</a> are to begin on Friday with a grand opening ceremony in Paris. And the lineup of performers is expected to chock full of stars. </p><p>There have been lots of rumors and secrecy surrounding the performers &mdash; big, big names &mdash; but first let's start with the people we now feel certain<em> </em>will be there for the opening ceremony. </p><h2>Lady Gaga</h2><p>Lady Gaga, one of the biggest pop stars in the world, is a confirmed act, <a href="https://www.timeout.com/news/the-star-studded-lineup-for-the-olympics-opening-ceremony-has-finally-been-revealed-072524" target="_blank">Time Out wrote</a>, citing the local French newspaper<em> Le Parisien</em>. What kind of performance can we expect? Well, that leads us to our next big name.</p><h2>Celine Dion</h2><p>The Canadian powerhouse vocalist is expected to perform at the opening ceremony. As <a href="https://mashable.com/article/2024-paris-opening-ceremony-celine-dion" target="_self">we wrote at Mashable this week</a>, people are very excited to see her sing after Dion took years off due to her being diagnosed with Stiff Person Syndrome. </p><p>Gage and Dion are reportedly set to perform together. They are expected to do a duet of &Eacute;dith Piaf&rsquo;s classic French song 'La Vie en Rose,' <em>The Guardian</em> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/25/lady-gaga-celine-dion-perform-duet-paris-2024-olympic-opening-ceremony" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

Time Out <a href="https://www.timeout.com/news/the-star-studded-lineup-for-the-olympics-opening-ceremony-has-finally-been-revealed-072524" target="_blank">reported</a> Nakamura, the country's most-listened to singer, is expected to perform "a Charles Aznavour classic, accompanied by the Republican Guard."</p><p>Nakamura is a French citizen who was born in Mali. It would be a triumphant performance, considering <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/26/sport/aya-nakamura-france-culture-wars-paris-2024-spt-intl/index.html" target="_blank">she was subjected racist attacks</a> about her heritage when it was rumored she would perform. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>French President Emmanuel Macron</h2><p>French President Emmanuel Macron is expected to deliver a speech once the Olympic torch is lit at the end of a procession through Paris' most famous landmarks, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/olympics/olympics-2024-opening-ceremony-watch-start-time-rcna163453" target="_blank">NBC reported</a>. Sure, it's not as exciting as a Gaga perforamnce, but it is<em> </em>a big name.</p><h2>Other French performers</h2><p>There will be a number of other French performers, Time out <a href="https://www.timeout.com/news/the-star-studded-lineup-for-the-olympics-opening-ceremony-has-finally-been-revealed-072524" target="_blank">confirmed</a>. Among them: pianist Sofiane Pamart, singers Juliette Armanet, Marina Viotti, and Philippe Katerine, the metal band Gojira, rapper Rim'K, and the drummer Cerrone. </p><h2>The other rumors</h2><p>The opening ceremony, as we mentioned, has been shrouded in a bit of secrecy. Macron himself was cagey about the plans from show's director when asked Dion's reported appearance. </p><p>"I will not reveal anything, what [opening ceremony director] Thomas Jolly and all his teams have prepared," Macron said on TV channel France 2, via <em>The Guardian</em>. "There is also a surprise."</p><p>Naturally this secrecy had led to lots of rumors. The <em>Hollywood Reporter</em> <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/lady-gaga-perform-olympics-2024-opening-ceremony-1235957365/" target="_blank">wrote that</a> Dua Lipa and Ariana Grande, two of the biggest names in pop, have been rumored. Don't get your hopes up too high, however. While Gaga and Dion have had more concrete reporting, there hasn't been much in the way of <em>proof</em> that Dua Lip or Grande will perform on Friday. Grande was <a href="https://x.com/ArianaToday/status/1816476992629243948" target="_blank">spotted</a> at an event in Paris this week, but that hardly means she'll be performing. Still, that would be an amazing line-up should it come to fruition. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Just yesterday, we <a href="https://mashable.com/article/july-24-microsoft-surface-laptop-go-3-deal" target="_self">spotlighted the Microsoft Surface Laptop Go 3</a> at a record-low $599.99. As of July 25, however, the price has dropped even lower to a new low of $549.99. Sure, the deal is only available on the ice blue version, but it's a good enough discount (31% off) that we don't mind. As shopping reporter Haley Henschel mentioned, "Our biggest gripe with it is that it costs too much compared to similarly specced laptops &mdash; but thanks to a big new price drop, that concern is currently null and void." The Go 3 features a sleek and sturdy build, an ultra-portable design, and a keyboard so good it made our reviewer want to cry. It's not a powerhouse or anything, but "it's ideal for students and busy-bee travelers in need of a portable notebook with one of the best keyboards I've ever tested."</p><p><a href="https://mashable.com/review/microsoft-surface-laptop-go-3" target="_self"><em>Read our full review of the Microsoft Surface Laptop Go 3</em></a>.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>The smallest Bluetooth tracker in Tile's lineup, the Tile Sticker is especially great for finding household objects like your remote, glasses, keys, and other stuff you regularly lose. It sticks onto items (hence the name) so you can keep tabs on things around the house. Just download the Tile app, connect your device, and tap the tracking button. Your Sticker will sound off a loud ring when its within Bluetooth range (up to 250 feet) or show you its most recent location on a map when it's outside of Bluetooth range. Snag one on sale for $19.99 as of July 25 &mdash;&nbsp;that's 33% in savings and just $1 away from its lowest price on record.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

While it looks pretty similar to the OG Pixel Watch, it packs better battery life (up to 24 hours), automatic workout detection, a new body-response sensor and skin temperature sensor to help with stress management, extra fitness features, safety tech additions, and more. The WiFi version is on sale for just $269.99 as of July 25, which is a savings of 23% and $20 cheaper than it was on <a href="https://mashable.com/article/amazon-prime-day-deal-fitbit-july-18" target="_self">Prime Day</a>.

<p>While only by a few cents, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/knmo3?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Sony%20SRS-XE200%20X-Series%20Bluetooth%20speaker&object_type=article&object_uuid=01mvd2k0DzgmTfsDBaZn1kt&short_url=knmo3&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Sony SRS-XE200 X-Series Bluetooth speaker</a> is also cheaper than it was on Prime Day. While we haven't tested out the SRS-XE200 speaker ourselves, Sony has been an audio expert for decades and we're big fans of other <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-bluetooth-speakers" target="_self">speakers</a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-headphones" target="_self">headphones</a> in its lineup. This little guy is built for on-the-go listening and packs a bit of a punch with two x-balanced speakers, line shape diffuser, and dual passive radiators. You'll get 16 hours of battery life and quick charging to get another 70 minutes of playtime on a 10-minute charge. This new all-time low price of $69.10 also puts it in the range of more budget-friendly speaker options. Unfortunately, the deal is only available on the light gray shade.</p><p><em>None of these deals catching your eye?

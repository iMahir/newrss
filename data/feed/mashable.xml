One school is so critical of social media that it is suing the companies themselves.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.lansingschools.net/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Lansing School District</u></a>, which includes 25 schools in Michigan, filed a complaint against Meta, TikTok, Google, and Snap, Inc. on Sept. 12 for not providing "adequate warnings" to children about how harmful social media can be, <a href="https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/news/local/education/2024/09/20/lansing-school-district-sues-meta-facebook-google-tiktok-snapchat/75296239007/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">according to the <em>Lansing State Journal</em></a>.

Ben Shuldiner, the superintendent of the Lansing School District, said in a statement emailed to Mashable that social media is an "incredible tool" that can "be used to learn and to teach." However, he argues, it can "also be used to harm, to threaten, and to intimidate."</p><p>"We, as a district, believe that social media companies must do more to protect and support our students when they use their product," the statement reads. "We believe that social media companies must do more to address threats and intimidation on their platforms. We believe that social media companies must do more to limit access to inappropriate material. To that end, the Lansing School District, along with hundreds of other districts across the country, is engaging in litigation. We look forward to the social media companies taking responsibility for their product and creating a safe environment for our children."</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>While Lansing appears to be the only plaintiff in this case, it's not the only school district in the country suing social media companies. <a href="https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/school-district-lawsuits-against-social-media-companies-are-piling-up/2024/01" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>According to <em>Education Week</em></u></a>, Lansing is just one of 200 school districts that have sued social media companies for similar reasons. In March 2023, the San Mateo County School Board sued YouTube, Snapchat, and TikTok, alleging that social media sites make kids depressed and anxious, leading students to act out, which drains school resources. Other districts have joined consolidated lawsuits against the platforms.</p><p>"Teachers and school administrators have been at the front lines of addressing this crisis and are overburdened by the negative effects on their students &mdash; from how it has affected mental health to behavior in the classroom," Lexi Hazam, an attorney with Lieff, Cabraser, Heimann &amp; Bernstein and co-lead counsel for the plaintiffs in a consolidated lawsuit, told <em>Education Week</em>. "Funds meant for educational purposes have been reallocated to address the misconduct of the corporations behind Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, YouTube, and Facebook. Social media companies should be held accountable and provide support to schools for the harms their products cause."</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

If all this time shifting messes with your head, you're far from alone. Here's your twice-annual reminder about what this all means, and what to do.&nbsp;</p><p>The shortening of days as the weather cools down means Daylight Saving Time (DST) is coming to an end, and it's almost time to switch back to standard time, when we set our clocks back an hour. Yes, this is the clock change where you get an extra hour of sleep, rather than losing an hour of sleep like you do in spring.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>When does Daylight Savings Time end in 2024?</h2><p>DST will technically end on <strong>Sunday, November 3, 2024 </strong>at 2 a.m. local time (if applicable in your area). Your <a href="https://mashable.com/category/mobile" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">smartphone</a> will most likely change itself, but if you have, say, an old grandfather clock in your house, and you want to experience the time change as it happens, wait until 2 a.m. and set your clock back to 1 a.m. &mdash; yes, repeating the hour that just happened.</p><p>Alternatively, just set your grandfather clock back an hour before you go to bed on the night of Saturday, November 2.</p><h2>What does the time change mean practically?</h2><p>The "saved" daylight in the warmer months is the daylight from hours around dawn transferred to the evening, meaning when we set our clocks back, mornings will feel brighter, but the dark will suddenly set in much earlier. You'll gain an extra hour of sleep on Saturday night, which might help you feel more rested on Sunday. You might feel like a night owl that first evening, having dinner under the stars instead of at twilight.</p><h2>Am I in an area where the time change is observed?</h2><p>If you are in the U.S., you probably have to participate in DST, but you might be an exception if you live in:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Hawaii</strong>, where the southern latitudes make the "Daylight Saving" concept less useful</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S. island territories</strong> like Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands (such as Saipan) where residents do not adjust their clocks for essentially the same reason as Hawaii</p></li><li><p><strong>Arizona excluding Navajo Nation</strong>, where there's no time change, just because</p></li></ul><h2>Why do we change our clocks to begin with?</h2><p>"Daylight Saving" is an attempt to make use of "extra" daylight during the evenings in warmer months. Shifting the clock in the summer means the already longer days feel radically longer because most people's wake-ups are recalibrated to occur around sunrise, rather than having the first hour of valuable summer sunshine occur when most people are asleep. &nbsp;</p><p>In the colder months, when there's no "extra" daylight to be conserved, we return to standard time, which re-aligns most of our wake-up times with the sunrise, and temporarily restores the accuracy of the term "high noon" because the sun is straight overhead once again.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Yes, I'm one of "those people" who brings their phone into the bathroom &mdash; and<strong> </strong>jams out to their favorite Apple Music playlists while standing under the cascading waters of their shower.

<p>I played a radio station curated just for me and it launched a classical music tune called "Piano Sonata No. 18 in D Major" by Yeol Eum Son. Since the Apple Watch Series 10 is so small and compact, I expected a tinny, metallic sound.</p><p>To my surprise, the song sounded richer, smoother, and more lush than I thought it'd be. I don't know how I could expect any different. If there's anything Apple gets right, it's nailing warm, full-bodied, balanced audio, whether it's on a <a href="https://mashable.com/review/15-inch-macbook-air-m2" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">MacBook</a>, a pair of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/airpods-4-hands-on-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">AirPods</a>, the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/iphone-16-pro-iphone-16-pro-max" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a> <strong>&mdash; </strong>and now, the Apple Watch.</p><p>Keep in mind, however, that I tested this in a quiet room, so my expectations were still high going into this quick shower experiment.</p><p>Before hopping the shower, I decided to switch gears and play some Frank Ocean.</p><p>I played "Thinking Bout You," swayed to the chill tune, and turned on the faucet to start the shower. I stepped in, but noticed one <em>tiny</em> little problem: the water droplets hitting the shower floor were overpowering Frank Ocean's crooning.</p><p>Even when I tried to turn the digital crown to increase the volume to the max, I could barely hear the song while showering. <em>Bummer!</em></p><p>The Watch Series 10's speakers aren't tinny, but they are <em>definitely</em> quiet. So if you, like me, had plans of purchasing the Apple Watch Series 10 for shower parties (and yes, you can wet it because it's swimproof), temper your expectations.</p><p>It can handle a wide variety of environments, but one that involves loud splashes of water simply isn't one of them.</p><h2><strong>Apple Watch Series 10: What can I use the music-playing speakers for?</strong></h2><p>We already established that the Apple Watch Series 10 isn't ideal for dance sessions in the shower, but the question is, what <em>can </em>you use it for? I've compiled a list here:</p><ul><li><p><strong>A quiet, relaxing bath</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Walking on a treadmill</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Dancing in front of a mirror</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Listening to podcasts in a quiet room </strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Sleeping with music that lulls you into a slumber</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Doing chores in a low-noise home</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Floor exercises</strong></p></li></ul><p>You get the picture here. </p><p>As long as there isn't any loud noise in your environment, the Watch Series 10 music-playing speakers are impressive. </p><p>For anything else, jogging alongside a clamorous street, for example, or a boisterous room with kids, the smartwatch's quiet tunes won't stand a chance.</p><p><em>The Apple Watch Series 10 <a href="https://zdcs.link/Q4bx3X?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=starts%20at%20%24399&object_type=article&object_uuid=06hGqkDHfeuJuKFGE8CxQXB&short_url=Q4bx3X&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">starts at $399</a></em><em> and it hit store shelves on Sept. 20.</em></p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h2>What is Connections?</h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <a class="text-gray-600" href="https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1679674590203723778?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(opens in a new window)">

    </a>
</blockquote>
<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>
<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. Like <em>Wordle, </em>you can share the results with your friends on social media.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

Words can be made from linked letters &mdash; up, down, left, right, or diagonal, but words can also change direction, resulting in quirky shapes and patterns. Every single letter in the grid will be part of an answer. There's always a theme linking every solution, along with the "spangram," a special, word or phrase that sums up that day's theme, and spans the entire grid horizontally or vertically.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>By providing an opaque hint and not providing the word list, Strands creates a brain-teasing game that takes a little longer to play than its other games, like <a href="https://mashable.com/category/wordle" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Wordle</a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/category/connections" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Connections</a>.</p><p>If you're feeling stuck or just don't have 10 or more minutes to figure out today's puzzle, we've got all the NYT Strands hints for today's puzzle you need to progress at your preferred pace.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

Words can be made from linked letters &mdash; up, down, left, right, or diagonal, but words can also change direction, resulting in quirky shapes and patterns. Every single letter in the grid will be part of an answer. There's always a theme linking every solution, along with the "spangram," a special, word or phrase that sums up that day's theme, and spans the entire grid horizontally or vertically.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>What is Connections?</h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <a class="text-gray-600" href="https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1679674590203723778?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(opens in a new window)">

</blockquote>
<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. Like <em>Wordle, </em>you can share the results with your friends on social media.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/02jVfb3AmRRUVHIxnOIEd1F/hero-image.jpg" alt="TikTok logo on a phone screen"><p>California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill on Friday that could entirely reshape how kids in the state use social media. Among the potential changes: A requirement that could effectively reshape the TikTok "For You Page" as minors now know it. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

    </div>
<p>The bill, SB976, is set to take effect in 2027 in the state home to many of tech's biggest companies. There are two major components. One: It would bar social media platforms from providing "addictive feeds" &mdash; defined as feeds based on info given by or collected on the user &mdash; to minors with parental consent. And two: It would bar social media platforms from sending notifications to minors (sans parental approval) between 12 a.m. and 6 a.m., and between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m. on weekdays during the school year. </p><p>In short: Minors' feeds would have to be chronological order feeds of people they followed. That would mean, effectively, no more "For You Page" on TikTok or other such algorithmic recommendation-based feeds. </p><p>"Every parent knows the harm social media addiction can inflict on their children &mdash; isolation from human contact, stress and anxiety, and endless hours wasted late into the night," Newsom said in a statement, via the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/california-social-media-addiction-children-law-bc649326701f892a16be1159bc008d71" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Associated Press</a>. "With this bill, California is helping protect children and teenagers from purposely designed features that feed these destructive habits."</p><p>It should be noted that the law makes the aforementioned actions towards minors illegal "unless the operator does not have actual knowledge that the user is a minor." Which seems to leave some space for minors who get around potential regulations. However, the bill's authors note that the state's attorney general will have to implement age verification and parental consent regulations by 2027, though it remains unclear what those would look like. </p><p>Now, of course, TikTok is <a href="https://mashable.com/article/tiktok-ban-court-case-update" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">already engulfed in a legal battle with the U.S. government</a>, so there's a chance it's not even around in the U.S. in 2027. But no matter the social media landscape in a few years, this law would completely shift how the platforms operated.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-09-20/newsom-to-sign-california-bill-to-limit-addictive-social-media-feeds-for-kids" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>L.A. Times</em> reported the bill </a>has "an unusual collection of opponents," including the ACLU of California, Equality California, and associations representing tech giants like TikTok and Meta. While the law would have a massive effect on how kids use social media, it seems reasonable to assume there will be a legal battle between now and 2027. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Director Chris Sanders, known for <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch </em>and <em>How to Train Your Dragon</em>,<em> </em>has crafted a sweet (and yes, tear-jerking) tale of motherhood and connection, all backed up with some of DreamWorks' most stunning animation to date.</p><h2><strong>What's <em>The Wild Robot </em>about?</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Based on the novel by Peter Brown, <em>The Wild Robot </em>strands us on a deserted island alongside ROZZUM unit 7134 (voiced by <a href="https://mashable.com/video/lupita-nyongo-hot-ones" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Lupita Nyong'o</a>). Unable to complete tasks for her human owners as her programming demands, ROZZUM &mdash; or "Roz" for short &mdash; looks to the island's many wild animals to try to fulfill her function.</p><p>It quickly turns out that these animals don't love a robot barreling down on them with a cheerful cry of, "Do you need assistance?" No matter that Roz can mimic their movements or understand their language; to the inhabitants of this island, she's a frightening intruder, and is treated as such. Without any understanding of the island's ecosystem, Roz winds up in dust-ups with everyone from thieving raccoons to frightening bears, leaving her dinged up and all alone.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Sanders is no stranger to crafting films that meld the classic fish-out-of-water trope with unlikely friendships. <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em>'s eponymous human-alien pairing is one of the greats, along with the dragon-rider dynamic between <em>How to Train Your Dragon</em>'s Hiccup and Toothless. With Roz and Brightbill in<em>The Wild Robot,</em> Sanders hits the jackpot once again. </p><p>Brightbill and Roz may be a goose and a robot, but so many of their interactions feel true to those between human parents and children. Roz is constantly concerned about doing right by Brightbill &mdash; something a wry mother possum named Pinktail (voiced by Catherine O'Hara) tells her is par for the course of parenting. Meanwhile, Brightbill walks the line between wanting independence and worrying about what will happen if he migrates away from Roz. Sure, he and Roz fight in the way that only mothers and teenagers do, but it's clear that they know they're each other's whole world.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>That sense of closeness is made all the stronger by the fact that both Roz and Brightbill are viewed as "defective" by members of their own kind. When Roz encounters the occasional other robot, they are confused by her ability to feel at all. For his part, Brightbill takes after his mother, developing a near-robotic voice and punctuating his every move with a whir or beep in order to mimic her, a habit that other geese find off-putting. Of course, in the end, these differences end up being Roz and Brightbill's greatest strengths, a message that, while nothing revolutionary, always bears repeating.</p><p><em>The Wild Robot </em>also widens its scope beyond Roz and Brightbill, showing how Roz relates to the island's other critters. In another one of the film's most touching relationships, Roz relies on conniving fox Fink (voiced by Pedro Pascal) for help with Brightbill. His philosophy, like that of many other animals on the island, is that there's one rule to life: Eat, or be eaten. Roz sees things differently, proposing that kindness can be its own survival mechanism. Over the course of the film, Fink and the other animals' outlooks shift from the former to the latter, a testament to Roz's impact on those around her. She's changing the island as much as it is changing her.</p><h2><strong>Roz is the next great movie robot.</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Roz's ability to bring misfits and entire communities together places her in conversation with other great animated robots in film, like Wall-E and the Iron Giant. So does her individual transformation, which <em>The Wild Robot </em>crafts with tremendous care. </p><p>Nyong'o's voice acting is impeccable here, and vital to Roz's journey. At the start of the film, she voices Roz as relentlessly chipper, with a hard robotic edge that mirrors how Roz stands out in an otherwise all-natural environment. As <em>The Wild Robot </em>continues, Nyong'o adds more emotions to Roz's vocal toolbox, letting her get mad, uncertain, and exasperated. The end result is a voice that's full of feeling yet still carries traces of the robotic; it's the culmination of a breathtaking tightrope of a vocal performance.</p><p>Nyong'o's work goes hand in hand with Roz's extraordinary design and animation. Her dynamism and versatility as a character &mdash; she can be a crab! A lighthouse! A builder! &mdash; is matched only by that of the artists who brought her to life. Every scene gives you something new to notice about Roz, whether it's the ever-flickering displays in her eyes or how the light strips along her body convey emotion. Like Nyong'o's performance, Roz's design also charts her arc on the island, with each mechanical injury or occasional plant growth acting as exquisite visual storytelling.</p><h2><strong><em>The Wild Robot </em>is a visual marvel.</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Speaking of exquisite, it's impossible to talk about <em>The Wild Robot </em>without highlighting its gorgeous animation. DreamWorks has shifted away from the 3D CGI look somewhat in past years, with a more illustrative style on display in films like <em>The Bad Guys </em>and <a href="https://mashable.com/video/puss-in-boots-antonio-banderas" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Puss in Boots: The Last Wish</em></a>. For <em>The Wild Robot</em>, Sanders opts for a watercolor-inspired aesthetic, with the film looking like something out of a fairy-tale storybook.</p><p>Pristine forests and tidal pools bloom to life on screen, their blue and green hues a sharp contrast to Roz's metal-gray plating and blinking lights. Flocks of geese take flight in a dazzling airborne montage. Roz's bright lights slash through a driving snowstorm. Each image is a marvelous snapshot on its own. But together, they create something wholly incredible, making <em>The Wild Robot </em>an unforgettable viewing experience and a perfect capstone to celebrate DreamWorks' 30th anniversary.</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/lVKqN?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3Btemplate=article&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=The%20Wild%20Robot%20hits%20theaters%20Sept.%2027.&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=03clwc9MKQejuJCF0xgE8fu&amp%3Bshort_url=lVKqN&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2F2024-fall-movie-preview&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=The%20Wild%20Robot%20was%20reviewed%20out%20of%20its%20premiere%20at%20Fantastic%20Fest.%20It%20hits%20theaters%20Sept.%2027.&object_type=article&object_uuid=00VXmiktrCkFZykYiuT3FKe&short_url=lVKqN&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>The Wild Robot </em>was reviewed out of its premiere at Fantastic Fest.<em> </em>It<em> </em>hits theaters Sept. 27.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2><strong>Perseverance's discovery of an anorthosite boulder</strong></h2><p>Just three days earlier on May 27, Perseverance found a light speckled boulder about 18 inches wide and 14 inches tall in <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/mars-2020-perseverance/location-map/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Jezero Crater</u></a>.

<h2><strong>Why the Europa Clipper spacecraft is so big</strong></h2><p>Europa Clipper, over 100 feet (30.5 meters) long, is big because it needs to generate solar power in deep space. And the Jupiter region only receives three to four percent of the sunlight that <a href="https://mashable.com/article/earth-pictures-images-from-space" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Earth</a> receives. Hence the long wings, or arrays.</p><p>"You just need these giant solar arrays in order to power all your instruments," Phillips explained. "We're talking about a huge expanse of solar arrays."</p><p>Capturing loads of the distant sunlight will create some 700 watts of electricity, which is "about what a small microwave oven or a coffee maker needs to operate," NASA explains. But the craft also carries batteries to help power a host of moon-sleuthing instruments.</p><p>"I'm really excited about this payload that we're bringing to Europa," Phillips said. </p><q>
    "I'm really excited about this payload that we're bringing to Europa."

<p>An ice-penetrating radar will look beneath the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nasa-europa-flyby-moon-science" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">moon's icy, cracked crust</a>. It will see how this icy subsurface is composed, and <em>possibly, possibly</em>, detect where the ice meets the ocean. (Europa's ice shell is likely some 10 to 15 miles, or 15 to 25 kilometers, thick.) This radar could detect about half a mile deep, or it could be much more &mdash; that depends on how fractured the ice is and the purity of the ice (a fractured subsurface, for example, means the radar signal will bounce around more, as opposed to penetrating down). There's potential, however, that the radar will infiltrate a whopping 19 miles (30 kilometers) down. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>In addition to a suite of specialized cameras, Europa Clipper also carries an instrument called the SUrface Dust Analyzer, or SUDA, that will literally sample particles of Europa that have been ejected into space by tiny meteorites.

<p>Plumes or not, mission scientists believe that some 50 close flybys of the surface will provide ample observations to prove whether or not Europa could harbor <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-prove-alien-life" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">life</a>.

And many of these lines were reddish, suggesting that something below the surface welled up to fill them. Planetary scientists also knew that as Europa swings by the gravitationally powerful gas giant Jupiter, its interior gets stretched and pulled, a process that produces heat on a world. This tugging could have provided heat on Europa for billions of years.</p><p>"This made Europa really, really interesting," Phillips noted.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Then, in the 1990s, NASA's Galileo mission captured legendary views of Europa's chaotic, ridged surface &mdash; suggesting there was water near the top.

Plus, you don't want something you're constantly fussing with; your headphones should help you stay focused during your exercises. </p><p>Mashable reviewers have tested <em>many</em> pairs of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-headphones" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">headphones</a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-earbuds" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">wireless earbuds,</a> and we can tell you which products stay put during a workout, and which buds will go tumbling onto the sidewalk as soon as you break into a run. To make sure we're recommending the right products, I tested five pairs of audio products during my daily workouts, ultimately choosing four. </p><h2>How to pick headphones for working out</h2><p>The right headphones for you depend significantly on the kinds of workouts you like to do and where you like to do them. If you <a href="https://mashable.com/article/strava-anxiety-joy-self-surveillance" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">like to run outdoors</a>, you need headphones that keep you safe in busy areas with reliable noise transparency. If you're pumping iron at the gym, you might prefer sports earbuds that block out the world with active noise cancellation so you can really lock in for your reps.</p><p>For this guide, I looked for two universal specs in all of the headphones I tested. First, workout headphones need to be wireless, giving you a full range of movement. You don't want to get tied up on the stairclimber.</p><p>Second, workout headphones need to be sweat- or water-resistant. This one is obvious. When you're working out, you're getting sweaty, and you want headphones that won't freak out at the first sign of moisture. Your gym earbuds don't have to be fully waterproof, but this will be helpful for outdoor athletes.</p><h2>Why are there no over-the-ear headphones on this list?</h2><p>When we review <a href="https://mashable.com/category/headphones" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">headphones</a> at Mashable, we look at all types, from <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-wireless-headphones" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">over-the-ear headphones</a> to <a href="https://mashable.com/category/earbuds" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">earbuds</a>, but you won't find any over-the-ear products here.

While we usually love them for their comfort and audio quality, their heft gets in the way when you're moving.</p><p>Plus, over-the-ear headphones and sweat are a terrible combination. Sweat gets under the ear pads, trapping moisture and leading to the headphones' fabric or leather disintegrating over time. Not to mention, they'll get smelly fast. But don't worry; if you don't like earbuds, you still have options.</p><p>So, whether you're hitting the gym or the pavement, here are the best earbuds and headphones for working out.</p>]]></content:encoded>

But unfortunately, the most shocking thing in <em>Nightbitch </em>is how unshocking it ultimately is.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Nightbitch </em>howls for the frustrated mothers.&nbsp;</h2><p>Heller's adapted screenplay gets off to a solid start with a grocery trip that introduces both the mundane and thankless duties of this unnamed mother (Adams, who is referred to as Mother in the credits) and the undercurrent of intellectual frustration boiling beneath her pleasant smile. When a former colleague in chic business attire asks how she likes "getting to be at home" with the baby all day, this pale and frazzled mother launches into a rant of her unrealized ambitions, her fear that mommy brain is killing her creativity as an artist, and her concern that there's no going back. But then the film leaps back a few moments, effectively creating a temporal record scratch that takes us back to the end of the question. This time, Mother answers with what she's <em>supposed </em>to say: "Yeah. I love it."&nbsp;</p><p>That she loves her son (also unnamed, and played by twins Arleigh and Emmett Snowden) is a given. He's adorable, yes, even when he's drinking out of the toilet or throwing paint all over her kitchen walls. What plagues her is the endless cycle of breakfast, diapers, bedtime, and mommy-and-me storytime at the library. There, she might find community among the other mothers, but she resists the warm invitations from these cheerful moms (<a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-afterparty-season-2-review-apple-tv-plus" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>The Afterparty</u></em></a>'s Zo&euml; Chao, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaFfLV51w4Y" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Happiest Season</u></em></a>'s Mary Holland, and Archana Rajan).

Then she begins to grow fur. Heller expertly weaves in elements of body horror grotesquely mimicking to comedic effect the physical transformation of a body throughout early motherhood. A particularly impactful scene involves Mother probing at a lump on her tailbone, which oozes a thick, milky pus, then long hair, and finally, an undeniable tail. The audience at the TIFF world premiere audibly gagged and groaned as Adams pulled fur and pus from her lower back! Both here and later &mdash; when Mother discovers she's grown four new nipples down her torso &mdash; Heller's heroine is not repulsed but empowered by her ability to transform. It's a thrilling beginning to a tale of finding your inner animal. But frustrating, <em>Nighbitch</em> fails to go fully feral.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Nightbitch </em>lacks bite.&nbsp;</h2><p>Mother finds fresh empowerment in her unusual behavior, like nighttime runs with runaway dogs, a carnal hunger for meat, outbursts at her stereotypically smug child-free friends, and an urge to strike back violently at her awful husband, who dares to chirp the deeply unhelpful advice, "Happiness is a choice!" There's an engaging build-up as she begins to move away from fantasizing about emotional outbursts and begins to act them out. But despite a bit of bloodlust in the form of small animal kills, there's no real sense of threat to the film.&nbsp;</p><p>This brings me back to Jennifer Kent's brilliant maternal horror movie <em>The Babadook</em>, which <a href="https://mashable.com/video/babadook-jennifer-kent-lgbtq-icon" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>celebrates its 10th anniversary this year</u></a>. While the films are tonally different, they have a lot in common. Both follow a woman trying desperately to play by the rules of being a "good mother," but finding the sacrifice of self demanded for this role absolutely suffocating.&nbsp;</p><p>Both have young sons, who they love but also resent. Both have murderous eyes toward the family pet, and both fear they are being taken over by some mysterious primal force. But <em>Nightbitch</em> won't embrace the darkness like <em>The Babadook </em>dared to. Heller's Mother might be bitchy, but she'll never go so far that she'll scare the audience. Admittedly, <em>The Babadook </em>is a nightmare of motherhood, where <em>Nightbitch </em>is meant to be a fantasy of liberation. So, there's understandable cause for Heller not to go as hard as Kent did. Still, without probing deeply to a point of true peril, which would require Mother destroying the things she loves, the low point in <em>Nightbitch</em> just doesn't hit as hard as it could. As the film turns to climb back to a happy ending, the change feels frustratingly mild instead of transgressive or revolutionary.&nbsp;</p><p>There are moments where <em>Nightbitch</em> seems on the verge of tearing down the ideals of "good motherhood" from its damning pedestal and ripping the concept to pieces, freeing Adams' Mother for good. Most of these come through the narration, presumably much of it pulled directly from Yoder's prose. The story illustrates the constraints of the role of mother, where sacrifice is taken so much for granted that moms don't even have a socially sanctioned space to complain about the hardships they endure. While Adams' harried (and hairy) heroine begins to discover some of these constraints are self-imposed, the film refuses to explore what it would mean to dismantle the expectations of others. Without what that could look like, the critique feels incomplete, suggesting some solid me-time is all that's needed to achieve a balance, ignoring the greater societal pressures put upon mothers specifically.&nbsp;</p><p>To Adams' credit, she's committed to playing Mother with an intense authenticity. Throughout the film, her character's hair is dull, her face unpolished by standard movie make-up, her body bigger than model-sizing would allow. She looks a lot like the mothers you might see any given day at the playground. And that makes her delight in her secret hidden tail and bonus nipples uniquely thrilling, punctuated by Adams' beguiling glee at these discoveries. There is much more to her than meets the eye.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet Adams balances this absurdity with earnest monologues about the incredible power of a body that can create life. And at times, this is electrifying. But all of this peculiarity and growing power sets up a promise of something extraordinary that is not delivered on. This mother never gets truly angry, so despite her canine quirks, she feels contained to a chipper maternal narrative. In the end, <em>Nightbitch </em>feels unfinished.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Nightbitch </em>was reviewed out its World Premiere at the 2024 Toronto International Film Festival. <a href="https://zdcs.link/Q4bx5X?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Searchlight%20Pictures%20is%20set%20to%20release%20the%20movie%20in%20theaters%20Dec.%206.&object_type=article&object_uuid=04D2s0KMLrHsY3oqpw5lrRc&short_url=Q4bx5X&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Searchlight Pictures is set to release the movie in theaters Dec. 6. </a></p>]]></content:encoded>

Khare is the creator of <em>Challenge Accepted</em>, a high-stakes digital series in which the 32-year-old takes on challenges ranging from working as a 911 dispatcher to training as a ballerina. Her videos, known for their premium quality, run between 15 and 24 minutes and consistently attract millions of views. With nearly 5 million subscribers, Khare has built a dedicated audience.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

The platform's success is driven by its hands-off approach, trusting creators like Khare to craft content that resonates with audiences.

This latest update solidifies YouTube's growing role in the television landscape.</p><p>Following the announcement, Khare spoke with Mashable about the new feature, what it means for <em>Challenge Accepted</em>, and how her creative process fuels YouTube's evolving TV strategy.</p><h2>Mashable: Have you ever thought about <em>Challenge Accepted</em> in terms of episodes and seasons prior to this announcement?</h2><p><strong>Michelle Khare: </strong>Our team always tries our best to think about things in terms of seasons and episodes. We think about, "What's the tone of this show? What's the release cadence? What's our format?" Previously, we organized things by season in playlists. Now through the new structure of the television app, we can formally organize things in terms of genre, episode, season, series. It just elevates our content even further.&nbsp;</p><h2>What's your reaction to the update?&nbsp;</h2><p>As creators, we can only focus on the content we create and we put it on the platform. It's really cool that the platform is evolving so that it positions our content as premium. I imagine it has the same feeling as when someone's in a movie and they see the poster in Times Square. As someone who loves premium television content, seeing our stuff in that limelight was really cool. It affirms what we're already doing with <em>Challenge Accepted</em> and it makes me even more excited to lean into that episodic format.&nbsp;</p><h2>I imagine it gives you more control of how a viewer interacts with your content.&nbsp;</h2><p>When you watch your favorite premium show, sometimes you'll watch one episode and realize you have 12 more episodes you can finish right after. I hope that [the update] will encourage people to watch more of <em>Challenge Accepted</em> when they stumble upon a standalone episode. They may realize, "Oh my gosh, I can watch more of this show, and it's all organized here for me." It takes a lot of the thinking and digging work out of the equation for the viewer.</p><h2>Do you think the new format will make it easier to attract new viewers?</h2><p>Right now to discover new content, you open the home pages to tons of videos, or the sidebar, when you're watching one video, you see a bunch of suggested. Now, you're not only introduced to one episode or a new creator but the world of this creator.</p><h2>When did you start making your videos for television? What was the process like of shifting over to that level of production?</h2><p>I'm gonna be honest, it wasn't a conscious choice of wanting to be seen on television. Our team is a mixture of people from both traditional and digital backgrounds. We have people who have worked on feature films, Oscar-nominated stuff, and <a href="https://mashable.com/category/snl" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Saturday Night Live</em></a>. Our output now feels premium, which is a wonderful thing to hear. But genuinely, it's just been about, "How can we make the best 30 minutes possible out of this story?" </p><p>Our team leans into [television] because they are from traditional television. But that said, creating for YouTube is a different animal because we're creating with the audience in mind. We're creating with the mindset of respecting the viewers' time, listening to their suggestions, and being aware that their time can be spent anywhere, and that it's on us to make a story that commands and interests their attention for long periods of time.</p><h2>How do you choose a challenge?</h2><p>Many of our initial episodes were born out of a whiteboard brainstorm of "What are Michelle's biggest fears?" and "What are the unique situations to put me in to confront them head-on?" We use that as a building block to use the challenges as a way to overcome fears, because it creates conflict and creates story. For example, I want to be a firefighter, but I'm not brave enough. Or I want to be a pageant queen, but I don't know if I'm graceful. We started using those one sentence formats to kind of inspire the different things we do.&nbsp;</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-CFbMRZNg4_I"></div>
</div>


<h2>That's so interesting, I wondered how you created so many challenges with a similar level of intensity.</h2><p>Conflict creates story. Story creates growth. Watching other people grow are the stories that we're most interested in, whether they're scripted or unscripted. That's really the angle we were coming back from.</p><h2>Are there any jobs you tried where you thought, "Maybe I should have pursued this instead of being a creator?"</h2><p>I love being a creator, and I'm not just saying that because we're at Made on YouTube 2024. I really, really love it. Being a professional jack of all trades is my ideal profession. Behind the scenes, I love running our studio, our production company, and our team and growing into [being a] CEO and leader. It's such a privilege to be an entrepreneur in this space. I hope to be doing it for a really, really long time.</p><h2>Do you have a golden rule for for content creation?</h2><p>Because our episodes are intense and in-depth, we have a pretty thorough vetting process before we greenlight an episode. We think about how we feel it will perform. Is it something our audience has been requesting? Are we, as a team, excited by it? That's often the question I find us asking the most. Analytics and getting feedback from the audience is wonderful, but we don't move forward unless our team's heart is in it. That comes from a practical perspective because if we greenlight a project we're going to be working on it for the next several weeks or months,&nbsp;sometimes even up to a year. </p><p><em>Challenge Accepted</em> is a show about pursuing novel life experiences, and I once heard that people who have more novel life experiences feel like their lives are longer. I think about that a lot. It's such a privilege to be able to think critically about where our time is spent and how much joy is created in the day-to-day. Ironically, that has led to the passion that our audience sees in each individual episode.</p><h2>Is there a challenge you wouldn't accept?</h2><p>We're really fortunate that we're in this position where we're continuing to push the envelope. We're very inspired by a lot of other creators around us. I'm excited to play in new worlds. What I love is that if you asked me a year ago what the next 20 episodes of <em>Challenge Accepted</em> are going to look like, I probably could have told you the next five. But fast forward a year, and there are things that we've released this year that I would have never even conceptualized a year ago. </p><p>What I love about the internet is that you can create quickly versus the traditional Hollywood system, where we would have greenlit several episodes a year ago, shoot them whatever, they don't come out for another entire year. A person can grow a lot in a year. So I love being able to create and release as it is relevant, impactful, meaningful, and heartfelt to us in each moment.</p><h2>What advice do you have for someone just starting and looking for financial stability as a creator?</h2><p>There's a reason so many people want to be content creators. I'm not going to lie: It rocks. But it's a very slow process that begins with creating content and learning your voice while you have another job. You're doing it in your free time to the point where you can't wait for the weekend because you get to work on this other thing. From there, you develop your voice and consistency. You can fail in a safe environment. Then, you can grow to the point where that becomes your full-time thing. But you have to feel really solid about your content before it becomes your whole world.</p><h2>How do you combat creative burnout? Obviously, you have a team that supports you.&nbsp;</h2><p>The people I look up to the most are very busy. I love moving at a fast pace. But the best parts of the job are also stepping away from the content and doing things that have nothing to do with making YouTube videos. You have to be a real person to tell real stories. You have to live life to have a story to tell. That time away from filming and producing and the office is so important to know what's really going on.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The 2024 college football season is officially in session. </p><p>This NCAA Division 1 football season marks the start of a new era &mdash;&nbsp;the traditional regional conferences and rivalries just got a major shake-up. The PAC-12 conference was dismantled last summer, which led to some conference scrambling. Starting this year &mdash; deep breath &mdash; USC, UCLA, Oregon, and Washington are part of the Big Ten alongside Ohio State, Penn State, and other top teams; Stanford and Cal have joined the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5763270/2024/09/12/acc-conference-realignment-florida-state-clemson-stanford-cal/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">ACC;</a> and Arizona, Arizona State, Colorado, and Utah have joined the Big 12 with TCU, UCF, and Texas Tech as potential new rivals. (Just two schools are left in the PAC-12, which is already set to <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/41230791/pac-12-conference-expansion-adding-four-teams-mountain-west" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">change again next season</a>. </p><p>It's also the first year with more than four playoff teams. In other words, college football is about to have a strange and exciting year.</p><p>If you want to tune into the 2024-2025 NCAA football season, we've got you covered. Keep scrolling to learn how to watch college football without cable in 2024, which channels you're going to need, and the best ways to get them.</p><h2>Can I watch college football games without cable?</h2><p>Yes, you can watch college football without cable, but unless you sign up for a live TV service like YouTube TV or Hulu + Live TV, you'll need a patchwork of streaming apps. The 2024 college football season will be broadcast across an array of local channels, specialty sports networks, and even a couple streaming services. If you don't have cable, you still have plenty of options to tune into games, but deciding which works best for you is tricky.</p><p>A live TV streaming service or cable replacement will give you the most comprehensive channel selection but will also cost you the most money. However, the good news is that you can cancel at any time, unlike cable. A single streaming service like Paramount Plus or ESPN+ will give you access to a slim number of games but will cost you less than 10 bucks per month. (TL;DR: you get what you pay for.)</p><h2>What channels are college football games on?</h2><p>Before you decide on which live TV service or streaming app you need to watch NCAA college football games, you need to know which networks your team(s) plays on. Check the conference list below to see which channels and streamers will air games for each conference in 2024. Not sure which conference your team is in?

With a Pro subscription (the most affordable tier), you'll get access to most college football broadcasts for $79.99 per month. But hardcore fans will probably want to upgrade to the Elite plan for $99.99/month, which unlocks access to ESPNU, SEC Network, Pac-12 Network, and ACC Network as well.

It's regularly $12.99 per month, but you can save 17% by paying for a year upfront.

Magnificent desolation."</em> ) In the valley, the future moon explorers collected geologic samples, and learned how to convey their finds to scientists. </p><p>Over half a century later, in June, NASA geochemist Heather Graham entered this remote Alaskan realm to scour the environment for the types of life that may exist on worlds beyond ours &mdash; planets and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nasa-europa-clipper-mission-launch" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">moons</a>.

Rather, Graham seeks the chemical activities that could support life &mdash; particularly life elsewhere that might create energy and thrive in ways different from organisms on <a href="https://mashable.com/article/earth-pictures-images-from-space" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Earth</a>.</p><p>"We're really thinking about life as we <em>don't</em> know it," Graham told Mashable. </p><q>
    "We're really thinking about life as we don't know it."
    </q>
<p>That's why Graham, and NASA's Goddard Instrument Field Team, or GIFT, endeavor to such places. They're remote, largely untrammeled, and are the closest environments approaching something extraterrestrial on our planet.</p><p>"Look out your window," said Graham. "There's literally life everywhere. The whole point of me going to the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes is it's so hard to get away from life."</p><p>Indeed, from its cataclysmic inception, the valley seemed a harsh, untamed, unearthly realm. "This Valley appeared to be on another planet that was in the process of formation," wrote Robert F. Griggs, a scientist who discovered and documented the steaming Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes on a National Geographic Society expedition in 1916. (While we were not granted permission to show Griggs' historic images here, they are available to see on <a href="https://www.nps.gov/katm/learn/nature/valley-of-ten-thousand-smokes.htm" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Katmai National Park and Preserve's website</a> and this <a href="https://npshistory.com/publications/katm/newspaper/2016.pdf" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Park Service publication</a>.)</p><q>
    "This Valley appeared to be on another planet that was in the process of formation."
    </q>
<p>When Novarupta blew in 1912, it pressed the restart button in the valley. Even water vaporized. So it's a rare place to sleuth for effects that life could have had on this new environment. Could such microbes have left clues that they harnessed energy using these fresh geologic ingredients, brewed deep inside Earth?</p><p>To find out, Graham, as shown below, inspected now-quiet fumaroles &mdash; vents where hot volcanic gasses are emitted. Graham assessed these features to see if any materials are different (and potentially altered) from the fresh rock blown out of the volcano. She looked for the presence of accumulated microorganisms, collected samples, and sent them to a microbiologist to see <em>who it is. </em>(We'll have to wait to find out; the results are pending.)</p><p>Ultimately, the search for these hints of life inform astrobiologists like Graham &mdash; who investigate the possible origins and existence of life beyond Earth &mdash; about how we should look for <a href="https://mashable.com/article/james-webb-space-telescope-habitable-planet-life" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">life</a> on other worlds.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

"Drowning in them is statistically the most dangerous thing about the Valley," Fitz, a former Katmai ranger, noted.

<p>The untrammeled valley can reveal what's transpired on other worlds. Places on Mars, for example, may have experienced similarly sized or larger volcanic eruptions, which blanketed mighty Martian glaciers in rocky ash, Whelley said. Scientists brought a ground-penetrating radar and other instruments to the valley to see how Novarupta's blast hid some large glaciers &mdash; and to demonstrate how similar events may have transpired on Mars. Another team investigated how clays could form following such a volcanic eruption &mdash; which could explain how such soils developed on Mars. We can't go to Mars today; but we can at least approximate desolate and extreme Martian environs.</p><p>"We need to find these places to do our work," Whelley explained. "They haven't been developed yet."</p><p>NASA's field team has explored volcanic landscapes in Iceland, lava tubes in Hawaii, remnants of an ancient supervolcano in California, and beyond.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

At bigger retailers, most off-the-shelf gaming laptops are already pre-specced (often by sketchy third-party sellers if you shop at Amazon), making it harder to find the right configuration and price.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2>What's the best cheap gaming laptop, and is it worth it?</h2><p>When it comes to gaming laptops, it's totally fine to not immediately spring for the top-of-the-line, $3,000-plus powerhouse. Plenty of gaming laptops fall below the $1,000 mark and are <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-cheap-gaming-laptop-2023-according-to-laptop-expert" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">well worth the money</a>. But, we would advise you against going <em>too</em> cheap. You really do get what you pay for, and if you settle for that bottom-of-the-barrel machine, you're not going to be able to run the games you want to play anyway.</p><p>However, if you're looking to keep a tight budget and don't mind playing via cloud streaming, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/drG5j?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Acer%20Chromebook%20516%20GE&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=07iXOXS8M55PKMaPfNhDFcp&short_url=drG5j&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Acer Chromebook 516 GE</a> is a great option (more details on that laptop below).

<h2>What are the best gaming laptops?</h2><p>Finding the <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-laptops" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">best laptop</a> for your needs <em>and </em>budget can be tricky. They may be easier to parse than their desktop counterparts, but gaming laptops still require a fair bit of careful spec scrutinization. These are no consoles &mdash; you can&rsquo;t just pick the latest generation system off the shelf and get playing. Choosing between the many graphics cards, processors, storage sizes, and screen types can be a real head-scratcher.

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>This entry-level Dell laptop features a 12th-generation (2022) Intel Core i3 CPU, 8GB of RAM, 512GB of SSD storage, and a 15.6-inch non-touch display with a 120Hz refresh rate.

<h2>What is Connections?</h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. Like <em>Wordle, </em>you can share the results with your friends on social media.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

Words can be made from linked letters &mdash; up, down, left, right, or diagonal, but words can also change direction, resulting in quirky shapes and patterns. Every single letter in the grid will be part of an answer. There's always a theme linking every solution, along with the "spangram," a special, word or phrase that sums up that day's theme, and spans the entire grid horizontally or vertically.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>By providing an opaque hint and not providing the word list, Strands creates a brain-teasing game that takes a little longer to play than its other games, like <a href="https://mashable.com/category/wordle" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Wordle</a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/category/connections" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Connections</a>.</p><p>If you're feeling stuck or just don't have 10 or more minutes to figure out today's puzzle, we've got all the NYT Strands hints for today's puzzle you need to progress at your preferred pace.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

            'Never Let Go' review: Halle Berry horror flick intrigues, then stalls

<p>The film, directed by Benjamin Ree, centers on 25-year-old Mats Steen, who died in 2014 from Duchenne muscular dystrophy. His parents, Robert and Trude, initially have a fairly bleak view of Mats' life. It seems to them that Mats was not social and spent most of his time gaming, so Robert and Trude worry he hadn't made any meaningful connections. However, after they announce Mats' passing on his old blog, they receive an outpouring of support that reveals Mats led a rich, love-filled life in the massively multiplayer online role-playing game <em>World of Warcraft</em>, where he played a character named Ibelin Redmoore.</p><h2><strong>What&rsquo;s <em>The Remarkable Life of Ibelin </em>about?</strong></h2><p><em>The Remarkable Life of Ibelin </em>first introduces us to Mats through Robert and Trude's home videos. Pivotal life moments play out at an accelerated pace: Mats as a newborn, Mats on his first day of school. As his dystrophy manifests and worsens, we also see footage of him falling and trying to get back up, followed by videos of him using a wheelchair, and even a time lapse of him gaming for hours at a time. Throughout it all, Robert and Trude lament what they see as his distance from those around him, wishing that they could have done more.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>But when Robert and Trude begin to receive e-mails from Mats' <em>WoW </em>friends, <em>The Remarkable Life of Ibelin </em>kicks into a whole new gear. It hits rewind &mdash; literally &mdash; and shows us everything we just saw from Mats' perspective, complete with posts from his blog, "Musings of Life," which are read aloud by an actor. Often, these voiceovers play over home video footage we've already seen, allowing Mats to lend his voice to the story in a crucial way.</p><p>The biggest change here is the inclusion of recreated scenes from Mats' <em>WoW </em>gameplay, pulled from over 42,000 pages of gaming logs. As these animated scenes play out, taking over from more tried-and-true documentary tools like talking heads and home videos, Ree immerses us fully in Mats' point of view. It's an effective shift in form: Whenever we enter <em>WoW</em> sequences, we know we're getting the closest we can to Mats' true story. </p><h2><strong><em>The Remarkable Life of Ibelin </em>proves the power of online spaces.</strong></h2><p>In the animated <em>WoW </em>scenes, we see Mats as Ibelin interacting with his online community, a role-playing guild known as Starlight. These interactions go beyond completing quests and slaying dragons, though. At one point, Mats forges an in-game romance that spills into the real world. At another, he helps a mother reconnect with her autistic son. Between animated <em>WoW</em> scenes and interviews with members of Starlight, we get a picture of Mats as kind, empathetic, and actively engaging in the kind of relationships Robert and Trude wanted for him &mdash; just online.</p><p>That virtual spaces can have a real-world impact is undeniable at this point, so <em>The Remarkable Life of Ibelin</em>'s<em> </em>exploration of that fact rings true, if not particularly revelatory. However, as someone with an admittedly narrow view of <em>WoW</em> &mdash; one that skews towards stereotypes of toxicity &mdash; Ree's look at Mats' niche community is a moving case study. Like with Robert and Trude, the revelation of Mats' inner life challenged my own assumptions about gaming as a tool for connection.</p><p><em>The Remarkable Life of Ibelin </em>keeps Mats' family life and <em>WoW </em>life mostly separate, mirroring his own experience and the experiences of those who knew him. Just as his parents didn't know much about his gaming life, his friends in the Starlight guild didn't initially know much about his personal life, as Mats kept fairly quiet about it.</p><p>However, both groups come together in the film's astonishing final moments, involving a memorial that will tug at your heartstrings and cue many, many tears. It's a remarkable closer, and along with the rest of <em>The Remarkable Life of Ibelin</em>, it serves as a touching tribute to what Mats meant to so many people, as well as the power of the virtual ties that bind us.</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/9wGAAD?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=The%20Remarkable%20Life%20of%20Ibelin%20was%20reviewed%20out%20of%20Fantastic%20Fest.%20It%20hits%20Netflix%20Oct.%2025.&object_type=article&object_uuid=05q6wb4rhoKNj32Q4ZBR6pM&short_url=9wGAAD&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>The Remarkable Life of Ibelin </em>was reviewed out of Fantastic Fest.

<p>You may shrug and think, "So?

There's also the entry-level, non-Pro AirPods line (the lineage that the AirPods 4 descends from) that delivered great sound, but delivered <em>zero </em>ANC.</p><p>After all, the entry-level AirPods line have an open-ear design, making ANC trickier. Unlike the AirPods Pro, which have silicon ear tips that seal the ear canal to facilitate ANC technology, the non-Pro AirPods don't. But somehow, some way, Apple managed to pull it off with the AirPods 4.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>And as someone who has tested them on a plane myself, they're pretty damn good. So the question is, how did Apple pull it off? Well, I ended up asking the AirPods team myself.</p><h2><strong>ANC on AirPods 4 was a challenge</strong></h2><p>"It's unbelievable all the things that need to be balanced," Eric Treski, Director of AirPods Product Marketing at Apple, told Mashable regarding the AirPods 4. "It's battery size as it relates to battery life, and it's sound quality, which includes noise cancellation," and more.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Not to mention, Treski added, that our ears are very sensitive, making it difficult to include all of these internals into a tiny form factor that is the AirPods 4 <em>without </em>causing comfort to the average user.</p><p>But the <em>real </em>challenge, Treski said, was ensuring that active noise cancellation doesn't affect the music that you're listening to.</p><p>In other words, without getting too much into the weeds of things, active noise cancellation works by the device "monitoring" the outside noise and emitting an inverted soundwave, or what Treski calls "the anti phase," to neutralize or negate the external cacophony. </p><p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re listening to Sabrina Carpenter&rsquo;s &ldquo;Espresso.&rdquo; The challenge is ensuring that the anti-noise signal filters out the background noise without messing with the song or diminishing its sound quality.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>However, the AirPods team managed to dodge this issue with the help of "algorithms and filtering," Treski said, as well as the H2 chip &mdash; the processor that the new AirPods 4 earbuds adopted from the AirPods Pro lineup.</p><p>And that's not the only thing that the AirPods 4 borrowed from the Pro family.</p><p>"One of the microphones for [the AirPods 4's] ANC is from the 'Pro' product," said Kate Bergeron, VP of Hardware Engineering at Apple, adding that it's a high-quality microphone that is ideal for the open-ear design found on the fourth-gen earbuds. </p><p>Because the AirPods 4's form factor is, for a lack of a better word, more "leaky" than the AirPods Pro, the H2 chip has to work harder than it does inside the Pro model to execute ANC &mdash; but it gets the job done.</p><p>"If you don't have really good mics, you'll hear a low noise hiss," Treski added. "So we have exceptional microphones."</p><p>The microphone that facilitates ANC is monitoring what you're hearing at 200 times a second. With a process called "adaptive EQ," it's ensuring that sound distortions caused by noise cancellation and other factors are corrected ASAP. </p><p>As someone who has <a href="https://mashable.com/article/airpods-4-hands-on-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">listened to "Espresso" on the ANC-supported AirPods 4</a> over and over again, I can confirm that the H2 chip and the microphones have been doing their thing. The sound quality is mint and the ANC is impressive.</p><p>But ANC wasn't the only hurdle Apple had to overcome.</p><h2><strong>Transparency mode is no easy task either</strong></h2><p>"Transparency seems so simplistic and easy," Treski said. Unlike ANC, Transparency Mode heightens environmental noise around you, so it can't be <em>that </em>difficult to implement, right?</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Wrong!</p><p>"It's incredibly challenging because you need to make sure that it sounds natural," Treski said. "Not just the environmental noise, but also your own voice while you're speaking."</p><p>On top of that, Transparency Mode would have to execute this task flawlessly with "extremely low latency." Otherwise, there would be too much of a mismatch between the sounds and what you're seeing.</p><p>Despite this challenge, Apple managed to fine-tune Transparency Mode to seamlessly blend environmental sounds with what you&rsquo;re hearing through the AirPods. The result is a more natural experience, where voices and ambient noise flow through smoothly, making it feel like you&rsquo;re not wearing earphones at all.</p><h2><strong>How did Apple discover the best fit for 'most'?</strong></h2><p>For some, AirPods fit perfectly &mdash; and for others, like myself &mdash; not so much.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>I'm just one of those folks with "weird ears," I guess. Bergeron assured me that that's not the case. "You look at people's ears and they're totally different in all aspects of their physiology," she said.</p><p>"We'll hear from people, 'The Pro' doesn't fit me' or 'The <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-airpods-4-vs-airpods-3-differences" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">AirPods 3</a>' doesn't fit me,'" Bergeron added. "And we want to learn from the challenges that people have."</p><p>In order to educate itself, Apple did some extensive research to find a "one-size-fits-most" shape on the AirPods 4.</p><p>As mentioned in <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-event-2024-everything-announced-iphone-16-watch-10" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple's "Glowtime" keynote</a> that introduced the AirPods 4, Apple analyzed thousands of ear shapes, relying on advanced technologies like 3D photogrammetry and laser topography, that amassed over 50 million data points to refine the earbuds' design.</p><p>"We've come up with a relatively efficient way to scan people's ears through our own tools so we can build that database [and continue to find the 'best fit'] on an ongoing basis," Bergeron said.</p><p>After popping the AirPods 4 into my ears, I was relieved that they didn't creep out of my canal to take a tumble. Even when I violently shook my head from left to right, they stayed in place like they were holding on for dear life in a windstorm.</p><h2><strong>What's next for AirPods?</strong></h2><p>Out of curiosity, I asked what Apple had up its sleeves for the next AirPods down the line, like AirPods 5 or AirPods Pro 3, for example.

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>It doesn't really get much better than Apple's recent M3 line of MacBooks. The <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-macbooks-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">M3 Air</a> is one of our favorites, and ahead of Prime Big Deal Days you can score one for just $929, which $170 off the usual price. This MacBook Air in particular comes with a 13-inch screen (great for traveling), and features the speedy M3 chip. It also has support for Apple Intelligence and can handle up to 18 hours of usage on one charge.</p><h3>More MacBook deals</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/ao5pPY?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20MacBook%20Air%2C%2013-inch%20%28M2%2C%208GB%20RAM%2C%20256GB%20SSD%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=032BGR40jknn3BTDZSr6OWE&short_url=ao5pPY&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple MacBook Air, 13-inch (M2, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD)</a> &mdash; <strong>$849</strong> <s>$999</s> (save $150)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/aMvlY0?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20MacBook%20Air%2C%2015-inch%20%28M2%2C%208GB%20RAM%2C%20512GB%20SSD%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=032BGR40jknn3BTDZSr6OWE&short_url=aMvlY0&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple MacBook Air, 15-inch (M2, 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD)</a> &mdash; <strong>$1,299</strong> <s>$1,499</s> (save $200)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/QddBL6?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20MacBook%20Air%2C%2015-inch%20%28M3%2C%2016GB%20RAM%2C%20512GB%20SSD%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=032BGR40jknn3BTDZSr6OWE&short_url=QddBL6&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple MacBook Air, 15-inch (M3, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD)</a> &mdash; <strong>$1,449</strong> <s>$1,699</s> (save $150)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/9lwkbd?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20MacBook%20Pro%2C%2016-inch%20%28M1%20Pro%2C%2016GB%20RAM%2C%201TB%20SSD%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=032BGR40jknn3BTDZSr6OWE&short_url=9lwkbd&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple MacBook Pro, 16-inch (M1 Pro, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD)</a> &mdash; <strong>$1,896.51</strong> <s>$2,699</s> (save $803.49)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qm2506?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20MacBook%20Pro%2C%2016-inch%20%28M3%2C%2018GB%20RAM%2C%20512GB%20SSD%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=032BGR40jknn3BTDZSr6OWE&short_url=Qm2506&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple MacBook Pro, 16-inch (M3, 18GB RAM, 512GB SSD)</a> &mdash; <strong>$1,999</strong> <s>$2,499</s> (save $500)</p></li></ul><h2>Best iPad deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>The AirPods Max are a great pair of over-ear headphones for those who prefer that style to that of earbuds. The Max provide super high-quality audio, active noise cancellation, a transparency mode so you can enjoy your tunes and the world around you, and personalized spatial audio. It's also got a 20-hour battery life, which is pretty sweet. Snag a pair before Prime Big Deal Days and save $100.</p><h3>More AirPods deals</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/QKD2Zj?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20AirPods%20%282nd%20Generation%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=032BGR40jknn3BTDZSr6OWE&short_url=QKD2Zj&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)</a> &mdash; <strong>$89</strong> <s>$129</s> (save $40)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/zjGede?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20AirPods%20%283rd%20Generation%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=032BGR40jknn3BTDZSr6OWE&short_url=zjGede&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple AirPods (3rd Generation)</a> &mdash; <strong>$129</strong> <s>$169</s> (save $40)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/z7bpLL?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20AirPods%20Pro%202&object_type=article&object_uuid=032BGR40jknn3BTDZSr6OWE&short_url=z7bpLL&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple AirPods Pro 2</a> &mdash; <strong>$189.99</strong> <s>$249</s> (save $59.01)</p></li></ul><h2>Best Apple Watch deals</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>One of our <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-smart-locks" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">favorite smart locks</a> for families with kids, the Ultraloq U-Bolt Pro offers six different ways to unlock your door. Each person in your home can create a user profile and add up to two fingerprints per profile. In other words, your fingerprint is your key, so you don't have to worry about forgetting it. There are also options to unlock by a passcode, voice commands via Alexa or Google Assistant, a button on the Ultraloq app, location-based auto locking and unlocking, and of course, a regular old key. Plus, all you need is a screwdriver for its DIY installation. As of Sept. 20, Target Circle members (signing up is free) can get the WiFi-enabled U-Bolt Pro for just $144.49. And although the original price listed on Target's website says $169.99, the MSRP is actually $179.99, making this a savings of 20%.</p><h2>Best smart speaker deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

Its smaller design makes it ideal for a bedside table, shelf, countertop, or desk, and it can be used for everything. Ask it to set a timer, save a recipe, schedule a task, play white noise, call your mom, turn on your lights, set a reminder, or just play your favorite tunes. The 5th generation Dot features more vibrant sound, clearer vocals for phone calls, and deeper bass. While it doesn't include Dolby audio like its bigger cousin, the Echo, it does feature new motion sensors and a front-firing speaker. As of Sept. 20, it's on sale for just $34.99 a Target. That's a savings of 30%.</p><h2>Best smart air purifier deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>While an air purifier might not be on your radar as a smart home deal, voice-assistant support and the ability to control it with your phone make the Blueair Pure 211i Max 100 a solid smart home addition. See the quality of air in your home via quick readings on the LED screen or through the app at any time. A convenient Welcome Home mode puts your purifier in standby when you leave the home and turns it back on when you're getting close. Plus, the RealTrack algorithm will inform you when it's time to replace your filter. Slash 15% off this purifier built for extra large rooms as of Sept. 20.</p><h3>More smart home deals</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/aNDbxG?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Amazon%20Echo%20Pop&object_type=article&object_uuid=05EWLNRrnrh7Aeg1ohSO6sI&short_url=aNDbxG&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Amazon Echo Pop</a> &mdash; <strong>$24.99</strong> <s>$39.99</s> (save $15)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/9g3Bk8?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Amazon%20Kids%20Echo%20Dot%20%285th%20Gen%202022%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=05EWLNRrnrh7Aeg1ohSO6sI&short_url=9g3Bk8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Amazon Kids Echo Dot (5th Gen 2022)</a> &mdash; <strong>$39.99</strong> <s>$59.99</s> (save $20)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/aepnPl?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Black%2BDecker%20smart%20home%20starter%20kit&object_type=article&object_uuid=05EWLNRrnrh7Aeg1ohSO6sI&short_url=aepnPl&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Black+Decker smart home starter kit</a> &mdash;&nbsp;<strong>$64.99</strong> <s>$105.99</s> (save $41)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/z7bpL4?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=ULTRALOQ%20U-Bolt%205-in-1%20smart%20deadbolt%20door%20lock&object_type=article&object_uuid=05EWLNRrnrh7Aeg1ohSO6sI&short_url=z7bpL4&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">ULTRALOQ U-Bolt 5-in-1 smart deadbolt door lock</a> &mdash;<strong> $93.49</strong> <s>$109.99</s> (save $16.50 with Target Circle)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/QLnd3b?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Amazon%20Echo%20Show%208%20%283rd%20Gen%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=05EWLNRrnrh7Aeg1ohSO6sI&short_url=QLnd3b&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Amazon Echo Show 8 (3rd Gen)</a> &mdash;<strong> $104.99</strong> <s>$149.99</s> (save $45)</p></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Halloween's right around the corner. If you're planning a party, or just a hangout with friends where you touch grapes and pretend they're eyeballs or demand your visitors believe that spaghetti is a bunch of monster brains, you need ambiance. What better way to do that than with a smart bulb and a hub to control it? Amazon is offering its compact <a href="https://mashable.com/review/echo-pop" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Echo Pop</a> smart assistant with a smart bulb right now at a great price, which means you can have the coolest Halloween party on the block with little effort and without having to spend very much money. </p><p>As of Sept. 20, get an <a href="https://zdcs.link/92b375?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Echo%20Pop%20bunlded%20with%20a%20Sengled%20Smart%20Color%20Bulb&object_type=article&object_uuid=04Wrim7oOO7qs8MRQl9sNyb&short_url=92b375&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Echo Pop bunlded with a Sengled Smart Color Bulb</a> for just $24.99. That's down from its normal price of $59.98 and a discount of 58%. You save $34.99 by snagging this bundle on sale, and it's $19.99 less than if you were to buy both items separately.</p><p>The Echo Pop is a smaller version of the Echo smart speaker, which can play music, podcasts, work with Alexa apps, and even make calls to other devices. But you'll likely find the most use with it as a smart home hub that can control your new Sengled smart bulb. Turn your lights on and off with the Echo Pop and change up your light colors as you please. You can even set a schedule during which your lights will come on &ndash; and other useful patterns as well.</p><p>Set up a blood red light for a full moon, pink and purple for a Halloween rave, or just use it to set the mood while you decorate for the season. Whatever you choose, this is a great deal you'll have plenty of uses for. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a lived-in but tidy two-bedroom apartment in Lower Manhattan, three estranged sisters are reluctantly reunited as their terminally ill father ebbs into his final days, which involve in-home hospice care. These sisters couldn't be more different, both in attitude and in how they're handling the impending death of the dad they shared in the apartment each has called home. (Sam Levy's cinematography often keeps the walls and narrow doorways in frame, constantly reminding us just how close &mdash;&nbsp;and almost suffocating &mdash; these quarters are.) </p><p>Coon kicks things off as Katie, a ruthlessly rational Brooklyn mom who begins the film with a breathless yet steady monologue explaining how the sisters must wall back their emotions and grievances to focus on the task at hand: giving their dad the most peaceful end possible. "Things from the past don't matter," she says firmly. "Not right now."</p><p>There's a rich New York sense of neurotic humor in Katie's opening speech, which is full of passion in its subtext but purposefully bled of throbbing emotion. This speech is not just a setup that she is a dam aching to break, but also a setup to the film's first sophisticated joke. The punchline is the reaction shot from Lyonne, whose weary expression screams "fuck you" though her lips never move.</p><p>Rachel (Lyonne), a Lower East Side stoner who makes her money through sports betting, lives in this apartment with their father. Yet when her sisters invade, she sidesteps, letting them make demands, lay down rules, and dominate the conversation with the hospice workers who come daily to give care and advise. While Katie and youngest sister Christina (Olsen) take turns watching over their father in his room at the end of the hall, Rachel ducks into her own room to get high or hang out with her maybe-boyfriend Benji (Jovan Adepo).</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Where Katie is brisk and business casual and Rachel is laden in New York sports gear and pot smoke with the husky yet relaxed voice to match, Christina has a bright smile, near-teary eyes, and the kind of flimsy casual wear that could cost $1 or hundreds. The baby of this group lives across the country, somewhere that reflects her sunny attitude and allows her to indulge in seeing her favorite jam bands, like The Grateful Dead.</p><p>Where Katie enters their dad's room with a purpose (getting the DNR order sorted) and Rachel avoids it, Christina goes in shiny and with a song on her lips. Naturally, when tossed together, these forces collide in passive aggressive barbs, whispered resentments, caustic assumptions, and plenty of hurt feelings.</p><h2>Coon, Lyonne, and Olsen are superb and nerve-racking in <em>His Three Daughters</em>.</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Thanks in part to Coon's rapid-fire monologue at the top, <em>His Three Daughters</em> feels like a stage play adapted to the screen. The claustrophobic setting of the apartment adds to this feel, trapping the characters in a fraught floor plan that means there's no way to escape to the outside world without emotional encounters at their dad's door, in the tiny kitchenette, or in the living/dining area that often becomes the stage for sister showdowns. </p><p>While Coon crisply sets the pace and the heady sense of theatricality through her punctuated stoicism, Lyonne brings misfit energy that infuses the film with New York authenticity. Whether shrugging off her sister's bad attitude or joking around with the building's security guard, she exudes that defiant individualism that defines the city. <em>His Three Daughters </em>offers pockets of private moments, in which each sister escapes the identity of herself among her sisters to give us a glimpse of who they are beyond these four walls. For Kate and Christina, this comes in the form of calls to their husbands and children. For Rachel, it's a walk through her neighborhood, where her smile comes out of hibernation and her shit talk is understood as affection. It's a role Lyonne was born to play. </p><p>Olsen's role might have been the one over shadowed, as Christina is the gentlest of the three, given the least cutting dialogue. However, Olsen weaves a nuance into the youngest sibling, whose breeziness is a radiant but thin fa&ccedil;ade. "Just because I don't complain doesn't mean I don't have issues," Christina asserts in a hard moment. And just like that, the bright baby sister is given depth that reaches into her love of jam bands, her choice to live across the country, and her unflappable warmth in the face of their father's death.</p><p>There's no one way to grieve, and <em>His Three Daughters</em> puts several &mdash; all heart-wrenching and all-too-familiar &mdash; on display.</p><h2><em>His Three Daughters</em> rejects treacle and tragedy porn in favor of giving death some dignity.</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Perhaps one of the most compelling choices Jacobs makes (outside of casting), is keeping audiences out of the room of the daughters' father, Vincent (Jay O. Sanders). The camera will never peek through the door or cross the threshold. The film is not so much about their father, but about how they see him, and what legacy he leaves behind in the "three crazy bitches" he raised &mdash; as Rachel puts it with a crooked grin.</p><p>By keeping us out of that room, Jacobs rejects making a spectacle of dying and gives the father and his daughters a private life outside the film. Still, we see plenty of who they are through how they're coping. Katie <em>needs</em> a project to channel her nervous energy, even if that means targeting Rachel unjustly. Rachel is deep in avoidance, doing all she can to look away from the inevitable. Christina is endlessly seeking positivity, to the point of proving toxic to her siblings. Even Benji gets a showcase of grieving, delivering a speech about who Vincent was to him. It's an oration so full of righteous rage and the pain of loss that it rattles even Kate and Christina from their poses of composure &mdash; and could make Adepo a dark horse Best Supporting Actor contender. (He's sensational in this small but blistering role.)</p><p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/fionna-and-cake-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>I've written before</u></a> about how <a href="https://mashable.com/article/after-yang-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>grief</u></a> is an <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-fallout-movie-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>ugly business</u></a>. It's cruel and unfair and can cause us to lash out cruelly and unfairly. <em>Three Daughters</em> neatly puts such chain reactions on display while avoiding making a ghoulish meal of its characters' pain. The center of the film is grief, but its purpose it to show how three sisters were able to rediscover each other through this grim moment. It's a motherfucker, but grief can teach us who we are, not just as individuals, but also to one another.</p><p>In a tightly written drama binding us to a humble home and an imminent death, Jacobs and his cast unfurl a powerful story of love and loss that is ultimately hopeful. While a third-act flight of fantasy may prove polarizing &mdash; arguably breaking from the rest of the film's logic &mdash; for me, it deepened the sense of absence, giving audiences a grander understanding of who the eponymous heroines lose when they lose Vincent.</p><p><em>His Three Daughters</em> is a simple but elegant drama that grapples with the ugliness of grief and comes out with as happy an ending as a shattering death might bring. It's chaotic, charismatic, and ultimately cathartic. Don't miss it.</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/z3bjvK?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=His%20Three%20Daughters%20is%20in%20now%20playing%20on%20Netflix.&object_type=article&object_uuid=05o61vDJMe5d6uKTL3Q3FPv&short_url=z3bjvK&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>His Three Daughters </em>is in now playing on Netflix.</a></p><p class="mx-auto">

As per our reviewer: "The v&iacute;voactive 4 is an excellent smartwatch for active people wanting to be more in tune with their bodies, and for less active individuals who have the desire but need a little nudging to stick to their goals." The newer model boasts even more advanced features, an upgraded AMOLED display, better heart rate sensor, upgraded sleep and stress coaching, and over 30 sports apps. It's usually $299.99, but you can save 17% as of Sept. 20 and get it for $249.99. </p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>Chore days are made <em>so </em>much easier if you have a robot vacuum in your arsenal, and the Roborock S7 Max Ultra is a great pick that also happens to be on sale ahead of Target Circle Week. The S7 Max Ultra brings a totally hands-free cleaning experience, including (in addition to its vacuum capabilities) a mopping function, automatic obstacle avoidance, and a self-cleaning, -drying, and -emptying base. Pick one up at Target and save $350 before Circle Week.</p><h2>Best tablet deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>If you're down to get an iPad from a previous generation iPad, you might want to check out this sweet discount on a 9th-generation model: It's just $349.99 for Target Circle Week, saving you $130. The WiFi-enabled tablet comes with 256GB of storage (which should be plenty), and is packed with internals that are still impressive even by today's standards. The Retina display, A13 Bionic chip, and ultra-wide front camera are all here.</p><h2>Best TV deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>If you're constantly stocking your fridge with comically large cases of La Croix, it may be time for you to move on to a more cost-effective and eco-friendly option like a SodaStream. Luckily, the SodaStream Terra is on sale ahead of Target Circle week &mdash; $40 off the original price, just $59.99. Using the SodaStream is simple. Just fill up the included bottle with plain water, stick it in the machine, and push the button to get a bubbly beverage in seconds. Trust us, it's worth it. </p><h2>Best air purifier deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>If you want to try Apple Intelligence on your Mac or iPad, the iPadOS 18.1 beta and macOS Sequoia 15.1 beta are available as well; the onboarding process is the same as above. </p><p>There's a caveat to all this. If you're in Europe or China, Apple Intelligence features will not be available to you, no matter which iOS version you have installed. That's because of AI regulations, which are different in the European Union and China than they are in the U.S. I wrote a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-intelligence-outside-us" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">short primer</a> on how you can try to overcome this limitation, but the short version is that it is not worth the trouble. And if you want to know more about EU laws that caused this gap, you can <a href="https://mashable.com/article/europe-ai-gap" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">read about that on Mashable too</a> </p><p>As far as what kind of AI features can you expect in this beta, the list isn't complete (some features are coming later this year) but it does include several key features seen in Apple's "<a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-event-2024-everything-announced-iphone-16-watch-10" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">It's Glowtime</a>" event held earlier this month. For example, you'll get the glowy, around-the-display Siri effect when you invoke her, and Siri will be a little smarter when it comes to understanding your mumbly requests. </p><p>You'll also get AI-powered spell and grammar checks when writing, as well as AI summaries of your text. Photos will be able to create slide shows based on your text input, Clean Up can be used to remove unwanted objects in photos, and Messages and Mail are getting smart replies. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In keeping with the product&rsquo;s overall simplicity, Plugable&rsquo;s portable monitor also doesn&rsquo;t have much going on design-wise. It&rsquo;s a big, black rectangle that displays whatever you want it to display. Easy enough!</p><p>This is a good thing, as it&rsquo;s extremely easy to figure out how to use the Plugable portable monitor without any kind of quick start guide or instruction manual, though the device comes with one of those in case you need it, too. There are no ports, buttons, nor features on three of the display&rsquo;s four sides. On the right side, you&rsquo;ll find buttons for controlling brightness and switching between picture modes, as well as three USB-C ports that do a variety of things that we&rsquo;ll get to later.</p><p>Plugable also included a travel cover with the device that attaches magnetically &mdash; and as far as I can tell &mdash; stays that way. The cover is also designed to be used as a stand for the monitor in the absence of another one. In all, even with the cover on, the monitor is about 1.8 pounds in weight. You won&rsquo;t even notice it in your backpack, which is lovely.</p><p>This is the source of my first problem (of very few) with the Plugable monitor: It can be hard to find the right vertical angle for it. You can fold the cover into a stand in a variety of ways (such as by laying it out flat on the desk or folding it up into a triangular shape), but in each configuration, your options are pretty limited. Put simply, the monitor is almost always going to be angled slightly upward, not unlike a laptop display. If you would prefer something more head-on, a traditional second monitor setup is probably the way to go.</p><h2><strong>Plugable portable monitor display</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>This thing wouldn&rsquo;t matter if the screen weren&rsquo;t any good, right? Thankfully, Plugable did just enough to earn a passing grade here.</p><p>The 15.6-inch, 16:9 monitor is basically the perfect size as a laptop companion, as it&rsquo;s as big (if not a little bigger) than most laptop displays. Its 300 nits of peak brightness are more than good enough for indoor office space usage, and the 1080p resolution is right in line with the expectations for a cheap-ish portable monitor, if not exactly awe-inspiring.</p><p>Some may be disappointed to hear the refresh rate maxes out at 60Hz. In a vacuum, I would be, too, but there are other things to consider. First, this device relies entirely on USB-C for image output. And finally, there just aren&rsquo;t that many things the average professional needs a 120Hz refresh rate for, if we accept the premise that this monitor is mostly intended for work.</p><p>Folks who do video-centric jobs that might require a higher refresh rate should probably look elsewhere.</p><p>If I have one major gripe with the Plugable monitor&rsquo;s display, it&rsquo;s the less-than-ideal viewing angles. When looking at the display head-on, everything is sharp and clear, but when looking at it from a slight angle to the side or above, it becomes harder to see. This is a problem as old as displays themselves, so I&rsquo;m not meaning to single out Plugable here, but I did notice it, especially in conjunction with the physical angle problems I had with the stand.</p><h2>Plugable portable monitor features</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>I should probably mention how exactly this thing works, huh?&nbsp;</p><p>Fortunately, it doesn&rsquo;t take too many words to do so: Plug the provided USB-C cable into a port on your computer that supports video output. If you have a relatively modern laptop, that <em>shouldn&rsquo;t</em> be a problem. Then, plug the other end into the bottom USB-C port on the monitor, which is helpfully labeled &ldquo;Host&rdquo; on the monitor itself.&nbsp;</p><p>After a few seconds, you&rsquo;ll have a perfectly functioning second display. On a MacBook, you&rsquo;ll have to briefly give the monitor permission to work the first time, but that&rsquo;s literally the only bit of friction I had with the entire experience. It&rsquo;s so remarkably simple that you&rsquo;ll instantly hate any other monitor you&rsquo;ve ever had to set up that gave you even the slightest bit of trouble in the process.</p><p>But that&rsquo;s not all! Remember those other two USB-C ports I mentioned earlier? You can use those while the monitor is connected to your laptop (or phone or tablet) for a variety of things. The top port allows you to connect and use other USB-C devices, such as portable speakers, while the middle port functions as a passthrough for charging your laptop, ensuring the display stays powered.</p><p>That last bit is especially useful because, in the absence of a power adapter, the Plugable monitor <em>will</em> drain your laptop&rsquo;s battery in order to power itself. There's no onboard battery in the monitor. In fairness, though, I didn&rsquo;t notice a huge amount of power drain on my <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-macbook-air-m2-2022-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>M2 MacBook Air</u></a>, and found it perfectly safe to use the monitor for long stretches without plugging in.</p><p>Your mileage may vary depending on what kind of laptop you have, though.</p><h2><strong>Plugable portable monitor performance</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>As far as performance is concerned, almost everything is in order. I didn&rsquo;t notice any kind of connectivity issues in my time with the Plugable portable monitor. When it&rsquo;s connected to your laptop, it stays that way &mdash; and the video signal doesn&rsquo;t ever get interrupted as far as I can tell.</p><p>The only performance issue worth noting is that the corner of the monitor where the three USB-C ports lie can get very warm to the touch after even a short usage session. The first time I tested the monitor at home, I was shocked at how hot it was after about 20 minutes of watching football highlights on YouTube.&nbsp;</p><p>It&rsquo;s not a dangerous or concerning level of heat, but it's worth mentioning. To Plugable&rsquo;s credit, I suppose, the heat is localized entirely to that corner of the device and doesn&rsquo;t permeate the whole chassis.</p><h2><strong>Is the Plugable portable monitor worth it?</strong></h2><p>Plugable&rsquo;s debut in the monitor space isn&rsquo;t mind-blowing or revolutionary, as there are other cheap portable monitors out there. Plenty of them come in at $100 or less, too, so Plugable doesn&rsquo;t exactly win on price, either.</p><p>But what Plugable does have is a trustworthy brand name and a device that I can confirm works exactly as intended. It&rsquo;s just so stunningly easy to get the Plugable monitor up and running and doing exactly what you want it to do. You don&rsquo;t need a chunky HDMI cable or a power adapter (though you can use one if you want) &mdash; you just need a host device and a USB-C cable.&nbsp;</p><p>I&rsquo;d like to see future iterations of this product with higher resolutions and better refresh rates, but for now, Plugable&rsquo;s first portable monitor is an impressive debut.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

      <description><![CDATA[Halle Berry, Anthony B. Jenkins, and Percy Daggs IV star in this atmospheric, yet lackluster horror flick from Alexandre Aja. Movie review.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01PZ6MyQ6iimslcKRWYgeDX/hero-image.jpg" alt="Halle Berry as Momma in "Never Let Go.""><p><em>Never Let Go </em>creeps onscreen like a dark fairy tale, enveloping its audience in a forest landscape of gnarled tree branches and mossy stones. At the center of this grove lies a solitary wooden house, home to a woman known simply as Momma (Halle Berry), as well as her twin sons Nolan (Percy Daggs IV) and Samuel (Anthony B. Jenkins). According to Momma, they're the only three people left in the world. A great Evil wiped out the rest of humanity, and now it's coming for her family.</p><p>There are ways to fight the Evil, though. Like <em>Never Let Go</em>'s wooded setting, these defense mechanisms come straight out of folklore. Momma, Nolan, and Samuel tether themselves to their house with a rope anytime they step outside. That bind grants them protection against the Evil. The same goes for the house as a whole, which the family treats as some kind of holy guardian. They touch its wooden walls to cleanse their souls of any contact with the Evil, reciting a well-worn rhyme that declares, "Heaven is here within our home."</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>All these elements form an intriguing blend of folk horror with religious undertones. Yet <em>Never Let Go</em>, directed by Alexandra Aja (<em>Crawl</em>, <em>Horns</em>), fails to deliver on its promising start. The film sometimes plumbs the depths of sinking dread, but for the most part, relies on cheap tactics to elicit any kind of scare.</p><h2><strong>What's <em>Never Let Go </em>about?</strong><em> </em></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">
    <div class="flex justify-center">
                    <img class="border border-gray-100" src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01PZ6MyQ6iimslcKRWYgeDX/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1726809591.jpg" alt="Momma, her sons, and their dog stand on the steps of their house." width="2000" height="1125" loading="lazy" srcset="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01PZ6MyQ6iimslcKRWYgeDX/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1726809591.jpg 800w, https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01PZ6MyQ6iimslcKRWYgeDX/images-1.fill.size_1400x788.v1726809591.jpg 1400w, https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01PZ6MyQ6iimslcKRWYgeDX/images-1.fill.size_2000x1125.v1726809591.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px">

<p>For Samuel and Nolan, the house is all they've ever known. The same goes for Momma's insistence that they stay attached to the all-important rope and follow each of her rituals. Momma knows best after all, as only she can see the Evil. It manifests in different forms for her, shedding its skin like a snake to take the shape of her deceased family members. Often in zombie-like states of decay, these apparitions shamble towards Momma and taunt her with painful memories.</p><p>All that definitely <em>sounds </em>scary, but since Samuel and Nolan have never seen or experienced the Evil themselves, even in the brief moments when they let go of the rope, it's only natural that doubt eventually creeps in. Samuel, ever the rule follower, remains steadfast in his trust in Momma. But Nolan grows bolder in questioning whether the Evil is even real. As starvation closes in and tensions rise, the stage is set for a family reckoning and all the beliefs they once held dear.</p><h2><strong><em>Never Let Go </em>raises fascinating questions, but never goes deep (or truly horrifying) enough</strong></h2><p>Unfortunately, that reckoning never quite arrives. That's a shame, as <em>Never Let Go</em> does wring some dread from its ambiguous approach to whether the Evil is actually real or not. Take Momma's story of the time she left a young, injured hiker to die for fear that she was one of the Evil's many forms. Are we certain that she outsmarted some malevolent force? Or did she actually abandon a real girl who needed her help? The different possibilities can tear you in two, and <em>Never Let Go </em>remixes that scenario a few times throughout its run for maximum dread.</p><p>Too often, though, <em>Never Let Go </em>turns away from this complexity<em> </em>in favor of clich&eacute;d frights. Jump scares and nightmare sequences abound, prompting quick moments of fear that quickly give way to exasperation. I don't need to see another mysterious creature dart across the frame! Give me unbridled panic about losing that vital, protective rope or the horrifying inevitability of starvation any day.</p><p>Some genuinely fascinating ideas do shine through <em>Never Let Go</em>, even with these half-baked scares clogging the runtime. Real or not, there are different ways to read the Evil's significance to Momma, especially through the lens of family trauma. There's also the angle of children breaking away from their parents: Is Nolan's skepticism a coming-of-age moment for him? Momma mentions she had a similar phase once, so is her family trapped in a cycle of rebelling against then conforming to rituals surrounding the Evil? <em>Never Let Go </em>certainly seems happy to let us keep asking these questions, but after its plodding pacing and scattershot climax, you'll wish it had held onto those ideas for just a bit longer.</p><p><a href="https://www.atomtickets.com/movies/never-let-go/360383" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Never Let Go </em>was reviewed out of Fantastic Fest's opening night.

<p>Though Pocketpair's claims of ignorance may initially seem ridiculous, they're less surprising once you consider the nature of Nintendo and The Pok&eacute;mon Company's claims.</p><p><em>Palworld</em> drew international attention during its January early access launch due to <a href="https://mashable.com/article/palworld-pokemon-guns-controversy-ai-art-plagarism" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">perceived similarities between its titular Pals and Pok&eacute;mon designs</a>. Some 3D modellers even directly compared character models, speculating that Pocketpair had stolen assets &mdash;&nbsp; a theory the developer has consistently <a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1800269900545478921" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">denied</a>.</p><p>However, patents don't cover such elements, which would more appropriately be handled by a copyright. Instead, a patent infringement lawsuit is more likely to deal with technical elements such as gameplay mechanics.</p><p><em>Palworld</em>'s gameplay does have undeniable gameplay similarities to the <em>Pok&eacute;mon </em>franchise, with both allowing players to capture and battle teams of fantastical monsters. Even so, they're far from the only monster-taming games out there, with games such as <em>Dragon Quest</em> <em>V </em>and Atlus' <em>Shin Megami Tensei </em>series preceding both.</p><p>As such, the exact nature of Nintendo's beef with Pocketpal isn't immediately apparent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It seems reasonable to speculate that the lawsuit may involve <em>Palworld</em>'s "Pal Spheres." To capture a Pal in <em>Palworld</em>, players first fight their target to lower its health and increase the probability of a successful capture. They then throw a Pal Sphere at the Pal, trapping them inside it.&nbsp;</p><p>As anyone familiar with <em>Pok&eacute;mon</em> games will know, this mechanic operates very similarly to Pok&eacute;balls.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-IltMIJeK-1M"></div>
</div>


<p>The theory that the lawsuit concerns Pal Spheres is further supported by several divisional patent applications Nintendo and The Pok&eacute;mon Company jointly submitted after <em>Palworld</em>'s launch. Some of the patents seem to concern mechanics such as <a href="https://www.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/c1801/PU/JP-7493117/15/ja" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">aiming and throwing an item</a> <a href="https://www.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/c1801/PU/JP-2024-016448/10/ja" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">to capture a creature</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/c1801/PU/JP-7545191/15/ja" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">throwing an item to release a captured creature and start a battle</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.kipb-jp.com/faq/5/divisional-applications" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Divisional patents</a> essentially split a pre-existing patent into multiple separate ones, separating distinct inventions that were previously bundled together. Such split patents are still considered to have been in effect from the date of their parent patent, meaning they could feasibly form the basis of Nintendo and The Pok&eacute;mon Company's lawsuit against Pocketpair.</p><p>As noted by Japanese patent attorney Kiyoshi Kurihara in <a href="https://news.yahoo.co.jp/expert/articles/59f880c5e13b9292f0e3ab2d1d55ce8bdbfdb97f" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Yahoo Japan</em></a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/whats-the-killer-patent-nintendo-is-suing-palworld-for-japanese-patent-attorney-offers-in-depth-analysis/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Automaton West</em></a>), Nintendo and The Pok&eacute;mon Company requested that processing for these divisional patent applications be fast-tracked.</p><p>Of course, all of this is mere speculation at present, with the exact details of the lawsuit yet to be confirmed. When previously reached for comment, The Pok&eacute;mon Company told Mashable that it "refrain[s] from commenting on the matters related to the content of the lawsuit."</p><p>Mashable has also reached out to Nintendo and Pocketpair for comment.</p><p>"It is truly unfortunate that we will be forced to allocate significant time to matters unrelated to game development due to this lawsuit," Pocketpair said in its public statement. "However, we will do our utmost for our fans, and to ensure that indie game developers are not hindered or discouraged from pursuing their creative ideas."</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <pubDate>Fri, 20 Sep 2024 09:24:59 +0000</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[Soft drink 7UP wants to encourage users to “level up” their drink creations with a new brand platform.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01TyZHcNf6jS6bXYlPFZQdd/hero-image.png" alt="Five cans of 7UP in a, arc on a green background."><p>Your collection of bar cart staples probably includes the usual suspects: a mixologist-approved stainless steel shaker, cute or quirky umbrellas, and exotic syrups.</p><p>Get ready to add an unexpected item to that list: 7UP. That's right, the lemon-lime-flavoured soft drink from your childhood wants you to make space on your drink trolley for its fizzy goodness. In a move aimed at capturing the hearts &mdash; and taste buds &mdash; of Gen-Zers and Millennials, 7UP has launched a global campaign under the banner "<a href="https://www.talkingretail.com/products-news/soft-drinks/7up-launches-new-global-campaign-11-09-2024/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Level Up With 7UP</u></a>". The main idea is that 7UP can be a key ingredient for elevating any social gathering, from low-key beach days to happening house parties.</p><p>Here's what you need to know &mdash; and how you can join in the fun.</p><h2>7UP tapping into timely trends</h2><p>Millennials and Gen-Zers are comfortable experimenting with unique food and drink combinations. After all, these are the generations responsible for such iconic (if not bizarre) creations as butter boards, egg flights, and croissant-doughnut hybrids. These cohorts are also suckers for a throwback. So, it&rsquo;s not a stretch to think that they&rsquo;ll embrace a classic choice like 7UP as a modern addition to their mixology toolkit.</p><p>The campaign also taps into other social trends, like mixology at home and craft mocktail culture, as well as the fact that younger consumers are increasingly open to experimenting with unique beverage options, from matcha mojito mocktails to muddled pineapple and lime cordials. (The absolute explosion of seltzer options in your supermarket&rsquo;s drink aisle is proof of this movement.)</p><p>Notably, the campaign also spotlights 7UP's Zero Sugar variant, which offers the same citrus-forward flavour without the sugar. This inclusion is a nod to the growing demand for diverse beverage options, particularly among younger consumers seeking great, refreshing drinks with less sugar.</p><h2>The strategy behind the &lsquo;z campaign</h2><p>To drive home their message, 7UP is rolling out a dynamic mix of content, starting with a short film that depicts friends getting together and playfully experimenting with 7UP in their drink recipes. The video illustrates how this familiar soda can be transformed into a creative mixer that adds flair to any gathering. (And it just might provide you with inspiration for your next flat party or happy hour theme.)</p><div class="raw-embed">
    <div style="padding:50% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://notube.lbbonline.com/media/66e9616be5bb56001942b0b4?h=000&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; gyroscope; accelerometer" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="Tour of Ibiza"></iframe></div>


</div>
<p>In addition to the film, 7UP has also introduced a series of influencer collaborations that demonstrate inventive ways to add 7UP&rsquo;s signature citrusy punch to any bespoke beverage of choice. For instance, the soda can be used in unique versions of both classic and novel drinks&mdash;from <a href="https://www.7up.com/en/recipes" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>tropical punches to fruity infusions to lemon-lime spritzes</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>The hashtag challenge: #LEVELUPWITH7UP</h2><p>Got an idea for up-levelling your favourite drink? You can join the party online. The #LEVELUPWITH7UP hashtag invites users on platforms like TikTok and Instagram to share their own drink recipes using 7UP. Show off your creation with everything from quick tutorials to more in-depth explorations of the endless possibilities.</p><p>In the coming weeks, 7UP is taking their new campaign global, hitting markets like Egypt, Vietnam, Portugal, India, and Thailand. Expect a slew of locally produced influencer content with regional twists, tons of giveaways, drink sampling events, and even some VIP beach parties. Want in on the action? Keep an eye on the brand&rsquo;s social feeds for all the juicy details.</p><p>Whether you're coming up with a new mocktail or enhancing your refreshing spritz recipe, 7UP promises to bring a novel twist to your next gathering &mdash; and an unexpected addition to your perfectly curated bar cart.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Even in 2023, these tone-deaf assumptions still find a way to rain on the lesbian online dating experience. If it's not a man appearing in your feed when you specifically marked that you're searching for women, it's matching with a woman just to be hit with the classic "My boyfriend and I are looking for a threesome."</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>There's one big problem: The apps targeted toward the straights are still<em> </em>where most of the queer users are, too. Though women-only apps like HER are gaining traction fast, they can still be a bit of a ghost town...or a scammer's paradise. You just have to decide whether you'd rather deal with the quirks of Tinder and have more options to swipe through or be fine with coming across the same profile three times as long as it's not a man.</p><h2>What is the best dating app for lesbians?</h2><p>A decent number of dating sites and apps specifically for lesbians do exist, but most are plagued with the same issues: Either their sole purpose is to sexualise lesbians and aren't really meant for genuine connection at all, or their lax security protocols make it way too easy for ill-intentioned men to sign up pretending to be women. If you're wondering why we left most of those so-called female-only apps out, that's why.</p><p>With that in mind, we have lined up a selection of strong options to suit lesbians and gay women. Hopefully, there is something for everyone in this roundup.</p><p>These are the best dating apps for lesbians in 2024.</p>]]></content:encoded>

What makes the bi dating landscape &mdash; especially the online one &mdash;&nbsp;so tricky to manoeuvre?</p><h2>What is unicorn hunting?</h2><p>One of the most antiquated stereotypes about bisexual people is that they're always down to get physical and down for polyamory. "Unicorn" is a term used to describe a bisexual person (usually a woman) who sleeps with heterosexual couples. In online dating, unicorn hunting is when a straight, taken female user toggles that she's "looking for women" &mdash;&nbsp;not genuinely looking for a girl to get to know romantically, but rather for a girl interested in a threesome with her and her boyfriend or husband or whoever. Of course, they don't mention this until later.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>No one is saying that threesomes are bad. Reddit users who have experienced this mention that they don't have a problem with "ethical non-monogamy." They have a problem with being tricked into it. </p><h2>Are bisexuals welcome on heteronormative apps?</h2><p>Another frequent bisexual experience is one that all women face online, now heightened by the mere mention of "bi" in a dating app bio: men being creepy. Too many straight men have yet to grasp the concept that bisexuality is not a green light to ask a stranger how many girls they've been with or if she likes men or women better.</p><p>Catfishing is also an issue. Some men have such a rabid obsession with queer women that they'll sign up for a dating site as a woman just to see an all-women swiping field. It's a total privacy breach at the least, and certainly doesn't boost your willingness to meet up with someone in real life. Many dating sites are working to increase <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/did-you-swipe-right-on-a-criminal-new-technology-aims-to-verify-dating-profiles-2017-07-10" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">transparency about first name and age</a> by requiring Facebook verification during sign-up.</p><h2>Are queer dating apps inviting to bisexual users?</h2><p>Does "<a href="https://www.pride.com/lesbian/2016/2/18/5-reasons-phrase-gold-star-lesbian-needs-die#media-gallery-media-2" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">gold star lesbian</a>" ring a bell? The delineation is given to lesbians who have never slept with a man. Countless bisexual women have reported being ghosted after disclosing that they have been with a guy before, and profiles with "gold stars only" in the bio have popped up, too.</p><p>This <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/9dl5y7/biphobia_rampant_on_dating_apps/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">crowd of Reddit users</a> explain the ways they've experienced biphobia on gay or lesbian dating sites. They've been told that they're not "actually bisexual" <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/what-is-bi-curious-meaning" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">if they haven't been with anyone of the same gender</a> before or that they're "basically straight" if their most recent relationship was a heterosexual one. Summed up: if you're not monosexually gay, it's a cop-out. Invalidating someone's sexual experiences is the opposite of the supportive sex-positivity that you'd expect from inside the queer community, and it contributes to many bisexual folks' struggles of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/queer-enough-lgbtq-jameela-jamil-legendary" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">not feeling queer enough</a>.</p><h2>Should you put "bi" in your dating app bio?</h2><p>Adding those two simple letters to your bio will draw some unwanted attention, and it's going to be a pain in the ass. But in the long run, it'll also act like a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/eayko9/do_you_put_bisexual_as_your_sexuality_on_dating/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">filter</a> to weed out people who try to put sexual orientation into a box.</p><p>The idea that being bisexual is just a pit stop to being "fully-blown gay" &mdash; or that it means that you're attracted to everyone you see &mdash; probably aren't thoughts you'd prefer a partner to have. They're especially not opinions you'd like to hear about months down the road from someone you thought you knew well. The easiest way to ensure that you won't be left heartbroken over someone not accepting your sexuality? Let them know from the jump.</p><p>"Coming out" over and over again is unfair. But doing so right off the bat also acts as an early screening for people who identify as bi but say they <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/why-amber-rose-wont-date-bisexual-menand-why-shes-wrong" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">wouldn't date another bi person</a> &mdash;&nbsp;something that a lot of bi men experience from bi women.</p><h2>Can you actually find a relationship online?</h2><p>Do bisexual people get dealt a tough hand on dating apps? Yes. Does that mean <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-sites-for-serious-relationships-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">meeting someone special online</a> is impossible?

However, this also means that a good portion of other single bi folks are probably on those popular dating apps that you've considered. At least you know the user base is there. </p><h2>What is the best dating app for bisexual people?</h2><p>There are a lot of dating apps out there, each offering a different set of features that will suit some daters better than others.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/06d3wJgmF4DjcQ9fNb017jN/hero-image.jpg" alt="A phone displaying the New York Times game 'Connections.'"><p><em>Connections</em> is the latest <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/connections" target="_blank"><em>New York Times </em>word game</a> that's captured the public's attention. The game is all about finding the "common threads between words." And just like <em>Wordle</em>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-20-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> resets after midnight and each new set of words gets trickier and trickier&mdash;so we've served up some hints and tips to get you over the hurdle.</p><p>If you just want to be told today's puzzle, you can jump to the end of this article for June 26's <em>Connections</em> solution. But if you'd rather solve it yourself, keep reading for some clues, tips, and strategies to assist you.</p><h2><strong>What is <em>Connections</em>?</strong></h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <a class="text-gray-600" href="https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1679674590203723778?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(opens in a new window)">

    </a>
</blockquote>
<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>
<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple.

It'll stream on Samsung's website as well as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Samsung" target="_blank">its YouTube channel</a>, as always. One fun twist is that the event is in Paris this time, but if you're watching from home, that's mostly just window dressing.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>Samsung Galaxy Unpacked July 2024: What to expect</h2><p>Of course, the big thing on everyone's minds is what exactly Samsung will announce here. The invite said it would involve "the next generation of Galaxy AI and the ever-expanding Galaxy ecosystem," which helps a lot. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/galaxy-ai-new-devices" target="_self">Galaxy AI</a> is the suite of AI features <a href="https://mashable.com/article/samsung-unpacked-2024-everything-announced" target="_self">Samsung revealed</a> at the beginning of this year, so it's not surprising that we'll hear more about what's going on with that on July 10.</p><p>We'll also likely (based on timing) hear more about the next batch of Samsung foldables, which will probably be follow-ups to the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review" target="_self">Z Fold 5</a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/review/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review" target="_self">Z Flip 5</a> released last summer. </p><p>Get ready, folks.

Result: <a href="https://mashable.com/article/cybertruck-is-over" target="_self">all 3,878 Cybertrucks then on U.S. roads had to go back to the dealers</a>. And the whole world learned just how many had been sold in the first six months. </p><p>Given that Musk has been predicting &mdash; nay, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tesla-cybertruck-success-failure/" target="_blank">betting the future of the company</a> on &mdash; 250,000 Cybertruck sales a year, this number was almost as embarrassing as the soapy pedal pad itself. Releasing it via a recall was about as unforced as errors get. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>But with the latest <a href="https://mashable.com/article/tesla-cybertruck-wiper-recall" target="_self">Cybertruck recall, this time thanks to the windshield wiper</a>, there's good news on sales! Well, not good news if you're a Cybertruck owner who now has to worry about both soap <em>and </em>rain. But good-ish news for Tesla: this time, they're recalling 11,688! </p><p>In other words, now that the accelerator definitely <em>won't</em> turn it into a death trap, an extra 7,810 Americans have been convinced that this child's idea of a car is the truck for them. And that has nudged the Cybertruck past an important milestone: More have sold in eight months than DeLorean Motor Company sold in its entire three years of existence.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>If you don't know the DeLorean ... well first of all yes you do, it was the time machine with the weird gull-wing doors in <em>Back to the Future</em>. That hit movie, alas, arrived two years too late for John DeLorean and his troubled company. </p><p>Just under 10,000 were sold between 1981 and 1983, when DeLorean went bankrupt. Reportedly, more than 6,000 of them are still on the road today. </p><p>The DeLorean was the last beautifully-designed stainless steel vehicle ever put on the market. Then came the Cybertruck, which is also made of stainless steel. To be fair, both companies found out how incredibly difficult it is to work with that material, and both were accused of shoddy production. </p><p>So with nearly 12,000 sales, Cybertruck mania is off and running, right? Naysayers might point to Musk's sales goal, or they might wonder what happened to the <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/11/28/tesla-increases-cybertruck-pre-order-deposit-but-reverts" target="_blank">two million alleged pre-orders</a>. But hey, naysayers have no place in the new Tesla, where shareholders have so much blind faith in Musk they just <a href="https://mashable.com/article/tesla-musk-forever" target="_self">voted to give him an extra $45 billion</a>. </p><p>"If you want to know whether Cybertrucks are cool or not, ask a kid," Musk said at that shareholder meeting. "Kids have no filter, right?" Right! They also usually have no wallet. Not to mention an understanding of how much of a pain it is when your new vehicle has to keep going back to the dealer.</p><p>The Cybertruck was also recalled this time because of a weird piece of trim in the truck bed that could fly off and hit other motorists. But hey, once you've got your new accelerator, your new wiper, and your new trim that won't kill anyone, what else could possibly go wrong? Just make sure you pay no attention to the stories about <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tesla-cybertruck-rusting-complaints-from-owners/" target="_blank">rust spots</a> (just perfectly <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/tesla-cybertruck-rust-reports-analysis/" target="_blank">normal grime</a>!) or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/12/23999258/software-problems-apparently-stranded-this-cybertruck-near-lake-tahoe" target="_blank">software errors that can leave you stranded</a>, or <a href="https://jalopnik.com/tesla-cybertruck-no-match-for-car-wash-1851417011" target="_blank">car washes</a> that turn this truck into a stainless-steel brick. </p><p>And if you do, well ... maybe buy another one before the recall, to goose the sales figures? After all, given the massive drain on its accounts known as Elon Musk, Tesla needs all the cash you can give it. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This is reverberating around Wall Street because Nvidia has been making shareholders rich of late. On June 18, for example, Nvidia surpassed both Microsoft and Apple to suddenly become the world's most valuable company with a market capitalization of $3.34 trillion.</p><p>Now, just one week later, Nvidia is worth around $2.9 trillion, surrendering its <em>most valuable company</em> crown to Microsoft, valued at $3.3 trillion. The company now ranks third behind Apple, which is also worth over $3 trillion.</p><p>Nvidia is still doing just fine of course. And it's likely to still be raking in plenty of revenue thanks to AI-related patronage from the likes of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/elon-musk-xai-supercomputer-plans" target="_self">Elon Musk</a>, who is reportedly building an Nvidia-based "supercomputer" via his AI company xAI. However, this recent downturn on the stock market might show that investors are sending a message that they're not so bullish on the AI industry's monumental claims of how they will change the world with their technology.</p><p>As multiple outlets have reported, AI companies have <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/the-ai-revolution-is-already-losing-steam-a93478b1" target="_blank"><u>made big promises,</u></a> but so far have had very little to show for it when it comes to actual meaningful change in the industry's AI claimed to soon disrupt. On top of that, <a href="https://jacobin.com/2024/06/ai-data-center-energy-usage-environment" target="_blank"><u>studies</u></a> have found AI to be a massive energy and resource drain, which will certainly give at least some AI backers second thoughts about where the industry is headed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>ChatGPT is not available in mainland China, but users have gotten around that by using the OpenAI API. According to Securities Times, many Chinese startups have built applications using the API. </p><p>It's unclear what prompted OpenAI to reportedly start restricting API access. But the company recently investigated and cut off five "<a href="https://mashable.com/article/openai-stopped-five-covert-influence-operations" target="_self">covert influence operations</a>." One of these was a Chinese network called "Spamouflage" which reportedly used OpenAI models to research and generate social media posts targeting critics of the Chinese government. The Biden Administration has determined that generative AI models are a cybersecurity risk and has mandated security testing and evaluations of foundation models in the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/white-house-drops-ai-regulation-bombshell" target="_self">AI executive order</a>. </p><p>As a result of the apparent move from OpenAI, Chinese companies with their own AI models have announced incentives to lure OpenAI users to their platforms. Per Reuters, Baidu is offering free migration to its Ernie chatbot with additional tokens for its flagship model Ernie 3.5. Similarly, Alibaba Cloud has offered free tokens and migration to its Qwen-plus model and Zhipu AI has launched a "Special Migration Program" for OpenAI API users, claiming its GLM model meets the same benchmarks as OpenAI's models. </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01MZ3gygC4mWr3gE9j8DSyv/hero-image.jpg" alt="dr disrespect face up close"><p><a href="https://x.com/drdisrespect" target="_blank">Dr Disrespect</a>, a popular streamer, has been booted from his gaming studio after disturbing allegations surfaced about an apparent text conversation he had with a minor. </p><p>The video game streamer, whose real name is Herschel "Guy" Beahm, was unceremoniously kicked off <a href="https://mashable.com/category/twitch" target="_self">Twitch</a> four years ago. The public was unsure why. Now, reports suggest it was due to an inappropriate texting relationship with a minor. </p><p>An anonymous former employee on Twitch's trust and safety team <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/23/24183875/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-explanation" target="_blank">told The Verge</a> that Beahm messaged a minor using Twitch's now-defunct messaging service, Whispers, and attempted to set up a meeting at TwitchCon. Cody Conners, another former Twitch employee, posted on X alleging Beahm &mdash; though Conners did not say his name outright &mdash; was banned "because got caught sexting a minor."</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Beahm, meanwhile, has denied any wrongdoing.</p><p>"Listen, I'm obviously tied to legal obligations from the settlement with Twitch but I just need to say what I can say since this is the fucking internet," he <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1804577136998776878" target="_blank">wrote on X</a> over the weekend. "I didn't do anything wrong, all this has been probed and settled, nothing illegal, no wrongdoing was found, and I was paid."</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

        Tweet may have been deleted
    </a>
</blockquote>
<p>In the wake of the allegations, Beahm is now out from Midnight Society, a gaming studio he co-founded. </p><p>On Monday, the studio posted a <a href="https://x.com/12am/status/1805341504086622355" target="_blank">statement</a> on X:</p><blockquote><p>"On Friday evening we became aware of an allegation against one of our co-founder&rsquo;s Guy Beahm aka Dr Disrespect. </p><p>We assumed his innocence and began speaking with parties involved. And in order to maintain our principles and standards as a studio and individuals, we needed to act. </p><p>For this reason, we are terminating our relationship with Guy Beahm immediately. </p><p>While these facts are difficult to hear and even more difficult to accept, it is our duty to act with dignity on behalf of all individuals involved, especially the fifty-five developers and families we have employed along with our community of players." </p></blockquote><p>Gizmodo <a href="https://gizmodo.com/dr-disrespect-twitch-herschel-guy-beahm-streaming-1851557849" target="_blank">reported that</a>, during a stream on Monday evening, Beahm said he was taking a break from streaming because he was "burnt out."  </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After Walmart could barely scrounge up a noteworthy robot vacuum deal for <a href="https://mashable.com/article/walmart-plus-week-robot-vacuum-deals" target="_self">Walmart+ Week</a>, we're banking on Amazon even harder to go off on robot vacuum deals for Prime Day.</p><p>We're in good hands, though. Overall, Amazon is already generally the best place to score a robot vacuum on sale at any point during the year, whether that's a shopping holiday or a random Tuesday in September when your current corded vacuum sends you over the edge. Despite <a href="https://media.irobot.com/2024-01-29-Amazon-and-iRobot-agree-to-terminate-pending-acquisition" target="_blank">ditching its plans to buy iRobot</a>, Amazon is still the best retailer to find a <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-roombas" target="_self">Roomba</a> on sale, slashing Roomba prices by between 25% to 50% throughout the year. We're manifesting those same Roombas to reach new record-low pricing as Prime Day nears  &mdash; ideally, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/V05nx?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Roomba%20Combo%20j9%2B&object_type=article&object_uuid=06GDudIxr7MNssa1pV8zoy7&short_url=V05nx&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Roomba Combo j9+</a> would drop below $800 or the <a href="https://zdcs.link/kn1NX?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Combo%20j5%2B&object_type=article&object_uuid=06GDudIxr7MNssa1pV8zoy7&short_url=kn1NX&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Combo j5+</a> below $400.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>We're similarly hoping that Prime Day sets the stage for new all-time low prices on other premium robot vacs released at <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ces-2024-robot-vacuums" target="_self">CES 2024</a> in January. Particularly, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/dM8q2?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Eufy%20X10%20Pro%20Omni&object_type=article&object_uuid=06GDudIxr7MNssa1pV8zoy7&short_url=dM8q2&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Eufy X10 Pro Omni</a> dropping below $650 or the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra getting its very first discount would be awesome &mdash;&nbsp;<a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-robot-vacuums" target="_self">we've tested and loved both.</a></p><p>But if you've already taken a beach trip that has left your floors perpetually sandy, you don't have to wait until Prime Day (July 16 and 17) to make the move on a robot vacuum. We'll be refreshing our list of robovacs on sale at Amazon (with subcategories for standard robot vacuums from robot vacuums that mop) throughout the upcoming weeks as Prime Day nears, and will keep you posted when Amazon switches over to official early Prime Day deals. For now, <strong><em>deals with a <s>strikeout</s> were either sold out or no longer available at their best sale price when we last checked. Anything marked with a &#128293; has dropped to an all-time low price.</em></strong></p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

And it's already seen several groundbreaking price cuts just in June: its current discount code X9PROEUFY bumps the discount to a full 50% off, beating the discount seen in mid-June that was exclusive to Prime members.</p><p>The X9 Pro is more reminiscent of its successor than its predecessor: It has a flat edge to get into corners, it mops, washes, and dries its own mopping pads, and uses AI to detect and avoid small obstacles like phone cables. As a mopper, the X9 Pro provides more elbow grease than many competitors thanks to double-pressurized, rotating mopping heads. These automatically lift above the ground if carpet is detected.</p><h3>More robot vacuums on sale at Amazon</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/q7yvy?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Eufy%20L60&object_type=article&object_uuid=06GDudIxr7MNssa1pV8zoy7&short_url=q7yvy&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Eufy L60</a> &mdash;

<p><a href="https://mashable.com/category/prime-day" target="_self">Amazon Prime Day</a> is coming up, and you'll be able to shop hundreds of deals when the event launches on July 16. But you don't have to spend a dime to scoop up some great games by way of <a href="https://zdcs.link/vd852?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Prime%20Gaming&object_type=article&object_uuid=04J4zZeClMrniGNcYNM4lF4&short_url=vd852&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Prime Gaming</a>. While you can already get a rotating selection of free games from Amazon each month, there will be a few more to sweeten the deal just in time for Prime Day. </p><p>Prime Gaming members will be able to claim free games and other goodies every day until July 16, with several options available right now. To claim them, you need to be logged into your Prime account. Then visit the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Lv5VX?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Prime%20Gaming%20page&object_type=article&object_uuid=04J4zZeClMrniGNcYNM4lF4&short_url=Lv5VX&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Prime Gaming page</a> and click the "Activate Prime Gaming" option in the top right corner of the page. You'll only see your Amazon account name there if you're logged in and have already activated your account. </p><p>When you claim a free Prime Gaming title, you can keep it forever &ndash; no strings attached. That's why it's important to grab each game while you can.. Right now, there's a decent selection of titles to choose from, including: </p><ul><li><p><em>Star Wars Battlefront II (Classic)</em></p></li><li><p><em>Deceive Inc.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Call of Juarez</em></p></li><li><p><em>The Invisible Hand</em></p></li><li><p><em>Tearstone: Thieves of the Heart - CE</em></p></li></ul><p>There's a decent mix of free titles here to choose from, but standout games include <em>Star Wars Battlefront II (Classic)</em>, a fun multiplayer title set in the <em>Star Wars</em> universe where you can duke it out with large-scale battles and exciting matchups that feel like your own custom story in a galaxy far, far away.<em> Call of Juarez</em> is an oldie but a goodie, especially if you're a first-person shooter fan who happens to be into Western settings. These games are redeemable on multiple platforms, including the Epic Games Store and GOG. </p><p>Amazon has revealed additional titles that are on their way as part of Prime Day as well, including:</p><ul><li><p><em>Soulstice</em> (Available on June 27)</p></li><li><p><em>Forager</em> (Available on June 27)</p></li><li><p><em>Heaven Dust</em> (Available on June 27)</p></li><li><p><em>Card Shark</em> (Available on June 27)</p></li></ul><p>There are also occasional non-game bonuses you can claim, like a free Twitch channel subscription (a $4.99 value) that you can put toward your favorite streamer. You'll need to make sure your Twitch and Amazon Prime accounts are connected. This subscription counts as a Prime subscription and is only valid for 30 days. You'll need to continue your subscription with real cash if you want to keep supporting your streamer. </p><p>If you're looking to grow your game collection without having to spend any money, it's in your best interest to keep checking back each week for another drop, as it seems there will be plenty to go around this Prime Day. We'll keep you updated on what's available so you can take advantage of every single deal available to you during this year's massive shopping event. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Another Prime-exclusive deal that turned our heads is the Fire HD 10 Kids Pro, which is down to an all-time low $109.99 for Prime members. That's a savings of 42% and beats its previous all-time low by $15. Designed for 6- to 12-year-olds, the kids tablet <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/amazon-fall-event-2023-announcements" target="_blank">released in 2023</a> is marketed as Amazon's "best kids tablet yet." It features a 10.1-inch 1080p full HD display, a lighter design, is 25% faster than the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/amazon-fire-hd-10-kids-pro-tablet" target="_self">previous generation</a>, 3GB of RAM, and up to 13 hours of battery life. And like other Amazon tablets for kids, its durable case (with a built-in kickstand) can stand up to all kinds of adventures. There's no need to hold off on purchasing until Prime Day, as this price is already extremely impressive.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>Our buds at PCMag (which is owned by Mashable's publisher, Ziff Davis) <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/amazon-luna-controller" target="_blank">reviewed Amazon's Luna controller</a> and found it to be "an excellent gamepad that provides the optimal Luna game-streaming experience." The real advantage, they noted, is its separate WiFi connection that reduces input lag as you play. It's <em>technically</em> optional for the Luna gaming experience, but they consider it a "must-have." Regularly $69.99, you can save $30 as a Prime member and snag it for only $39.99. It even includes a free month of Luna+ to get you up and running. </p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>Bass lovers looking for a portable speaker will fall for the Sony ULT Field 1. Mashable's own Miller Kern went <a href="https://mashable.com/review/sony-ult-field-1-speaker" target="_self">hands-on with the speaker</a> and found its sound quality, customizable EQs, and ULT setting to be particularly impressive selling points. While its battery life could be better, we're willing to give it a pass for its affordable price tag. Usually $129.99, Amazon has it on sale for only $98 as of June 25. That's 25% off and matches its record-low price.</p><p><em>None of these deals catching your eye?

<h2>Paramount+ price changes</h2><p>The new prices for each Paramount+ plan after the price changes are as follows:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Paramount+ with commercials</strong>: $7.99/mo ($1 increase)</p></li><li><p><strong>Paramount+ Essential</strong>: $7.99/mo for new subscribers as of Aug. 20 ($2 increase)</p></li><li><p><strong>Paramount+ with Showtime</strong>: $12.99/mo as of Aug. 20 for new customers or Sept. 20 for existing ones ($1 change)</p></li></ul><p>There are a couple of weird caveats to note here. First, the "Paramount+ with commercials" plan is not actually something people can sign up for right now. That price change only applies to people who had that plan when it <em>was</em> on offer and have been grandfathered into the new system. Second, existing subscribers to Paramount+ Essential will actually see no price change at all. They will continue paying $5.99/mo.</p><p>This combined with recent price increases for other services like <a href="https://mashable.com/article/max-prices-rise" target="_self">Max</a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/spotify-premium-price-increase-june-2024" target="_self">Spotify</a> make it clear that cutting the cord isn't quite the money-saver it used to be.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Enjoying your favorite podcast or rocking out to your newest playlist can only be interrupted by one thing &mdash; ads. If these put a damper on your listening experience, maybe it's time to cut them out of your life. Thanks to today's early <a href="https://mashable.com/article/prime-day-everything-you-need-to-know" target="_self">Prime Day</a> deal at Amazon, you could enjoy ad-free music and podcasts for months to come.</p><p>As of June 25, Prime members can sign up for five months of free access to <a href="https://zdcs.link/jo8YL?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Amazon%20Music%20Unlimited%2C&object_type=article&object_uuid=03cv66CD3jy1e26DK01OaCl&short_url=jo8YL&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Amazon Music Unlimited,</a> which usually costs $9.99 per month for Prime members, for a total savings of $49.95. Non-Prime members are still in for a great deal with three months of free access, saving a total of $32.97. The deal extends only to new subscribers to Amazon Music Unlimited.</p><p>With <a href="https://mashable.com/article/early-prime-day-apple-deals-2024" target="_self">Prime Day 2024</a> on the horizon, Amazon is offering some epic deals. The mega retailer often offers Prime members a free one-month trial of its music streaming platform, but this deal comes with five generous months for any Prime member who's new to Amazon Music Unlimited.</p><p>Ad-free music and podcasts are at your fingertips with Amazon Music Unlimited. That means you can say goodbye to fishing your phone out of your pocket to skip annoying ad breaks. The service also gives you unlimited skipping power should you stumble into a track you're not digging. Plus, you can listen offline which could be great during upcoming summer travel. </p><p>Keep in mind Amazon will automatically charge your card for continued membership to Amazon Music Unlimited after the five-month trial period, but you can cancel anytime. </p><p>If you're not a Prime member, now's a decent time to consider if signing up makes sense for your shopping needs. <a href="https://zdcs.link/R07LK?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Prime%20Day&object_type=article&object_uuid=03cv66CD3jy1e26DK01OaCl&short_url=R07LK&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Prime Day</a> sales officially hit on July 16 and 17 this year, with exclusive deals for members. But like this deal, we expect to see Prime-member-only sales hit well before the official <a href="https://mashable.com/category/prime-day" target="_self">Prime Day event</a> starts. A yearly <a href="https://zdcs.link/NM3Ld?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Prime%20membership&object_type=article&object_uuid=03cv66CD3jy1e26DK01OaCl&short_url=NM3Ld&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Prime membership</a> costs $139, or you can opt for a monthly membership for $14.99 per month.</p><p>If your music or podcast streaming platform isn't giving you a great experience, try out <a href="https://zdcs.link/jo8YL?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Amazon%20Music%20Unlimited&object_type=article&object_uuid=03cv66CD3jy1e26DK01OaCl&short_url=jo8YL&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Amazon Music Unlimited</a> which is free for five months for Prime members new to the music platform.

<p>"The Realm is going to war because you're too busy serving face and fashion. Shame on you Ser Criston Cole," commented one user on a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C5Y-x06rdZd/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==" target="_blank">post</a> promoting a profile on Frankel in the style magazine <em>Man About Town</em>. </p><p>"I hate you. But you're so handsome," commented another on the same post. Some called out Cole's &mdash;&nbsp;shall we say &mdash;&nbsp;negligence over the young Targaryen heir Jaehaerys being slain in bed, commenting, "Where were you when the heir to the throne was murdered?" Still others shared their desire for Frankel's character to meet a gruesome death. "Man I hope someone jumps this guy," said one commenter. </p><p>Ser Criston Cole was already a contender for the most detestable <em>House of the Dragon</em> character when he spitefully switched allegiances to Alicent Hightower in <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-1-ending-explained" target="_self">Season 1</a> &mdash; after being rejected by Rhaenyra Targaryen. But when he concocted episode 2's <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-2-twins-erryk-arryk" target="_self">evil twin plot</a>, fueled by his own guilt about breaking his celibacy vow (a lot) by bedding Alicent <em>while</em> the heir presumptive was beheaded, Cole may have <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-2-ser-criston-cole" target="_self">surpassed Joffrey Baratheon as the most hated character. </a></p><p>While some vocal <em>House of the Dragon </em>fans are publicly conflating the real Frankel and the fictional Cole, other fans swiftly <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C8kZlDBoRd-/?img_index=1" target="_blank">came to the actor's defense</a> and gave the haters a reality check. "I'm sorry HOTD fans are bothering you, you don't deserve any hate for playing a character, love you Fabien," said one Instagram user in a comment that got 1,893 likes. "Yes. We hate Sir [sic] Criston Cole. Yes, we LOVE Fabien," said another. </p><p>Many pointed out that Cole's loathsome antics are a testament to Frankel's acting. "You know an actor has mastered the craft when the audience is unable to separate the fictional character from the real-life human. You are doing an amazing job. Keep up the good work!" said one comment. "You're a very talented actor, ignore the hate. You just play the character so well that people assume you're the same person," said another. </p><p>Yes, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-2-ser-criston-cole" target="_self">Ser Criston Cole sucks</a>. But let's keep the hatred to the fictional character who is destabilizing the realm with his impulsive, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-mens-egos-war" target="_self">egotistical</a> behavior, not the actor who makes Cole the character we love to hate. </p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/el4jA?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3Btemplate=article&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=New%20episodes%20of%20House%20of%20the%20Dragon%20air%20Sundays%20at%209%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20HBO%20and%20Max.&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=00imlCa1Zf2bZssHTCnPdle&amp%3Bshort_url=el4jA&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Fhouse-of-the-dragon-season-2-book-vs-show&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=How%20to%20watch%3A%20New%20episodes%20of%20House%20of%20the%20Dragon%20air%20Sundays%20at%209%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20HBO%20and%20Max.&object_type=article&object_uuid=070brRPf4LBNLQUKIoXS4Eq&short_url=el4jA&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><strong><u>How to watch: </u></strong>New episodes of <em>House of the Dragon </em>air Sundays at 9 p.m. ET on HBO and Max.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

   <em><strong>UPDATE: Jun. 25, 2024, 12:00 p.m. EDT </strong>We've updated this story with new info about Amazon Prime Day 2024, including its dates and some details about a competing sale at Walmart.</em>
</p>
<p><a href="https://mashable.com/category/amazon" target="_self">Amazon</a> Prime Day is turning 10 this year, and the members-only sale is poised to be a huge draw for sticker shock-weary shoppers on the hunt for summer deals. (Granted, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/amazon-prime-day-how-to-find-the-best-deals" target="_self">not </a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/amazon-prime-day-how-to-find-the-best-deals" target="_self"><em>every</em></a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/amazon-prime-day-how-to-find-the-best-deals" target="_self"> deal is worth it</a>.)</p><p>Here's what you need to know about <a href="https://mashable.com/category/prime-day" target="_self">Amazon Prime Day 2024</a> &mdash; including some just-confirmed dates.</p><h2>When is Prime Day 2024?</h2><p>Amazon announced in a <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/2024/6/correcting-and-replacing-amazons-10th-prime-day-event-returns-july-16-17-with-millions-of-exclusive-deals-for-prime-members" target="_blank">press release</a> Tuesday that Prime Day will run from <strong>Tuesday, July 16</strong> through <strong>Wednesday, July 17</strong> in 2024. This lines up with its historical preference for early-week slots in mid-July, so it comes as little surprise. (For reference, Prime Day 2022 was live from Tuesday, July 12 through Wednesday, July 13, and Prime Day 2023 ran from Tuesday, June 11 through Wednesday, July 12.)</p><h2>What is Prime Day?</h2><p>Prime Day is an annual sitewide sale open to paid and trial members of Amazon's Prime subscription service. First held in 2015 in honor of Amazon's <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/amazon-celebrating-20-years-with-prime-day-deals" target="_blank"><u>20th anniversary</u></a> (with <a href="https://mashable.com/archive/amazon-prime-numbers" target="_self"><u>mixed success</u></a>), it was originally <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/step-aside-black-friday-meet-prime-day" target="_blank"><u>plugged</u></a> as a "one-day-only event filled with more deals than Black Friday." In the years since, it's morphed into a 48-hour affair that's preceded by weeks of preview offers. "Prime <em>Day"</em> is a misnomer at this point.</p><p>For the past two years, Amazon has hosted another major two-day sale for Prime members in October, teeing up its Black Friday festivities. (The 2022 version was called "Prime Early Access Sale," and it was renamed to "Prime Big Deal Days" in 2023.) However, the summer iteration of Prime Day has remained Amazon's flagship sale.</p><h2>What to expect from Prime Day</h2><p>Prime Day is Black Friday-coded in the sense that it's prime time for finding unprecedented price drops that you wouldn't see otherwise throughout the year. We can loosely predict what products will be on sale for Prime Day 2024 by looking back at <a href="https://mashable.com/article/amazon-prime-day-2023-day-2" target="_self">last year's hot items</a> in categories like robot vacuums, headphones, and Amazon devices.</p><p>With the Kindle Paperwhite dropping below $100 in 2023, for example, we'd love to see our new <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-kindles" target="_self">favorite Kindle</a>, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/b1mKo?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Kindle%20Paperwhite%20Signature%20Edition&object_type=article&object_uuid=021GMBMBI2cCTSZOcIhfGnL&short_url=b1mKo&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition</a>, hit or beat its Black Friday price of $129.99. Between a smart mapping Roomba dropping below $200 and a j Series Roomba with small obstacle avoidance dropping below $300 (and staying there for much of spring 2024), a j Series Roomba scooting under the $250 point seems like the natural next step for the robot vacuum section.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>If you're eyeing Apple deals, Prime Day 2024 should be especially good for them. The past year has been packed with Apple events introducing new <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-iphone-15-plus-review" target="_self">iPhones</a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-macbook-air-m3-chip" target="_self">MacBooks</a>, and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-watch-series-9-vs-watch-se" target="_self">Apple Watches</a>; Apple most recently announced a new <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ipad-air-2024-preorder" target="_self">iPad Air</a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ipad-pro-2024-preorder" target="_self">iPad Pro</a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-pencil-pro-preorder" target="_self">Apple Pencil Pro</a>, and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-magic-keyboard-2024-preorder" target="_self">Magic Keyboard</a> at its iPad-centric event on May 10. The mere existence of all this new gear could definitely trigger new record-low prices on all of the older versions of these devices, pushing Apple Watch 9 or 2023 MacBook discounts past their $100-ish plateaus.</p><p>Amazon devices themselves might have a similar story. Amazon device deals are always at the heart of Prime Day, but after a new version of almost every single Alexa-enabled device came out at the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/amazon-devices-and-services-event-2023-preorders" target="_self">Amazon event in Sept. 2023</a>, there are a ton of new Amazon devices ripe for the picking for Prime Day 2024.

<p>If you're A Chosen One, Amazon's <a href="https://mashable.com/article/black-friday-amazon-invite-only-deals" target="_self">invite-only deals</a> for Prime members are really where it's at. October Prime Day's selection was a doozy, offering 60% off two Fire TVs and 62% off Jabra earbuds and a Sony soundbar. During Prime Day in July 2023, the star of the invite-only section was a 43-inch Omni Fire TV rocking a 75% discount, bringing it below $100.</p><p>For Prime Day 2024, we wouldn't be surprised to see the mega invite-only discount focus divert from the 43-inch to 55-inch range and focus on bigger models, like a 65-inch or 75-inch Fire TV from Hisense. Invite-only deals could be announced as early as June, as extra time is needed for shoppers to request and be granted access by the time Prime Day actually starts.</p><h2>Can you shop on Prime Day without being a Prime member?</h2><p>Not all Prime Day deals are officially tied to the sale, but to have access to the most possible savings, you will want to be a Prime member.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>You can participate in Prime Day without committing to a paid Prime membership by scheduling a <a href="https://zdcs.link/GyqXV?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=30-day%20free%20trial&object_type=article&object_uuid=021GMBMBI2cCTSZOcIhfGnL&short_url=GyqXV&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">30-day free trial</a> around the event. Just remember to <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-cancel-amazon-prime" target="_self">cancel it</a> as soon as the sale is over to avoid getting charged. </p><h2>Who's competing with Prime Day?</h2><p>At this point, it's traditional for other major retailers to conveniently hold sales right before, during, and right after Prime Day.</p><p>Last year, that included Best Buy's Black Friday in July sale which took place from July 10 to 12, Walmart+ Week from July 10 to 13, and Target Circle Week from July 9 to July 15. (As a reminder, last year's Prime Day ran from July 11 to 12.) Both <a href="https://mashable.com/article/walmart-spring-sale" target="_self">Walmart </a>and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/april-4-target-circle-week-deal" target="_self">Target</a> just <em>happened</em> to hold big spring sale events around the time Amazon was running its Big Spring Sale, so we're expecting no less competition-wise for the summer blowouts. Beyond expanded sale times, these retailers can offer better deals on certain categories like QLED TVs, high-end laptops, and home essentials.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>So far, only Walmart has confirmed its plans for its summer sale. The big-box store will host an event called "Walmart Deals" online and on the Walmart app from Monday, July 8 through Thursday, July 11 &mdash; aka the week before Prime Day. The sale is being billed as Walmart's "largest deals event ever," and will feature five hours of early access for paid Walmart+ members before it opens to the public at 5 p.m. ET on the 8th.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01uubMEQQzGOrHSPrF9H2ek/hero-image.jpg" alt="Tesla Cybertruck wiper"><p>Remember <a href="https://mashable.com/article/tesla-cybertruck-wiper" target="_self">Tesla Cybertruck's oversized windshield wiper</a>? The one that appears too large to exist, at least not without malfunctioning in some way? Well, it turns out that it is. </p><p>Tesla just <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2024/RCLRPT-24V456-3775.PDF" target="_blank">issued a recall</a> for over 11,000 Cybertrucks over a windshield wiper issue. The recall includes all model year 2024 Cybertruck vehicles manufactured from Nov. 13, 2023, to June 6, 2024, which is pretty much all of them given that the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/tesla-cybertruck-how-to-watch" target="_self">Cybertruck deliveries</a> started in Nov. 2023. </p><p>"On affected vehicles, the front windshield wiper motor controller may stop functioning due to electrical overstress to the gate driver component," the recall report says. "A non-functioning windshield wiper may reduce visibility in certain operating conditions, which may increase the risk of a collision."</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

        </a>
    </div>
<p>The report also said that Tesla is not aware of any collisions, injuries, or deaths relating to the issue. </p><p>For Cybertruck owners, this means that they'll have to take their car to a Tesla service center and get the windshield wiper motor replaced. </p><p>The Cybertruck's oversized windshield gained notoriety even before the car itself launched with spy shots revealing just how <a href="https://mashable.com/article/tesla-cybertruck-wiper" target="_self">oddly huge it is</a> (compared to any other car's wiper). Tesla CEO Elon Musk also said that the wiper is a big trouble for the car's development, noting that there's "<a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1469371515430912004" target="_blank">no easy solution</a>" for it.</p><p>The chatter about the wiper subsided after the car launched, but it appears that its troublemaking days aren't over. </p><p>The company also issued another Cybertruck recall, this one for a trim piece along the truck bed which can come loose and fall off. This one will also need to be replaced or re-attached to avoid losing it. </p><p>This is not the Cybertruck's first recall rodeo. The company <a href="https://mashable.com/article/cybertruck-is-over" target="_self">recalled all of the Cybertrucks it sold in April 2024</a> due to accelerator pad issues. And unlike many of Tesla's other recalls, which were easily solved with a software update, these Cybertruck recalls required a visit to a service center. All in all, Tesla issued four Cybertruck recalls since the car went on sale. </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[Apple is reportedly talking to Meta about bringing its Meta AI models to Apple Intelligence. Here's what we know.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03fggf1cI1QkxGrcLIW2pgG/hero-image.jpg" alt="A laptop keyboard and Apple Intelligence on website displayed on a phone screen"><p class="mx-auto">
   <em><strong>UPDATE: Jun. 25, 2024, 8:03 a.m. EDT </strong>A new report from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman disputes the Wall Street Journal's report, stating that Apple rejected the idea of partnering with Meta and that no formal conversations ever took place. The story has been updated to include this information.</em>
</p>
<p>Meta AI might be coming to iPhones and other Apple devices, depending on who you believe.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/apple-meta-have-discussed-an-ai-partnership-cc57437e" target="_blank"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>, Meta and Apple are in talks for a potential partnership that would integrate Meta's generative AI model into <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-intelligence-ai-siri-wwdc-2024" target="_self">Apple Intelligence</a>. </p><p>It seemed that Apple and Meta are putting aside a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-tim-cook-feud-history-facebook-apple-2020-9" target="_blank">longstanding feud</a> over privacy and revenue-sharing in favor of establishing footing in the competition for AI dominance. For Meta, the partnership could mean wider distribution of its AI features. For Apple, it would insulate the company from any<strong> </strong>over-reliance on its OpenAI partnership. </p><p>At <a href="https://mashable.com/article/wwdc-2024-everything-apple-announced" target="_self">WWDC</a> earlier this month, Apple announced a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-openai-chatgpt-integration-announced-wwdc-2024" target="_self">deal</a> with OpenAI that brings ChatGPT to iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. But that's not the only AI model Apple is planning to add to its operating systems. In a post-keynote discussion with iJustine, senior VP of software engineering Craig Federighi said Apple is also looking to integrate Google Gemini and other AI models. </p><p>"We think ultimately people are going to have a preference perhaps for certain models that they want to use, maybe one that&rsquo;s great for creative writing or one that they prefer for coding. And so we want to enable users ultimately to bring a model of their choice," said Federighi. </p><p>Now it looks like Meta AI might be one of the models that Apple users can choose to interact with. The <em>Journal</em> also said Apple is also<strong> </strong>in with talks with Anthropic (which makes the ChatGPT competitor Claude), and Perplexity, which is an AI-powered search engine. </p><p>However, <em>Bloomberg's</em> Mark Gurman on Tuesday, June 25 published a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-24/apple-spurned-idea-of-iphone-ai-partnership-with-meta-months-ago" target="_blank">report</a> disputing WSJ, stating that Apple rejected partnering with Meta months ago and that no formal discussions were held.</p><p>Apple Intelligence is the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/wwdc-2024-apple-ios-18-ai-features" target="_self">collection of AI features</a> the company has developed for iPhones, iPads, and Macs. But Apple has chosen to supplement AI capabilities with ChatGPT for improved Siri functionality and features like drafting emails and generating images. Notably, Apple touted a privacy-first approach with the ChatGPT announcement and says users will be asked for permission before sharing information with ChatGPT.</p><p>The potential Meta partnership raises the question of how Apple will protect user privacy, since Meta doesn't have a great <a href="https://mashable.com/article/facebook-privacy-settlement-payout" target="_self">track record</a> with that. Meta AI is <a href="https://mashable.com/article/meta-ai-assistant-facebook-instagram" target="_self">trained on users' posts</a> and other publicly shared data on its platforms and it's <a href="https://mashable.com/article/meta-using-posts-train-ai-opt-out" target="_self">nearly impossible</a> to opt out.</p><p>It's unclear what the terms of the deal would be. But we know that Apple "paid" OpenAI with distribution and access instead of cash. Partnering with Apple could similarly boost Meta's userbase and increase its stature in the cutthroat generative AI race. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The updated tags (known as "attributes") are intended to address broader, intersecting accessibility needs for those navigating public spaces and businesses, following the popularity of Yelp's "wheelchair accessible" tag.

<p>Yelp will also provide accessibility inclusion guidance under a new Accessibility Resources Hub for business owners themselves, designed with information from its nonprofit partners. </p><p>"Far too often, people with disabilities do not have access to information to find businesses and services that are accessible to them," said Calla Devlin, managing director of <a href="https://www.opentoall.com/" target="_blank">Open to All</a>, a coalition of nonprofits promoting nondiscrimination. "Yelp&rsquo;s new suite of attributes is an invaluable tool for customers, and Open to All offers resources and guidance for businesses to create welcoming and safe environments for all customers."</p><p>Yelp's visual features will be getting a revamp, too, with new AI-powered alternative text descriptions for photos uploaded to the site. The feature harnesses unnamed Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate descriptive alternative text for images for screen readers, Yelp explains. Earlier this year, Yelp announced a new AI assistant, adding to a larger collection of generative AI features integrated on the platform.</p><p>"To help people discover and connect with great local businesses, it&rsquo;s important that they can determine if those businesses will accommodate their needs, especially when it comes to accessibility," said Yelp Senior Vice President of Product Akhil Kuduvalli Ramesh. "With these new accessibility attributes, we&rsquo;re excited to help businesses more clearly indicate their inclusive practices to make it even easier for people to find the right business for them."</p>]]></content:encoded>

It contains no images of the watch, featuring instead images of a Chromebook; and some of the details, such as 128GB of storage and 8GB of RAM, are obviously related to a Chromebook. But a big chunk of the listing, including the title, seems to be about the upcoming wearable. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

My pre-owned 27-inch iMac served me well for nearly a decade, and I was satisfied with my desk setup. That is, until my new job sent me a 34-inch curved ultra-wide monitor along with my company laptop. It was an absolute behemoth, laughably large in the tiny home office I share with my partner, but &mdash; after leaving that job and replacing my iMac with a new <a href="https://mashable.com/review/m3-macbook-air-15-inch" target="_self">Macbook Air</a> &mdash; it left a gaping hole on my desk that I knew I needed to fill. </p><p>The lads at the Best Buy return counter can tell you that I started with a huge mistake: a 31-inch full HD monitor that I thought would be perfectly fine, only to discover that once you go 4K, you can&rsquo;t go back. My next step was a 32-inch <a href="https://mashable.com/review/samsung-m70b-smart-monitor" target="_self">Samsung M7 Smart Monitor</a>, which offered a 4K UHD resolution and a host of smart features that transform this external monitor into a television. But as much as I love my Samsung, when I was asked to test the <a href="https://zdcs.link/bPWLo?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Philips%20Creator%20Series%2027-inch%204K%20UHD%20Monitor&object_type=review&object_uuid=02r5kgJGZxBlvsToO3JyFcF&short_url=bPWLo&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Philips Creator Series 27-inch 4K UHD Monitor</a>, I knew I couldn&rsquo;t pass up the opportunity.</p><h2>Philips Creator Series 27E2F7901 price and specs</h2><p>The Philips Creator Series monitor has an MSRP of $499.99, but we've seen it drop between $329 and $399 on sale. </p><p><strong>Some notable specs:</strong></p><ul><li><p>27-inch 4K UHD display</p></li><li><p>USB-C, USB-A, HDMI, DisplayPort</p></li><li><p>400 nits brightness</p></li></ul><h2>First impressions of the Philips Creator Series 27-inch 4K UHD Monitor</h2><p>I&rsquo;ve unboxed four monitors in the past eight months, and the Philips&rsquo; Creator Series Monitor is firmly tied for first with my Samsung M7 in terms of first impressions. The packaging was sleek and convenient, the instructions were easy to follow, and I had my new monitor up and running within minutes. The monitor itself is gorgeous, with a sleek silver frame mounted on a sturdy metal base, and it boasts multiple connection options, including USB-C, HDMI, and DisplayPort. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Even more impressive, the Philips Creator Series includes a built-in KVM switch, meaning you can see and interact with content from two computers at the same time with a single monitor, keyboard, and mouse. This 4K monitor also has a DisplayPort that supports daisy chaining. Translation? If your computer also supports daisy chaining, you can plug it directly into this monitor and use the DisplayPort to seamlessly extend your display onto additional monitors.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>What I love about this monitor: Adjustable orientation</h2><p>One of my favorite features about this monitor took my by surprise: The ergonomic, adjustable base that offers height adjustment, tilt, and swivel. It might not sound like much, but the ability to adjust the monitor with a single touch was an incredible feature that I used more than I thought I would &mdash; especially the ability to rotate the monitor completely into a portrait orientation. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Once I figured out how to rotate the monitor&rsquo;s screen within my MacBook&rsquo;s settings, I was surprised to discover that I preferred this orientation. I had inadvertently created the perfect second screen to hold more of my &ldquo;static&rdquo; programs like my daily to-do list, calendar, Spotify, and Discord. Especially with my multi-screen setup,&nbsp;I loved having the option to rotate the Philips to act as either a functional main display or a secondary vertical monitor. Along with the brightness and crisp 4K display, the Creator Series feels futuristic and cool.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2>What I didn't like about this monitor: Daisy chaining multiple monitors</h2><p>Truthfully, with a monitor like this, there isn&rsquo;t a lot to dislike. It is quite a bit pricier than your standard 27-inch monitor, even when comparing it with other 4K UHD models. It also retails for $100 more than my 32-inch Samsung M7 Smart Monitor. The refresh rate is also a little low at only 60 Hz, so it&rsquo;s not going to be the <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-gaming-monitors" target="_self">best gaming monitor</a> when speed is on the line. It should work for casual gamers, but it really depends on your personal preference.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>The only other issue I had with this monitor was the DisplayPort out functionality to daisy chain multiple monitors together. While this monitor is fantastic for Mac users, my M2 MacBook Air doesn&rsquo;t support daisy chaining, which means I wasn&rsquo;t able to test this functionality fully. After a quick search through Reddit, I was able to find a workaround involving a DisplayLink port, but &mdash; as a casual user &mdash; I didn&rsquo;t really want to spend an extra $150 on an additional adapter. </p><p>Instead, I stuck with using my MacBook Air as my main display, extending to the Philips via USB-C and extending to my Samsung monitor via Apple Play. It wasn&rsquo;t the greatest solution, considering there was a significant lag and quality drop when casting from my MacBook to the Samsung monitor, but it was able to give me a taste of what it would be like to daisy chain the two monitors together. </p><h2>Is the Philips Creator Series 27-Inch 4K UHD Monitor worth it?</h2><p>It depends on how you plan to use it. For the casual user, I&rsquo;d probably recommend going for a cheaper option &mdash;  you can get a similar size 4K UHD monitor for a couple hundred dollars less than this one, especially if you wait for a decent sale. However, for creative professionals who need a higher level of brightness and impressive color accuracy for their work, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/bPWLo?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Creator%20Series&object_type=review&object_uuid=02r5kgJGZxBlvsToO3JyFcF&short_url=bPWLo&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Creator Series</a> is a smart investment. And if you like the idea of a swivel screen that can support portrait orientation, or you want to utilize the DisplayPort technology to extend your monitors, then it&rsquo;s definitely worth the splurge. </p><p>After testing it out on my own desktop, I can tell you that this 4K monitor delivers a truly gorgeous display that definitely stands out in a crowded market.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

In the images below, you're viewing these star clusters, which are gravitationally bound groupings of stars, as they existed just 460 million years after the universe's creation. That's looking through 97 percent of cosmic time. </p><p>This profoundly deep space view was made possible by the double whammy of the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/james-webb-space-telescope-hubble-science" target="_self">Webb telescope's unprecedented sensitivity</a> &mdash; its over 21-foot-wide gold-plated mirrors detect extremely faint sources of light &mdash; and a natural phenomenon called a "gravitational lens." In the foreground sits a massive cluster of galaxies, each containing <em>hundreds of billions of stars, </em><a href="https://mashable.com/article/black-holes-rogue-discovery-space" target="_self">millions of black holes</a>, and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/space-planets-exoplanets-discovery-2022" target="_self">perhaps trillions of planets</a>. The combined mass of these galaxies warps space, like a bowling ball sitting on a mattress. It creates a giant magnifying lens.</p><p>"Webb's incredible sensitivity and angular resolution at near-infrared wavelengths, combined with gravitational lensing provided by the massive foreground galaxy cluster, enabled this discovery," Larry Bradley, an astrophysicist at the Space Telescope Science Institute which manages the Webb telescope, said in a statement. </p><p>"No other telescope could have made this discovery," Bradley, who led the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07703-7" target="_blank">new research</a> published in the science journal <em>Nature</em>, added.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>The image below shows this unprecedented cosmic view.</p><p><strong>- On right:</strong> Almost every object in this image is an entire galaxy (besides the six-pointed <a href="https://mashable.com/article/milky-way-oldest-stars-universe" target="_self">stars</a> in the foreground). The white galaxies at center make up the massive galaxy cluster SPT-CL J0615&minus;5746, which creates the gravitational lens. </p><p><strong>- On left:</strong> Two lensed, or magnified, galaxies. The galaxy on bottom, dubbed the "Cosmic Gems arc," is shown with a number of separate star clusters. There are actually five, but gravitational lensing can sometimes, under the right viewing alignment from our perch in space, create mirror-images of objects.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Astronomers are using Webb to learn about the creation of the earliest stars and galaxies &mdash; ultimately revealing more about our cosmic history in the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/milky-way-galaxy-image-stars-billions" target="_self">Milky Way galaxy</a>. What's more, astronomers suspect these first galaxies &mdash; and massive star clusters inside that may eventually form even larger "globular star clusters" &mdash; emitted intense radiation into the early universe, and eventually broke down dense clouds of gas that had saturated <a href="https://mashable.com/category/space" target="_self">space</a>, making it largely opaque. Ultimately, this ended the universe's "Dark Ages." Brilliant starlight was no longer hidden; the light was finally unleashed, about 1 billion years after the universe began.</p><q>
    "No other telescope could have made this discovery."
    </q>
<p>Today, with the aid of Webb, we can see these momentous objects from primordial space.</p><p>"The surprise and astonishment was incredible when we opened the Webb images for the first time," Angela Adamo, an astronomer at Stockholm University who also authored the research, marveled in a statement. "We saw a little chain of bright dots, mirrored from one side to the other &mdash; these cosmic gems are star clusters! Without Webb we would not have known we were looking at star clusters in such a young galaxy!"</p><div id="related-video" class="mx-auto mt-8 mb-12 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans md:mt-12 md:mb-16 text-primary-400">

<h2><strong>The Webb telescope's powerful abilities</strong></h2><p>The Webb telescope &mdash; a scientific collaboration between <a href="https://mashable.com/category/nasa" target="_self">NASA</a>, the ESA, and the Canadian Space Agency &mdash; is designed to peer into the deepest cosmos and reveal new insights about the early universe. But it's also peering at <a href="https://mashable.com/article/james-webb-space-telescope-exoplanet-discovery-1" target="_self">intriguing planets</a> in our galaxy, along with the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/james-webb-space-telescope-uranus-polar-cap" target="_self">planets and moons in our solar system</a>.</p><p>Here's how Webb is achieving unparalleled feats, and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/james-webb-space-telescope-meteoroid-damage-nasa" target="_self">likely will for decades</a>:</p><p><strong>- Giant mirror: </strong>Webb's mirror, which captures light, is over 21 feet across. That's over two-and-a-half times larger than the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/space-hubble-most-distant-star" target="_self">Hubble Space Telescope's</a> mirror. Capturing more light allows Webb to see more distant, ancient objects. As described above, the telescope is peering at stars and galaxies that formed over 13 billion years ago, just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang.</p><p>"We're going to see the very first stars and galaxies that ever formed," Jean Creighton, an astronomer and the director of the Manfred Olson Planetarium at the University of Wisconsin&ndash;Milwaukee, told Mashable in 2021.</p><p><strong>- Infrared view: </strong>Unlike Hubble, which largely views light that's visible to us, Webb is primarily an infrared telescope, meaning it views light in the infrared spectrum. This allows us to see far more of the universe. Infrared has longer <a href="https://scied.ucar.edu/learning-zone/atmosphere/wavelength" target="_blank">wavelengths</a> than visible light, so the light waves more efficiently slip through <a href="https://mashable.com/article/carina-nebula-james-webb-space-telescope" target="_self">cosmic clouds</a>; the light doesn't as often collide with and get scattered by these densely packed particles. Ultimately, Webb's infrared eyesight can penetrate places Hubble can't.</p><p>"It lifts the veil," said Creighton.</p><p><strong>- Peering into distant exoplanets: </strong>The Webb telescope <a href="https://webbtelescope.org/news/webb-science-writers-guide/webbs-scientific-instruments" target="_blank"><u>carries specialized equipment called spectrographs</u></a> that will revolutionize our understanding of these far-off worlds. The instruments can decipher what molecules (such as water, carbon dioxide, and methane) exist in the atmospheres of distant exoplanets &mdash; be they gas giants or smaller rocky worlds. Webb will look at exoplanets in the Milky Way galaxy. Who knows what we'll find?</p><p>"We might learn things we never thought about," Mercedes L&oacute;pez-Morales, an exoplanet researcher and astrophysicist at the <a href="https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Center for Astrophysics-Harvard &amp; Smithsonian</a>, told Mashable in 2021.</p><p>Already, astronomers have successfully found intriguing chemical reactions on a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/james-webb-space-telescope-exoplanet-discovery" target="_self">planet 700 light-years away</a>, and as described above, the observatory has started looking at one of the most anticipated places in the cosmos: the rocky, Earth-sized planets of the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/james-webb-space-telescope-trappist-planet" target="_self">TRAPPIST solar system</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA["I Am: Celine Dion" is now streaming on Prime Video. This doc is a must-see for fans at any level. Review.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/05PWigocSppslRW4eV6W3vw/hero-image.jpg" alt="Celine Dion shares her personal story in "I Am: Celine Dion." "><p>In the wake of a rare diagnosis that threatened to derail her 40-year music career, Canadian singer Celine Dion allowed a documentary crew into her Las Vegas home to introduce a new side of herself in <em>I Am: Celine Dion. </em>Considering all the sides she's already presented to audiences over decades of concerts, albums, and TV appearances, this in and of itself is an achievement, as Dion is as multifaceted as a diamond.&nbsp;</p><p>One side of her is the belter of rousing love songs, like '90s hits "Because You Loved Me," "It's All Coming Back to Me Now," or the <em>Titanic </em>theme, "My Heart Will Go On." Beyond these glamorous romantic tracks, she's got a dizzying catalog of songs in French and English, with which she has toured the world, won five Grammy Awards, built a big and fervent fandom, and created a successful Las Vegas residency. Her performance style is eccentric, led by confidence, bespoke jumpsuits, and a flinging of limbs that is unapologetically enthusiastic&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;if not a bit goofy. It's little wonder that she's inspired the bizarre <a href="https://mashable.com/article/aline-movie-review" target="_self"><u>unofficial biopic <a href="https://mashable.com/article/aline-movie-review" target="_self"><em>Aline</em></a></u></a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/aline-movie-review" target="_self"><u>,</u></a> the off-Broadway<a href="https://titaniquemusical.com/?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwsuSzBhCLARIsAIcdLm6p41GWuVkMzPyAkm_NRbHWLTpTF0myvB5lKUPXROlb_oFtgjJYzCEaArg7EALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank"><u> jukebox musical <em>Titanique</em></u></a>, and countless drag queens. But that's not all.&nbsp;</p><p>In <em>I Am: Celine Dion, </em>which is peppered with concert footage and home movies, the world-famous singer also reminds us of her funny side, with clips from her <em>Titanic </em>boat ride performance for <em>The Late Late Show with James Corden</em> and giving her all for another theme song, <a href="https://mashable.com/video/celine-dion-deadpool-ashes" target="_self"><u>"Out of Ashes" for <a href="https://mashable.com/video/celine-dion-deadpool-ashes" target="_self"><em>Deadpool 2</em></a></u></a><a href="https://mashable.com/video/celine-dion-deadpool-ashes" target="_self"><u>.&nbsp;</u></a></p><p>Watching such clips one after another, <em>I Am: Celine Dion </em>urges audiences to recognize that while Dion takes her craft seriously, she refuses to take herself seriously. Her diva stage persona is bolstered by a quirky ability to laugh at her own indulgences. Her ability to make us cry through her song is born from the vulnerability she shares generously. And with this documentary, she's more vulnerable than fans have ever seen her before.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>I Am: Celine Dion </em>is no tedious music bio-doc.&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>If you're looking for a bog-standard documentary that baby steps audiences from Dion's Quebec childhood to her career launch at Eurovision '88 through her controversial romance with her manager, the late Ren&eacute; Ang&eacute;lil, and on to mega-stardom &mdash;&nbsp;look elsewhere. Documentarian Irene Taylor refuses to be so predictable.&nbsp;</p><p>There will be no talking heads of colleagues or influenced artists or critics or historians weighing in on who Dion is. Instead, this doc is firmly rooted in Dion talking about herself, which is inherently fascinating. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/this-is-me-now-jennifer-lopez-review" target="_self"><u>While some divas</u></a> might be seeking overt control over their narrative, determined to keep anything unglamorous or potentially damning off-screen, Dion is willing to show us not just her personal life but also her harrowing battle with <a href="https://me.mashable.com/entertainment/42713/celine-dion-speaks-up-on-her-struggle-with-stiff-person-syndrome-i-have-broken-ribs" target="_self"><u>stiff person syndrome</u></a>, a rare neurological disorder that causes stiffness and seizures of the muscles.&nbsp;</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>In interviews, Dion explains the long journey of getting this diagnosis, the prescribed medications she took to stave it off so she could perform, and the hardships now that these coping methods no longer serve her. The progression of the disease could mean the end of her performing career, a possibility she is openly terrified about. But it's not that her work or her art is all she has. Dion is up front about the many blessings in her life, like her family.&nbsp;</p><p>The film begins with a playful interview in which Taylor steps aside to let the singer's teen sons, Nelson and Eddy, offer some questions of their own. Even when the question seems simple &mdash;&nbsp;"What's your favorite color?" &mdash;&nbsp;Dion regards it thoughtfully, inviting in their perspective. Often, she appears in these at-home interviews with little to no make-up on. Yet this doesn't feel like a ploy to paint her as just like us.&nbsp;</p><p>One sequence &mdash; perhaps the film's funniest &mdash;&nbsp;shows Dion touring her personal warehouse of mementos, which includes everything from haute couture worn on red carpets to crayon drawings from her children, all lovingly stored and inventoried. It's that scene from <a href="https://mashable.com/article/hacks-season-3-review" target="_self"><em><u>Hacks</u></em></a>, but more remarkable because this is real. Surrounded by essentially a museum of Celine Dion, it's somehow both sweet and silly to hear the singer go on a rant about how she loves shoes so much she will <em>will </em>them to fit, size be damned! "When a girl loves her shoes," she explains, "She always makes them fit." In this, she seems relatable, but also defiant in a way that is distinctly Dion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But for all these tender moments, there are some really tough ones.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>I Am: Celine Dion </em>is shocking in how much of her struggles it shows.&nbsp;</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-KzV4mSZPke0"></div>
</div>


<p>As teased in the film's trailer, the documentary does present footage of Dion in a prolonged and painful seizure. Early on, Taylor shows a brief clip of this sequence, which cynics might think of as a way to tantalize with the shocking climax. But considering the clear affection the film has&nbsp;for its subject &mdash; swirling in a cycle of current confessions to nostalgic highlights of Dion's career &mdash;&nbsp;I suspect this early moment is more a warning of what's to come. Not intended to hang like a looming cloud over the sunshine that is Dion reflecting on her life and playing with her children during COVID lockdown, this brief clip is about giving the audience a chance to brace themselves for how hard this will get.</p><p>However, while the seizure scene is alarming &mdash;&nbsp;both for the clear distress Dion is in and for the intense intimacy of seeing such a private moment &mdash;&nbsp;there's something even more shocking here. Celine Dion allows us to see her fail.&nbsp;</p><p>In an interview, she explains how stiff person syndrome has impaired her vocal cords, making it harder than ever before for her to hit those high notes that dazzle audiences worldwide. Within that, she struggles with her identity. Who is she if not the Celine Dion who can hit the notes that makes us all drop jaw in awe? Who is Celine Dion if not her?&nbsp;</p><p>So, when she lets the cameras into a studio session, it feels even more personal than letting us in on the medical alert. Here she is, before the mic, and we know how scared she is that this is it. This could be her defeat, the end of the concerts, the cheering, the connecting, the end of her career. The tension is awful as we witness her fight with her own body. <em>I Am: Celine Dion </em>shows audiences how raw and real her struggle to reclaim the life and vocation she loves is. There will be no chipper Hollywood ending, promising us that the tough times are behind her and her next world tour is just around the corner. Instead, the film leaves us in a moment of mixed emotions, where Dion has found a win in reclaiming her voice but a loss in her body's reaction to that.&nbsp;</p><p>Essentially, <em>I Am: Celine Dion </em>is a tale of resilience. While many music docs look to bolster legends or build legacies, Dion's ends on a bit of an ellipsis, uncertain what might come next for her. But as the past footage of good times (her concerts, her TV appearances, home movies of the birth of first-born) and bad (her husband's funeral, her slipping up on stage), there's a gentle reminder that she is not just what she can do, but also what she can endure.&nbsp;</p><p>Far from a fluffy documentary that fawns over its subject, <em>I Am: Celine Dion </em>is a roller-coaster of emotions that leaves audiences with a mix of elation and uncertainty. But most incredibly, it gives one of music's biggest stars her voice back.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How to watch: </strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/MVKmg?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=I%20Am%3A%20Celine%20Dion%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Prime%20Video.&object_type=article&object_uuid=05PWigocSppslRW4eV6W3vw&short_url=MVKmg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><em>I Am: Celine Dion </em>is now streaming on Prime Video.</a> </p>]]></content:encoded>

The game is all about finding the "common threads between words." And just like <em>Wordle</em>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-20-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> resets after midnight and each new set of words gets trickier and trickier&mdash;so we've served up some hints and tips to get you over the hurdle.</p><p>If you just want to be told today's puzzle, you can jump to the end of this article for June 25's <em>Connections</em> solution. But if you'd rather solve it yourself, keep reading for some clues, tips, and strategies to assist you.</p><h2><strong>What is <em>Connections</em>?</strong></h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>
<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. Like <em>Wordle, </em>you can share the results with your friends on social media.</p><h2><strong>Here's a hint for today's <em>Connections</em> categories</strong></h2><p>Want a hit about the categories without being told the categories?

The EOFY sales, both online and in-store, feature some of the biggest savings on almost all product categories you'll see all year &ndash; and will be the last big sales event until <a href="https://mashable.com/article/black-friday-2023" target="_self"><u>Black Friday</u></a> at the end of November. Times have been tough lately, and most people are getting more picky with their big-ticket purchases. EOFY is a great opportunity to either make a purchase that can be claimed on tax, or pick up an item that you&rsquo;ve been eying off for a while, as it doesn&rsquo;t get much cheaper than this!</p><h2>What are EOFY sales? When are they in 2024?</h2><p>EOFY stands for the End Of Financial Year. EOFY sales are the annual sales events held by many retailers in Australia through the month of June, before the new tax year commences on July 1. EOFY is one of the best times during the year to find heavy discounts on a range of items, as retailers look to clear out their stocks to prepare for the upcoming financial year. Most retailers have deals running throughout all of June, but some start earlier, or have shorter events during June.</p><h2>What are the best items to buy during EOFY sales?</h2><p>You can expect discounts on a range of products and categories, but you will find the biggest savings on big-ticket items like laptops, headphones, TVs and consoles. Online retailers like <a href="https://zdcs.link/pKZXZ?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3Btemplate=deals&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=Amazon&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=06QCkXxJWpQbwhzy3cZtFDB&amp%3Bshort_url=pKZXZ&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Fau%2Fdeals%2Fbest-eofy-deals-australia&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Amazon&object_type=article&object_uuid=03UFat2zPHGPm2ujeCEcmKD&short_url=pKZXZ&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><u>Amazon</u></a>, <a href="https://kogan.4p72pk.net/Gje0yV" target="_blank"><u>Kogan</u></a> and <a href="https://www.ebay.com.au/?mkcid=1&amp;mkrid=705-53470-19255-0&amp;siteid=15&amp;campid=5338816478&amp;customid=&amp;toolid=10001&amp;mkevt=1" target="_blank"><u>Ebay</u></a> will have strong deals in all categories. However, keep an eye out specifically for the following products:</p><ul><li><p>Appliances: Retailers like <a href="https://prf.hn/click/camref:1100ljCK5/%5Bp_id:1100l465534%5D" target="_blank"><u>The Good Guys</u></a> and <a href="https://t.cfjump.com/73144/t/60101?Url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.binglee.com.au%2f" target="_blank"><u>Bing Lee</u></a> always go big during EOFY, dropping prices on pretty much everything they stock. You can expect deals on robot vacuums, washing machines, fridges, freezers, kettles, toasters, and much more. If you're looking to stock up on appliances for your home, these sites should be your first stop.</p></li><li><p>Games consoles: Finding console availability has been a total over the last couple of years, but things are definitely improving in Australia, with PS5 bundles being <a href="https://zdcs.link/DRP3Z?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3Btemplate=deals&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=readily%20available%20on%20Amazon&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=06QCkXxJWpQbwhzy3cZtFDB&amp%3Bshort_url=DRP3Z&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Fau%2Fdeals%2Fbest-eofy-deals-australia&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=readily%20available%20on%20Amazon&object_type=article&object_uuid=03UFat2zPHGPm2ujeCEcmKD&short_url=DRP3Z&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><u>readily available on Amazon</u></a>. That means there should be opportunities to pick up deals games and accessories for the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/xbox-series-x-review" target="_self"><u>Xbox Series X</u></a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/xbox-series-s-is-a-streaming-box" target="_self"><u>Xbox Series S</u></a>, and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/playstation-5-review" target="_self"><u>PS5</u></a> this year.</p></li><li><p>Smartphones: Amazon always offers plenty of impressive deals on all sorts of smartphones.</p></li><li><p>TVs: As we said, the best EOFY savings are found on the biggest products, and that means TVs. We expect pretty much all of the leading retailers to offer fantastic deals on TVs of all sizes from top brands like Sony, Samsung, LG, and Panasonic. It's best to shop around for the best <a href="https://mashable.com/article/black-friday-tv-deals-2023" target="_self"><u>TV deals</u></a>, because there are going to be so many, but you can't go wrong with The Good Guys, Bing Lee or Kogan.</p></li></ul><p>Laptops: <a href="https://lenovoau.hmqldu.net/QyKqAa" target="_blank"><u>Lenovo</u></a>, <a href="https://hp-au.sjv.io/q4gRmb" target="_blank"><u>HP</u></a> and <a href="https://dell.rrmo.net/KjxRO7" target="_blank"><u>Dell</u></a> all have EOFY events, featuring some heavy discounts on their laptops, as well as other computer items such as desktops and accessories.

      <description><![CDATA[YouTube has a big problem with scammers hijacking channels and streaming fake videos of Elon Musk in order to promote crypto scams.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01sbmSOJphYh6wKScJjXFzd/hero-image.jpg" alt="Elon Musk"><p>Is there any end in sight to fake Elon Musk livestream scams on YouTube?</p><p>Over the weekend, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/deepfakes-of-elon-musk-are-pushing-crypto-giveaway-scams-on-youtube-live-200700886.html?guccounter=1" target="_blank"><u>Engadget</u></a> reported on a YouTube broadcast featuring Elon Musk talking at what appears to be a Tesla conference-type event. The livestream had over 30,000 viewers at one point according to Engadget.</p><p>One problem: It wasn't real. The fake live event is part of an ongoing cryptocurrency scam on YouTube.</p><h2><strong>Fake Elon Musk livestreams on YouTube continue to flourish</strong></h2><p>The scammers that take part in this particular scheme appear to focus solely on YouTube to perpetrate their fraudulent activity.</p><p>The idea behind it is simple. Scammers broadcast a video of Elon Musk speaking at some event as a livestream. Oftentimes, these broadcasts feature real video of Musk on a loop. The audio can be either a fake AI generated voice that sounds like Musk or real audio from a Musk speech that's generic enough that it can be just about anything.</p><p>The on-screen graphics, however, portray the event as a live talk from Musk about cryptocurrency. These often include links or QR codes to the crypto scam, urging viewers to get in on this opportunity before the livestream ends.</p><p>There's another crucial element to this scam. These live videos are often being streamed on hijacked YouTube channels that people are already subscribed to. These hacked channels can have hundreds of thousands of subscribers, so there's a built-in audience that YouTube notifies because a channel that these users are subscribers to just went "live." The scammer usually changes the name of the YouTube channel in order to make it appear like an official Musk or Tesla-related account.</p><p>In this particular case over the weekend, the hacked channel had more than 10,000 subscribers and was also verified by YouTube. The channel was renamed "Tesla" with the YouTube handle "@elon.teslastream."</p><p>While Engadget viewed the livestream with as much as 30,000 concurrent live viewers at one point, it's unclear how many of those were actual real people. YouTube often promotes and recommends livestreams based on how many users are currently watching the stream. Its possible that a chunk of that viewership were bots in order to game the YouTube algorithm into pushing the video into users' feeds.</p><p>While Musk and Tesla are most commonly utilized to push these YouTube livestream crypto scams, scammers have altered the strategy a bit at times. For example, in April, Mashable <a href="https://mashable.com/article/fake-spacex-elon-musk-solar-eclipse-youtube-livestreams-crypto-scam" target="_self"><u>reported</u></a> on a SpaceX version of this scam that weaponized the solar eclipse in order to perpetuate their crypto scheme on YouTube.</p><p>Nearly four years ago, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak actually <a href="https://mashable.com/article/steve-wozniak-youtube-lawsuit-bitcoin-scam" target="_self"><u>sued</u></a> YouTube over Bitcoin scam livestreams that were using his likeness. So, this has clearly been going on for quite a while now. And, unfortunately, it looks like these fake YouTube livestream schemes are going to continue on, at least for the foreseeable future.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>The most annoying thing about printers? Running out of ink whenever you actually need to print something important. The HP Smart Tank Plus 651 comes with Original HP Ink bottles that will cover you for up to two years of printing. That's 8,000 color pages or 6,000 black-and-white pages right out of the box. It can print, copy, scan, and fax and features a 35-page automatic document feeder, borderless prints, and mobile and wireless printing. While it lacks some more advanced features, it makes up for them in printing volume, compact design, and price.</p><p>It's regularly $289.99, but you can pick it up at Amazon for just under $200 ahead of the official Prime Day printer deals we expect in July. That's not bad considering it covers your ink costs for two years. It's also down to its <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B07XGNLFJC" target="_blank">lowest price on record</a>. You can also pick up the same deal at <a href="https://zdcs.link/KJ85D?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Best%20Buy&object_type=article&object_uuid=07v7LomWilfzupu8g8nvQIU&short_url=KJ85D&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/71R4G?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Walmart&object_type=article&object_uuid=07v7LomWilfzupu8g8nvQIU&short_url=71R4G&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Walmart</a>, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/jo8mp?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=HP%20direct&object_type=article&object_uuid=07v7LomWilfzupu8g8nvQIU&short_url=jo8mp&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">HP direct</a> at the time of writing.</p><h3>More early Prime Day printer deals</h3><p><strong>Inkjet printers</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/8BA0R?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=HP%20DeskJet%202855e%20inkjet%20printer&object_type=article&object_uuid=07v7LomWilfzupu8g8nvQIU&short_url=8BA0R&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">HP DeskJet 2855e inkjet printer</a> &mdash;

More than one match the lowest price we've ever seen on those models at Amazon, or are close (some deals are exclusive to Prime members, but most are open to everyone for now). The deals are already more impressive than the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/walmart-plus-week-tv-deals" target="_self">sorry showing of TV deals</a> at last week's Walmart+ event, where there was barely a worthwhile QLED deal in sight.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Several TVs at Amazon also currently have a 90-day free trial of Amazon Music Unlimited attached to them &mdash; a nice $11ish per month break from Spotify or Apple Music if you're currently paying for that.</p><p>We'll be updating our list of TVs on sale at Amazon throughout the weeks leading up to Prime Day and will keep you posted when Amazon makes the big switch to official early Prime Day deals. For now, <strong><em>deals with a <s>strikeout</s> were either sold out or no longer available at their best sale price when we last checked.

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>TCL's Q6 TV is one of the most impressive cheap QLED TVs out there right now, so the opportunity to score the big 65-inch version for even less than $500 (just $30 away from the lowest price it has ever reached at Amazon) is pretty exciting for anyone looking to ditch their old muted LED TV. For the price, the Q6 gets bright enough to make HDR worthwhile, complemented by the noticeable boosted color accuracy from the layer of quantum dots. </p><h2>More TVs on sale at Amazon</h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/6X40Y?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Amazon%2043-inch%20Omni%20QLED%204K%20Fire%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=04dA6ENwyxBmPdq7OxcDT5E&short_url=6X40Y&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Amazon 43-inch Omni QLED 4K Fire TV</a> &mdash;&nbsp;<strong>$359.99</strong> <s>$449.99</s> (save $90 with Prime)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/Bd8nE?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Insignia%2050-inch%20F30%204K%20Fire%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=04dA6ENwyxBmPdq7OxcDT5E&short_url=Bd8nE&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Insignia 50-inch F30 4K Fire TV</a> &mdash;&nbsp;<strong>$199.99</strong> <s>$299.99</s> (save $100) <strong>&#128293;</strong></p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/6X4EY?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Amazon%2055-inch%20Omni%204K%20Fire%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=04dA6ENwyxBmPdq7OxcDT5E&short_url=6X4EY&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Amazon 55-inch Omni 4K Fire TV</a> &mdash;&nbsp;<strong>$349.99</strong> <s>$549.99</s> (save $200 with Prime)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/R07K8?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Hisense%2055-inch%20U7%20ULED%204K%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=04dA6ENwyxBmPdq7OxcDT5E&short_url=R07K8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Hisense 55-inch U7 ULED 4K TV</a> &mdash;&nbsp;<strong>$598</strong> <s>$799.99</s> (save $201.99) <strong>&#128293;</strong></p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/oeJY6?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Amazon%2065-inch%20Omni%204K%20Fire%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=04dA6ENwyxBmPdq7OxcDT5E&short_url=oeJY6&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Amazon 65-inch Omni 4K Fire TV</a> &mdash;&nbsp;<strong>$639.99</strong> <s>$759.99</s> (save $150)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/ZRAvv?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Hisense%2070-inch%20A6%204K%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=04dA6ENwyxBmPdq7OxcDT5E&short_url=ZRAvv&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Hisense 70-inch A6 4K TV</a> &mdash;&nbsp;<strong>$479.99</strong> <s>$529.99</s> (save $50)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/mV8YJ?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Hisense%2075-inch%20U7%20ULED%204K%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=04dA6ENwyxBmPdq7OxcDT5E&short_url=mV8YJ&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Hisense 75-inch U7 ULED 4K TV</a> &mdash;&nbsp;<strong>$1,098</strong> <s>$1,499.99</s> (save $401.99) <strong>&#128293;</strong></p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/Ey87P?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Hisense%20100-inch%20U7%20ULED%204K%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=04dA6ENwyxBmPdq7OxcDT5E&short_url=Ey87P&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Hisense 100-inch U7 ULED 4K TV</a> &mdash;&nbsp;<strong>$2,499.99</strong> <s>$4,999.99</s> (save $2,500)</p></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p><a href="https://mashable.com/review/m3-macbook-air-15-inch" target="_self"><em>Check out our full review of the M3 MacBook Air (15-inch).</em></a></p><p>It's no secret that Apple laptops fall into a more premium price range, and that's especially true when you're looking at anything beyond an entry-level model. That's why we appreciate the pricing of this 15-inch MacBook Air, which gets you a wider display at a price you'd expect from a 13-inch model. Along with the extra screen space, you'll be getting a six-speaker sound system, WiFi 6E support, a great keyboard, and the ability to connect two external displays (while the laptop is closed). At $1,129, this is the lowest price we've seen this laptop hit. And if you have a bigger budget, configurations with <a href="https://zdcs.link/84ZP7?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=more%20built-in%20storage&object_type=article&object_uuid=04sC6S4rAQZjYQYIWFldzO4&short_url=84ZP7&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">more built-in storage</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/Ad8Bb?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=memory&object_type=article&object_uuid=04sC6S4rAQZjYQYIWFldzO4&short_url=Ad8Bb&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">memory</a> are also on sale.</p><h3>More iMac and MacBook deals</h3><p><strong>MacBook Air</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/1vjok?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20MacBook%20Air%2C%2013-inch%20%28M2%2C%208GB%20RAM%2C%20256GB%20SSD%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=04sC6S4rAQZjYQYIWFldzO4&short_url=1vjok&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Apple MacBook Air, 13-inch (M2, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD)</a> &mdash;

<h3>Why we like it </h3><p>There aren't too many stellar iPad deals yet, but what this deal lacks in a hefty discount, it makes up in what's actually being discounted: this brand new iPad Air was just released in May, so any sale at all is impressive. Sure, the discount is only about $30, but that's $30 off a tablet with an M2 chip and starting storage of 128GB, beating the <a href="https://2022's%20Air" target="_blank">2022 Air's M1 and 64GB combo</a>. If you're not quite in need of the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-ipad-pro-m4-geekbench-macbook-m3" target="_self">M4 Pro experience</a> and instead want a tablet that can run most programs without a hitch, whether you're gaming, taking notes, or making some art, the M2 iPad Air is a great choice. </p><h3>More iPad deals</h3><p><strong>iPad (10th gen)</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/Ad8Nq?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20iPad%2C%2010.9-inch%20%28WiFi%2C%2064GB%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=04sC6S4rAQZjYQYIWFldzO4&short_url=Ad8Nq&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Apple iPad, 10.9-inch (WiFi, 64GB)</a> &mdash; <strong>$321</strong> <s>$349</s> (save $28)</p></li></ul><p><strong>iPad Air</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/Bd5k1?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20iPad%20Air%2C%2011-inch%20%28M2%2C%20WiFi%2C%201TB%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=04sC6S4rAQZjYQYIWFldzO4&short_url=Bd5k1&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Apple iPad Air, 11-inch (M2, WiFi, 1TB)</a> &mdash; <strong>$1,034</strong> <s>$1,099</s> (save $65)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/ZRX8m?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20iPad%20Air%2C%2013-inch%20%28M2%2C%20WiFi%2C%20512GB%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=04sC6S4rAQZjYQYIWFldzO4&short_url=ZRX8m&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Apple iPad Air, 13-inch (M2, WiFi, 512GB)</a> &mdash; <strong>$1,034</strong> <s>$1,099</s> (save $65)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/DdMkZ?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20iPad%20Air%2C%2013-inch%20%28M2%2C%20WiFi%2C%201TB%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=04sC6S4rAQZjYQYIWFldzO4&short_url=DdMkZ&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Apple iPad Air, 13-inch (M2, WiFi, 1TB)</a> &mdash; <strong>$1,219</strong> <s>$1,299</s> (save $80) </p></li></ul><p><strong>iPad Pro</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/6X4Rl?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20iPad%20Pro%2C%2011-inch%20%28M4%2C%20WiFi%2C%20256GB%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=04sC6S4rAQZjYQYIWFldzO4&short_url=6X4Rl&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Apple iPad Pro, 11-inch (M4, WiFi, 256GB)</a> &mdash; <strong>$944</strong> <s>$999</s> (save $55)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/rd8q8?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20iPad%20Pro%2C%2011-inch%20%28M4%2C%20WiFi%2C%20512GB%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=04sC6S4rAQZjYQYIWFldzO4&short_url=rd8q8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Apple iPad Pro, 11-inch (M4, WiFi, 512GB)</a> &mdash; <strong>$1,124</strong> <s>$1,199</s> (save $75)</p></li></ul><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p><a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-watch-series-9" target="_self"><em>Check out our full review of the Apple Watch Series 9.</em></a></p><p>What better way to enjoy the exceptional display brightness of the Series 9 than with the largest display you can possibly get? Mashable Senior Editor Stan Schroeder appreciated that this watch introduced Double Tap but <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-watch-series-9" target="_self">wrote in his review</a> that the 2000 nit max brightness and minimum of one nit make this watch incredibly functional to use in the middle of a sunny day, or in the darkness of your room in the early morning. Apple Watches haven't introduced a ton of exciting upgrades over the years, but we do like that with this sale price, you can grab the 45mm Series 9 for about $70 cheaper than you would the 41mm Series 9 at full price.</p><h3>More Apple Watch deals</h3><p><strong>Series 9</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/Jdp0D?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20Watch%20Series%209%20%2841mm%2C%20GPS%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=04sC6S4rAQZjYQYIWFldzO4&short_url=Jdp0D&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Apple Watch Series 9 (41mm, GPS)</a> &mdash; <strong>$299.99</strong> <s>$399</s> (save $99.01)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/0ejor?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20Watch%20Series%209%20%2845mm%2C%20GPS%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=04sC6S4rAQZjYQYIWFldzO4&short_url=0ejor&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Apple Watch Series 9 (45mm, GPS)</a> &mdash; <strong>$329.99</strong> <s>$429</s> (save $99.01)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/JdJkl?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20Watch%20Series%209%20%2845mm%2C%20GPS%20%2B%20cellular%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=04sC6S4rAQZjYQYIWFldzO4&short_url=JdJkl&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Apple Watch Series 9 (45mm, GPS + cellular)</a> &mdash; <strong>$429</strong> <s>$529</s> at Amazon (save $100)</p></li></ul><p><strong>SE</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/L3qeR?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20Watch%20SE%20%2840mm%2C%20GPS%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=04sC6S4rAQZjYQYIWFldzO4&short_url=L3qeR&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Apple Watch SE (40mm, GPS)</a> &mdash; <strong>$189</strong> <s>$249</s> (save $60)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/vp24x?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20Watch%20SE%20%2844mm%2C%20GPS%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=04sC6S4rAQZjYQYIWFldzO4&short_url=vp24x&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Apple Watch SE (44mm, GPS)</a> &mdash; <strong>$219</strong> <s>$279</s> (save $60)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/glXDb?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20Watch%20SE%20%2840mm%2C%20GPS%20%2B%20cellular%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=04sC6S4rAQZjYQYIWFldzO4&short_url=glXDb&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Apple Watch SE (40mm, GPS + cellular)</a> &mdash; <strong>$239</strong> <s>$299</s> (save $60)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/Dd8NZ?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20Watch%20SE%20%2844mm%2C%20GPS%20%2B%20cellular%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=04sC6S4rAQZjYQYIWFldzO4&short_url=Dd8NZ&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Apple Watch SE (44mm, GPS + cellular)</a> &mdash; <strong>$269</strong> <s>$329</s> (save $60)</p></li></ul><p><strong>Ultra</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/V0Xjx?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20Watch%20Ultra%202%20%2849mm%2C%20GPS%20%2B%20cellular%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=04sC6S4rAQZjYQYIWFldzO4&short_url=V0Xjx&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Apple Watch Ultra 2 (49mm, GPS + cellular)</a> &mdash; <strong>$719</strong> <s>$799</s> (save $80)</p></li></ul><h2>AirPods and Apple accessories deals</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p><a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-airpods-max-review" target="_self"><em>Check out our full review of the Apple AirPods Max.</em></a></p><p>To be blunt, we don't consider the AirPods Max <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-headphones" target="_self">one of the best headphones</a> out there anymore. They're missing key features, like a power button and a 3.5mm audio jack. Though they still sound great, they're way overpriced in 2024. However, we understand that some Apple fans treasure the only over-ear AirPods, so when they get a good discount, we make sure to note it. At $449, they're about $20 away from their lowest price ever, but it's been quite a while since they've hit that price. Even catching them at $100 off can be trickier these days, so if you're not trying to wait and see if Apple will announce <a href="https://mashable.com/article/new-apple-airpods-max-rumor" target="_self">new and improved AirPods Maxes</a> later this year, this is a decent time to buy.</p><h3>More deals on AirPods and Apple accessories</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/0x6qA?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20AirTags%20%284-pack%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=04sC6S4rAQZjYQYIWFldzO4&short_url=0x6qA&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Apple AirTags (4-pack)</a> &mdash; <strong>$79.99</strong> <s>$99</s> (save $19.01)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/b1eEw?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20Pencil%20%282nd%20gen%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=04sC6S4rAQZjYQYIWFldzO4&short_url=b1eEw&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Apple Pencil (2nd gen)</a> &mdash; <strong>$79</strong> <s>$129</s> (save $50)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/3dO5M?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20Pencil%20Pro&object_type=article&object_uuid=04sC6S4rAQZjYQYIWFldzO4&short_url=3dO5M&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Apple Pencil Pro</a> &mdash; <strong>$119</strong> <s>$129</s> (save $10)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/GdykJ?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Beats%20Solo%204&object_type=article&object_uuid=04sC6S4rAQZjYQYIWFldzO4&short_url=GdykJ&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Beats Solo 4</a> &mdash; <strong>$149.95</strong> <s>$199.95</s> (save $50)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/0PeE3?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20AirPods%20Pro&object_type=article&object_uuid=04sC6S4rAQZjYQYIWFldzO4&short_url=0PeE3&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Apple AirPods Pro</a> &mdash; <strong>$199</strong> <s>$249</s> (save $50)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/we4x6?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20AirPods%20Max&object_type=article&object_uuid=04sC6S4rAQZjYQYIWFldzO4&short_url=we4x6&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Apple AirPods Max</a> &mdash; <strong>$449</strong> <s>$549</s> (save $100)</p></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The sizzling tensions of Luca Guadagnino's <a href="https://mashable.com/article/challengers-review-zendaya" target="_self"><em><u>Challengers</u></em></a><em> </em>inspired memes, breathless text posts, and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/challengers-fan-edits-piracy" target="_self"><u>horny fan edits</u></a> of the three lead characters. Many of these edits used clips from the movie shot surreptitiously on mobile phones in dark theaters nationwide. As <a href="https://mashable.com/article/challengers-fan-edits-piracy" target="_self"><u>Mashable&rsquo;s Elena Cavender noted,</u></a> pirated clips are looked down on in some fan circles. Still, the online frenzy around <em>Challengers</em> made them fair game for fan editors who knew the people needed their tennis fantasy fix ASAP.</p><h2>Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, <em>The Tortured Poet's Department</em>, and Travis Kelce</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>For the past year, we've seen so much <a href="https://mashable.com/category/taylor-swift" target="_self">Taylor Swift</a> on our feeds that she has <em>become the moment</em>. Her <a href="https://mashable.com/article/taylor-swift-eras-tour-surprise-songs-list" target="_self">Eras Tour</a> and relationship with footballer Travis Kelce &mdash; both the talk of 2023 &mdash; remained top of mind in 2024 as Swift played stadiums worldwide and managed to make it to her beau's Super Bowl game on time. Then came the release of <em>The Tortured Poet's Department</em>, a project fans expected would tear into her breakup with long-time partner Joe Alwyn. Instead, it seemed to primarily focus on her subsequent relationships with <a href="https://mashable.com/article/matty-healy-the-1975-tiktok" target="_self">Matt Healy</a> and Kelce, which <a href="https://mashable.com/article/taylor-swift-tortured-poets-department-lyrics-reactions" target="_self">sent listeners straight to their keyboards</a> to discuss it all.</p><h2>Pro-Palestine campus protests</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Across the country, college students protesting the war in Gaza demanded that their universities divest from financial support of Israel. These protests, which included on-campus encampments and demonstrations, drew varied reactions from law enforcement. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/10/peaceful-pro-palestinian-campus-protests" target="_blank"><em>The Guardian</em></a> reported that though "fewer than 20" of the 533 campus demonstrations nationwide between April 18 and May 3 resulted in any serious interpersonal violence or property damage, there were at least 70 instances of forceful police intervention.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/05CuuX90KmItoiY6kqoV21Y/hero-image.png" alt="a close-up of a person putting a 15-inch apple macbook air into a backpack"><p>On any given day, Amazon's <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-laptop-deals" target="_self">best laptop deals</a> include some markdowns on Apple <a href="https://mashable.com/category/macbook" target="_self">MacBooks</a>... and not much else. The retail giant lists a lot of older and/or discontinued PCs that aren't super worth it. Amazon also has a penchant for inflating sticker prices, making discounts look steeper than they really are. </p><p>Those factors, combined with the heavy presence of sketchy third-party sellers among Amazon's laptop listings, make it one of the worst places to buy a laptop on the internet (again, unless you're shopping for MacBooks). We usually <a href="https://mashable.com/article/when-to-buy-a-laptop" target="_self">recommend</a> shopping at Best Buy or going directly to the manufacturer's online store instead.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

            Prime Day 2024: When it's happening and everything else we know so far

<p>The fine print here is that <a href="https://mashable.com/category/amazon" target="_self">Amazon</a> usually gets its act together for major savings events, including its flagship <a href="https://mashable.com/category/prime-day" target="_self">Prime Day</a> sale. When such sales are live, it's<em> way</em> easier to find heftier discounts on new laptops shipped and sold by Amazon itself. (That said, it still behooves savvy shoppers to cross-check prices elsewhere, just in case.)</p><p>As we head into Prime Day season &mdash;&nbsp;it's <a href="https://mashable.com/article/prime-day-everything-you-need-to-know" target="_self">confirmed for July</a> &mdash; I'll be keeping track of the best Prime Day laptop deals. So far, I'm not finding much outside of the typical discounts on M2 and M3 MacBooks, and I'm willing to bet that they'll get even cheaper as Prime Day approaches, especially as other retailers roll out competing sales. But if you need to replace an older MacBook ASAP, there are some decent buys up for grabs right now &mdash; including some all-time lows.</p><p><em>Note: I've cross-checked all of the following deals with manufacturers' sites to make sure the discounts are legit. (If Amazon had the wrong MSRP, I corrected it and adjusted the discount accordingly.) I've also weeded out laptops sold by third-party sellers &mdash;&nbsp;if they have "Ships from/Sold by <a href="http://Amazon.com" target="_blank">Amazon.com</a></em><em>" underneath their "Buy Now" button, we're cool. </em></p><p><em>Any laptop marked with a &#128293; is at a record-low price, according to the Amazon price tracking site <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/" target="_blank">CamelCamelCamel</a></em><em>. Lastly, because Prime Day hasn't officially begun, these savings aren't official Prime Day deals; however, all of these discounts are live and ready to shop now. </em></p><h2>Early Prime Day laptop deals to watch</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p><a href="https://mashable.com/review/m3-macbook-air-15-inch" target="_self"><em>Read Mashable's full review of the 15-inch M3 Apple MacBook Air.</em></a></p><p>Earlier this year, Apple upgraded its thin and lightweight Air with a peppier M3 chip, WiFi 6E support, and the ability to drive two external monitors (with its lid closed). "[It] may seem like a simple refresh," wrote Mashable tech editor Kim Gedeon, "but as someone who owns the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-macbook-air-m2-2022-review" target="_self">M2 MacBook Air</a>, I&rsquo;d definitely trade it in for the new-generation model." (She gave it a 4.3/5 rating in her review.) This 15-inch model has more screen real estate and two more speakers compared to the <a href="https://zdcs.link/eB8b6?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=13-inch%20version&object_type=article&object_uuid=05CuuX90KmItoiY6kqoV21Y&short_url=eB8b6&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">13-inch version</a>.

<p>We can all agree that it&rsquo;s been hot AF lately. As temperatures continue to rise to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/24/weather/south-heat-wave-midwest-flood-recovery/index.html" target="_blank">unbearable levels</a>, many apartment dwellers are looking for ways to stay cool. You could try begging your landlord to install air conditioning in your building, but we wouldn't hold our breath.</p><p>Portable air conditioners offer a convenient solution. These units connect to a nearby window to quickly cool bedrooms, offices, or small apartments. You can even move them from room to room as needed. (For an even more convenient option that won't take up precious floor space, we were pretty impressed by the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/windmill-air-conditioner" target="_self">Windmill AC (medium, 8,300 BTU) window unit</a> recently.)</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

It can cover up to 400 square feet and has a built-in dehumidifier. The unit also has a washable dust filter for quick maintenance and a filter change alert function to let you know when it&rsquo;s time to clean it.</p><p>Yes, there <em>is </em>a hose that connects this unit to the window, but it&rsquo;s not as cumbersome as some of those old-school units. Plus, with the on-screen coupon, you&rsquo;ll save an extra $48 at checkout, bringing the total to a whopping $271 (which is a pretty good deal for a Honeywell air conditioner).  </p><h2>Best air conditioner for larger rooms </h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>REI's 4th of July Sale gives shoppers up to 40% off clearance items, including camping and hiking gear, clothes for men and women, and water sports equipment. Plus, REI Members can take 20% off any regular-priced Yeti cooler. (If you're not a member, you can <a href="https://www.rei.com/membership#perks" target="_blank">join for $30</a> - and get a $30 REI gift card back when you sign up before July 11.) These deals are only here until July 4th, so we recommend acting on them sooner rather than later. </p><h2>Best tent deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

But if you&rsquo;re tired of feeding your data to Microsoft and want to switch to a local account, you&rsquo;re in luck &mdash; it's still possible.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Here's your quick guide to swapping out your Microsoft Account for a local one on Windows 11:</p><h2><strong>How to create a local Microsoft account for Windows 11</strong></h2><ul><li><p><strong>Fire Up Settings</strong>: Click on the Start menu and open the Settings app</p></li><li><p><strong>Head to Accounts</strong>: Navigate to the "Accounts" section in Settings</p></li><li><p><strong>Find Your Info</strong>: Under Accounts, select "Your info"</p></li><li><p><strong>Switch to a Local Account</strong>: Look for the option that says "Sign in with a local account instead" and click on it</p></li><li><p><strong>Follow the Prompts</strong>: Simply follow the on-screen instructions to set up your local account</p></li></ul><p>While switching to a local account remains straightforward, you should create a password reset disk &mdash; without it, recovering a forgotten password can be a hassle.</p><p>While Microsoft, like Google and Apple, prefers users to stay connected within their ecosystems, opting for a local account is still a viable choice for those prioritizing data privacy and autonomy. Even though Windows 11 has made it less obvious, the ability to use a local account is very much alive. So go ahead and take control of your Windows experience.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As our friends at PCMag (which is owned by Mashable's publisher, Ziff Davis) wrote in their <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-4" target="_blank">review</a>, the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4 earbuds "produce powerful, bass-forward audio and are very customizable." However, they also noted that the noise-cancellation isn't what it should be for the $299.95 price tag. Fortunately, the current deal at Amazon knocks them down to a more justifiable $243.66 &mdash;&nbsp;the lowest price on record for these buds.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>If you have the space for another countertop appliance, the Instant Omni air fryer toaster oven is a well-rounded option that allows you to air fry, broil, bake, roast, toast, warm, and cook with convection all in one. Its 19-quart capacity can fit a 12-inch pizza, six slices of bread, a whole chicken, and more without taking up too much real estate on your counter. It's usually $199.99, but Amazon has it on sale for just $120 as of June 24 &mdash; that's its second lowest price on record.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

Amazon currently has them listed for just $34.99 &mdash; that's 30% in savings &mdash;&nbsp;which matches their all-time low price. These buds offer 10 hours of listening on a single charge and 40 when you use the compact charging case. Even better, a quick 10-minute charging session will give you two full hours of listening.

Just don't expect the noise-cancellation to be out of this world. </p><p><em>None of these deals catching your eye?

<p>One of the most well-known photographers encountering the issue is Pete Souza, who served as the official White House photographer during the Obama and Reagan administrations. Last week, Souza <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C8Mmg2FuFBL/?igsh=NGlsdG44bm5meXhv" target="_blank">posted digital scans</a> of film images he had snapped at a 1984 NBA Finals game to his Instagram account. The post was labeled as "Made with AI," which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/21/meta-tagging-real-photos-made-with-ai/" target="_blank">Souza told TechCrunch</a> was "annoying" because Instagram "forced me to include the 'Made with AI' [tag] even though I unchecked it." He noted that Adobe required him to &ldquo;flatten the image&rdquo; before saving it as a JPEG file, which he believes could have triggered the incorrect "Made with AI" tag.</p><p>In another example, a cosplayer posted to X about an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C8honzQMiGO/?igsh=MXB5djV2MjVjam1ydA%3D%3D&amp;img_index=1" target="_blank">Instagram photo </a>of her work that had been incorrectly tagged as being "Made with AI." They wrote, "My cosplay made with the physical labour of my own hands is being labeled as AI content on Instagram, with no way to correct this tag."</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>The accurate labeling of AI-generated or edited images is crucial to maintaining a safe and authentic online experience, especially as the 2024 election looms. AI-generated images have already <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-seniors-are-falling-for-ai-generated-pics-on-facebook" target="_blank">duped older users of Facebook</a>, a Meta product. Adobe's AI capabilities, specifically, <a href="https://mashable.com/video/adobe-generative-ai-video" target="_self">can be highly convincing</a>.</p><p>A Meta spokesperson told TechCrunch about the company's AI-tagging capabilities: "Our intent has always been to help people know when they see content made with AI. We are taking into account recent feedback and continue to evaluate our approach so that our labels reflect the amount of AI used in an image."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The study tested several different key words, including deafness, blindness, cerebral palsy, autism, and the general term "disability." </p><p>Researchers used one of the author's publicly available CV as a baseline, then created enhanced versions of the CV with awards and honors that implied different disabilities, such as "Tom Wilson Disability Leadership Award" or a seat on a DEI panel. Researchers then asked ChatGPT to rank the applicants.</p><p>In 60 trials, the original CV was ranked first 75 percent of the time.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>"Ranking resumes with AI is starting to proliferate, yet there&rsquo;s not much research behind whether it&rsquo;s safe and effective," said Kate Glazko, a computer science and engineering graduate student and the study&rsquo;s lead author. "For a disabled job seeker, there&rsquo;s always this question when you submit a resume of whether you should include disability credentials. I think disabled people consider that even when humans are the reviewers."</p><p>ChatGPT would also "hallucinate" ableist reasonings for why certain mental and physical illnesses would impede a candidates ability to do the job, researchers said. </p><p>"Some of GPT&rsquo;s descriptions would color a person&rsquo;s entire resume based on their disability and claimed that involvement with DEI or disability is potentially taking away from other parts of the resume," wrote Glazko. </p><p>But researchers also found that some of the worryingly ableist features could be curbed by instructing ChatGPT to not be ableist, using the GPTs Editor feature to feed it disability justice and DEI principles. Enhanced CVs then beat out the original more than half of the time, but results still varied based on what disability was implied in the CV.</p><p>OpenAI's chatbot has displayed similar biases in the past. In March, a <em>Bloomberg</em> investigation showed that the company's GPT 3.5 model displayed <a href="https://mashable.com/article/openai-chatgpt-racial-bias-in-recruiting" target="_self">clear racial preferences</a> for job candidates, and would not only replicate known discriminatory hiring practices but also repeat back stereotypes across both race and gender. In response, OpenAI has said that these tests don't reflect the practical uses for their AI models in the workplace.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The DMA, which entered into force in Nov. 2022, requires companies with app platforms operating in the EU to enable third-party app developers to inform their customers of alternative, cheaper purchasing options, as well as steer them to those offers and allow them to make purchases. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>During its investigation, the Commission looked at Apple's App Store practices and found that it doesn't allow developers to "freely steer their customers" away from the App Store. The company instead permits third-party apps to direct users through links within their apps, which the Commission finds to be too restrictive. It also said the fees that Apple charges developers for acquiring new customers "go beyond what is strictly necessary."</p><p>"For too long, Apple has been squeezing out innovative companies &mdash; denying consumers new opportunities &amp; choices," European Commissioner Thierry Breton tweeted on Monday. "Today we are taking further steps to ensure AppStore &amp; iOS comply with #DMA."</p><p>Apple now has 12 months (counting from March 25, 2024, when the proceedings commenced) to comply, or otherwise face a fine that can be as high as 10 percent of Apple's global revenue (roughly $38 billion per Apple's recent earnings), or up to 20 percent in case of repeated infringements. The EU <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_1161" target="_blank">fined Apple $1.84 billion</a> for similar anti-steering practices in March 2024, following a Spotify lawsuit. </p><p>Last week, Apple announced it <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-delays-ai-features-europe-dma-regulation" target="_self">would not launch its upcoming Apple Intelligence features in Europe</a> due to the requirements set forth in DMA. </p><p>Apple isn't the only company the European Commission is investigating for DMA violations. The EU's regulator is also looking into the business practices of Google and Meta. </p>]]></content:encoded>

            'House of the Dragon' Season 2 perfectly illustrates how men's egos start wars

<p>But did this gambit actually pay off for <em>House of the Dragon</em>? Or was it yet another TV show clinging to low hanging plot devices that declare twins two polarised sides of the same coin and little else? </p><h2>What happens in <em>House of the Dragon</em> Season 2, episode 2?</h2><p>In a knee-jerk order, disgruntled commander Ser Criston Cole (Fabien Frankel) <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-mens-egos-war" target="_self">throws some of that volatile Westerosi male ego around</a> and orders Kingsguard white cloak Arryk on a secret mission to Dragonstone to assassinate <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-green-black-rhaenyra-alicent" target="_self">Team Green's enemy, Rhaenyra</a>. Arryk is a twin, whose brother Erryk stands opposed within Rhaenyra's Queensguard, so it's an order of impersonation, and essentially, a tragic fool's errand.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Despite the fact that everyone at councils large and small in Westeros <em>know</em> the identical pair sit within each camp, Arryk stalks into Dragonstone pretty much undetected in a sequence <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-recap-season-2-episode-2.html" target="_blank">Vulture's Amanda Whiting called</a>, "a scheme that seems more like a <em>Punk&rsquo;d</em> episode than an act of cunning." It's a slapstick game of one-twin-out, one-twin-in, a Fake Twin Gambit scene with Erryk wandering through the halls unaware his brother is replacing him as he goes. It's <em>House of the Dragon</em> cloak-and-dagger but make it <em>The Prestige </em>as a daytime soap starring Chaplin.</p><p>"What [the filmmakers] were trying to do narratively was confuse the audience," <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/24/arts/television/house-of-the-dragon-twins-elliott-luke-tittensor.html" target="_blank">Luke Tittensor told the <em>New York Times</em>.</a> "When Arryk stands at the door, there&rsquo;s a moment of you thinking, 'Is that actually Arryk, or is it Erryk?' You&rsquo;ve seen us do a bit of a <em>Scooby-Doo</em> moment. That&rsquo;s a little bit of a trick with twins."</p><div id="related-video" class="mx-auto mt-8 mb-12 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans md:mt-12 md:mb-16 text-primary-400">

<p>Gaining access to Rhaenyra's chambers, Arryk moves to attack the queen. Luckily, Mysaria (Sonoya Mizuno) saves the day, having spotted Arryk arriving at the Dragonstone docks and raising the alarm. Arryk and Erryk battle in a whirl of identical confusion, despite Erryk's pleas for his brother to yield, and Arryk is slain. Beset with immediate grief and despair, Erryk falls on his own sword. The show plays the duel out <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-book-vs-show" target="_self">slightly differently to how it's written in George R. R. Martin's </a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-book-vs-show" target="_self"><em>Fire and Blood</em></a>. And while the result is undeniably devastating, in some senses it also feels like another series leaning on an Evil Twin trope for dramatic effect.</p><h2>TV bloody loves an Evil Twin trope.

<p>I'm an identical twin who has been asked "which one's the evil one?" so many times it's made me want to embody such a dumb question and rain that hellfire down on the spot. But I know where it comes from.</p><p>Historically, divine twins are a goldmine throughout mythology for examining dualism; Egyptian deities Nut and Geb, Zoroastrianism's Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu, Olympian twins Apollo and Artemis, Hinduism's horsemen The Ashvins, West African complex twin goddess Mawu-Lisa. Dark/light, sun/moon, earth/sky &mdash; twins are the perfect framework for this kind of either/or storytelling. </p><q>
    Modern pop culture really, truly insists that one twin must be just...bad. 
    </q>
<p>But modern pop culture really, truly insists that one twin must be just...bad. It's a low hanging plot device for writers to unpack these opposing forces of good and evil, but it often reduces the characters to simplistic sides of the same coin. If my twin sister and I were on a TV show, one of us would be have to be an absolute piece of work.</p><p>Yes, the show does give Erryk and Arryk the right to choose their allegiances, but <em>House of the Dragon</em> can't help itself, making it clear there's a Good/Evil split through dark cinematography, sinister blocking, and a Big Bad Score as Arryk stalks through Dragonstone. Arryk is basically forced through his sense of duty to accept Cole's order, but the series frames him as a villain, a slithery assassin, with Erryk instead the heroic shining light in Rhaenyra's camp. Then, the final sequence becomes a <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pointing-rick-dalton" target="_blank">Pointing Rick Dalton</a> game of "spot the imposter", a stressful watch that plays both as <em>House of the Dragon</em> and soap climax.</p><h2>Why Erryk and Arryk's duel is actually important</h2><p>One of the main reasons Erryk and Arryk's duel is important is not only because of their twindom, but their conflicting familial polarity. Essentially, this kinslaying tragedy embodies the broader implications of the Dance of the Dragons, the civil war between <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-targaryen-family-tree-season-2" target="_self">the Targaryen family</a>, and the senseless violence that will accompany the bloody path to the Iron Throne. There's no good, no evil, only blood and death.</p><p>As oath-sworn members of the Kingsguard and Queensguard, Arryk and Erryk are quite literally torn apart by their sense of honor &mdash; and the fact that <em>House of the Dragon</em> allows the characters to make their own decisions negates the somewhat frustrating tropes of the Dragonstone sequence.</p><p>"We always love that moment of these two brothers who love each other more than anything also being set to kill each other, and there&rsquo;s a very American Civil War brother-on-brother aspect to it," <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQgi3uT2biA" target="_blank"><em>House of the Dragon</em> writer and executive producer Sarah Hess said in a behind-the-scenes video.</a> "Why are they doing this? It&rsquo;s because these nobles have decided they they&rsquo;re mad at each other, and now these guys have to battle it to the death."</p><p>One of the saddest fates of Season 2, Erryk and Arryk are buried together, "one soul in two bodies," on either side of the war for Westeros. While <em>House of the Dragon </em>loves to play into the drama, the impact of this scene should rest on the tragedy of them choosing honor over each other, not with one being Evil and the other Good. </p><p>And as for me? I'd tell Cole to shove his honor and defect. That's your twin right there. </p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/el4jA?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=House%20of%20the%20Dragon%20Season%202%20airs%20Sundays%20on%20HBO%20and%20Max%20at%209%20p.m.%20ET.&object_type=article&object_uuid=05ln4D51N05N0bRdFRquNkE&short_url=el4jA&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><em>House of the Dragon </em>Season 2 airs Sundays on HBO and Max at 9 p.m. ET.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Don't worry if you don't have any exciting plans this summer. You don't need to be sunning yourself on a picture-perfect beach on an exotic vacation (or, holiday, as they'd say across the pond), surrounded by beautiful people all vying for your attention. You don't need to leave the house to live that particular dream this summer, because <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-watch-uk-love-island-itvx-using-vpn" target="_self"><em>Love Island UK</em></a> is back on our screens.</p><p>If you want to watch <em>Love Island UK</em> for free from anywhere in the world, we've got all the information you need to catch the newest season.</p><h2><strong>When did Season 11 of <em>Love Island UK premiere</em>?</strong></h2><p>The eleventh season of <em>Love Island UK </em>started on <strong>June 3</strong>. Host<strong> </strong>Maya Jama is back to present the series, with Iain Stirling returning as narrator.</p><h2><strong>How to watch <em>Love Island UK</em> for free in the U.S.</strong></h2><p>The 11th series of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-watch-uk-love-island-itvx-using-vpn" target="_self"><em>Love Island UK</em></a> is available to live stream for free on <a href="https://www.itv.com/" target="_blank">ITVX</a>. </p><p>ITVX is <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/deals/how-to-watch-itvx-for-free" target="_self">geo-restricted to the UK</a>, but you should be able to access this free streaming platform with a <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-uk" target="_self">VPN</a>. These tools can hide your real IP address (digital location) and connect to a secure server in the UK. This quick and easy process tricks streaming services like ITVX into providing you with access from anywhere in the world. </p><p>This might sound complicated, but the process is actually really straightforward:</p><ol><li><p>Sign up to a VPN (like <a href="https://zdcs.link/VbkpL?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=ExpressVPN&object_type=article&object_uuid=02SzvApmG4zOH2QfQKJOzrH&short_url=VbkpL&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">ExpressVPN</a> or <a href="https://zdcs.link/4AAVm?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=NordVPN&object_type=article&object_uuid=02SzvApmG4zOH2QfQKJOzrH&short_url=4AAVm&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">NordVPN</a>)</p></li><li><p>Download the app to your device of choice (the <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-vpns" target="_self">best VPNs</a> have apps for Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux, and more)</p></li><li><p>Open up the app and connect to a server in the UK</p></li><li><p>Visit <a href="https://www.itv.com/" target="_blank">ITVX</a> </p></li><li><p>Watch <em>Love Island UK</em> for free from anywhere in the world</p></li></ol><p>The <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-for-streaming-uk" target="_self">best VPNs for streaming</a> are not free, but they do tend to offer money-back guarantees. By using these guarantees, you can unblock ITVX without fully committing with your cash. That means you can sign up to a streaming-friendly VPN and unblock ITVX to watch <em>Love Island UK</em> from anywhere in the world. If this process doesn't work for some reason, you can recover your money.</p><h2><strong>What is the best VPN for ITVX?</strong></h2><p>Of the <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-vpns" target="_self">VPNs we've tested</a> and recommend, only two consistently unblocked ITVX and other geo-restricted apps when connected to a UK-based server: NordVPN and ExpressVPN.

<p>Probably one of the most well-known VPNs on the market, NordVPN is our top premium pick for a few reasons: its unrivaled suite of security features, more than 5,000 obfuscated servers, and a sweet deal on a 27-month plan. You'll be able to unlock ITVX (and plenty of other geo-blocked websites and apps) and watch Season 11 <em>Love Island UK</em> episodes live when they air. While NordVPN still has some lingering transparency concerns, it's made great strides to repair its reputation with boosted security standards, a bug bounty program, and network upgrades. </p><p>The Basic plan will only cost you $3.09 per month, the Plus plan goes for $3.99 per month, and the Ultimate plan will run you $5.99 per month.</p><p><a href="https://mashable.com/review/nordvpn" target="_self"><em>Read our full review of NordVPN</em></a>.</p><h2>Other ways to watch <em>Love Island UK</em> in the U.S.</h2><p>If the VPN workaround seems too complicated or you don't feel like signing up for a VPN subscription, you can also stream <em>Love Island UK</em> on Hulu in the U.S. starting <strong>June 8</strong>. Of course, the episodes won't air live as they do on ITVX, but you'll still be able to watch the drama unfold on your own time. Episodes will appear on Hulu a week after they air on ITVX, so you'll just have to avoid spoilers in the mean time.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>Hulu newbies and some returning subscribers who haven't had an active Hulu account in some time can get a free 30-day trial to the streamer &mdash;&nbsp;a rare and hard-to-beat <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-streaming-deals" target="_self">streaming deal</a> these days. That may not be enough time to watch the entire season, but you'll be able to watch a significant portion of it before having to pay a cent. Once your trial is up, you can keep your subscription going for $7.99 per month for the plan with ads or $17.99 per month for the plan without ads.</p><p>There are a few ways to score Hulu for free or at a discount as well:</p><ul><li><p>T-Mobile customers on the Go5G Next plan can enjoy Hulu with ads for no extra cost (on top of the already stacked lineup of Netflix, Apple TV, and MLB.tv). Just head over to the T-Mobile website and choose "redeem now" to <a href="https://zdcs.link/OddJE?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=claim%20your%20offer&object_type=article&object_uuid=02SzvApmG4zOH2QfQKJOzrH&short_url=OddJE&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">claim your offer</a> if you haven't already.</p></li><li><p>Students can <a href="https://zdcs.link/rddqN?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=get%20a%20Hulu%20Student%20account&object_type=article&object_uuid=02SzvApmG4zOH2QfQKJOzrH&short_url=rddqN&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">get a Hulu Student account</a> for only $1.99 per month &mdash; that's 75% off the full cost of Hulu with ads. There's no free trial, but you'll be able to watch as much <em>Love Island UK</em> you want for only $2 every month. You'll have to be able to prove you're a student with SheerID, so don't try using an ancient college email address.</p></li><li><p>If you're committed to watching Hulu long-term, you can <a href="https://zdcs.link/W008W?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=sign%20up%20for%20an%20annual%20plan&object_type=article&object_uuid=02SzvApmG4zOH2QfQKJOzrH&short_url=W008W&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">sign up for an annual plan</a> instead of a monthly plan and save 17%. It'll run you $79.99 per year, which breaks down to only $6.67 per month (rather than $7.99 per month). </p></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

The game is all about finding the "common threads between words." And just like <em>Wordle</em>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-20-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> resets after midnight and each new set of words gets trickier and trickier&mdash;so we've served up some hints and tips to get you over the hurdle.</p><p>If you just want to be told today's puzzle, you can jump to the end of this article for June 24's <em>Connections</em> solution. But if you'd rather solve it yourself, keep reading for some clues, tips, and strategies to assist you.</p><h2><strong>What is <em>Connections</em>?</strong></h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. Like <em>Wordle, </em>you can share the results with your friends on social media.</p><h2><strong>Here's a hint for today's <em>Connections</em> categories</strong></h2><p>Want a hit about the categories without being told the categories?

<p>The vulnerability for was discovered by Ryan Pickren, an independent researcher who already found a couple of bugs in Apple's software, including <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/01/25/apple-pays-record-100500-to-student-who-found-mac-webcam-hack" target="_blank">nasty iPhone and Mac camera issues</a>. Pickren told Mashable via email that he believes the bug he'd found in visionOS allows for the first "spatial computing" hack. He also said that Apple awarded him a bounty for finding and describing the issue.</p><p>The bug stems from <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-vision-pro-spatial-personas" target="_self">the way visionOS handles apps that can spawn 3D objects</a> in your virtual space while you're using the Vision Pro. As <a href="https://www.ryanpickren.com/vision-pro-hack" target="_blank">Pickren explained on his blog</a>, the company severely restricted who and what can do this in most cases, but "forgot" about an older, web-based 3D model viewing standard called <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-arkit-hands-on" target="_self">Apple AR Kit Quick Look</a>. By adding some simple code to a website, a hacker could bypass Apple's restrictions and launch "an arbitrary number of 3D, animated, sound-creating, objects without any user interaction whatsoever." </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

You can generally expect the mopping technique to get a little more meticulous as price goes up, so the <em>type</em> of mess that you'll be expecting your 2-in-1 model to conquer becomes a big deciding factor. Are you mostly concerned with wiping up spur-of-the-moment spills, or will you be a stickler about dried-on stains that call for more heavy-duty scrubbing?</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Fortunately, both ends of the pricing spectrum provide way more bang for their buck in 2024 than they did in the early 2020s. The past year or so has seen serious strides in the automated mopping department: Brands like <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-roombas" target="_self">iRobot</a>, Roborock, Eufy, <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-shark-robot-vacuums" target="_self">Shark</a>, and Narwal are moving far past the bare minimum &mdash; the mere presence of mopping gear &mdash; with features that actually make autonomous mopping effective, like pressurized and/or spinning mopping pads (rather than lackadaisical, stationary ones), water tanks that refill themselves, and interior compatibility with cleaning solutions for better sanitization than cleaning with just water.</p><p>This shift is particularly exemplified in the fleet of new hybrid robot vacs released at <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ces-2024-robot-vacuums" target="_self">CES 2024</a>, where a new standard for the future of mopping robot vacuums was set: The best robot hybrids will also cross post-mopping maintenance off of your list by automatically washing and drying their own mopping pads, shifting the concept of a self-empty dock to a full self-cleaning station. With one of these self-cleaning models, your robovac will be ready to mop again almost immediately &mdash;&nbsp;a clutch change from older, more basic designs that required you to toss soggy mopping pads in the washing machine after every use..</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

Or should we say how <em>men</em> start wars.</p><p>Yes, OK, so it may have been <a href="https://mashable.com/article/viserys-last-words-alicent-house-of-the-dragon-episode-8" target="_self">Alicent Hightower (Olivia Cooke) who misunderstood Viserys Targaryen (Paddy Considine) on his deathbed in Season 1</a>, and the ongoing rift between her and Rhaenyra (Emma D'Arcy) certainly hasn't helped things. But come on. Season 2 has, so far, been a textbook case of male egos getting people killed.</p><p>Here's the deeply stupid step-by-step as it stands, beginning with Aemond (Ewan Mitchell) <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-1-ending-explained" target="_self">semi-accidentally killing Lucerys</a> (Elliot Grihault) at the end of last season.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

    </div>
<h2>Step 1: Aemond kills Lucerys</h2><p>Unable to forget the teasing he endured as a boy, Aemond decided to wage a campaign of harassment against Rhaenyra's children that <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-prince-aemond-villain" target="_self">started with some "Strong" speech jokes</a> and ended with <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-1-ending-explained" target="_self">Lucerys getting chomped to death mid-air</a>.</p><p>Does he regret it? Maybe a little bit. But if he'd just scared the kid back at the Baratheon castle and called it quits then things probably wouldn't have escalated as quickly as they did.</p><h2>Step 2: Daemon gets Aegon's son killed</h2><p>We know what you're thinking: It's Rhaenyra that, on returning to Dragonstone, says she "want[s] Aemond Targaryen". But she doesn't say exactly what she means, and that's the apparent cue for an already-enraged Daemon (Matt Smith) to pay some very awful assassins to try and do the job for him. Inevitably the plan fails and the poor son of Aegon (Tom Glynn-Carney) and Heleana (Phia Saban), Jaehearys, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-helaena-rat-prophecy-blood-and-cheese" target="_self">is the one killed instead</a>.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2>Step 3: Ser Criston Cole sends a man to his death</h2><p>Carrying an Iron Throne-sized chip on his shoulder, Criston Cole (Fabien Frankel) decides the best course of action following Jaehaerys' death is to go rogue, blackmailing a member of the Kings' Guard (who happens to be a twin) to go to Dragonstone disguised as his identical brother, who has conveniently defected to work for Rhaenyra.</p><p>Unsurprisingly this works about as well as Daemon's off-the-cuff plan, and both twins &ndash; but <em>not</em> Rhaenyra &ndash; end up dead.</p><div id="related-video" class="mx-auto mt-8 mb-12 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans md:mt-12 md:mb-16 text-primary-400">

<h2>Step 4: Aegon fires his Hand and promotes Ser Criston</h2><p>So: Aemond's been irrational, Daemon's been irrational, and then Ser Criston's been irrational. Thank goodness there's a solid, safe pair of hands on the Iron Throne itself though, right?</p><p>Oh no, wait: The realm's biggest man-baby Aegon II is in charge, and not only does he praise Ser Criston's actions, but he even decides to promote him to Hand after firing his grandad Otto Hightower (Rhys Ifans).</p><p>Aegon's petulant little attempt at a comeback while Otto is giving him a dressing down?

<p>An example of that fleshing out is the relationship between Rhaenyra Targaryen (Emma D'Arcy) and Alicent Hightower (Olivia Cooke), whose fraught dynamic in the show benefits from the extra layers of seeing them grow up together before becoming bitter enemies. That strong adaptation choice is one of many that carries into Season 2, but there are plenty new deviations from <em>Fire &amp; Blood </em>on the way. Which ones work and add depth to the story of the Dance of the Dragons? Which ones are less successful? Let's break it down.</p><p>Here are all the biggest differences between <em>House of the Dragon </em>Season 2 and <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>.</p><h2><strong>Episode one: We're back at the Wall!</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p><em>House of the Dragon </em>Season 2 opens with shots of snowy forests and the familiar sounds of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/game-of-thrones-theme-song-composter-interview" target="_self">Ramin Djawadi</a>'s Winterfell theme, which can only mean one thing for House Stark fans: We're so back.</p><p>After spending the first season mostly in and around Dragonstone and King's Landing, it's a delight to revisit the northernmost reaches of Westeros. Rhaenyra's eldest son Jacaerys (Harry Collett) flew up there in the Season 1 finale to treat with Lord Cregan Stark of Winterfell (Tom Taylor), and by the time we catch up with them at the beginning of Season 2, it seems like they've become good pals. They're taking a field trip up the Wall, bantering about the time Torrhen Stark bent the knee to Aegon the Conqueror, and discussing how the North can aid Rhaenyra in her war efforts.</p><div id="related-video" class="mx-auto mt-8 mb-12 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans md:mt-12 md:mb-16 text-primary-400">

<p><em>House of the Dragon </em>skips over quite a bit of material to get to Jace and Cregan's allyship. In classic <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em> fashion, there are several conflicting accounts of Jace's time in Winterfell in Martin's work. Of his many historical "sources," Grand Maester Munkun writes in his <em>True Telling</em> that the two became inseparable and swore a blood oath of brotherhood, while Septon Eustace claims that Jace badgered Cregan about converting to the Faith of the Seven. The most scandalous of all the accounts belongs, naturally, to court jester Mushroom, who says Jace fell in love with and married a bastard named Sara Snow, even though he was betrothed to his cousin Rhaena (Phoebe Campbell). </p><p>With only eight episodes in this season, <em>House of the Dragon </em>likely didn't have the time to get into all this potential Northern drama. We've got the Dance of the Dragons to kick off, people! Still, you can bet we haven't seen the last of Cregan Stark.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>In a move I didn't see coming (and that certainly isn't in <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>), Dowager Queen Alicent and Lord Commander of the Kingsguard Criston Cole (Fabien Frankel) are getting it on. Based on Alicent's assertion that they shouldn't hook up again (as if that's going to work), we can assume this affair has been going on for <em>a while</em>. So, when did this tryst begin? When did Cole come back around on the whole "breaking his Kingsguard oath of chastity" thing? When did Alicent decide, "Eh, screw it," and start doing exactly what she hated Rhaenyra for doing?</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Alicent and Criston's hypocrisy here doesn't bother me, as it's totally in keeping with their overly righteous characters. And it just makes sense that something would happen between these two. They're basically joined at the hip, and their joint animosity towards Rhaenyra adds a sweet psychosexual twist. Plus, as Alicent reckons with the increasingly unpredictable men in her circle, like her sons Aegon II (Tom Glynn-Carney) and Aemond (Ewan Mitchell), it also makes sense that she'd try to reclaim her power elsewhere. </p><p>What <em>does </em>bother me about this change is that Criston is having sex at all.

<p>In what is undoubtedly one of the darkest scenes ever featured in <em>House of the Dragon </em>and <em>Game of Thrones</em>, two assassins &mdash; known simply as Blood (Sam C. Wilson) and Cheese (Mark Stobbart) &mdash; sneak into the Red Keep and murder Aegon and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-helaena-rat-prophecy-blood-and-cheese" target="_self">Helaena's (Phia Saban)</a> infant son Jaehaerys.

<p>In the book, Blood and Cheese force Helaena to choose which of her sons she wants them to kill. When volunteering herself doesn't work, she chooses her youngest, Maelor, as Jaehaerys is heir to the Iron Throne. In a nasty twist, Blood and Cheese kill Jaehaerys instead &mdash; and tell Maelor that his mother wants him dead.</p><p>Things play out a little differently in <em>House of the Dragon</em>, although the final outcome is the same: Jaehaerys dies, and Helaena is traumatized for life. First off, Blood and Cheese's original target in the show is Aemond. That change already complicates the blame of Jaehaerys's death. It lets Daemon off the hook <em>a little </em>for bankrolling child murder, just as Vhagar's unauthorized chomping in the Season 1 finale means Aemond <em>technically </em>didn't murder Lucerys. But technicalities don't matter when children are dead.</p><p>Instead of finding Aemond, Blood and Cheese stumble upon Helaena and the twins Jaehaerys and Jaehaera. (Maelor is cut from the show entirely.) They make a snap judgment that one Targaryen son is as good as another and make Helaena tell them which of her children is Jaehaerys. She points him out, but there's a brief moment in which Blood thinks she's trying to double-cross them. After all, why would she give up the heir to the throne so easily? Surely she's actually pointing to Jaehaera. Cheese calls her bluff though and correctly surmises that she's actually singled out her son. With that, Jaehaerys becomes another victim in the Dance of the Dragons.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>This version of the Blood and Cheese scene nods a bit to the book version, with Helaena still having to make an impossible choice and there being trickery involved. However, there's an extra layer of tragedy here. Based on a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-helaena-rat-prophecy-blood-and-cheese" target="_self">rat-centric statement towards the beginning of the episode</a>, Helaena likely foresaw the arrival of Blood and Cheese in a prophetic dream. That means she's had quite a bit of time to think about this moment, and maybe even prepare for it. Her attempt to throw Blood and Cheese off of Jaehaerys's scent was her last-ditch effort to stop the inevitable. In failing, her action turns a horrifying scene into something even sadder.</p><h2><strong>Episode two: The aftermath of Jaehaerys's death</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Understandably, much of <em>House of the Dragon </em>Season 2's second episode deals with the fallout from Jaehaerys's murder at the hands of Blood and Cheese. Some elements from <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em> remain the same, such as Aegon's decision to murder all the ratcatchers. Other details are omitted. For example, the show's version of Alicent doesn't try to learn Blood's true name in order to "bathe in the blood of his wife and children." (Probably for the best.) Instead, her reaction is one of grief for Jaehaerys and especially Helaena.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Elsewhere, Hand of the King Otto Hightower (Rhys Ifans) views Jaehaerys's death as an opportunity to spread some good old-fashioned propaganda. He throws a funeral procession for Jaehaerys, with Helaena and Alicent riding with the young prince's corpse. Accompanying them is a crier telling onlookers to "behold the work of Rhaenyra the Cruel," weaponizing Jaehaerys's death against Rhaenyra. The scene is a show-only invention, yet one that's entirely in keeping with Otto's scheming persona. Plus, even though Alicent decries the procession as ghoulish, it seems like Otto's scheme actually works and wins sympathy points from the smallfolk. (At least, until Aegon hangs every ratcatcher in the vicinity.)</p><h2><strong>Episode two: Rhaenyra and Daemon duke it out</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>When Rhaenyra learns of Daemon's involvement in Jaehaerys's death, <em>House of the Dragon </em>treats us to a massive argument between the married couple (and uncle-niece pair). Rhaenyra worries that she can't trust Daemon, while Daemon claims Rhaenyra is as weak as her father. It's a brutal but deeply necessary fight, dredging up both characters' insecurities about their relationship, proximity to power, and different approaches to the brewing conflict with Aegon. And <em>none </em>of it is in <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>By this point in <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>, Daemon has already taken control of Harrenhal. He orchestrates the Blood and Cheese plot from afar, and we don't get enough of Rhaenyra's reaction to the murder to suggest that the two fall out over Daemon's actions. Instead, <em>House of the Dragon </em>fills in one of the emotional gaps of Martin's fictional history. The resulting scene gets at the heart of Rhaenyra and Daemon's fraught relationship, and puts the two in very different headspaces as we move into the next section of the season.</p><h2><strong>Episode two: Arryk versus Erryk</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Like much of <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>, the duel between the Cargyll twins Arryk and Erryk (Luke and Elliott Tittensor) is the subject of differing historical accounts. Munkun says their battle was epic, lasting for almost an hour and ending with the brothers dying in each other's arms. Mushroom, on the other hand, claims the fight was short-lived. Erryk (who fights for Rhaenyra) dealt Arryk (who fights for Aegon) a mortal blow fairly early on. He sustained a gut wound in the process, and succumbed to it after four painful days. Frankly, the latter seems more plausible, so we've got to give this round to Mushroom.</p><p>Also left ambiguous is the true goal of Arryk's mission to Dragonstone. Was he sent to kill Rhaenyra, or to murder her sons Jacaerys and Joffrey (Oscar Eskinazi)? <em>House of the Dragon </em>decides on the latter. It also moves the battle from "deep in the heart of Dragonstone" to Rhaenyra's chambers, putting her in more danger than in <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>. Here, she witnesses firsthand the kinslaying that will continue to take place should she and Aegon go to war outright. Will this prompt her to take swifter action, or will she stay her cautious course?</p><p>Perhaps the most interesting development in the Cargyll fight is the involvement of Mysaria (Sonoya Mizuno), who alerts Dragonstone to Arryk's presence. By this point in <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>, Mysaria and Rhaenyra haven't interacted much, although Mysaria does become Rhaenyra's unofficial mistress of whispers later on. However, Rhaenyra now owes Mysaria her life. Could this signal a greater (and earlier) partnership between the two, especially now that Daemon is gone?</p><p>We'll be updating this article as <em>House of the Dragon </em>Season 2 continues airing, so check back weekly for more differences between the show and <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>. </p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/el4jA?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=New%20episodes%20of%20House%20of%20the%20Dragon%20air%20Sundays%20at%209%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20HBO%20and%20Max.&object_type=article&object_uuid=00imlCa1Zf2bZssHTCnPdle&short_url=el4jA&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">New episodes of <em>House of the Dragon </em>air Sundays at 9 p.m. ET on HBO and Max.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>There's no way to verify the figures provided by 50 Cent. Cryptocurrencies do provide the opportunity for scammers to pump value and make a quick buck.</p><p>This is, after all, not an uncommon scam. Some hacker takes over a prominent account and pumps the value of some cryptocurrency via posts. It seemed to <a href="https://mashable.com/article/hulk-hogan-crypto-token-hack" target="_self">happen to Hulk Hogan</a> this month. It's made all the more confusing because some celebs, like rapper Iggy Azalea or Caitlyn Jenner have <em>actually </em>launched volatile coins. </p><p>50 Cent has been active in the crypto space in the past, <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2018/01/23/50-cent-made-millions-bitcoin-animal-ambition-album/" target="_blank">reportedly owning</a> millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin, so it would add up that folks would fall for the memecoin. </p><p>Be careful out there on the internet and don't go around buying every random cryptocurrency.</p>]]></content:encoded>

With Dreamscreens, you can transform your TV into a stunning 4K digital art gallery. And for a limited time, you can get Dreamscreens for just $31.97 (regularly $49.99) through June 26.</p><p>Art TVs have become one of the biggest trends in the TV market over the past few years, and these premium gadgets typically cost $1,000 or more. Dreamscreens pulls off the same trick with a simple USB hack. Instead of buying an expensive new smart TV, Dreamscreens comes in the form of a USB drive that plugs directly into the USB port on your TV. Once plugged in, you can view and display more than 500 famous works of art while you sit around and read, clean your home, or host a get-together.</p><p>And you get to view them in ultra-high-def 4K quality (assuming you have a 4K TV to match) so you get to discover and enjoy the details on such works of art as <a href="https://zdcs.link/MV8Zm?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=%22The%20Starry%20Night%22%20by%20Vincent%20Van%20Gogh%20and%20%22The%20Last%20Supper%22%20by%20Leonardo%20da%20Vinci&object_type=article&object_uuid=04WpIDW2VXMdD0KqhEbzCjK&short_url=MV8Zm&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">"The Starry Night" by Vincent Van Gogh and "The Last Supper" by Leonardo da Vinci</a>. You can view them one at a time, as a slideshow, and even opt to have the slideshow play along with background music.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-m_yBsTdSOng"></div>
</div>


<p>With Dreamscreens, you'll get one USB drive with the standard-screen version of the works of art and another with a wide-screen version. Before purchasing, it's a good idea to double-check that your TV supports NTFS-formatted USB drives. Fortunately, this is a common port on most modern TVs.</p><p>Don't let your TV sit unused when it can become a creative focal point for any of life's moments.</p><p>Turn your TV into a <a href="https://zdcs.link/MV8Zm?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=4K%20digital%20art%20gallery%20with%20Dreamscreens&object_type=article&object_uuid=04WpIDW2VXMdD0KqhEbzCjK&short_url=MV8Zm&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">4K digital art gallery with Dreamscreens</a> while it's on sale for just $31.97 (reg. $49.99) until June 26 at 11:59 p.m. PT.</p><p><a href="https://www.stacksocial.com" target="_blank"><em>StackSocial</em></a><em> prices subject to change.</em></p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

The second rule of the Clubhouse is: No, really, you're not invited.</p><p>If you're a Bravo fan, you know exactly what I mean. The Clubhouse is the intimate set where Andy Cohen hosts Bravo's stalwart late-night program <em>Watch What Happens Live</em>, and it's nearly impossible to get in as an audience member. You can't buy tickets, enter a lottery, or wait in line all day. You have to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BravoRealHousewives/comments/12iz5az/wwhl_tickets/" target="_blank">beg and hope</a> or know someone. It might be New York City's most exclusive ticket and the hottest commodity in the Bravoverse, a place where beef among Bravolebrities is constantly born, creating real-time online gossip.</p><p>Despite the difficulty, I'm here to tell you what it's like to attend &mdash; twice.</p><p>The good folks at Bravo allowed me and my wife &mdash; a Bravo superfan who got me hooked on the network's offerings years ago &mdash; to attend two shows after I wrote about the network's <a href="https://mashable.com/article/bravo-2023-mainstream-vanderpump-andy-cohen-controversy" target="_self"><u>boom in popularity</u></a> in 2023.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>The first thing you need to do to enter the Clubhouse, should you be so lucky, isn't very fun. You fill out some forms way ahead of time, agreeing to, I assume, some boilerplate rules that, frankly, I didn't bother to read. I was going, no matter the conditions. Then there are more emails about what to expect and wear: "Dress as if you're getting cocktails with Bravolebrities!" On the day of, you're in your best shirt, in line with roughly 19 other audience members outside a nondescript office building in Lower Manhattan.</p><p>The show is a well-oiled machine, even if it is known for creating messy online drama. <em>WWHL</em> is celebrating its <a href="https://www.bravotv.com/the-daily-dish/inside-andy-cohen-wwhl-15th-anniversary-party-photos" target="_blank">15th anniversary this summer</a>, and you can tell they know exactly how to churn these episodes out. Before we get into the nitty-gritty details, here are the basics of attending the show IRL:</p><ul><li><p>You queue outside the office building precisely one hour before filming, where you're counted, checked in, and handed two drink tickets.</p></li><li><p>Alongside the rest of the guests, you're led up an elevator to the sixth floor, where you hear loud, fun music as you get close.</p></li><li><p>There's a small lobby with a bar (hence the drink tickets), backdrops for photos (with cutouts of Cohen and the <em>WWHL</em> desk), and a few places to sit and mingle.</p></li><li><p>Shortly before filming, the audience lines up in a specific order corresponding to where you'll sit in the Clubhouse.</p></li><li><p>Once seated, there&rsquo;s a Q&amp;A with Andy before the show&rsquo;s guests arrive and filming begins.</p></li><li><p>You watch the show! It takes about as long as the actual airtime. You&rsquo;re encouraged to whoop, yell, react, and participate when appropriate.</p></li><li><p>After the show, you&rsquo;re back outside the office building, watching the stars get chauffeured out in black cars.</p></li></ul><p>Now, the million-dollar question for Bravo fans everywhere: What's the experience like? TL;DR: It's as fun as you&rsquo;d imagine and even more intimate than you&rsquo;d think. The episodes we saw featured, respectively, Lindsay Hubbard and Gabby Prescod from Bravo&rsquo;s <em>Summer House</em>, then actor Joel Kim Booster and <em>Real Housewives of New Jersey</em> legend Teresa Giudice. As an audience member, you&rsquo;re legitimately part of the show. How could you not be? We sat close enough to smell Tre's perfume. (It smelled nice.)</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Let's get into the details.</p><h2>The pre-show</h2><p>Let me be clear: There is no having a bad time at a <em>WWHL</em> taping for a fan. It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience since you can't purchase the ticket. But I've got to say, our taping with Giudice was far more fun because the fans were so excited. People began cheering as they stood in line outside the building. Folks danced in the elevator as the music waned from the sixth floor. A pregnant woman negotiated with her friends to dole out her drink tickets &mdash; everyone cackled. Even the bartender said, "Oh, it's a great crowd." </p><p>Through some unlucky break, the <em>Summer House</em> crowd was a bit more muted. It seemed a few men were dragged along who maybe didn't get how big a deal it was to attend.</p><p>That's the thing: Because you can't buy tickets, you can get an interesting mix of attendees. Sometimes tickets go up at charity auctions &mdash; I expect a few disinterested finance bros got their partner's tickets that way. Then there are friends of folks who work on the show, friends of guests, and superfans who pulled strings. And then, twice, there was me and my wife, Analise. It's hard to describe how excited we were.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The first go-round, we were almost worried about it. We fretted over what to wear for about a week. We arrived <em>so early.</em> I threw back my free drinks before taping, afraid I'd spill live on air. It was nerve-wracking but in a night-before-Christmas kind of way. By the second taping (pictured above), we felt more comfortable. And the crowd was much more open and fun. Everyone danced, joked, and had a good time, easing anxious energy and raising excitement. </p><p>During the pre-show happy hour and photo-op, you might even run into the guests on the show. The room isn't huge, and the bathrooms are shared. One audience member from the <em>Summer House</em>-themed episode hustled out of the restroom and quickly told us she had an interaction with Hubbard in the women's room. I'm using kinder words than the fan's description of the event, but honestly, how freaking cool to have a <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/lindsay-hubbard-refutes-amanda-batulas-claims-shes-rude-to-fans/" target="_blank">famously</a> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Zi2ORz_AA" target="_blank">allegedly</a>) rude Bravolebrity (allegedly) be rude to you! It's every Bravo superfan's dream! You're in this tiny space with the stars of your favorite shows, watching it all go down as it happens.</p><p>OK, wait, a little bit of housekeeping and a not-so-secret fact. Some <em>Watch What Happens Live</em> episodes are no longer aired live. The <em>Summer House</em>-themed episode, for instance, was taped two days ahead of time. It makes sense. Cohen is a media mogul with, I assume, a busy schedule. The show airs five days a week. There's no way he'd be free every night.</p><p>So, anyway, what happens after those welcome drinks? You're quickly shuttled into the Clubhouse, past hallways adorned with decorations like <a href="https://x.com/BravoWWHL/status/1638729780823465985" target="_blank">Jax Taylor's infamous</a> chunky white fisherman's sweater. (You know the one.) </p><p>It's hard to overstate how tiny the Clubhouse is. I've been on other TV sets, and it still felt quite condensed. Analise, who has been watching the show forever, couldn't believe the on-set bar was barely a couple of feet from the guests. Camera angles can play tricks. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>"The studio was so small, and the audience was so small, it was much more intimate than I expected," Analise told me after the tapings. </p><h2>The Andy Cohen Q&amp;A</h2><p>So by the time you have your pre-drinks, you take your seats, and you talk with Andy, an audience member will spend far more time doing other things than actually seeing the show get filmed. But the Q&amp;A is a highly anticipated moment for fans because Andy is the Alpha and Omega of Bravo. Most audience members used the time to make little jokes or ask gossipy questions about the Bravoverse. There were some cringey questions &mdash; <em>"Are you jealous my last name is Gay?" </em>&mdash; but mostly, Cohen did a deft job joking with the audience while avoiding revealing anything too newsy. He's there to warm you up, not give you Bravo tea for your TikTok account.</p><p>Still, as a journalist, I felt the need to ask him a question. I asked him which Bravolebrity made him the most nervous or required him to prep the hardest for an interview. He had to take a beat before sharing his answer: Erika Jayne during the 2021 <em>RHOBH</em> reunion. Honestly, I felt proud that I momentarily stumped one of the best interviewers out there &mdash; and that was a good thing because I was too nervous to follow up. </p><p>And Cohen is <em>right there. </em>He paces up and down in front of the audience; the front row sits in chairs, and the second row is raised on an extended bench. The guy has a presence. He controls the room like a celeb who's had fans bombard them for the past 15 years. He'll funnily answer audience questions and sternly warn them, "I'm filming a promo," if someone tries to ask something while the camera rolls. He'll ask, "Sir, are you here under duress?"<em> </em>to the uneasy finance bros. He'll talk to the audience and producers in his earpiece simultaneously. As I said, the show is a well-oiled machine, and the audience is an integral part of that apparatus &mdash; but an annoying fan isn't going to be the grain of sand that grinds the gears to a halt. </p><p>Cohen gets to his customary seat after the audience Q&amp;A wraps up, and the show begins. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2>Taping the show</h2><p>As an audience member, you are there to bring the vibes. You're encouraged to have a good, well-lubricated time with your fellow seatmates. It's hard to have a bad time, mainly because a producer named Rachael might be the best hype-woman I've ever seen. She's got the whole spiel down flat, like a camp counselor on her tenth summer. She's cheering. She's getting you going. She's letting you know when to scream and for how long. Now that I've gone behind the scenes, I cannot miss her <em>yaaaaaaaaaaaaay </em>in and out of every <em>WWHL </em>commercial break. (And now you can't either.) </p><p>Otherwise, it's sort of like watching the show at home. Even the taped broadcast followed a strict schedule. You can spot most of the graphics on screens overhead. Phones are allowed, but only during breaks. You're encouraged to <em>ohh </em>and <em>ahh </em>and <em>haha,</em> but there's absolutely no yelling out or answering the trivia questions. And if you absolutely must<em> </em>use the bathroom, there is no re-entry. You're in and out in just about the exact time it takes to watch the show on television.</p><p>It might not surprise you to know that so much actually happens during <em>Watch What Happens Liv</em>e. We got to watch Hubbard skirt accountability on her much-publicized break-up and spot Andy giving her serious side-eye from a spitting distance away. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

<p>We got to see Teresa Giudice &mdash; in a skin-tight lavender jumpsuit &mdash; forcefully (and kind of unconvincingly) deny ever leaking things to bloggers. We watched as her husband Louie, who's taller than you think, fed her a line about her enemies being "obsessed" from our little peanut gallery. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>We got to see Giudice's makeup people &mdash; seemingly glammed up for a night out at the club &mdash; rush out to touch her up during commercial breaks. We even saw Giudice take countless selfies, getting the angles just right, long after the cameras stopped rolling and as producers probably eagerly awaited the audience to exit. </p><p>Seeing these soon-to-be-viral moments up close was a unique experience. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>It was also neat to be there <em>live </em>as people watching from home lost their minds over Giudice &mdash; her jumpsuit, her putdowns of her sister-in-law whose name she refused to utter, and, well, just Teresa just being Teresa. I cracked up at Giudice's refusal to say her SIL's name, and folks noticed it online. I even predicted to Analise she'd wear a latex jumpsuit before she took the stage. (Maybe I watch too much Bravo.) But it was cool to be there <em>in person </em>for what I'd usually tweet about from my couch. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<h2>So, how was it?</h2><p>I hope by now it's clear: Going to <em>Watch What Happens Live </em>is a blast for a Bravo fan. It's like jumping into the TV screen momentarily and getting a bit part in the Bravoverse. If you listen closely, you can hear my laugh in the background and barely catch me in an audience shot. You get to see if the Bravolebrities live up to their reputation, which, in my experience, is a resounding yes.</p><p>Sure, you can buy a ticket to <a href="https://bravocon2023.com/" target="_blank">BravoCon,</a> but thousands of people do that. <em>WWHL</em> is the golden ticket, the ever-so-exclusive treat. Our Bravo-watching friends were jealous, and for good reason. It's far more intimate than any other studio show I've been to. Any <a href="https://1iota.com/show/536/the-late-show-with-stephen-colbert" target="_blank">schmo can see</a> Stephen Colbert. Not many get to throw back <a href="https://x.com/Andy/status/233656084135571456" target="_blank">a Fresquila</a> alongside Andy Cohen. </p><p>I can't tell you how to get in, but I can suggest you do it if you can. And if you do score an invite to Bravo's chocolate factory, just make sure you prepare a good question for Andy. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>How to find the best dating apps for lesbians</h2><p>Mainstream dating apps attract the most users &mdash; including queer users. That means niche lesbian dating apps aren't your only options for finding love. These days, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/hinge-lgbtq-dating-identity-questions" target="_self">Hinge</a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/bumble-nonbinary-users-message-first" target="_self">Bumble</a>, OkCupid, and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/eharmony-launches-new-features-for-lgbtq-users" target="_self">even eharmony</a> all have clear filters to help you match with people of the same gender (or any gender at all), as well as filters that acknowledge the existence of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/what-is-consensual-non-monogamy" target="_self">non-traditional relationships</a>. Especially if you don't live in a densely populated area, going for the more popular dating apps over lesbian dating sites can often lead to better results. </p><p>With that said, there is one dating app lesbian women should try. HER is an app by and for queer women, and it's grown to have a strong user base. According to <a href="https://zdcs.link/1Gyqb?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=their%20website&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=05OeYFtDK5qi44fkvKr0KKO&short_url=1Gyqb&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">their website</a>, the app has <em>more than 15 million registered users</em> worldwide. The app also emphasizes finding community and making friends in addition to dating, giving you plenty of ways to find a connection with other queer women and non-binary users.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer.

To be indifferent to Ball is to be a potential Ball-Knower lain dormant. But to <em>act</em> like you Know Ball and to not Know Ball? That is a moral failing. Even further, it is a black stain on your character &mdash; to thieve at Ball-Knowing is to steal valor from the Ball-Knowers who are right with God. You claim to Know Ball but don't remember <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/BuckCo00.htm" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Correll Buckhalter</a>?

Tim Walz, the Democratic Vice President nominee and former high school football coach. Some rightwing Non-Ball-Knowers have posted and pontificated about the merits of Walz's football career because he was a defensive coordinator. They wonder how he can claim to be a football coach if he was an assistant coach.</p><p>Here is, for instance, a post about it from an official Trump campaign account. The replies feature many people agreeing. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>I take <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2018/11/i-think-about-this-a-lot-louise-mensch-steve-bannon-tweet.html" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">no pleasure in reporting</a> that all these people do not Know Ball. There is perhaps no more Football Job in the world than defensive coordinator. It is the purest form of Ball. A head coach is basically a CEO figurehead for the team. Fine enough, but it's akin to a celebrity chef who hasn't worked the line in years. An offensive coordinator is all sizzle, no steak. They're all 35, good-looking, and working for their next job &mdash; a politician, basically. Special teams coordinators work closely with kickers. </p><p>To be a defensive coordinator is to live with honor. It is the American version of being a chivalrous knight. It is not to expect glory but to live with purpose because it is right to live a purpose-driven life. You must admit there will always be points scored, yet you will always fight against that current. Perhaps the only more honorable job is strength coach. </p><p>Walz was a defensive coordinator who took a cellar-dwelling team to a state championship. The Republican Party and Trump's campaign are telling voters in the Rust Belt, SEC country, and elsewhere that defense doesn't matter. As if it <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/billsimmons/comments/15cs0hh/origins_of_defense_wins_championships/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>doesn't </em>win championships</a>?

<p>Any politics aside, this was a stunning, official display of the Trump campaign Not Knowing Ball. To slander a defensive coordinator is to slander the game itself. To wonder aloud the merits of leading a group of young men to glory in the 4-4 alignment? That is an affront to all this nation holds dear. </p><p>Not every American needs to Know Ball. But we must hold sacred the values of those who do and protect against those who wish to muddy the waters with a lack of Ball knowledge. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>A high-tech blend of form and function</h2><p>Over the years, TVs have gotten slimmer, but the newly released CanvasTV is one of the first in the market to fundamentally rethink its form, transforming it from a black box into a stylish design element for your home.</p><p>The CanvasTV includes all the tech specs that you want in your watch box, including 4K QLED that captures over a billion shades and a 144Hz refresh rate that guarantees you&rsquo;ll be streaming your favorite shows with zero lag. Its surround sound audio makes movie nights feel like you're in a theater.&nbsp;</p><p>But these tech specs come to life in a whole new way once you switch the TV to Art Mode and choose from one of the included 120 famous paintings to display on your wall. Capturing all the hues of a Monet painting is no easy feat, but with quantum dot technology, this TV renders a wider range of more accurate hues &mdash; something LED alone can't achieve. Plus, it enhances the immersive experience, making every viewing feel truly spectacular in either mode.&nbsp;</p><p>The CanvasTV also has a hi-matte display which showcases artwork more realistically by removing any glare or distortion from ambient light. This thoughtful detail makes the experience as enjoyable as viewing actual artwork, with the added benefit of being lit up by QLED.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 max-w-3xl">

<h2>Thoughtful attention to detail</h2><p>With all these features, the CanvasTV works impressively in both function and form equally, avoiding any cheesy gimmicks you might worry about. I can confirm: the CanvasTV is much more than a fun party trick!&nbsp;</p><p>Adding to its impressive design, the ultra-slim wall mount included with the CanvasTV is both sleek and sturdy. The two-part mounting system is easy to install with another person's help (shoutout to George from Best Buy!).&nbsp;</p><p>As my first wall-mounted TV, my space instantly felt more open and airy, with my media console freed up to hold other objects. Flush against the wall, this device extends just a few inches outward &mdash; complementing the look and feel of the rest of the artwork adorning your walls and enhancing the feng shui of the room.&nbsp;</p><p>The teak frame is also a standout feature. Nothing would&rsquo;ve ruined the art vibe faster or screamed TV louder than a shiny black plastic frame. The inclusion of a magnetic teak frame that easily snaps into place and has the Hisense logo displayed discreetly on the side rather than the front, ties the dual functionality of this product together in a really intentional way.&nbsp;</p><p>It helps that the teak effortlessly matched my acorn-finish media console and my parquet floors, blending mid-century modern vibes with cutting-edge tech.</p><div class="raw-embed">

<h2>Curate your own gallery experience</h2><p>Your taste in art is your own, and who better to be the director of your new at-home art gallery than you? Art Mode comes preloaded with 120 famous paintings, ranging from iconic portraits like the Mona Lisa to modern abstract works from Klimt and van Gogh.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Personalize your picks to display your favorite work, or cycle through a slideshow that you can curate to set a specific vibe. A handy button on the remote overlays a description with the title, artist, and a brief description of the piece &mdash; so you&rsquo;ll brush up on your art history, too. And if you want to add a personal touch, you can easily upload your own photos using the Art Mode app.&nbsp;</p><p>During my workday, I like to pair an upbeat music playlist with a modern or abstract masterpiece. When it&rsquo;s time to unwind at night, I switch to Google TV&rsquo;s intuitive layout of streaming apps and smart recommendations. A prominent Rotten Tomatoes rating helps me choose without searching for reviews on another device.&nbsp;</p><p>Here&rsquo;s the takeaway: If you&rsquo;re looking for a new TV or want to elevate the design appeal of your living space, the Hisense CanvasTV is a fantastic dual-function product that flexes on form and function.

      <description><![CDATA[Nintendo is winding down 'Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp' for phones, while introducing a paid offline version you can keep playing.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/06f5rwVhia0V8cGm3nODIHy/hero-image.bmp" alt="Animal Crossing New Horizons screenshot"><p>One of Nintendo's flagship phone games is shutting down, but it isn't going away <em>completely</em>.</p><p>As announced on the <a href="https://ac-pocketcamp.com/en-US" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">official website</a> for the iOS and Android version of <em>Animal Crossing</em>, service for <em>Pocket Camp</em> will end on Nov. 28 of this year. The game will continue to work, and there will even be seasonal events and other activities until that date. But after Nov. 28, <em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</em> as you know it will end, as have many online service-based games over the years, including Nintendo's own <a href="https://dragalialost.com/en/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Dragalia Lost</em></a> in 2022. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

            Nintendo Switch 2: It might not come out in early 2025 after all

        </a>
    </div>
<p>But it's not <em>completely</em> over. A single-player, offline version of <em>Pocket Camp</em>, which you can buy with a one-time payment (the original game is free-to-play with microtransactions) that gets you access to the game's "included features," per a vaguely worded <a href="https://faq.ac-pocketcamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/36353725150489-What-is-the-paid-version-of-the-app" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">FAQ page</a> on the website. Yes, you will be able to transfer your save data to this new version of the game, so you can keep going. </p><p>There are some asterisks to this &mdash; both good and bad. Unfortunately, since this new app is offline, you won't be able to use <em>any</em> network features, like the ability to visit your friends' camps. On the plus side, there will be no microtransactions nor subscriptions in the game anymore; you simply buy it once and that's that. </p><p>Considering so many online games (such as <em>Dragalia Lost</em>) shut down unceremoniously with no way to keep playing, this approach to <em>Animal Crossing</em>'s end-of-life process is a pivot for Nintendo. Maybe other companies will start thinking about doing similar things in the future.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The European cultural movement first became shorthand online a decade ago, when images of a physical fight in the Ukranian parliament, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/17/parliamentary-fighting-bloodsport-ukraine" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">a somewhat common occurrence</a>, circulated.

He notes, however, that it's more akin to a Roman Baroque painting, the period directly following the Renaissance, due to its complex, interlocking postures and incidental mastery of visual language developed during the former period &mdash; specifically, the value placed on rich symbolism and continuous narrative across multiple figures within the frame.</p><p>As with most internet trends, "accidental Renaissance" is no longer used to describe photographs that are decisively similar to the movement's work.&nbsp;Once something is part of the online vernacular, its use resonates and gains traction despite its meaning changing throughout the repetitive process.

<p>However, Wivel understands why people still use the term. "Most people don't know much about art history, but they've heard of the Renaissance and know it's an era of classical painting," he said.&nbsp;</p><p>It's also a pivotal moment in art history and the history of Western culture that's reiterated in history classes and at museums around the world. Da Vinci's <em>The Mona Lisa</em> gets <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/story/6-of-the-world-39-s-most-visited-paintings/sAVhFizZbAwNJA?hl=en" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">10 million visitors a year in the Louvre</a>, making it the most visited painting in the world. Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling panel <em>The Creation of Adam</em> has been spoofed in popular culture a hundred times over. Thousands cram themselves in front of Raphael's <em>The School of Athens </em>every day in the Vatican. </p><p>Many of the characteristics of the Renaissance that these images hint at, like the rational organization of figures in space and psychological realism, were developed during the period.&nbsp;Given that that's when the characteristics emerged, Wivel argues, the descriptor makes sense.</p><p>These developments are most notably articulated in da Vinci's <em>The Last Supper</em>, which is likely the central reference point for posters as one of the most famous images of all time. "You have Christ in the middle with the apostles around him. It's just as he announces that one of them is going to betray him, you see his words reverberating in all they all respond to it," explains Wivel. "So there's a psychological intertwinement of all the figures in that image. Leonardo's great goal is to show not just the physical presence of humans, but also the mental presence."</p><p>Jerry Brotton, professor of Renaissance Studies at Queen Mary University of London and author of <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/447424/four-points-of-the-compass-by-brotton-jerry/9780241556870" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Four Points of the Compass: The Unexpected History of Direction</em></a>, also cited <em>The Last Supper</em> as a demonstration of the emotions we associate with the Renaissance.&nbsp;</p><p>"Revelation, calmness, thoughtfulness, guilt, terror, horror, it's all laid out there at a dinner table," he told Mashable. "Those images that are captured now through social media are doing something similar. They are trying to capture a certain composition or moment which is about pain, ecstasy, joy, and/or horror."</p><p>With the range of emotions and sculpted bodies on display &mdash; another defining aspect of the Renaissance &mdash; at the 2024 Paris Olympics, many so-called Renaissance paintings circulated on social media.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://x.com/WorldAthletics/status/1822359787964612749" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">image</a> of the four-by-400-meter relay race that got the descriptor displayed members of Team Great Britain. One lies on his back, another bent over him. Beside him is another runner with a face of shock and hands almost held in prayer, and the final member of the team keeps his hands over his head. In a Renaissance painting, these emotions would be assumed as driven by religious beliefs &mdash; and despair featured heavily. Wivel likened the image to a painting of a lamentation over the dead body of Christ, a popular scene for artists known as the Piet&agrave;, rendered by masters from Michelangelo to Pietro Perugino and Giovanni Bellini.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Emma Turner, a 24-year-old working in sports media in Brisbane, Australia, posted a photo of her TV displaying the men's triathlon finish line with the caption, "obsessed with the finish line in the men&rsquo;s triathlon, it&rsquo;s like a renaissance piece" <a href="https://x.com/EmmaTurnerBA/status/1818595213176455326" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">to X</a>. The photo showed one athlete lying on his back and another on his hands and knees.&nbsp;</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>The response to the meme and its recirculation on Facebook and Instagram surprised her. She received comments like, "People are just calling anything a Renaissance painting these days."</p><p>"With modern phrases and pop culture, it's just become a shorthand for people to say this is beautiful or this is something that came together in a way that is appealing to the human eye, in the way that classical art is," she told Mashable.</p><p>Despite the loosening of what "Renaissance painting" means in reference to viral images, it's no accident that, again and again, we find ourselves attracted to these images of extreme emotion and beautiful bodies. We may no longer be living in the time of da Vinci, Raphael, and Michelangelo, but we're still appreciators of art, whether that be murals or memes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

However, as of Aug. 22, it's on sale for a new record-low of just $349, making us much more likely to recommend it. The tablet itself is just OK on its own, but the charging speaker dock can turn it into a smart display or a desktop TV when plugged in.</p><p>"It just&hellip;works, especially if you&rsquo;re like me and don&rsquo;t want two or three big-ass monitors on your desk," Mashable tech reporter Alex Perry wrote in his <a href="https://mashable.com/review/google-pixel-tablet-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">review</a>. The specs aren't going to blow you away;&nbsp;it packs a Google Tensor G2 chip with 8GB of RAM under its hood and 8MP cameras on the front and back.

<p>Built-in TV speakers aren't usually anything to write home about, which can make watching your favorite shows and movies kind of a bummer. Give it a boost into something more substantial with the Bose speaker and soundbar. While it adds some serious sound, it doesn't add any serious bulk to your entertainment space. It only measures about two inches in height and two feet in width. Plus, it's super simple to set up. As of Aug. 22, snag it on sale for only $199 &mdash;&nbsp;that's 29% in savings.</p><p><em>None of these deals catching your eye?

<p>This compact air purifier is small enough to fit just about anywhere in your home, and its surprisingly modern design means it'll probably look good there, too. It can clean up to 361 square feet in just 13 minutes, and areas up to 874 square feet in just 30 minutes, so you can have a clean apartment or small space within an hour. That's all thanks to its HEPA filter, which takes about 99.999% of 0.01-micron particles out of the air. It can also handle pollen and other allergens. </p><p>You can choose between three different cleaning speed options, and watch in real time as the unit clears out the air in your home thanks to its color-coded LEDs. The air quality indicator can let you know when you might want to run the machine in short bursts as well. </p><p>If you need an easy, simple air purifier that gets the job done, you can't go wrong with this one &mdash; especially since it's under $200. </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01vhdD9hCn0sWHfHrVQkixp/hero-image.jpg" alt="iPhone Messages keyboard"><p>In an era of expensive devices or services falling prey to security problems and whatnot, it's always nice to hear about a genuinely funny and seemingly harmless iPhone bug.</p><p>Spotted by a security researcher named <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@kpwn/113000348717635390" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Konstantin</a> on Mastodon (and corroborated by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/21/typing-these-four-characters-could-crash-your-iphone/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">TechCrunch</a>), typing the characters "":: (that is, two quotation marks followed by two colons) into some iPhone text entry fields can cause the phone to temporarily crash. TechCrunch confirmed that it works if you do it while searching in the Settings app or searching through your app library; I won&rsquo;t be testing this myself and wouldn&rsquo;t recommend anyone else try it either.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>To be fair, however, it doesn't appear that this is a security issue &mdash; and it doesn't <em>seem</em> like it should cause long-term issues for any phones that do suffer this specific kind of crash. It's also easy enough to avoid, as that particular string of characters is more akin to something a toddler (or very groggy adult who just woke up) would type into their phone.</p><p>We reached out to Apple and will update this piece if we get a response.</p>]]></content:encoded>

It can be expensive to keep up with everything Apple has to offer, so if you're looking to grab one of the company's watches but don't want to shell out for the latest and greatest, this deal is for you. </p><p>As of August 22, get the <a href="https://zdcs.link/NMYRD?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=refurbished%20Apple%20Watch%20Series%208%2045mm%2C%20%28GPS%20%2B%20Cellular%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=06TN3LwIUr7Z2OOlm8qSyUJ&short_url=NMYRD&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">refurbished Apple Watch Series 8 45mm, (GPS + Cellular)</a> at Woot! for just $234.99. That's $194.01 off its normal price of $429 and a discount of 48%. The watch is considered Grade A refurbished, which means there's minimal cosmetic damage. It also comes with a 1-year warranty and you can choose from several colorways. </p><p>The Series 8 may not come with some of the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-watch-series-9-vs-watch-se" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Series 9's</a> niceties (like the latest processor), and it won't be equipped with some of the features you may be looking for, like Double Tap. But it's an excellent entry into Apple's smartwatch collection that still comes with a wide variety of features: track your sleep, fitness, menstrual cycle, and just about everything else, too. Plus, use it for your favorite apps, to call and text, and tell time (wow!). </p><p>Kidding aside, just because it's cheaper, that doesn't make it less functional. It's an excellent price that still comes equipped with everything you should need in a smartwatch. You're just going to have to act quickly if you want yours though, as this deal is only available for six more days or until the watches are sold out. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2><strong>Social Security breach check</strong></h2><p>Pentester, a cybersecurity firm, launched a tool that lets you check if your data was caught up in a recent breach. To find out, visit <a href="http://npd.pentester.com" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">npd.pentester.com</a>, enter your first and last name, along with your birth year, and you&rsquo;ll get a list of any breached accounts associated with you. </p><p>The tool even shows the last four digits of the compromised Social Security numbers, making it easier to confirm if your information is at risk.</p><h2><strong>How to protect yourself if you're breached</strong></h2><p>If you&rsquo;ve checked Pentester&rsquo;s website and discovered that you&rsquo;re one of the billions affected by the breach, here&rsquo;s what the NPD recommends to protect your identity:</p><p>1. <strong>Financial monitoring </strong>- NPD advises taking a closer look at your bank accounts, ensuring everything is in order. While this might seem like a no-brainer, the reality is that many Americans don&rsquo;t scrutinize every line item on their credit and debit card statements, which leaves room for fraudulent charges to slip through unnoticed.</p><p>2. <strong>Credit monitoring - </strong>Set up credit monitoring with one or all of the major credit bureaus, including Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. This way, you&rsquo;ll get alerts for any suspicious activity, like new or existing accounts being opened in your name. </p><p>3. <strong>Consider a credit freeze</strong> <strong>-</strong> Instituting a credit freeze is like hitting a big red button. It stops new credit from being opened in your name without your explicit permission.</p><p>Of course, none of these steps will erase the fact that your Social Security number is now floating around in the cybercrime underworld. But they&rsquo;re practical measures you can take to safeguard your finances and protect yourself from future headaches.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>We've heard many reports about a foldable iPad and/or a foldable MacBook (these two might be the same device, in fact) being in the works over the years. A <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-foldable-iphone-report" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">report from The Information</a> in February claimed that Apple is working on several foldable devices, including a foldable iPad and a foldable iPhone.

It would essentially be a giant touchscreen when unfolded (think a very large iPad or a touchscreen monitor), and a laptop when partially folded, with the bottom part of the display being used as a keyboard. Such laptops do exist &ndash; <a href="https://mashable.com/article/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-foldable-windows-pc-computer" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Lenovo in particular</a> tried its hand at creating something like that &ndash; but they haven't gained significant traction. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

The words: "mathematics," "Paris," and "combination." One outfit is for work, the other for a night out, like a bar or, as Innanen prefers, chess club.</p><p>"What people don't know is that chess club is cool," he tells Mashable. "Chess night is fun. Chess night is a good time. You go there, and you kick some ass." He got into chess during the pandemic, claiming he was in the top 90th percentile of players globally (it is unclear to me where he got that number), though he admits he&rsquo;s since "fallen off."&nbsp;</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Back to the panicking: He can't find a pair of pants that feel Parisian enough (he's looking for corduroy, but we're faced only with a barrage of camo). So, he starts "fully breaking down."</p><p>"Oh god, I'm not even thinking about 'combination,'" he says, running his hands through his hair and darting his eyes across the room.

<p>The only difference between this and how he approaches his TikTok videos when he&rsquo;s feeling stuck &mdash; "<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@yungjackinnanen/video/7361910422636743942?lang=en" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>I just use a random word generator and do word association until something hits</u></a>" &mdash; is that he&rsquo;s being timed. It makes him flip through the clothes faster but doesn't necessarily improve the quality of his choices. He spins in circles. He moves his hands frantically, all pointing to a level of physical comedy you might not notice in the closeup way he records TikTok sketches. He's like a goldfish that grows to fit in their given space, and this thrift store is <em>big</em>. His linguistic mannerisms &mdash; "holy shit" or "what people don't know" &mdash; echo across the selection of cowboy boots that don't fit him.</p><p>Despite the pressure, Innanen assembles two surprisingly cohesive outfits. The first includes a Notre Dame sweatshirt (Paris), pleated slacks (Paris), a Mickey hat (combination, although his explanation eludes me), and a leather briefcase (mathematics). The second outfit features pleated pants that don&rsquo;t button (mathematics), a shirt with an eagle (combination, somehow), a blazer (Paris), and the Mickey hat again (combination).&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Innanen's flair for fashion is apparent &mdash; look at his brand collaborations with Ralph Lauren, Louis Vuitton, Acne Studios, and Coach &mdash; and an interest he finds "really fun." But it's a side quest; he sees it as separate from the rest of his content, centered almost entirely on sketch comedy. He typically plays two characters, one eccentric and the other normal. Take, for instance, the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@yungjackinnanen/video/7332236921063705861?lang=en" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>vegan who doesn't want to kill the bacteria</u></a> on his body, the guy who <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@yungjackinnanen/video/7331862141617720581?lang=en" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>can't stop slipping engagement rings</u></a> into random girls' drinks, and the marketing exec who sexualizes <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@yungjackinnanen/video/7301019215211810053?lang=en" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>a slogan</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><blockquote class="tiktok-embed" data-video-id="7332236921063705861" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;">

<p>"I just love telling good stories and funny stories," he says at SEY Coffee, where water drips on our shoulders from an overactive air conditioner. "Whether that's the writing aspect, the performing side, the editing side &mdash; I love it all."</p><p>For Innanen, it's particularly fun to have complete creative control over his work and mold it himself.</p><p>"Online stuff gives you the full ability to have [the] freedom to do whatever you want, whenever you want, which is fun," he says. "I write it myself. I perform myself. I edit myself. I distribute it myself."</p><p>Innanen has two TikTok profiles: his main account,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@yungjackinnanen?lang=en" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>@yungjackinnanen, with 3.3 million followers</u></a>, and his secondary page,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@oldjackoutoutout?lang=en" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Spammy Boy or @oldjackoutoutout,</u></a>&nbsp;with over 988,300 followers. His main account is polished, while his more chaotic spam account, spawned during the pandemic, operates under one rule: no drafts.&nbsp;</p><p>He posts frequently on his spam account, sometimes multiple times daily, yet it&rsquo;s rare to see unsupportive or negative comments under Innanen's videos. Most popular influencers have snark pages and subreddits devoted to hating them. Innanen does not. While there&rsquo;s a level of privilege to his online experience &mdash; straight, white, cis, men rarely receive the vitriol faced by marginalized communities &mdash; the absence of hate is still notable. That is until you meet him; Innanen is hard to hate.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Talking to him, you never know which character will respond &mdash; Schmidt from <em>New Girl</em>? His comedic inspirations <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1967111/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Jake and Amir</u></a>? Or Innanen himself? Regardless, he&rsquo;s undeniably charming and down for anything. It isn't easy to anticipate what he might say next.&nbsp;</p><p>He recalls how his grandmother introduced him to Kurt Vonnegut when he was 16, though he was too busy playing Minecraft to appreciate it then. After she passed, he rediscovered Vonnegut in college and began admiring the author&rsquo;s unique blend of dark humor, absurdity, and satire.</p><p>"He's so clever and funny," he says, noting that <em>The Sirens of Titan</em> is his favorite of the author and recommending a deep cut he just finished reading:<em> A Man Without a Country</em>. "He's not setting up jokes and punchlines. It's in the cleverness. It's very subtle. I love that in people."</p><p>Replicating that kind of humor online is tricky because short-form content only has a few seconds to capture an audience. While TikTok is ideal for sketches, it lacks the nuance and space to play with more depth, something Innanen aspires to create more of in future projects.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>"There's an aspect of my sketches that are to the mass audience where I'm like, 'OK what's a good hook here? What will most people find funny? Can I deliver this line in a goofy way?' Versus if, in a different medium, like if I were to write a movie or something, I would want [to replicate Vonnegut's humor]. I love just how subtly witty he is, and I'd love to have a character like that or lines delivered like that that are not as slap-sticky as sketches can be."</p><p>For now, though, his focus is on acting. Innanen was recently cast as a lead in FX&lsquo;s ensemble comedy pilot <em>Snowflakes</em>, created by <em>The Tonight Show</em> writers Ben Kronengold and Rebecca Shaw. It follows a cohort of twenty-somethings "trying to be good people, despite being neither 'good' nor 'people' yet," <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/07/snowflakes-fx-comedy-series-1236025265/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>according to Deadline</u></a>. It's Innanen's "first serious acting gig" and only his second audition.</p><p>"The script for <em>Snowflakes</em> came across, and I was like, 'This is the funniest thing I've ever read,'" Innanen says. "We shot the pilot, and it was the most incredible experience. Everyone's hilarious. The whole cast is hilarious and so talented &mdash; the creators and everyone producing it. And I just got to be myself." He says acting allows him to "hone in just on performing." </p><p>"I don't write my own lines. I'm not filming it," he says of the differences between short-form content on TikTok and film. "But I just love being silly on camera.

<p>He fell into acting in the same way he fell into TikTok: by following his passion. As a teenager, he made YouTube videos that are now unlisted, videos he seems deeply ashamed of and does not want to show me, like "What Guys Look For In Girls." He was a Minecraft YouTuber, made lyric videos for songs he liked, and eventually studied astrophysics at university. He even tried his hand at playing music, to no avail. (His Spotify On Repeat is a mix of Drake, Frank Ocean, and Otis Redding.)</p><p>Now, he stands on the cusp of extraordinary success &mdash; the kind that could propel him far beyond TikTok fame.

Sometimes, just the thought of putting on proper clothes, coming up with witty conversation starters, and commuting to the actual meetup spot can be tiring. </p><p>No matter what kind of encounter you plan, when it comes to dating, there'll always be some sort of physical effort required. The good news? There is a<em> </em>loophole: Sexting.</p><h2>What is sexting?</h2><p>Sexting is the art of sending sexually explicit photos or messages to one or more people via text. Thanks to its recent <a href="https://www.getthefacts.health.wa.gov.au/keeping-safe/sexting" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">rise in popularity</a>, there are now apps for sexting and new sexting features in apps that are otherwise for <a href="https://mashable.com/category/dating" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">dating</a> in person.</p><h2>What do you need to know about sexting?</h2><p>Whether you're interested in giving sexting a try or you're a seasoned pro, there are a few things to keep in mind when downloading and using a new dating app to sext. Sure, there are fewer inhibitions when scoring a new sexting partner when compared to finding a long-term lover, but there are rules you should follow in order for all parties to feel at ease. Here are three big ones:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Mutual respect </strong>&mdash;<strong> </strong>Assess the situation and know your audience. Usually, it doesn't take much more than a few pre-sext texts (or pre-sexts) to gauge whether or not someone is interested in doing the cyber-dirty with you. Take the time to figure that out before you lead with something raunchy and uncalled-for. AKA, don't just start throwing dick pics at people left and right if they didn't ask.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mutual trust </strong>&mdash;<strong> </strong>Be respectful: <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Privacy</a> is sacred. The internet has the scary ability to make fleeting moments very permanent. If someone asks you to keep something to yourself, do it. While sexting can be light and fun, it also requires a serious level of trust. If you betray that trust, you're ruining it for everybody.</p></li><li><p><strong>Privacy </strong>&mdash;<strong> </strong>No app can completely protect your privacy for you &mdash; that's your job. Though there are apps that have certain features that are designed to protect your identity/content, they don't rule out all scenarios. For example, someone doesn't need to take a screenshot to capture a picture you send. They could easily use another phone or device to snap or record your photos and/or videos. You should always keep this in mind before sending anything that could be compromising, and do your best to make sure you trust the person who's receiving your messages.</p></li></ul><p>Keep these points in mind when engaging in NSFW messaging.</p><h2>Should you engage in sexting?</h2><p>Real-life dating is obviously the best way to get to know somebody long-term, especially if you're looking for any kind of serious, in-person relationship. And <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-mattress-for-sex-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">real sex</a> will always be better than sexting. However, sexting is an alternative that may help you out in ways you didn't even think about.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Convenience </strong>&mdash; Whether you plan to wine and dine on your date or just meet to hook up, it always requires some extra effort. For those with super hectic schedules or those who just don't have room in their life (for whatever reason) for a steady in-person relationship, sexting is practically a saving grace. After all, your sex drive doesn't go away just because you're busy. Sexting allows you to take care of your sexual needs without putting yourself out.</p></li><li><p><strong>Exploring trust and intimacy </strong>&mdash; Getting comfortable with another person in close quarters doesn&rsquo;t always come naturally for everyone &mdash; but opting for sexting gives way to a new level of exploration in terms of intimacy and trust. You don&rsquo;t ever have to meet the person behind the screen if you don&rsquo;t want to, but being able to practice feeling vulnerable without any strings attached can be a great lesson in being more open.</p></li><li><p><strong>Freedom </strong>&mdash;<strong> </strong>As is the case with most behind-the-screen activities, with sexting, you can let go of your inhibitions and get comfortable exploring your sexual side. Knowing there's a certain barrier between you and the other person may allow you to experiment with language and ideas that you wouldn't otherwise explore in person.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fun </strong>&mdash; A little honesty, please. A night of sexting is always going to be a lot more fun than endlessly swiping right on a dating app and starting the same conversation over and over. Having the option of opening an app on your phone and engaging in a little virtual foreplay offers instant gratification and (almost) guaranteed pleasure.</p></li><li><p><strong>Safety </strong>&mdash;<strong> </strong>We've touched on the reasons why sexting might<em> </em>not be completely safe in terms of privacy, but to its credit, sexting offers an element of safety that in-person meetings don't. Sexting allows you to interact with both people you know and total strangers without putting yourself in dangerous or unwanted physical situations. Your experience should always be what you want it to be, and with sexting, if it's not going in the direction you want, it's just a matter of closing an app.</p></li></ul><p>The benefits are clear for all to see, so not give it a try?</p><h2>What makes an app good for sexting?</h2><p>You'll want to look for certain features in an app if you're planning on sexting:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Ease of use </strong>&mdash;<strong> </strong>You don&rsquo;t want to find yourself in a hot and steamy conversation trying to figure out how to attach an image or a voice note. When it comes to sexting, the more user-friendly the platform is, the better. You&rsquo;ll want something that&rsquo;s efficient and fast.</p></li><li><p><strong>Privacy features </strong>&mdash; What happens in a sexting app doesn&rsquo;t always stay in a sexting app; there are no guarantees that your conversations or selfies won&rsquo;t wind up a screenshot on someone&rsquo;s phone. That said, certain apps include instant self-destruction features that delete photos and conversations after a certain amount of time.</p></li><li><p><strong>Safety </strong>&mdash; If you&rsquo;re looking for a night of no-strings-attached fun online, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter if the person on the other end of your conversation has been verified &mdash; but if you do want to ensure you&rsquo;re not being catfished or chatting with a bot, consider using an app that links social media or verifies users.</p></li><li><p><strong>Subscription pricing versus free features </strong>&mdash;<strong> </strong>How much are you willing to pay for bells and whistles? There are several free apps out there, but if you're looking for something a little fancier, you can pay a few pounds a month for premium features.</p></li></ul><p>With these features in mind, you should be ready to select an app and start sexting. You've got this.</p><h2>What is the best app for sexting?</h2><p>Since sexting, by nature, comes with <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/your-guide-to-safer-sexting" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>a lot of factors to consider</u></a> (consent and privacy, for example), we've picked out the best sexting apps to get you off &mdash; to a good start, that is.

If you're struggling to find a match in the real world, it might be time to put your faith in dating sites.</p><p>When we think about these sites, it's normal to go straight to the likes of <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/9d96?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Match&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=032PDBUNHFvBoerJxJZRCEd&short_url=9d96&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Match</a>, eharmony, EliteSingles, and other marriage-minded options, but not everyone is thinking about <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-dating-sites-for-serious-relationships-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">something so serious</a>. Sometimes all you want is a little fun, and you best believe that there's an app for that.</p><h2>How do you find a hookup?</h2><p>It's still possible to <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-dating-sites-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">find a connection</a> in the real world, because meeting in bars, clubs, parks, and other real-life locations still happens on a regular basis.

Why not give yourself the best chance of success?</p><p>Dating sites and sex apps allow you to get your information out there to a massive network of <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-dating-sites-for-geeks-nerds-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">like-minded individuals</a>.

<p>Lastly, using dating apps and sites is a whole lot less intimidating than meeting someone face to face.

We're sorry to break it to you, but the best dating sites don't come cheap. It all comes down to access to advanced and premium features.

And you can watch some of the biggest fixtures without spending anything.</p><p>If you're interested in watching the Women's Super League for free from anywhere in the world, we have all the information you need.</p><h2>What is the Women's Super League?</h2><p>The Women's Super League (WSL) is the highest level of women's football in England. Established in 2010, it is run by the Football Association and features 12 professional teams. Chelsea are the current WSL champions after winning their seventh title last year.</p><h2>How to watch the Women's Super League for free</h2><p>Sky Sports will show up to 44 WSL games this season, but it's not free. Fortunately, there are free alterrnatives on offer.</p><p>BBC Sport has agreed to show 22 live matches for free on BBC iPlayer. And it gets better, because all non-Sky Sports/BBC broadcasted WSL fixtures will be live streamed globally on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@bwsl" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">YouTube</a>.</p><p>Anyone from around the world can access WSL fixtures for free on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@bwsl" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">YouTube</a>, but the same can't be said for the top games featured on <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">BBC iPlayer</a>. This popular service will block your access if you attempt to connect from outside the UK, so if you want to watch the WSL on BBC iPlayer from abroad, you'll need to use a <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">VPN</a>. </p><p>VPNs can hide your digital location and connect you to a secure server in the UK, meaning you can access BBC iPlayer from anywhere in the world.

<h2><strong>Pixel 9 Pro XL vs. iPhone 15 Pro Max: Wide camera test</strong></h2><p>So here's what we're working with for both phones when it comes to the main wide camera lens:</p><p><strong>iPhone 15 Pro Max: 48MP, <em>f/</em>1.8 aperture, and 1.22&micro;m</strong></p><p><strong>Pixel 9 Pro XL: 50MP,<em> f/</em>1.7 aperture, and 1.2&micro;m</strong></p><p>On paper, the Pixel 9 Pro XL will likely capture more detail due to its higher resolution. And with its slightly larger aperture, the Google phone should allow more light gathering, which means better low-light performance. However, the iPhone 15 Pro Max has a slight edge in its pixel size, which should offer better dynamic range and less noise.</p><p>However, because of image processing and other factors that affect camera performance, let's use the best tools for analyzing which phone is better: our eyes.</p><h3><strong>Test 1</strong></h3><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

      <description><![CDATA[Tesla has issued a recall for 9,100 Model X cars over an issue that should've been fixed in 2020.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/05XUG0oU3feymZyLJPspYjR/hero-image.jpg" alt="Tesla Model X"><p>Tesla issuing a recall for just over 9,000 cars is hardly a surprise these days, given that the company has recalled millions of cars over the years, including a recall for <a href="https://mashable.com/article/tesla-recall-cars-hood-issue" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">1.8 million cars</a> just weeks ago. </p><p>However, while most of Tesla recalls are for issues that can be fixed with software updates, this new one is notable as it requires a visit to the service center. </p><p>According to a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) report (via <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-recall-more-than-9000-model-x-suvs-nhtsa-says-2024-08-21/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Reuters</a>), Tesla has issued a recall for 9,136 Model X SUVs over a trim on the roof that could separate and increase the risk of a crash. </p><p>"The Model X is equipped with a cosmetic applique at the front of the roof just behind the windshield, known as the front applique, as well as an applique at the center of the roof in between the upper falcon door roof glass, known as the spine applique. Both appliques are adhered to the vehicle using urethane. If the applique-to-urethane interface lacks primer, then, over time, the adhesion may weaken, causing the applique to separate from the vehicle," the report said.</p><p>Owners of affected Teslas, which are all of the 2016 model year Model X vehicles, will have to go to a Tesla service center where the roof trim adhesion will be tested and trim pieces reattached to make sure the cars are safe to drive, at no cost to the owners. </p><p>Also notable is that this is the <a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/recall-front-and-spine-applique" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">second time</a> these Model X vehicles have been recalled for the same issue. The first time it happened was in 2020, but now Tesla says that fix was not sufficient to truly remedy the issue. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Within hours of Ebiri's report, <em>Megalopolis</em>' distributor Lionsgate apologised and announced the new trailer would be taken down immediately.

<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple.

      <description><![CDATA[PC feeling a little sluggish? Phone experiencing swipe-delay? Here are some simple tips to both speed up and lock down your personal devices.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/0153JSDBCKbohphpeW1RBxl/hero-image.jpg" alt="Security PC"><p>So, you want your PC to perform at its best? Outside of just buying the most expensive hardware, one of the keys to achieving this is ensuring top-notch security. A secure PC isn't just safer, it's also faster. By following these tips to optimise your system, you'll transform your computer into a sleek, efficient powerhouse. Get ready to experience the best of both worlds: security and performance. Let's dive in.</p><h2>First steps</h2><p><strong>Clear up disk space</strong>: Running your PC when it's bogged down with junk is like trying to run a marathon with a backpack full of bricks. If your PC is feeling sluggish, the first thing you should check is the amount of available space on your drives. Removing unnecessary files and unwanted programs should quickly provide a speed boost, with plenty more you can do from there.</p><p><strong>Restart your PC</strong>: Sometimes, things are as simple as turning it off and on again. Rebooting your PC can help close unnecessary background processes, clear the memory (RAM), and provides an opportunity to apply updates. This of course leads to the next tip..</p><p><strong>Update your operating system</strong>: Make sure that your Operating System (OS) and all your drivers are up to date. These updates often include performance improvements and security patches that can help your PC run more smoothly and safely.</p><p><strong>Run an antivirus scan</strong>: You could have some viruses or malware infecting your system. These malicious programs often run in the background, consuming valuable resources and slowing down your computer. By running a scan using a reputable antivirus, you can detect these threats and eliminate them. Then you&rsquo;ll not only be safer, but have a faster, more responsive computer.</p><h2>Choosing an antivirus</h2><p>Everybody should be using some form of basic antivirus on their computer. Something that only becomes more important if you a) share your devices, or b) use that device for banking or online shopping.</p><p>Outside of just <a href="https://www.avast.com/c-virus-removal-tool" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">scanning for viruses</a>, antivirus software also enhances your PC&rsquo;s performance by removing and blocking malware, cleaning up unnecessary files, optimising system settings, and providing ongoing protection against new threats. So it&rsquo;s kind of like having a housekeeper or a robot vacuum cleaner for your PC. Plugging away in the background, sucking up all the digital dirt and keeping your PC squeaky clean. Leading to a smoother, faster, and more reliable computing experience.</p><p>Even if you really, really don&rsquo;t want to pay for additional security on your devices, it&rsquo;s still recommended you install a lightweight, free version of a reputable antivirus. <a href="https://www.avast.com/en-au/avast-one" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Avast One Basic</a> was the 2024 Editor's Choice pick for free antivirus by the experts at our sister site <a href="https://mashable.com/antivirus/8949/the-best-antivirus-protection" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">PCMag</a>. It provides free protection for Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows, and scored near-perfect scores in our lab testing for both antivirus and phishing protection. However, if you want the best protection for the most devices, we recommend upgrading your plan to one of the paid options. In this instance:</p><h2>Avast One Gold</h2><p>While a free tool such as <a href="https://www.avast.com/en-au/avast-one" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Avast One Basic</a> is a great place to start, the best features and security tools are always going to be tied to a premium antivirus plan. For Avast One, the golden standard is quite simply: <a href="https://www.avast.com/en-au/avast-one" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Avast One Gold</a>.</p><p><strong>Upgrading to Gold provides:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Antivirus and malware protection for up to 30 devices (PCs, Macs, tablets or smartphones)</p></li><li><p>A VPN (Virtual Private Network) with unlimited data for all devices on the plan to help you browse privately and securely</p></li><li><p>Performance optimisation features, automatic PC driver updates, and storage cleaning tools</p></li><li><p>Anti-tracking technology to prevent bad actors or advertisers from tracking you and learning about your online behaviour</p></li><li><p>Email Guardian, which helps flag scams and suspicious emails before they even reach your inbox</p></li><li><p>Technology that helps automatically block fake and malicious websites</p></li></ul><p>So if you want to both secure your devices and speed them up, Avast One Gold is an easy recommendation. It provides advanced protection, performance optimisation, privacy, priority support, and multi-device coverage.

<h2><strong>Windows Recall release date window</strong></h2><p>In October, Windows Insiders will gain access to Recall, though the exact date remains unspecified. At least, we think so. Recall was announced in May as a potentially life-changing AI feature that constantly takes screenshots of everything you do on a compatible Windows PC, then studies those screenshots to build a database of all your actions that you can search through if needed. </p><p>The only problem is that Recall was <a href="https://mashable.com/article/microsoft-copilot-recall-cybersecurity-disaster" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">immediately flagged</a> as a massive cybersecurity problem, considering the fact that it actively and purposely compiles a history of everything a user does on a PC.

But at least it won't be a long wait.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Before the reveal of the Google Pixel 9 series, the lineup only had two phones: a base model (e.g., last year&rsquo;s <a href="https://mashable.com/review/google-pixel-8-and-pixel-8-pro" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Google Pixel 8</u></a>) and a Pro variant (e.g., 2023&rsquo;s Google Pixel 8 Pro).</p><p>Now, Google has changed things up with a triple-device lineup: the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/pixel-9-pink-google-pixel-event-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Pixel 9</u></a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-pixel-9-and-9-pro-preorder" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Pixel 9 Pro</u></a>, and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/pixel-9-pro-xl-hands-on-first-impressions" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Pixel 9 Pro XL</u></a>.</p><p>Interestingly, despite its name, the Pixel 9 Pro XL isn&rsquo;t that much larger from last year&rsquo;s biggest model (i.e., Google Pixel 8 Pro).

If you want a 512GB model or a 1TB variant, you&rsquo;ll have to shell out $1,319 and $1,549, respectively. (I highly suggest getting the 256GB model.

<p>The Pixel 9 Pro XL is also highly resistant to fingerprints, so feel free to get handsy with it without any guilt.</p><p>The particular unit I tested for this review sports the Hazel chassis. There are three other colors you can choose from, including Obsidian (black), Rose Quartz (pink), and Porcelain (off-white).</p><p>I've seen them all in person. The Obsidian may be the most popular of the four colorways. You can never go wrong with a rich, onyx device that looks like it'd be on Batman's desk. The Rose Quartz delivers a pink-ish hue to the Pixel 9 Pro XL. Emphasis on the word <em>ish </em>because it's more of a pastel, barely there, "baby shower pink," if you will. If you want a pink that's actually not afraid to be pink, check out the "Peony" color on the Pixel 9.</p><p>Although Google made a subtle gen-over-gen change with the camera bar, it elevates the visual appeal of the Pixel 9 series. The funky Geordi La Forge-esque visor no longer goes from edge to edge. It now has an island-style design with a body that color matches the chassis.</p><p>On the right side of the Pixel 9 Pro XL, you'll find the volume and power buttons. On the bottom, you'll discover the USB-C port and a SIM card slot (the Pixel 9 Pro XL also supports eSIM).</p><p>Compared to the Pixel 8 Pro, the Pixel 9 Pro XL is just a <em>smidge </em>larger (6.41 inches long versus 6.40). However, it's slightly thinner (0.33 inches vs. 0.35 inches). The Pixel 9 Pro XL feels quite nice in the hands; the curved edges are forgiving as my fingers wrap around them. As someone who never liked the Pixel series' design, I'm finally warming up to it.</p><h2><strong>Google Pixel 9 Pro XL display</strong></h2><p>The Pixel 9 Pro XL has a 6.8-inch, 1344 x 2992-pixel resolution display. It has a screen-to-body ratio of about 88%, a slight jump from the Pixel 8 Pro's 87% screen-to-body ratio. This means that the Pixel 9 Pro XL offers a better immersive viewing experience with thinner bezels, allowing more of the display to be dedicated to your content.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The first thing that caught my eye is that the Pixel 9 Pro XL deals better with challenging lighting, delivering a shot with little to no lens flare (unlike the iPhone 15 Pro Max). The Apple device offered a more true-to-life interpretation of the two antique cars while its Google rival captured a richer, more saturated shot.</p><h3><strong>Ultrawide camera</strong></h3><p>I also took some pictures of Northport Harbor in Long Island, New York.

<p>This is quite low compared to the scores we've recorded for other phones we've reviewed:</p><p><strong>Google Pixel 9 Pro XL - 4,569</strong></p><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 - 6,069</strong></p><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 - 6,300</strong></p><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra - 7,078</strong></p><p><strong>iPhone 15 Pro Max - 7,359</strong></p><p>I know the iPhone 15 Pro Max's 7,359 score may look astronomical &mdash; and that's because it is. It's way too overpowered for a smartphone. The Pixel 9 Pro XL doesn't need to match this score to be considered as beastly as the priciest iPhone, but its Geekbench 6 score is surprisingly low. And when you consider that the Pixel 8 Pro actually delivered a <em>higher </em>score (e.g., 4,639), the G4 chip feels even more underpowered.</p><p>Even so, I didn't experience any slowdowns whatsoever while juggling multiple apps simultaneously. It is worth nothing, however, that the Pixel 9 Pro XL got a little too hot at times, particularly while using the cameras during a warm day.

<p>We ran a TikTok rundown on the Pixel 9 Pro XL at 50% brightness. Now, imagine our surprise when we saw it lasted a whopping <strong>18 hours and 41 minutes</strong> on a single charge. This beats the iPhone 15 Pro Max, which lasted <strong>14 hours and 53 minutes </strong>on the same test.</p><h2><strong>Google Pixel 9 Pro XL: Is it worth it?</strong></h2><p>The Google Pixel 9 Pro XL is <em>totally </em>worth it based on the battery life alone. You can comfortably leave the house with the Pixel 9 Pro XL and not suffer from battery drainage anxiety. You can get away with being lazy for a bit and <em>not </em>charging the phone for a night or two.</p><p>Plus, when it comes to its shooters, it can compete with arguably the best smartphone on the market: the iPhone 15 Pro Max. That being said, the Pixel 9 Pro XL beats the iPhone 15 Pro Max in at least three categories: camera, display, and battery life.</p><p>On top of that, the Pixel 9 Pro XL's Google AI features are a blast to use (though they have their quirks), making the Pixel 9 Pro XL one of the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/aug-14-best-phone-deals" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>best phones of 2024.</u></a></p>]]></content:encoded>

The feature exists to help create quick summaries of conversations, but per PromptArmor, it does so with access to private DMs, and can be tricked into phishing other users.</p><p>The technical nitty-gritty details are all in the PromptArmor blog post, but the problem here is essentially twofold. For starters, Slack recently updated its AI system to be able to scrape data from private user DMs and file uploads <em>on purpose</em>. Beyond that, using a technique called "prompt injection," PromptArmor proved you can use Slack AI to create malicious links that could potentially phish members of said Slack channel.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Mashable has reached out to Slack for comment on this. Per PromptArmor's blog, the issue was raised to Slack ahead of the publication of its blog post. A spokesperson for Slack's parent company SalesForce told <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/21/slack_ai_prompt_injection/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">The Register</a> that the problem has been addressed, but did not go into specifics.</p><p>"When we became aware of the report, we launched an investigation into the described scenario where, under very limited and specific circumstances, a malicious actor with an existing account in the same Slack workspace could phish users for sensitive data," the SalesForce spokesperson said. "We've deployed a patch to address the issue and have no evidence at this time of unauthorized access to customer data."</p><p>If nothing else, it's probably worth looking up the stated AI policies for every app that you use regularly.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Watching the sunset at the beach or lakeside is one of life's simple joys. Perhaps one of the only things that could make it better would be listening to some great music. Pop on some ambient jazz or this summer's playlist and take the experience to a whole new level.</p><p>However, there's one non-negotiable when it comes to tunes by a body of water: your portable Bluetooth speaker needs to be waterproof. Sure, we all tell ourselves we'll keep the speaker far away from the water source, but stuff happens. It's better to play it safe and opt for a waterproof speaker for the beach, the lake, or the pool.</p><p>Some of our favorite models are on sale as we count down the final days of summer, so if you have some water-side hangs planned, here are some great deals to shop today.</p><h2>Best overall waterproof speaker deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

It's screen time you can feel good about. </p><p>Like the regular Kindle, it has a six-inch, glare-free display with 300 ppi for sharp resolution, adjustable front light, and dark mode to prevent eye strain. Where it stands out is the kid-friendly extras, like 1-year of unlimited access to Amazon Kids+. This subscription would normally run you $4.99 per month and includes thousands of ad-free books and a Vocabulary Builder, where kids can look up definitions and learn new words. As of Aug. 21, it's down to just $94.99 from $119.99. That's 21% in savings.</p><h3>Best laptop deal of the day</h3><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>As you can see, you'll find the Action Button, which was left out of the lower-tier models on the current generation iPhone, now present on the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus. More on that later.</p><h3><strong>Display</strong></h3><p>The iPhone 16 Pro will reportedly have a 6.3-inch display while the iPhone 16 Pro Max will pack a 6.9-inch panel. You may be wondering, &ldquo;What about the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus? Will they get a screen size bump, too?&rdquo; The answer is likely no. The lower-tier models will reportedly have the same display sizes as their predecessors.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>However, he offered slightly different numbers: 6.2 inches and 6.8 inches. What could be the reason behind the discrepancy?

The current-gen iPhone 15 Pro models' Action Button can be programmed to launch a range of apps and functions, including Flashlight, Camera, Silent Mode, Voice Memo, Focus, Magnifier, Translate (coming to iOS 17.2), and a range of accessibility features.</p><p>When iPhone 16 drops, however, the rumor mill states that Apple will add more functionality to the Action Button.</p><h3><strong>Capture Button</strong></h3><p>The Action Button was all the rage for the iPhone 15 series, however, according to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/iphone-16-capture-button/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">MacRumors</a> and <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-plans-iphone-camera-button-as-creators-shift-to-horizontal-videos?rc=bdqvyp" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">The Information</a>, a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/iphone-16-camera-button" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">new Capture Button</a> will be one of the biggest selling points for the iPhone 16.

MacRumors says it's the latter, but The Information claims it's both.</p><h3><strong>Solid-state buttons</strong></h3><p>Apple reportedly planned on introducing solid-state buttons with the iPhone 15 Pro models, but instead, we got a customizable Action Button. For the uninitiated, solid-state buttons aren&rsquo;t buttons <em>per se </em>&ndash; they&rsquo;re panels that feature haptic feedback sensations that simulate real button presses (Think of the iPhone SE series' Home button). On the plus side, the solid-state buttons aren&rsquo;t totally out of the picture. According to respected <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/two-iphone-15-pro-models-removal-of-solid-state-button-design-negatively-affects-cirrus-logic-and-a456d5e7386c" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Apple leaker and analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</u></a>, Apple is working on debuting solid-state buttons on the iPhone 16 Pro models instead.<br></p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

To make room for this change, Apple will reportedly move the mmWave antenna to the left of the iPhone 16 Pro as opposed to the right. This Weibo tip comes from a leaker with the moniker "Instant Digital," a bean spiller that reportedly has an accurate track record, according to MacRumors.</p><h2><strong>iPhone 16 colors</strong></h2><p>According to a leak dropped on X, the iPhone 16 comes in five colors: white, black, blue, green, and pink.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<h2><strong>iPhone 16 battery life</strong></h2><p>As we reported in early April, a Weibo leaker by the name of "OvO Baby Sauce OvO" seemingly unveiled the new <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-iphone-16-plus-battery-size-reduction" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">new battery sizes across the iPhone 16 lineup</a>:</p><ul><li><p><strong>iPhone 16:</strong> 3,561mAh</p></li><li><p><strong>iPhone 16 Plus:</strong> 4,006mAh</p></li><li><p><strong>iPhone 16 Pro:</strong> 3,355mAh</p></li><li><p><strong>iPhone 16 Pro Max:</strong> 4,676mAh</p></li></ul><p>All the iPhone 16 models have some sort of <em>increase </em>from two to six percent <em>except </em>for the iPhone 16 Plus, which reportedly has a reduction of nearly nine percent compared to the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-iphone-15-plus-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">iPhone 15 Plus</a>.</p><p>Keep in mind that an increase in battery size doesn't necessarily mean that the device will deliver longer battery life.

<h3><strong><br>Storage</strong></h3><p>According to news aggregator account "yeux1122" from Naver, a Korean blog, the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max will feature options that offer <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/iphone-16-pro-2tb-option-rumor/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">2TB of storage</a>.</p><p>That is double the current max storage capacity of the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><h3><strong>Chipset</strong></h3><p>In recent years, Apple has followed the trend of putting <em>last year's </em>chip into the two entry-level models while the Pro models, the Pro and the Pro Max, get the new-generation chip. For example, the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus got the A16 Bionic chip, the same inside the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max. However, the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max got outfitted with the <em>new </em>A17 Pro chips.</p><p>If this pattern continues, it should follow that the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus get the A17 Pro while the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max get the A18 chips. Pu hinted that this is how it will be for the iPhone 16 line, hinting that the A17 Pro will reportedly be less efficient. In other words, the iPhone 16 models equipped with this chip may take a battery life hit. This is because the next-generation chip will offer tremendous performance gains at the expense of power efficiency.</p><p>However, another rumor tells a different story. </p><p>According to an alleged iOS 18 code leak from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/20/ios-18-code-four-new-iphone-models/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">MacRumors</a>, the<strong> entire</strong> iPhone 16 line will get<em> </em>an<em> </em>A18 chip. However, there&rsquo;s a chance that Apple will use a &ldquo;Pro&rdquo; identifier name to differentiate from the standard and Pro models (e.g., A18 chip and A18 Pro).</p><p>The iPhone 16 Pro models will also reportedly support Wi-Fi 7 (current models support WiFi 6E). Wi-Fi 7 should offer zippy transfer speeds that exceed 40 Gbps, quadrupling what WiFi 6E can do.</p><p>According to Pu (via <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/10/12/iphone-16-pro-faster-5g-wi-fi-7/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>9to5Mac</em></a>), the iPhone 16 Pro will come with Qualcomm&rsquo;s Snapdragon X75 modem, which can reach a 5G download rate of up to 7.5 Gbps.</p><p><em>We&rsquo;ll periodically update this rumor hub as new iPhone 16 leaks trickle in, so be sure to bookmark this page.&nbsp;</em></p><p></p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

It captures the duel scene between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker from Return of the Jedi with adorable minifigs of both characters, Emperor Palpatine, and some seriously tiny lightsabers. It includes the circular Death Star window, a rotating throne, two display consoles and a special 40th anniversary <em>Star Wars: Return of the Jedi</em> plaque. When finished, it stands 6.5 inches tall, and it consists of 807 pieces. It's not only a fun set to put together, but a great finished display item for any fan of the movies. </p><h2>Best Lego Icons deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>With that in mind, yes, the digital-only PS5 Slim is a money-saver in comparison to the one with a disc drive, but not in comparison to the digital-only model that launched three years ago. </p><p>The new price also means that buying a digital model before purchasing the additional disc drive would cost <em>more</em> than just snagging the version with a built-in drive. I don't really have a good explanation for any of that.</p><p>My only advice is this: If you want a PS5 that only costs $399, you better get one now. This is an important note: <strong>Once the existing stock of both original models sells out, the new slim models will replace them on store shelves. </strong></p><h2><strong>PS5 vs PS5 Slim size</strong></h2><p>Obviously, size is what many gamers are most concerned about here, so let's get right to it. Looking at Sony's stated dimensions, you can see that the new PS5 is indeed smaller than the original:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Original PS5 (disc version)</strong>: 104mm (height) x 390mm (width) x 260mm (depth)</p></li><li><p><strong>PS5 Slim (disc version):</strong> 96mm (height) x 358mm (width) x 216mm (depth)</p></li></ul><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>One little internal bonus that owners of the new PS5s get, however, comes in the form of expanded storage. For some reason, the original PS5 only had 825GB of onboard storage, with the option to expand via external SSDs. The new ones have a full 1TB of built-in space, so you can install a few extra games depending on how big they are.</p><h2><strong>PS5 vs PS5 Slim disc drive</strong></h2><p>Just like at the PS5's launch in late 2020, there are two PS5 Slim models.

<h2><strong>Microsoft Surface Laptop 7 is the best Windows laptop of 2024: 3 reasons why</strong></h2><p>Stay with me here. In order for you to understand <em>why </em>the Surface Laptop 7 is best Windows laptop of 2024, you need a little historical context. Because the Surface family wasn't <em>always </em>highly recommended &mdash; until now.</p><p>A few years ago, I was smack talking the Surface Laptop 5 when I reviewed it for a different publication. (The Surface Laptop 5 is <em>technically </em>the Surface Laptop 7's predecessor. There's a Surface Laptop 6, but only for business and not available in stores.) I had so much faith in Microsoft.

<p>It's not that Microsoft Surface laptops were awful <em>per se</em> &mdash; they just kept getting outperformed by cheaper, better competitors. So I couldn't, in good conscience, recommend them.</p><p>Now, if you were to tell me that, in 2024, I'd be recommending a Surface laptop, I'd say, "You're out of your mind!" But here I am, as a laptop expert, actually suggesting a Microsoft laptop to my readers. But you know what? I'm backing this up. <strong>I have proof </strong>that it's the best Windows laptop of the year. Here are my three reasons:</p><h3><strong>1. Microsoft Surface Laptop 7 has the best battery life I've ever seen</strong></h3><p>When I tested the Microsoft Surface Laptop 7 to see how long it could last on a single charge, it <strong><em>just. wouldn't. die.</em></strong></p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>To my surprise, the Surface Laptop 7 delivered a battery runtime of <strong>22 hours and 50 minutes.</strong> That's nearly 23 hours! This is literally unheard of for Windows laptops these days.</p><p>This is <strong>the best battery runtime</strong> we've ever recorded at Mashable in recent years. Here are some of the other runtimes of our laptops:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://mashable.com/review/m3-macbook-air-15-inch" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><strong>15-inch M3 MacBook Air</strong></a><strong> - 10 hours and 52 minutes</strong></p></li><li><p><a href="https://mashable.com/review/hp-omnibook-x" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><strong>HP OmniBook X</strong></a><strong> - 16 hours and 47 minutes</strong></p></li><li><p><a href="https://mashable.com/review/lenovo-yoga-9i-2-in-1-gen-9" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><strong>Lenovo Yoga 9 2-in-1</strong></a><strong> - 7 hours and 21 minutes</strong></p></li></ul><p>As you'll find out in the next section, the reason behind the Microsoft Surface Laptop 7's success with battery life is its new Qualcomm processor.

(<strong>Spoiler alert:</strong> It was an Intel chip.)</p><h3><strong>2. Microsoft Surface Laptop 7 performance beats all of its rivals, including the MacBook</strong></h3><p>I don't want to bore you with too many details about chipsets, but they're crucial to bring up to help you understand why Microsoft Surface family <em>finally</em> has positive critical reception from testers after a few tumultuous years.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Long story short, Intel, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1130315/worldwide-x86-intel-amd-laptop-market-share/#:~:text=Intel%20processors%20made%20up%2071,CPUs%20detected%20via%20the%20tests." target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">the most popular chipset maker for Windows</a>, was holding the Microsoft Surface series &mdash; and other mobile Windows machines &mdash; back from laptop nirvana. Even Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/3/17191986/apple-intel-cpu-processor-design-competition" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">stopped dealing with Intel a few years ago</a>. In 2020, Apple introduced its new in-house, custom ARM chips (i.e., M-series processors). After Apple debuted these chips in the M1 MacBook Air and M1 MacBook Pro four years ago, it never looked back. Why? They were a huge success, delivering unmatched battery life and performance. (Apple's current-gen MacBooks are now rocking M3 series chips and it's <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-every-mac-line-will-get-m4" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">reportedly eyeing an M4 release soon</a>).</p><p>Now, non-Apple vendors are finally hopping aboard the "Intel ain't it" train, too, thanks to Qualcomm, an Intel rival. Qualcomm announced it had a chipset, dubbed the Snapdragon X Elite processor, that is <em>so </em>good, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/cpu/qualcomm-claims-its-snapdragon-x-plus-is-an-m3-beater-but-it-is-really#:~:text=According%20to%20Qualcomm's%20benchmarks%20for,M3%20processor%2C%20another%20large%20boast." target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">it beats all M3-based MacBooks</a>. Now, I was skeptical, but this new Snapdragon X Elite processor was packed inside the new Microsoft Surface Laptop 7 that dropped this year &mdash; and it blew its rivals out of the water.</p><p>With "Best performance mode" turned on in Settings, the Surface Laptop 7 notched an <em>incredible</em> multi-core score of <strong>14,548</strong> on Geekbench 6. For context, here are the multi-core scores of other laptops I've tested this year:</p><ul><li><p><strong>14-inch M3 MacBook Pro - 11,998</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>15-inch M3 MacBook Air - 12,057</strong></p></li></ul><p>And yes, I purposely highlighted Apple's M3 MacBooks here to prove a point (i.e., Qualcomm was right). This wasn't just a fluke either. The <a href="https://mashable.com/review/hp-omnibook-x" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">HP OmniBook X</a> I reviewed this year, also packed with a Snapdragon X Elite chip, is almost as good as the Surface Laptop 7, but delivered a <em>slightly </em>lower multi-core score of <strong>13,888.</strong></p><h3><strong>3. Microsoft Surface Laptop 7 makes Windows fun again with AI</strong></h3><p>Remember when Windows used to be fun? As a kid (I'm now a Millennial adult for context), I used to mess around on Paint, play Microsoft 3D Pinball, and watch visualizers bounce along to the music I played on Windows Media Player.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>However, as a laptop reviewer, I know more than anyone that no machine is ever perfect. One flaw that I spotted with the Surface Laptop 7 is app incompatibility. It's something I discovered when I tried to install the Apple Music app. I typically have no issues with doing this on other Windows systems, but it looks like some developers haven't enabled Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite support for their apps yet.</p><p>The Surface Laptop 7 is not a gaming PC by any means (it lacks a discrete GPU), but I'll admit that you can get away with some <em>light </em>gaming on it. So keep in mind that some games, according to <a href="https://www.worksonwoa.com/games/?compatibility=Unplayable" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">this list</a>, may not run properly on the Surface Laptop 7.</p><p>Overall, though, the Surface Laptop 7 has never-ending battery life, engaging AI features, zippy performance, a sturdy, anti-fingerprint chassis, and more.

According to Gurman, the next-generation Apple Watch Ultra will <strong>not </strong>feature any significant design changes. Keep in mind that the Ultra line is relatively new, getting its debut in 2022.</p><p>Kuo also claims that Apple may add a new color of a darker hue to the Apple Watch 10, but the specific color is unclear.</p><p>Finally, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-08-13/apple-event-september-12-2023-apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-watch-x-later-ll9geb3n" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Gurman claims</a> that the Watch 10 will feature a new magnetic mechanism for bands, making it easier to swap them out for other styles.</p><h2><strong>Apple Watch 10 new features</strong></h2><p>According to Gurman, here are the following health tools that Apple has been working on for the Apple Watch:</p><ul><li><p><strong>blood-pressure monitor</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>sleep apnea sensor</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>glucose monitor</strong></p></li></ul><p>However, according to Gurman, the blood-pressure sensor has been hitting a couple of snags during testing.

<p>"There have been particular concerns about the blood-pressure feature working properly with the new Series 10 design," Gurman said. </p><p>So even if the new blood-pressure monitor <em>does </em>launch on the Apple Watch 10, it won't be a reliable alternative to the blood-pressure cuff. It's not supposed to give an actual reading. Instead, it will determine your baseline and determine whether your blood pressure is high based on that reference point.</p><p>The sleep apnea sensor, which depends on user's blood-oxygen levels, is also facing some challenges.

<p>If you're a big spender, you can get the iPhone 15 with 512GB of storage, which costs $1,100. But if you have enough money to spend on <em>that</em>, you'd be better off upgrading to the iPhone 15 Pro with 256GB of storage, which is <strong><em>exactly</em> </strong>the same price.</p><p>Speaking of the iPhone 15 Pro, it has a <a href="https://zdcs.link/OyRg2?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=starting%20price%20of%20%24999%20via%20Apple%27s%20official%20website&object_type=article&object_uuid=05pOpXtThV5P0vXJmxtgMrN&short_url=OyRg2&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">starting price of $999 via Apple's official website</a> and comes with the following specs:</p><ul><li><p><strong>128GB of storage</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>8GB of RAM</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>A17 Pro</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>6.1-inch display</strong></p></li></ul><p>The most expensive iPhone 15 Pro, packed with 1TB of storage, will set you back $1,500.

However, if you don't mind deleting a few stuff along the way, or you have cloud storage, the 128GB variant should be fine.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h2><strong>iPhone 15 vs. iPhone 15 Pro: design</strong></h2><p>Cue Sia singing "Titanium" at the top of her lungs. The iPhone 15 Pro's biggest selling point is that it consists of a titanium frame, making it lighter and more durable than its predecessor's stainless-steel finish.</p><p>The iPhone 15, wrapped in an aluminum enclosure, doesn't have a hint of titanium. <em>Womp, womp</em>! It is, however, a little lighter than its Pro sibling (6.03 ounces vs. 6.6 ounces).</p><p>As far as colors are concerned, I'd argue that the iPhone 15's colors are more fun and lively.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>They also have the same resolution: 2,256 x 1,179 pixels</p><p>Although the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro Max share the same screen size, they do <em>not </em>have the same display tech. For example, the iPhone 15 does <strong><em>not</em></strong><em> </em>have ProMotion technology nor does it have an Always-On display &mdash; but the Pro model has both of these perks.</p><p>What's ProMotion? It's just a fancy term for, "This phone has a variable refresh rate of up to 120Hz." In other words, the iPhone 15 Pro has a zippier display that adapts to your workflow. If you're simply scrolling through an article, the refresh rate will slowdown. However, if you fire up a fast-paced mobile game, the refresh rate will pick up. </p><p>Conversely, the iPhone 15 has a refresh rate of 60Hz, which will feel slower only if you've ever owned a phone with a refresh rate of 90Hz or higher. And for the uninitiated, an Aways-On display lets you get information like time, widgets, and more at a glance because &mdash; well &mdash; the screen is always on. I can't say the same for the iPhone 15.</p><p>Both have the snazzy <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-iphone-15-dynamic-island-standard" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Dynamic Island</a> featured at the top of the display, and plus, the duo can climb to a peak brightness of 2,000, according to Apple.</p><h2><strong>iPhone 15 vs. iPhone 15 Pro: cameras</strong></h2><p>Cameras are one of the biggest selling points smartphones, and as you might have guessed, the iPhone 15 Pro has an edge over the iPhone 15. Here's a break down of the camera specs:</p><h3><strong>iPhone 15</strong></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Wide camera - 48MP</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Ultrawide camera - 12MP</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Selfie camera - 12MP</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>No telephoto</strong></p></li></ul><h3><strong>iPhone 15 Pro</strong></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Wide camera - 48MP</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Ultrawide camera - 12MP</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Selfie camera - 12MP</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Telephoto - 3X optical zoom</strong></p></li></ul><p>Unlike the iPhone 15 Pro, the iPhone 15 does not have a telephoto lens, which means that zoomed-in shots will have a dip in quality. It's also worth nothing that the iPhone 15 Pro's ultrawide lens has a slightly wider aperture, which means low-light shots in dim environments should have a better outcome.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The Robot White Series X scraps a disc drive for the first time in Microsoft's flagship console, blurring the line between the Series X and the entry-level Series S. (You'll still get <a href="https://mashable.com/article/mircosoft-xbox-series-x-vs-s-differences" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">more power</a> out of a Series X, for what it's worth.) It's $50 cheaper than the standard black version that can play physical games, and it comes with a matching controller.</p><p>Meanwhile, the new 1TB Series S is just a new colorway; we've had a 1TB Carbon Black Series S since fall. Notably, that version appears to be getting phased out: Microsoft said in its <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/09/xbox-series-x-s-new-console-options/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">announcement</a> that "fans can still purchase [it] <em>while supplies last</em>" (emphasis mine), and seemingly just from third-party retailers.

There are so many different laptop lines under Lenovo &mdash; ThinkPad, ThinkBook, the Legion and LOQ gaming laptops, Yoga, IdeaPad &mdash; and I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to review all of the lines over the past few months.</p><p>But out of all the Lenovo laptops I've tested this year, these three laptops stood above the rest.</p><h3><strong>1. Lenovo Yoga Book 9i is a dual-screen productivity masterpiece</strong></h3><p>When I first unboxed the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/lenovo-yoga-book-9i" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Lenovo Yoga Book 9i</a>, I remember thinking, &ldquo;This is so cool, but I couldn&rsquo;t see myself buying it as a daily laptop.&rdquo; And man, I quickly proved myself wrong.

<p>After just a few weeks with this laptop, I was obsessed. With two stunning 2880 x 1800-pixel OLED panels, a surprisingly satisfying keyboard, and the included wireless mouse, I was more productive than I've ever been &mdash; it was like bringing my two-monitor desktop setup with me wherever I went.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>While this laptop&rsquo;s dual display greatness is my favorite feature, it wasn&rsquo;t the only feature that impressed me. The Yoga Book 9i is also equipped with a rotating Bowers &amp; Wilkins soundbar that had me listening to my favorite bassy tracks on repeat. Plus, the webcam takes incredibly detailed shots.</p><p>During my time with the Yoga Book 9i, it never got too hot nor noisy, and I didn&rsquo;t notice any lag while performing my daily work. That said, its Geekbench 6 multi-core score of <strong>8,642</strong> reflects middle-of-the-road performance and is worth noting.</p><p>There was one feature I wasn&rsquo;t crazy about when reviewing the Yoga Book 9i: its battery life. In our 1080p video test, it only lasted <strong>7 hours and 5 minutes</strong>, which is low even for a Windows laptop. That said, it does charge quickly &mdash; and if you&rsquo;re like me, there&rsquo;s rarely a moment where I&rsquo;m not next to an outlet, so I&rsquo;d still highly recommend this laptop despite its short battery life.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>Before diving into which hardware features I love about the Yoga 9i 2-in-1, let&rsquo;s talk price, because that&rsquo;s a huge driving factor behind my recommendation. At full price, this laptop is $1,449 &mdash; that&rsquo;s already a great deal. Right now, you can grab the Yoga 9i 2-in-1 for just <a href="https://zdcs.link/6XO5d?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=%241%2C099%20via%20Best%20Buy&object_type=article&object_uuid=03s0bUPtj3WwMWHesXupIwn&short_url=6XO5d&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>$1,099 via Best Buy</u></a>.</p><p>To help you understand why paying $1,099 for this laptop is insane, let me tell you what it brings to the table. The Yoga 9i 2-in-1 Gen 9 is decked out with a vivid 2.8K OLED display, a rotating Bowers &amp; Wilkins soundbar that provides full-bodied, delicious audio, a comfortably springy keyboard, and a flexible form factor that lets you flip between tablet, tent, and laptop modes.</p><p>This laptop is also equipped with one of Intel&rsquo;s new Core Ultra 7 155H chips, and it earned an impressive Geekbench 6 multi-core score of <strong>12,345</strong>. In practice, the laptop ran a bit hot and noisy under pressure, but nothing too major.</p><p>And like its close sibling above, the Yoga Book 9i, the Yoga 9i 2-in-1 doesn&rsquo;t have the best battery life. It only lasted <strong>7 hours and 21 minutes</strong> in our 1080p video test, but with double-sided USB Type-C ports and fast charging, it wasn&rsquo;t that big of a deal for me while testing.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>That lengthy battery life could be due to the laptop&rsquo;s Intel Core Ultra 155U CPU or its 1920 x 1200-pixel, low-power IPS display with a matte finish, or a combination of the two. Its display is reminiscent of a Kindle, which feels easy on the eyes during long work days.</p><p>I enjoyed the laptop&rsquo;s springy keyboard, smooth glass touchpad, surprisingly capable speakers hidden below the keyboard, and overall port variety &mdash; I love seeing HDMI ports and multiple USB Type-A ports on laptops. The ThinkPad X1 2-in-1 performs well, too, earning a Geekbench 6 multi-core score of <strong>9,420</strong>.</p><p>The only hangup I have with the ThinkPad X1 2-in-1 is its price. It&rsquo;s a business-forward laptop, but if you don&rsquo;t need 1TB of storage, you&rsquo;re paying a premium for this configuration.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/0281qPDuunihW8i5CmzxRry/hero-image.png" alt="Relaxing moments in Paris city - stock photo"><p>One of the most stressful parts of travel, especially when traveling internationally, is worrying about your cell phone data. Am I using too much? Will there be extra charges? Will I run out and be stranded? These are questions we&rsquo;ve all asked ourselves when roaming abroad &mdash; <a href="https://www.getnomad.app/?rfsn=8093646.79e136" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>which is where Nomad comes in</u></a>. Nomad provides data-only eSIM cards for reliable connectivity in 170 countries, giving you access to high-speed data for just pennies per gigabyte. Here&rsquo;s how:&nbsp;</p><h2>Democratizing data with global partnerships</h2><p>Nomad has dozens of global partners, allowing them to provide a reliable, high-quality connection to your mobile device and offer data that&rsquo;s up to 40 percent cheaper than other providers, depending on your destination. Nomad stands out of the crowd by working with multiple local providers whenever possible, allowing you to connect to another network if a connection is bad.</p><h2>Data you need, when and where you need it<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Nomad has a few plan options depending on your travel itinerary. The Regular Plan offers pre-purchased data by the gigabyte with up to 30 days to use it. A Day Plan lets you choose the length of your trip and the amount of high-speed GB per day. Once that allocation is up, you get unlimited data at 512kbps. You can even opt for a Regional Plan that covers multiple countries or worldwide. For example, <a href="https://www.getnomad.app/europe-eSIM?rfsn=8093646.79e136" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Nomad&rsquo;s Europe Regional Plan</a> gives you 10GB of data for just $18, that you can use as you travel through 35 countries, using a single eSIM to connect. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>"The attic in question and tell me why I just noticed the fucking black handprint I&rsquo;m SCREAMING," they wrote.</p><p>Rae confirmed in a later post that their husband has been up in the attic to have a look, but there's nothing there.</p><p>"For the handprint, the only explanation i can think of is that it&rsquo;s leftover from when we got a home inspection last year," Rae told Mashable. "We just purchased this house a little over a year ago. Neither my husband nor I have been up to the attic since we moved in, since we don&rsquo;t really have a lot of things to store. It&rsquo;s completely empty, aside from the insulation. Technically, this is the second time we have found the latch open without explanation. The first time, I admittedly thought my husband was just messing with me."</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Rae said the internet is convinced they have a phrogger &mdash; a person who secretly hides in another person's home. But Rae isn't so sure. "With all due respect, we live out in the middle of nowhere. You&rsquo;d be hard pressed to find anyone just wandering around out here in the sticks, especially with all the recent bear sightings in our town. And if it is truly a person, he&rsquo;d have to be pretty dumb to leave the latch open."&nbsp;</p><p>Rae said they haven't heard any noises coming from the attic, but that they sleep with ear plugs in anyway.</p><p>"My kid, on the other hand, mentioned that he heard banging above his bed. This was after the attic had already been closed up again."</p><p>As a last ditch effort to work out what's going on, they've now set up a camera in the garage.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>"I only set the camera up last night, so I&rsquo;m afraid that I don&rsquo;t have much in terms of updates. When these things happen, people are always eager for updates, but I think it&rsquo;s funny that the only way we would have an update is if something bad were to happen," Rae said.</p><p>"As for my son&hellip;he has mentioned the man multiple times, but it&rsquo;s hard to make sense of what he&rsquo;s saying. He doesn&rsquo;t watch horror movies and he&rsquo;s never out of our sight for long. I don&rsquo;t know where the idea of a man in the attic came from. He talks about his imaginary friends often, and it&rsquo;s hard to determine what&rsquo;s nonsense and what isn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s all unsettling nonetheless."</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The new imagery also revealed that the North star, which is part of a three-star system, is five times more massive than our medium-sized <a href="https://mashable.com/article/solar-flares-sun-active-why" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">sun</a>, and 46 times wider.</p><p>To capture this stellar view, six spaced-out telescopes atop the lofty array captured light from Polaris. In effect, this created a 330-meter (1,082-foot) telescope, which is needed to capture such extremely faint light. This light was ultimately fed to an instrument called the MIRC-X camera &mdash; which simultaneously combines the light from all six telescopes. </p><p>Polaris' behavior still largely remains a mystery. Solar scientists know it grows and shrinks over four-day cycles, but its spotted appearance may be tied to 120-day cycles. "We plan to continue imaging Polaris in the future," astronomer John Monnier, one of the study's coauthors, also said in a statement. "We hope to better understand the mechanism that generates the spots on the surface of Polaris."</p><p>Today, Polaris might be a dominant fixture in the night sky.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/roundups/00BdDICwGhjRxqh2xPyCmIj/hero-image.png" alt="woman in gym with a protein shake"><p>There's a little fitness secret that they don&rsquo;t always tell you at the gym: Muscles are made in the kitchen. Indeed, you could spend hours pumping away in the weights room, sweating it out in front of the mirror, but if your diet isn&rsquo;t up to scratch, you aren&rsquo;t going to get the results that you want. You'll be pumping iron for nothing. </p><p>Sorry guys, but that's just the way it works.</p><p>To work towards those fitness goals, take a closer look at the fuel you&rsquo;re consuming (i.e. what you&rsquo;re eating day-to-day). We definitely wouldn't recommend counting every gram going in and out, but doing something relatively simple like increasing your protein intake will <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-running-shoes-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">improve results</a>. You're guaranteed to see a difference.</p><p>Upping your protein may help keep <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-massage-guns-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">muscles healthy</a> and boost your muscle mass. You could load up on meat &mdash; and pack it into every meal &mdash; but that would be both expensive and boring. (Not to mention bad for the environment!) The most effective and affordable method of adding protein to your diet is with something called whey protein powder. Here&rsquo;s a quick need-to-know guide. </p><h2>What is whey protein powder?</h2><p>Whey protein is a byproduct of the cheese-making process. Whey is the watery bit of milk that separates from curds when cheese is made. We agree that it doesn&rsquo;t sound appetising but there's more on that issue below. Whey protein usually comes in the form of a powder &mdash; packages in flexible sachets or plastic tubs &mdash; and can be mixed with liquids to make milkshake or smoothie-like drinks that you can drink as part of a set daily routine, or before and after workouts.</p><h2>What are the benefits of whey protein powder?</h2><p>There&rsquo;s some debate about the exact health benefits of whey protein powders, but there's some evidence to suggest that adding protein powder to your workout routine boosts strength, muscle mass, and recovery. Other potential benefits include weight gain, faster healing properties, and combatting allergies. </p><h2>Are whey protein powders safe?</h2><p>Always check with your healthcare professional before you increase your protein intake significantly. There are a few risks for people with particular illnesses, so we recommend playing it safe before you invest. Once that is out of the way, there's nothing stopping you from mixing and maximising those muscles.</p><h2>Do whey protein powders come in different flavours?</h2><p>A "byproduct of cheese-making" sounds a bit sickly, yes. But supplement companies add flavours and sweeteners to their powders, while keeping calories and carbohydrates to a minimum. This ensures that it is both palatable and effective at doing what you want it to do &mdash; build muscle. Flavours include chocolate, banana, vanilla, and strawberry. What's not to like?</p><h2>What is the best protein powder?</h2><p>To help you pick the best product for your particular set of goals, we have researched all the top protein powders, and compared brands, prices, reviews, and much more. We've then condensed all of this information into a handy list, so that you can make an informed decision.</p><p>These are the best protein powders for 2024.</p>]]></content:encoded>

If this is all very new to you, you've probably got a lot of questions. Don't worry, because we can help. </p><p>We've done all the hard work for you and thoroughly researched these services to provide the information that matters to you. Here's everything you need to know about VPNs.</p><h2>What is a VPN?</h2><p>VPNs (or Virtual Private Networks) provide important protection for your data and identity when you're online. They offer this <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-for-anonymity-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">online privacy and anonymity</a> by creating a private network that hides your real IP address (digital location). This means that all of your activity is untraceable and secure. </p><p>Basically, you can think about VPNs as encrypted tunnels through which all of your online traffic passes through. Nobody can see into the tunnel, and everything inside the tunnel is protected against online threats like viruses, hackers, and malware.  </p><h2>Do you need a VPN?</h2><p>Any sort of activity on an unsecured WiFi network leaves your private information and browsing habits exposed to the world, unless you're using a VPN. There's no need to panic, because whether you're sending important emails, doing some online shopping, or paying essential bills, VPNs make sure that everything remains private and anonymous.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">
        <span class="font-bold text-primary-400">SEE ALSO:</span>

        </a>
    </div>
<p>First and foremost, VPNs are designed to provide online security, but there is another reason that millions of people use these services: streaming more content from around the world. By hiding your real IP address and connecting you to a server in another location, you can trick your favourite streaming services into thinking that you are based in a different country. This means that you can watch all of the shows and films from global libraries, like all the extra content on <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-netflix" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">U.S. Netflix</a>. This is the quickest and easiest way of boosting your content options, without the need to rely on a dodgy stream.</p><h2>What should you consider before subscribing to a VPN?</h2><p>There are plenty of things that you should consider when it comes to VPNs, but we don't have all day. Instead of listing off every feature offered by the <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-deals" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">best VPNs</a>, we have highlighted a selection of the most important things to think about.</p><p>Before you make any sort of decision, you should look out for connection speed, server network, number of logins, and more important features:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Bandwidth </strong>&mdash; There are some VPNs out there that place monthly caps on network bandwidth, meaning you can only download a certain amount of data. You should avoid these services, unless you're on a free trial. If you're paying for a VPN, you should be able to download and upload as much as you want.</p></li><li><p><strong>Connection speed </strong>&mdash; Using a VPN is going to produce a drop in your connection speed, but you shouldn't accept a significant drop that is going to result in buffering. Be sure to select a VPN that doesn't negatively impact your connection speed to the point that you can't watch a film or download a file without frustration.</p></li><li><p><strong>Encryption </strong>&mdash; There are different levels of encryption, and whilst it's important to take note of the grade provided by your VPN, the best options will all offer powerful protection for your data. You are likely to come across terms like "military-grade" and "enterprise-grade," which just means that you can rely on it to do its job.</p></li><li><p><strong>Number of connections </strong>&mdash;<strong> </strong>Some VPNs let you connect an unlimited number of devices with the same account. Others limit you to just a single device. You should look out for a service that offers multiple simultaneous connections, so you can stay protected on all your devices at the same time.</p></li><li><p><strong>Server network </strong>&mdash; The very best VPNs provide access to literally thousands of geographically diverse servers. It's useful if a VPN has a lot of servers in key locations, because you should always be able to find a stable and speedy connection for <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-streaming-movies-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">streaming</a>, shopping, or browsing anonymously. It's not a straightforward case of more is better, but it's always good to have options.</p></li><li><p><strong>Privacy policy </strong>&mdash; It's worth paying special attention to the data-handling, storage, and usage practices of the VPN you are planning on using. These practices should be laid out in a privacy policy, and if they aren't clear, it's best to avoid. Most VPNs require access to your IP address, online transactions, and browsing history, plus your personal details when you sign up. If privacy is the objective, it's absolutely essential that your VPN is not going to store these details. If it does, the whole thing is kind of pointless.</p></li></ul><p>There are other things to consider, like price and subscription plans, but these features are a good place to start.</p><h2>Should you use free VPNs?</h2><p>There are plenty of <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/deals/best-vpn-for-free" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">free versions</a> of popular VPNs, plus free trials of VPNs with full access to everything you get with a premium plan. So why would you ever pay for a VPN?</p><p>As with most things in life, you get what you pay for with VPNs. There tends to always be a catch with free versions, and it's normally in the form of limited data usage. If you're just an occasional user, these plans will work fine. But if you're going to be streaming or downloading, this isn't going to work. Free trials are a little bit different: they come with everything you get in a paid plan, but obviously they don't tend to last very long. Trials are great for testing out a service before committing, but this isn't a long-term solution. </p><p>What we're saying is that the best option for streaming securely and accessing the online world without restrictions is with a paid subscription to a VPN. To gain access to advanced security features without limitations on usage, you need to pay up. The best VPNs are generally the most expensive, but there are plenty of <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-cheap-vpn-services-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">cheap plans</a> out there, especially if you're willing to commit to a lengthy contract.</p><h2>What is the best VPN?</h2><p>There are a lot of VPN providers out there all offering different sets of features, with different pricing structures. We recommend taking some time to carefully access your options, and decide on what you really need from a VPN. Once you have established your priorities, you can check out this definitive list of the best VPNs this month.</p><p>We have tracked down everything on offer and lined up a selection of the very best VPNs for streaming, shopping, and everything else.

<p>In its first Paperwhite update since 2018, Amazon didn't stray too far from its previous efforts. Both the cheaper Paperwhite and the Signature Edition feature almost identical specs:</p><ul><li><p>6.8-inch display with 17 LEDs and 300ppi (up from 6 inches on the 2018 model)</p></li><li><p>New USB-C charging port with up to 10 hours of battery life on a full charge</p></li><li><p>Signature Edition supports wireless Qi charging</p></li><li><p>8GB storage on the base $139.99 model, 16GB for $149.99, and 32GB on the $189.99 Signature Edition</p></li><li><p>IPx8 waterproof rating, can be fully submerged</p></li></ul><p>Amazon managed to bump the screen size up by nearly a full inch without making huge weight sacrifices. At 205g (208g in the Signature Edition), it's only marginally heavier than the 182g model from three years ago, perhaps due to the dramatically thinner bezels around the screen</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>Better than books</h2><p>As I mentioned before, part of the reason I don't read as often as I should is that I'm lazy and prefer to lounge around with one hand free. Some actual books just don't accommodate that lifestyle due to their size and weight distribution. This Kindle Paperwhite is <em>just</em> heavy enough to not feel cheap and flimsy, without being a hindrance on the one-handed readers among us.</p><p>This is a fully touch-driven Kindle with no buttons for turning pages. A simple tap or swipe does the trick. Tapping the top of the screen while reading brings up a quick toolbar with options for going back to the home screen, changing font sizes and styles, and enabling a simple page-turn animation. Swiping down from the top pulls out another menu for turning on Bluetooth for listening to Audible audiobooks, adjusting screen brightness and warmth, and turning dark mode on or off. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Highlighting passages, looking up the definitions of words, and bookmarking pages are all here, too. All of those nifty features are secondary to reading books, however, and the excellent Paperwhite display makes that a delight. </p><p>Text is sharp even when holding the device right up to your face. The glare-free screen is immensely legible and pleasing to the eye in all kinds of lighting. I've read Frank Herbert's meandering epic <a href="https://mashable.com/article/dune-denis-villeneuve-book-vs-movie" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Dune</em></a> (what can I say, I've got sandworm fever) on the new Paperwhite both outdoors in the shining sun and indoors at night with the lights turned off. In both scenarios, it was as comfortable as reading off an actual page with a light shining on it. Even at high brightness, the screen didn't hurt my eyes, either. You can truly take the new Paperwhite with you <em>anywhere</em> and have a good time reading it.</p><p>I'd be remiss not to mention the small but important addition of a USB-C charging port. As we move further and further into a USB-C world, this is a godsend and was probably overdue, seeing as the how 2018 model didn't have it. It sits on the bottom of the device next to the power button, which is the only button you'll find here.</p><p>It should go without saying at this point that I loved everything about the new Kindle Paperwhite's physical design. This is an ideal e-reader for me once you actually have a book ready to go on the screen. Unfortunately, getting to that point can be somewhat troublesome.</p><h2>Slow and mostly steady</h2><p>Amazon doesn't set out to make iPad-level powerhouse tablets with the Kindle Paperwhite line. You use these devices to read or listen to books, and that's about it. Amazon promised better overall performance and responsiveness with the latest Paperwhite, and while my experience with it was mostly fine, I did run into a couple of technical blemishes.</p><p>Simply navigating the Kindle's straightforward menus is sometimes more of a chore than it needs to be because this screen was only designed to display still text. Scrolling up and down through lists of books or settings is jittery and slow rather than smooth like you would expect from almost any other touch-based device released in 2021. It's responsive enough that you can accomplish whatever you're trying to accomplish, be it searching for a new book or changing screen brightness, without too much hassle. But you won't have much fun doing it.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>I totally get that Amazon designs these Kindles to be <em>really good</em> for reading books at the expense of doing, well, anything else. The tremendous form factor and top-notch display outweigh these small performance hurdles for me because, again, I'm not expecting an <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-ipad-pro-13-inch-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">iPad</a> or even a <a href="https://mashable.com/review/amazon-fire-hd-8-plus-tablet" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Fire HD tablet</a> here. Even with those low expectations in mind, though, it still feels a little behind the times. </p><p>It doesn't help that, on one occasion, the Paperwhite froze and became completely unresponsive in the middle of reading <em>Dune</em>. I waited several minutes for it to un-jam itself and that didn't happen. Holding the power button down for 40 seconds or so hard reset the device and I was able to get back to reading after that, but still, I felt this needed to be noted.</p><p>Aside from that one anomalous freeze, performance on the Kindle Paperwhite was at least consistently at that a-little-too-slow level in my time with it. I respect consistency because at least I know what to expect. </p><p>One final aspect of the performance to note is battery life. Amazon rates the new Kindle Paperwhite for up to <em>10 weeks</em> of battery on a full charge. I only had the device for a little less than a week, so it was not possible for me to fully verify that. With that in mind, though, the battery drained by a mere 10 percent or so in that time frame. Maybe you won't get 10 weeks out of it if you read for hours every day, but it'll last a good, long while no matter how you shake it.</p><h2>Big jump to get rid of ads</h2><p>I can learn to live with the Kindle Paperwhite's laggy performance and even the odd lock-up every now and then. Everything else about actually using the device is largely excellent and actually got me, a person with severe attention span problems, to willingly sit down to read a dense sci-fi screed about religion and feudalism. The one thing that actually gives me pause in recommending it to people is the price.</p><p>At $140, I feel that the standard <a href="https://zdcs.link/plEGl?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=2021%20Kindle%20Paperwhite&object_type=review&object_uuid=06d50WrKklnWD1uZ9IpfHAm&short_url=plEGl&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">2021 Kindle Paperwhite</a> is maybe a little too pricey, but avid readers will get their money's worth. It's the Signature Edition, which bolts on an extra $50 for the privilege of not seeing ads, getting some extra storage space, and being able to have the Kindle automatically adjust brightness based on the light level in the room that bothers me. Tying storage and bonus features to a price hike is standard fare in tech, but the ad thing is just slimy. Doesn't Amazon make enough money already?</p><h2>Is the Kindle Paperwhite worth it?</h2><p>The good news is that these aren't your only Kindle options. The <a href="https://zdcs.link/3ymvw?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=entry-level%20Kindle&object_type=review&object_uuid=06d50WrKklnWD1uZ9IpfHAm&short_url=3ymvw&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">entry-level Kindle</a> is $99.99 and will probably do the job if all you want is a competent e-reader. If you can afford to pay extra for the Paperwhite, however, you won't regret it. This little book tablet's massive battery, gorgeous and versatile display, and maximal hand comfort made me enjoy reading more in the several days I spent with it than I had in several years prior. </p><p>And if you're as severely <em>Dune</em>-pilled as I am right now, this is much better than hauling around a massive book.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>After the successful lunar flyby, Juice will now venture by Earth on Aug. 20. </p><p>The spacecraft is shielded from the extreme radiation present around Jupiter, similar to <a href="https://mashable.com/category/nasa" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">NASA</a>'s Juno spacecraft. But Juice is bigger. It wields two large cross-shaped solar panels, the biggest ever built for an interplanetary mission, ESA explains. That's because solar radiation at distant Jupiter, which is on average 484 million miles from the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/sun-solar-ejection-nasa-footage" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">sun</a>, is 25 times weaker than on our planet.</p><p>"This makes JUICE the largest 'solar power plant' in the Solar System," ESA wrote. It's a whopping 71 feet (21.7 meters) wide.</p><p>The mission will scrutinize worlds like <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nasa-europa-flyby-moon-science" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Europa</a>, an ice-blanketed moon suspected to harbor a voluminous sea beneath its ice shell, as well as the large moons Ganymede and Callisto.

      <description><![CDATA[From Brandon Lee to Bill Skarsgård, and almost…Mark Wahlberg?]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/06pcZqk2t5CSfUTfjSH18j9/hero-image.jpg" alt="Brandon Lee as Eric Draven in 1994's "The Crow," and Bill Skarsgård as Eric Draven in 2024's "The Crow.""><p>It's been 30 years in the making, but <em>The Crow </em>has finally been rebooted. Despite many, many challenges along the way, this was inevitable.&nbsp;</p><p>In 1994, <em>The Crow</em> found roost in the hearts of movie fans, from goths clutching tattered copies of James O'Barr's graphic novels and those who stumbled across <a href="https://www.revolvermag.com/music/watch-mtv-alternative-nation-crow-special-featuring-nin-stp-and-more/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>the soundtrack's bands on MTV late at night</u></a> to action fans eager to see Bruce Lee's only son, Brandon Lee, in what should have been his big-screen hurrah. Lee's accidental death before the film was finished, caused by a prop gun shot during a crucial scene, only added to the tragic allure of the film and its rain-slick aesthetic.</p><p>Three sequels, with increasing levels of silliness, tried to gain momentum. (Iggy Pop shrieking, "Fuck you, bird dick!" during <em>The Crow: City of Angels</em> is a treasured college memory.) There was even a short-lived Canadian TV show, which seemed to be an urban fantasy hallucination along the lines of Ron Perlman's <em>Beauty and the Beast</em>, but, like, worse. You couldn't go to a goth club without seeing a guy wearing Eric Draven's maquillage until well into the 21st century. Even with these sequels' failings &mdash; ranging from from forgettable leading men and laughably bad storylines to exponentially dismal box office earnings &mdash; there was no way the powers that be wouldn't keep trying to recapitalize upon the fervor over the original.</p><p>Now, the same year Alex Proyas' original <em>Crow </em>celebrates its 30th anniversary, director Rupert Sanders resurrects Draven with a reboot. Bill Skarsg&aring;rd headlines, donning haute JNCOs and scrubby facial tattoos to woo British musician FKA twigs, the two of them lovers on the run from Satan himself. They are Eric and Shelly for a neo-noir by way of <em>Spring Breakers</em>. But how did we get here?&nbsp;</p><p>Trying to untangle the various proposed reboots &mdash; inevitably "gritty," inevitably starring the popular edgy actor du jour &mdash; is an exhausting Hollywood rabbit hole. But we're gonna do our best.</p><h2><em>The Crow </em>reboot buzz began with <em>Blade </em>and Nick Cave.</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

Norrington's genre bona fides are pretty tight; in addition to his critical and commercial success with <em>Blade</em> &mdash; Marvel's first big hit! &mdash; he learned special effects from industry pioneers Rick Baker, Stan Winston, and Dick Smith, who earned Oscars for their behind-the-scenes practical magic on movies like <em>An American Werewolf in London</em>, <em>Jurassic Park</em>, and the like.&nbsp;</p><p>Then <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jul/27/nick-cave-remake-crow" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Nick Cave himself</u></a> was brought on in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100730071202/https://www.thewrap.com/movies/column-post/exclusive-nick-cave-rewrite-crow-remake-19578" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>July 2010</u></a> to give Norrington's script a gothic gleam. (While we love and respect Nick Cave's current status as elder spooky statesman, penning advice columns and going to church, this was a different era of Bad Seed, and a movie based on nearly anything Cave wrote would have been hellishly good.)</p><p>Here's where things get tricky. The internet isn't actually forever, as we once thought; the sites that once posted casting news and rumors about <em>The Crow</em> have gone through redesigns, reboots, and relaunches that have done funky things to their archives or deleted them altogether. Google's prioritizing of paid search results, the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-ai-search-memes-mistakes" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>integration of AI</u></a>, and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/internet-doesnt-last-forever-link-rot-digital-decay" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>good old link rot</u></a> have made it almost impossible to find the original source for some of these rumors. It's like a game of Operator gone berserk. And honestly? Some of the actors whose names were attached to the reboot are so random that I'm skeptical they were much more than fancasting.</p><h2>Mark Wahlberg was an early contender for <em>The Crow </em>reboot.&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

Norrington even said, "I will say I think Wahlberg could be cool if they take a gritty blue-collar approach&hellip; He's a truthful actor. I think he could really ground the supernatural stuff."&nbsp;</p><p>However, Wahlberg distanced himself from the project, telling the long-defunct Cinematical (via <a href="https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/wahlberg-running-crow/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Empire</u></em></a>) in November 2010,<em> </em>"We never committed to making the movie&hellip;They talked to me about it and there was a director attached who I was a fan of, and he's no longer doing it.

In every interview people ask me about this. This is something all directors in Hollywood usually do. Maybe my projects are more famous or something. But it is the normal thing to do &mdash; to deal with five, six projects at the same time. Because you never know which one is going to be the proper one at the end. It&rsquo;s something you have to do. The crazy thing is that you develop something and then all the newspapers are reacting."</p><h2>Jason Momoa, Channing Tatum, Ryan Gosling, and Tom Hiddleston were rumored for <em>The Crow.&nbsp;</em></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>But storage isn&rsquo;t all Koofr has to offer. Their Duplicate Finder tool is a lifesaver for anyone who&rsquo;s ever wasted time searching for that one file buried under duplicates.

If you're ready to upgrade your flying experience, picking up a pair of noise-cancelling headphones can go a long way.</p><p>You definitely have options: plenty of <a href="https://mashable.com/category/headphones" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">headphones</a>, from over-ear headphones to <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-wireless-earbuds" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">wireless earbuds</a>, offer active noise cancellation. And in 2024, it's not too hard to find ANC headphones that cost under $100. That said, we do recommend spending a little more to enjoy maximum calm at 35,000 feet, which is why we've tested and vetted the best headphones for travel.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>How much should I spend on noise-cancelling headphones?</h2><p>If you want to find the best noise-cancelling headphones for flying, you should be prepared to pay $250 to $500. Premium headphones offer improved active noise cancellation, customizable settings, and transparency modes that allow you to hear those all-important gate announcements. </p><p>Many <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-headphones-under-100" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">cheap headphones</a> claim to offer "noise-cancelling" features, but a random pair of $40 over-ear headphones won't compare to the top Sony noise-cancellers. Typically, the more you pay and the better regarded the brand, the better the noise cancellation.

They're definitely an investment, but we think the Ultras are worth it (especially when they're on sale) thanks to their long-term wearability and strong noise cancellation. </p><h3>Why we picked this: </h3><p>Lead Shopping Reporter Bethany Allard here. Personally, I've owned, used, and loved Bose QuietComfort headphones for years. (I previously tested the QC 35 IIs and the QC 45s, both standouts in the field of ANC headphones.) But, with the Ultras, I feel like Bose really stepped up the QuietComfort line. They're durable but still supremely comfortable. I've worn them with earrings all day and on a five-hour flight while wearing glasses, and not once did I experience any soreness or discomfort.</p><p><a href="https://mashable.com/review/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Shopping Reporter Sam Mangino</a> also tried out the headphones, and she had a similar experience, calling the Ultras "the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn." Beyond comfort, they offer good noise cancellation, which is key for flying. Mangino was less impressed than I was, noting that "while the noise cancellation is really good at blocking out low-pitched noises, it can't wholly block high-pitched sounds unless you turn up the sound to unhealthy volumes." When I wore them on a flight, they significantly reduced the hum of the airplane's engine and my fellow passengers, but I agree that they do best with lower pitches. They certainly block sound better than past QuietComfort models. </p><p>Sound-wise, Mangino nailed it when she described it as "rich" and able to allow the little details shine. Bose's first pass at spatial audio is fine, but we think the standard settings are good enough. However, the on-ear controls of these headphones could definitely use some work. They didn't reliably turn on, and we had to resort to alternating short and long presses for them to power up and connect to our devices. Their multipoint connection can also be spotty with two devices connected, but this is likely to be less noticeable on a flight. </p><p>The lack of passive playback with a wired connection was noticeable, however. Thankfully, these have a decent battery life that should be enough to get you through wired and wireless listening. Another travel bonus: The earcups fold in, allowing the headphones to take up less space in your bag. That also gives them an edge compared to the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/sony-wh-1000xm5-headphones" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Sony WH-1000XM5s</a>, which can only lie flat.</p><p><strong><em>Battery life: </em></strong><em>24 hours </em>| <strong><em>App-connected:</em> </strong><em>Yes</em></p><hr><h2>Budget pick: Anker Soundcore Life Q20</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3>Who it's for: </h3><p>While having active noise cancellation at the ready while traveling might sound great, spending hundreds of dollars sounds decidedly less so. (Airline tickets <a href="https://mashable.com/article/internet-tips-tricks-cheap-flight-fares" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">are expensive enough</a>, thank you.) If you're not looking for the most elite ANC, sound, or build quality, the Anker Soundcore Life Q20s don't break the bank. And while they may not have more premium features, we found they wore comfortably and got the job done.</p><h3>Why we picked this: </h3><p>The Life Q20s are a fraction of the price of the other headphones on our list, but their merits go far beyond their budget status. The cushioned ear pads make them easy to wear comfortably for the length of a long flight. The active noise cancellation is strong enough to block out ambient airplane sounds, and the battery life is also impressive. It took us several days of use to run it down listening at about 50 percent volume &mdash; and that was <em>with</em> noise-cancelling engaged. </p><p>Plus, unlike higher-end headphones in this guide (namely, the Bose QC Ultras), these headphones support passive playback via a 3.5 millimeter aux cable. In other words, if you do happen to run out of battery on your flight, you're not completely out of luck. As for the actual listening experience, these headphones provide a surprisingly well-balanced sound, but if you don't like how they sound out of the box, you are unfortunately out of luck. Part of the reason they clock in at such a good price (and even more so <a href="https://mashable.com/article/jan-29-soundcore-life-q20-headphones-deal" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">when they're on sale</a>) is because these headphones are an older model, so they're not compatible with the Soundcore app and its equalizer features. Overall, these headphones epitomize the word decent &mdash; but that's not a knock against them at all. </p><p><strong><em>Battery life: </em></strong><em>40 hours </em>| <strong><em>App-connected:</em> </strong><em>No</em></p><hr><h2>Best earbuds for travel: Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

If you like to lean against the window to nap during flights or just need a lower-profile set of headphones so you can travel a bit lighter, the QC Ultra buds are the way to go. They're also a cool $130 less than our top pick, making them easier on the wallet.</p><h3>Why we picked this:</h3><p>The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds were just released in October 2023, and they've already snagged a <a href="https://mashable.com/mashable-choice" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Mashable Choice award</a> for their stellar noise cancellation, comfortable fit, and impressive Immersive Audio tech. Per usual for the brand, Bose's ANC drowns out a ton of background noise, making these buds a perfect fit for flights. In his <a href="https://mashable.com/review/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">review of the QC Ultra buds</a>, Mashable contributor Timothy Beck Werth mentioned that Bose's noise cancellation is so good that he often wears these buds even when he's not playing music. </p><p>"When I want to take a nap on a plane or focus on my work, I pop in these earbuds and let the noise-cancelling cocoon wash over me," Werth says. "Do they offer 100 percent sound dilution? No, but all but the loudest and closest sounds should disappear. On airplanes, they significantly reduced noise, making it much easier to take a nap. I have to warn my partner when I'm putting on these earbuds, otherwise she'll think I'm giving her the silent treatment."</p><p>In terms of complaints, we noticed that the design of the case makes it a bit difficult to remove the buds. We also experienced some finicky Bluetooth connection during long-term testing, but these are minor qualms &mdash; the pros of the QC Ultra buds absolutely outweigh the cons. </p><p><strong><em>Battery life:</em></strong><em> Six hours (Up to 24 with charging case) </em>| <strong><em>App connected: </em></strong><em>Yes</em></p><hr><h2>Best sound quality: Sony WH-1000XM5</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

Though they're not an essential upgrade for those who already own the ultra-popular WH-1000XM4s, the improved noise cancellation and fuller sound make these the stronger pick for airplane travel in 2024.</p><p>While the ANC is solid, it's not a standout among other high-end noise-cancelling headphones. However, they still pack impressive noise cancellation and stellar audio quality for music. Considering noise cancellation is most effective in tandem with music, these headphones should appeal to music lovers and audiophiles. In her <a href="https://mashable.com/review/sony-wh-1000xm5-headphones" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">review of the Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones</a>, Mashable's Deputy Shopping and Reviews Editor Miller Kern said the XM5s were "probably the best-sounding headphones I&rsquo;ve ever tried," making them a great pick for folks who take pride in their Spotify playlists.</p><h3>Why we picked this: </h3><p>Besides sounding amazing, they offer exceptional travel functionality with the "quick attention" mode, activated simply by covering your right ear cup, allowing you to hear gate change announcements and flight attendants without completely stopping your music. Voice assistant support, crisp call quality, and a great battery life of up to 30 hours complete the package.</p><p>Though they look great, the biggest drawback is that these headphones don't fold up, and the carrying case is quite tall, though slim. For obvious reasons, that's not ideal for travel. Still, if premium sound quality is more important than portability, they're not <em>that</em> much bulkier than other headphones on this list (and they're still more travel-friendly than the AirPods Max). We also appreciate that, unlike the Bose QC Ultras, they support passive playback and generally have a less finicky time connecting via Bluetooth or with multiple devices.</p><p><strong><em>Battery life: </em></strong><em>30 hours </em>| <strong><em>App-connected:</em> </strong><em>Yes</em></p><hr><h2>Best for Apple loyalists: Apple AirPods Max</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

Plus, the noise cancelling is pretty great. You can still find these headphones on sale these days, but since they're also rumored to <a href="https://mashable.com/article/new-apple-airpods-max-rumor" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">get an upgrade later this year</a>, anyone who's not already a diehard Apple fan will probably want to skip these.</p><h3>Why we picked this: </h3><p>The AirPods Max aren't just a pretty pair of headphones. With the help of eight microphones, these headphones provide excellent active noise cancellation. Switching into transparency mode happens with the push of a button, so there's no messing with finicky touch controls to hear what's going on around you. In addition to ANC, they have fantastic sound quality, and support for spatial audio will make cinephiles happy.</p><p>Their battery life, however, is a bit lacking compared to similarly priced headphones, thanks to the fact that they have no power button. (They're also missing a headphone jack, so a Bluetooth adapter will be a must if you like to enjoy in-flight entertainment). They will go into a low-power mode, but you can never completely turn them off. However, this does allow for easy switching in between devices, and for the "Find My" feature to always work. Plus, 20 hours of battery isn't bad, as that should last for even the most long-haul flights. In a pinch, five minutes of a charge can get you an hour and a half of battery life. </p><p>The carrying case is unfortunately, as former Mashable Tech Reporter Brenda Stoylar <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-airpods-max-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">wrote in her review</a>, "possibly the dumbest thing Apple has ever designed," so these headphones are probably best for people who don't mind wearing them around their neck for the entirety of their trip. </p><p><strong><em>Battery life: </em></strong><em>20 hours </em>| <strong><em>App-connected:</em> </strong><em>Yes</em></p><hr><h2>Best earbuds for Apple users: Apple AirPods Pro</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3>Who it's for: </h3><p>Just because you don't have a ton of cash to spend doesn't mean you should try to fly without <em>any</em> noise cancellation. The Anker Soundcore Life P3i earbuds won't change your life, but they'll do a good enough job to give you a little more peace while you're up in the clouds.</p><h3>Why we picked this:</h3><p>Budget headphones can often reveal their price tag through their performance, but we're not surprised that the same folks behind our cheap headphone pick delivered in the earbuds category as well. The Life P3i earbuds are some of our <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-budget-wireless-earbuds" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">favorite budget earbuds</a> in general, offering impressive sound for their price tag, including an app that lets you choose between 21 EQ presets (we prefer Treble Booster). Anker could've stopped there and likely made these buds worth it, but they also have a battery life that outdoes the AirPods Pro and customizable touch controls for each earbud. </p><p>So what's the trade off? Well, these earbuds not only have zero multipoint connection, but you'll need to manually disconnect them from one device before reconnecting to another. If you're primarily using these on planes, that shouldn't be too much of an issue. They also have one other major flaw: The ANC does have some hiss to it. If that's not a dealbreaker for you (and it shouldn't be at this price point), then these buds offer surprisingly good value.</p><p><strong><em>Battery life: </em></strong><em>7 hours with ANC, 8.5 without (36 hours with charging case)<strong> </strong></em><em> </em>| <strong><em>App-connected:</em> </strong><em>Yes</em></p><hr><h2>How we test noise-cancelling headphones for flying</h2><p>All seven of these headphones were hands-on tested by Mashable editors and writers, including past and current tech reporters, senior tech editors, as well as shopping reporters and editors. All of these headphones were chosen with the following criteria in mind: </p><ul><li><p><strong>Comfort: </strong>As we mentioned above, active noise cancellation becomes much less enjoyable if the headphones delivering it squeeze your head for the entirety of your flight. Any headphones that weren't favored for long-term wear didn't make our list. </p></li><li><p><strong>Battery life: </strong>If your headphones' battery is going to die 30 minutes into your flight, they're not going to cut it for even the shortest of trips. Our picks were typically in a higher price range that have better battery life and quick charge options for the times when you forget to juice up your headphones the night before you leave. </p></li><li><p><strong>Active noise cancellation quality: </strong>There are lower cost options for ANC, but not all active noise cancellation is delivered the same. That's why we focused on picks that either offered multiple levels of ANC, or delivered a strong level of ANC on its own, that didn't require music to make a noticeable difference.</p></li><li><p><strong>Portability: </strong>Over-the-ear headphones are going to deliver the best noise cancellation possible, but they are bulky. To keep these picks travel-friendly, we looked for headphones that fold up or that come with sleek carrying cases. </p></li><li><p><strong>Durability: </strong>Taking your headphones with you through TSA lines just opens them up to more wear and tear, so we went for higher-cost picks that are likely to survive the journey. Plus, we made sure to choose headphones that will last you for years, so the upfront investment is worth it.</p></li></ul><h3>Recent testing updates</h3><p>As of Aug. 2024, the <strong>Bose 700 headphones</strong> are no longer our pick for the best adjustable ANC headphones, as they're no longer on store shelves after being discontinued nearly a year ago. At the time of writing, we don't have a replacement as many headphones do not offer levels of adjustable ANC like the 700s did. RIP. </p><p>Also in August, we're keeping our eyes on new releases, including the new <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-preorder" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><strong>Google Pixel Buds Pro 2</strong></a><strong> </strong>and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/dyson-ontrac-headphones-release-preorder" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><strong>Dyson OnTrac</strong></a> headphones. We'll be updating our recommendations once we have a chance to test both products.</p><p>In June 2024, we also phased out the <strong>Bose QuietComfort 45</strong> headphones from our recommendations. We knew they were being discontinued, but as of this writing you can no longer find them on virtual store shelves. We'll be testing out the newer <a href="https://zdcs.link/b1MRe?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Bose%20QuietComfort%20headphones&object_type=article&object_uuid=00zGDldyIRhJy5qXqF4eGmR&short_url=b1MRe&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Bose QuietComfort headphones</a> to see if they're a worthy replacement.</p><p>In May 2024, we tested out the <strong>Bowers &amp; Wilkins Px7 S2e </strong>headphones. Though we were wowed by their high-end design and impressive sound profile out-of-the-box, we felt only middling about their active noise cancellation and noticed that their Bluetooth connection wasn't stable when paired to more than one device. For $399 headphones, we expect better on both these fronts, which is why we opted not to include them in this roundup, and would instead recommend the Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones for a blend of excellent sound and ANC.</p><p>In April 2024, we added the <strong>Anker Soundcore Life Q20 </strong>headphones into our lineup of hands-on tested products. (Prior to this update, we recommended them based on research and customer reviews.) We've also recently added the <strong>Anker Soundcore Life P3i</strong> earbuds as a budget option for those who prefer not to use over-ear headphones.</p><p>Other more recent additions include the <strong>Bose QuietComfort Ultra</strong> headphones, which we added in Nov. 2023. As of Feb. 2024, we tested the <strong>Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds </strong>and the <strong>JBL Tour One M2 </strong>headphones, and added the former. The JBL headphones didn't make the cut even though we liked their long battery life, comfort, and surprisingly functional multipoint pairing &mdash; we just didn't think the $300 price tag matched up to the quality of the active noise cancellation. It wasn't bad, but it didn't wow us, and if you're willing to spend that much, we'd recommend going with Bose headphones instead.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/reviews/064RTNerE71BA4q4o5u3AEq/hero-image.png" alt="kindle with book cover sitting on table"><p>I&rsquo;ve been a lover of <a href="https://mashable.com/category/books" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">books</a> for as long as I can remember. Junie B. Jones was my icon in kindergarten, helping me develop both my vocabulary and my backsass. Even still, my book collection is expansive and my greatest ambition is to one day have an entire library with one of those sliding ladders (assuming I eventually have the funds to buy my own house). Regardless, I buy books almost as often as I buy clothes, but surprisingly have never used an e-reader of any kind. Paper copies have always had so much value to me, and I never thought a screen would be able to beat it. After reviewing <a href="https://zdcs.link/0p2Aw?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Amazon%E2%80%99s%20latest%20Kindle&object_type=review&object_uuid=064RTNerE71BA4q4o5u3AEq&short_url=0p2Aw&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Amazon&rsquo;s latest Kindle</a>, I can say that there are a lot of perks that come along with the device, such as reading in the dark (and one-handed) with no problem. For only $100, I now consider it a fantastic addition to my ever-growing library, not its replacement.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://zdcs.link/0p2Aw?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=base%20Kindle%20model&object_type=review&object_uuid=064RTNerE71BA4q4o5u3AEq&short_url=0p2Aw&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">base Kindle model</a> is small, lightweight, and comes with double the storage of the previous version. It also has the longest battery life of any model, claiming to last up to six weeks. The image resolution is 300ppi, the same as the Kindle Paperwhite, but for a fraction of the cost. The 2022 release is the 11th generation of the basic Kindle model, and has some differences compared to the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/amazon-kindle-2019-e-reader" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">10th generation</a> released in 2019.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2>Kindle (2022) price and specs</h2><p>As I mentioned, the standard Kindle retails for $99.99, though we usually see that price drop for <a href="https://mashable.com/category/prime-day" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Prime Day</a> and Black Friday. If you want to get rid of lockscreen ads, the price bumps up to $119.99. Here's what the Kindle is working with in terms of specs:</p><ul><li><p>6-inch glare-free display</p></li><li><p>16GB of storage</p></li><li><p>USB-C charging port</p></li><li><p>Up to six weeks of battery life</p></li><li><p>Weight: 5.56 ounces</p></li><li><p>Dimensions: 6.2 x 4.3 x 0.32 inches</p></li></ul><h2>Phone setup isn&rsquo;t that simple&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>The Kindle was relatively easy to set up. All I had to do was press the power button until the screen lit up, and then the device prompted me to select a language and region. It then gave the option to set up on the Kindle device or my phone via the Kindle app. At first, my phone wouldn&rsquo;t connect to the Kindle, but after I plugged my phone into the charger, it worked fine. My phone then made sure it was on the same WiFi network as the Kindle and my <a href="https://mashable.com/category/amazon" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Amazon</a> account was transferred to the Kindle. There&rsquo;s a &ldquo;kid-friendly&rdquo; setting, which seems like a good option for parents to have during setup. After that, my library immediately popped up on the device and the Kindle ran me through a quick user tutorial. I also reset the device and tried the &ldquo;set up on Kindle&rdquo; option, which actually took less time because all you had to do was login to Amazon versus going through extra steps using your phone.&nbsp;</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>An elevated reading experience&nbsp;</h2><p>As soon as I finished setting up, I downloaded Jeannette McCurdy&rsquo;s memoir <em>I&rsquo;m Glad My Mom Died</em>. It&rsquo;s been in the top 10 for weeks and consequently, on backorder as well. I knew that with the Kindle, I could read it without having to wait or search for it in a store. To download the book, all I had to do was click on the Kindle Store icon and search for it. Then, since my Amazon account is already linked to the device, I just clicked &ldquo;buy&rdquo; and downloaded it to my library and began reading. The download was super fast, and I started reading before the download was even finished.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>I must admit, I was glued to the couch reading for the next few hours. Even when I was ready for bed, I took the Kindle with me and kept reading. At night, the light in my room is a pink LED lamp, which provides very little light for reading books. Normally, my eyes strain too much to read in there for a long time, but the light of the Kindle made it easy. I adjusted the brightness and switched to night mode, feeling virtually no eye strain after hours (seriously, I could not put this book down). You can feel from using it in low light how much better it is for your eyes than your phone, which <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8631113/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>can cause major eye strain from blue light</u></a>.</p><p>While reading a book on the Kindle, there will be a percentage at the bottom of the page that indicates how far along in the book you are. For some reason, I think this motivates me to keep reading. It goes up one percentage every few pages or so (depending on the book) and it just made me want to keep going. If I was at 72 percent, I would think <em>OK, I&rsquo;ll put it down at 75 percent</em>. You know how some people need the TV volume to be an even number or an increment of five? Same vibe. Currently, I am on my third Kindle read. I also read Drew Barrymore&rsquo;s memoir <em>Wildflower</em> and am almost finished with the best-selling fantasy novel <em>A Court of Thorns and Roses</em> by Sarah J. Mass.&nbsp;</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>What makes this Kindle the best Bezos has to offer?&nbsp;</h2><p>Compared to the previous versions of Kindle, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/0p2Aw?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=2022%20release&object_type=review&object_uuid=064RTNerE71BA4q4o5u3AEq&short_url=0p2Aw&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">2022 release</a> is the smallest and most lightweight model yet. At only 158 grams, it weighs less than my iPhone, so I am able to read one-handed for a pretty long period of time without any discomfort. Also, the screen measures six inches diagonally, making it the smallest screen available for a Kindle. I really like the size of the device &mdash; it&rsquo;s super easy to carry around and fits in a lot of my smaller purses.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The resolution of the 2022 Kindle screen is 300ppi, while the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/amazon-kindle-2019-e-reader" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">2019 Kindle model</a> only has a resolution of 167ppi. Book covers and pictures appear very clearly, but keep in mind they are always black and white to keep up the &ldquo;paper and ink&rdquo; aesthetic. Not great for books that are mostly photos. It also comes with 16GB of storage instead of 8GB, letting you download way more to your library at a time. So far, I have five or six books downloaded to my library and haven&rsquo;t run into any storage issues. I&rsquo;m interested to see how many books I can have downloaded at a time (it's supposedly thousands). The battery of this device does last for a while. Fully charged, I read two and a half books over the course of three weeks or so before the device reached 10 percent battery and prompted me to charge. I think Amazon&rsquo;s &ldquo;six weeks of battery&rdquo; claim is a bit of a stretch, because it obviously depends how much you&rsquo;re reading. Three weeks is still a long time for how much I was using it.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2>She&rsquo;s even Earth-friendly</h2><p>I&rsquo;m pretty proud of Amazon for this one. The website states that the new model is made with 90 percent recycled magnesium. It&rsquo;s also made with 75 percent recycled plastics for the black model and 30 percent recycled plastics for the denim model. It comes in 100 percent recyclable packaging, which lessens plastic waste. Amazon actually has a whole program dedicated to recycling old Kindle models, and they will offer you Amazon gift cards and discounts on a new Kindle device in exchange. For a company that has a large carbon footprint, it&rsquo;s nice that they&rsquo;re using old materials to make new Kindles, as well as giving customers incentives to return their old ones.</p><h2>Why do e-books have to cost so much?&nbsp;</h2><p>Amazon offers <a href="https://zdcs.link/NbAdG?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Kindle%20Unlimited&object_type=review&object_uuid=064RTNerE71BA4q4o5u3AEq&short_url=NbAdG&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Kindle Unlimited</a>, which is $11.99 a month for access to more than 3 million book titles on Kindle. New Kindle users can get a three-month free trial of the service. However, nothing I had been gunning to read was available through Kindle Unlimited. There were a few from some authors I knew, but it seems like the Kindle Unlimited selection is for people who are okay with reading whatever. I am not that person. I have a list of the next 15 books I want to read on deck at all times. I wish more than anything that Amazon had some type of deal where you could buy the printed and Kindle versions bundled together. That way, I could own the printed version while still using the Kindle for nighttime reading or traveling. My book collecting habits are against me on this one. I&rsquo;m not going to spend $15 on a Kindle copy of a book that I already own on paper.&nbsp;</p><h2>Is the Amazon Kindle worth it?&nbsp;</h2><p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a basic e-reader, this one has everything you could need. While some of Amazon&rsquo;s other releases, like the <a href="https://zdcs.link/bYgOe?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Kindle%20Scribe&object_type=review&object_uuid=064RTNerE71BA4q4o5u3AEq&short_url=bYgOe&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Kindle Scribe</a> or <a href="https://zdcs.link/K26Aj?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Kindle%20Oasis&object_type=review&object_uuid=064RTNerE71BA4q4o5u3AEq&short_url=K26Aj&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Kindle Oasis</a>, come with bells and whistles, they cater to a specific audience.

It&rsquo;s only $10 more than the previous version of the basic Kindle and comes with way more storage, battery life, and pixel resolution. This review is coming from the perspective of someone who has never owned an e-reader, so I&rsquo;m not sure how worth it these upgrades are for someone who owns an earlier version. If you are a book fanatic like me, I highly recommend adding it to your collection. For only $99, it has genuinely made me read more than I have in months.&nbsp;</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h2>A thoroughly great e-reader</h2><p>My colleague Alex Perry reviewed the regular <a href="https://mashable.com/review/kindle-paperwhite-2021-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">fifth-gen Paperwhite</a>, but here are my basic impressions (coming from someone whose primary e-reader before now was a second-gen Paperwhite).</p><p>The new Kindle Paperwhite is just the right size and sat perfectly in my hand. It's also beach-ready, with an IPX8 rating, which is a big deal to me, especially when compared to my <a href="https://mashable.com/review/ipad-mini-gen-6-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">iPad mini</a>, which officially isn't water-resistant at all. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>I have only one beef with the device's design, and that's the fact that Amazon moved the power button to the bottom from the top, which took some getting used to. (It's worth noting that this change happened on a previous iteration of the Paperwhite.)</p><p>The new Paperwhite is a lot faster than my old model, but it could be faster still, especially when browsing through menus. The battery lasts forever, and having a USB-C port instead of the old microUSB connector is a blessing.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>One thing you won't get on this Kindle is ads. Compared to ads on certain other devices, advertisements on the Kindle's homescreen aren't nearly as intrusive, but I still prefer zero ads on something I paid for. You can remove the ads from the base model Kindle for an extra $20, but then the price difference between the two is a mere $20, which means you should really look at the other extras you get with the Signature Edition. </p><p>You know what they say about memory: More is always better. That said, unless you're a voracious reader, or you constantly send a bunch of periodicals to your Kindle, you won't need more than 8GB. <a href="https://zdcs.link/ZD34M?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=The%20Kindle%20Paperwhite%20SE&object_type=review&object_uuid=03Ozd6oIKkwasAUWeAiiqtD&short_url=ZD34M&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">The Kindle Paperwhite SE</a> has 32GB, which is overkill, but it is comforting to know you'll never have to worry about storage. </p><p>When this review was originally published, the Kindle Paperwhite cost $139.99 for 8GB of storage. That configuration is no longer offered, and the current base model includes 16GB for $149.99. So, there's an even smaller price gap between the standard model and Signature Edition now at $40 compared to the previous $50, making these bonus features even more worth the upgrade.</p><p>Whether wireless charging will be worth it for you depends entirely on whether you normally use it in other scenarios. All Kindles have great battery life, so you won't be charging them very often. I do have wireless chargers in my car and scattered all around the house, so the ability to just toss the Kindle onto them and have it charge is a nice, if marginal, improvement. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Fun fact: I tried to charge the Kindle Paperwhite SE using Apple's MagSafe magnetic charger for the iPhone, and not only does it work, but the charger sticks (though just barely) to the Kindle like it does to the iPhone. Pretty great.</p><h2>The display, automated</h2><p>The last big improvement on the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition is the display. </p><p>The 6.8-inch, 300ppi display is sharp, crisp, beautiful to look at, and won't tire your eyes even after long reading sessions. The bezels on the sides and top of device are far smaller than on the previous iteration, but there's still enough room to rest your fingers without accidentally flipping the page. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

    </div>
<p>Now for the big difference between the regular and the SE version of the Paperwhite: Automatically adjusting front light. The best way to explain the importance of this feature is to think of smartphones: Literally every single modern smartphone has this feature. You don't think about it much, but if someone took the feature away, you'd definitely notice. </p><p>It's similar on the Paperwhite. The display automatically sets brightness depending on the amount of light in your environment. I like reading in very dim light, and the Kindle set the screen's brightness pretty much as I would do. The device supports dark mode (bright text on dark background), and if I switched to that, it readjusted the brightness accordingly. I love the feature and though I could live without it, I'd be slightly annoyed about having to adjust brightness manually again. </p><h2>Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition battery life</h2><p>A single charge should have the Kindle Paperwhite lasting up to 10 weeks. While we didn't run the e-reader for 10 weeks until it died, we can say it had excellent battery life based on our usage.</p><h2>Is the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition worth it?</h2><p>This may be because I'm biased from reviewing <a href="https://mashable.com/review/iphone-13-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple devices</a> &mdash; Apple charges an arm and a leg for upgrades and extra features &mdash; but I feel like the <a href="https://zdcs.link/ZD34M?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Kindle%20Paperwhite%20Signature%20Edition&object_type=review&object_uuid=03Ozd6oIKkwasAUWeAiiqtD&short_url=ZD34M&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition</a> is worth it.</p><p>For $50, you get no ads (a $20 value), wireless charging, 32GB, and an improved display. None of it is essential, but it does feel like you're getting a decent value for your money. </p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

   <em><strong>UPDATE: Jul. 9, 2024, 5:00 a.m. EDT </strong>This review has been updated to reflect that the base Kindle Paperwhite model now houses 16GB and retails for $149.99. Previously, the device started at 8GB for $139.99. That means there's now a $40 difference between the standard Paperwhite and the Signature Edition, rather than $50.</em>

In the months since the new mobile app launched we&rsquo;ve been updating the software that runs on our speakers and in the cloud to the point where today S2 is less reliable &amp; less stable then what you remember. After doing extensive testing we&rsquo;ve reluctantly concluded that re-releasing S2 would make the problems worse, not better. I&rsquo;m sure this is disappointing. It was disappointing to me," he added.</p><p>The issues Spence is referring to are related to the company's <a href="https://mashable.com/article/sonos-new-mobile-app" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">new app</a>, which rolled out in April but was so bad and riddled with bugs that the company <a href="https://mashable.com/article/sonos-app-apology" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">apologized for it in July</a>.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/roundups/05jCqQUxkt9wcHwLkGWbM55/hero-image.png" alt="Person using a lawn mower"><p>Nobody said gardening was easy. It takes love, hard work, and &mdash; above all else &mdash; a good looking lawn. You can fill your garden with as many <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-flower-delivery-services-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>flowers</u></a>, trees, water features, and ornaments as you want, but it simply isn't up to scratch without a well-kept lawn. It's the thing that ties the whole garden together.</p><p>The easy solution is a good lawn mower. Indeed, a neat and tidy lawn is pretty easy to achieve when you've got the right mower. And it's especially easy with a cordless lawn mower, which gives you the added bonus of convenience and lightweight handling. Even with the list of options that include <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-lawn-mowers-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">electric</a>, manual, and <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-petrol-lawn-mowers-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">petrol devices</a> mowers, there are lots of reasons to go cordless.</p><p>But where to start? Not everybody is an expert gardener with a deep knowledge of the best tools and equipment. Here's a quick guide on cordless lawn mowers.</p><h2>What is a cordless lawn mower?</h2><p>Like it says on the box, a cordless lawn mower is exactly that: cordless. There's no need to plug into the mains, which means no cord trailing behind &mdash; which also means no tripping over or cutting through the cord by mistake. Cordless lawn mowers are powered by rechargeable batteries, giving you more freedom in the garden.</p><h2>What are the benefits of a cordless lawn mower?</h2><p>Cordless lawn mowers give you a much bigger range and have easier, lightweight handling. They&rsquo;re best for small and medium-sized gardens, but allow you to reach spots that might be hard to cut when tethered to a cord. They also need relatively little maintenance, unlike petrol mowers. Other than charging the battery, of course.</p><h2>What are the drawbacks of a cordless lawn mower?</h2><p>All that added convenience comes at a higher price. And there&rsquo;s the added issue, as stated above, of keeping the battery topped up. It&rsquo;s worth remembering to recharge after use, rather than realising the battery&rsquo;s dead every time you get the lawn mower out of the shed. And while they&rsquo;re especially good for smaller and medium-sized gardens, if you have a large or hilly garden, or seriously tough grass to cut through, the extra power you get with an electric or even petrol lawn mower is probably better.</p><h2>What features do cordless lawn mowers have?</h2><p>Cordless lawn mowers, with their added convenience, are often easy to store away, so look out for models that have folding handles or other storage features. Depending on your lawn layout and style, you might want to check that your new lawn mower has close edge cutting &mdash; which allows you to go right to the edges &mdash; or a rear roller for creating a stripe effect on your lawn. Other features include adjustable cutting heights and easy-to-empty grass boxes &mdash; all bonuses that make cutting the grass easier. </p><h2>How long does a cordless lawn mower battery last?</h2><p>A good battery is perhaps the most important feature of all. You want a battery that gives you plenty of juice, if only to save the hassle of constantly recharging or running out of power when you're only half finished. Look out for cordless lawn mowers that offer 25 minutes or more, but be aware that some cheaper mowers offer much shorter runtimes &mdash; it could all come down to how much you want to spend.</p><h2>What is the best cordless lawn mower?</h2><p>If a cordless lawn mower seems like the best option for your garden, you're in luck. There are lots of impressive models out there from some of the biggest gardening brands. To make your decision making process that little bit easier by shortlisting a selection of the very best options, giving you more time for actual gardening.</p><p>These are the best cordless lawn mowers in 2024.</p>]]></content:encoded>

What we are expecting, however, are new product announcements, information about Meta's metaverse plans, and a whole lot of talk about AI.</p><h2>What to expect at Meta Connect 2024</h2><p>While we don't know the exact details of what Meta plans to announce this Wednesday, Facebook's parent company is expected to continue last year's <a href="https://mashable.com/article/meta-connect-2023-ai-roundup-celebrities-personal-assistant" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">heavy focus on AI</a>. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/what-to-expect-at-meta-connect-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">According to rumours</a>, Meta's announcements may include updates on the company's artificially intelligent assistant Meta AI, as well as a more budget-friendly Quest 3 and a new pair of augmented reality glasses.</p><p>If you want to know more about what to expect, Mashable's <a href="https://mashable.com/author/kim-gedeon" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Kimberly Gedeon</a> has provided a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/what-to-expect-at-meta-connect-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">rundown of all the rumours circulating in the lead-up to Meta Connect 2024</a>.</p><h2>How to watch Meta Connect 2024</h2><p>Meta Connect 2024 is scheduled to start Sept. 25 at 1 p.m. ET / 10 a.m. PT, with a keynote speech by Zuckerberg kicking off the event. This will be followed by a developer keynote shared by several Meta executives at 2 p.m. ET / 11 a.m. PT.

According to Meta, the VR experience will be inspired by the company's Menlo Park campus in California, and offer attendees the chance to unlock "exclusive rewards." Whether the promise of such nebulous incentives is worth it is a question only you can answer.</p><p>Meta Connect 2024 will run for two days, featuring talks on how to use some of the tech giant's tools for developers. You won't have to stay glued to your computer for the entire event, as some of the sessions will be recorded and made available to stream once Meta Connect ends. Meta hasn't specified which parts of the program might be left out though, so you'd be best off catching it live if you're super keen on a specific session.</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <div id="video-container-23yGj81xd9s?feature=shared"></div>
</div>


<p>A nostalgic tribute to 90's PS1-era horror, <em>Fear the Spotlight</em> by Cozy Game Pals is getting a major boost with Blumhouse Studios stepping in as publisher. </p><p>In this eerie survival game, players follow Vivian and Amy as they sneak into their school after hours, only to face the terrifying consequences of a s&eacute;ance gone wrong. After its initial release in September 2023, <em>Fear the Spotlight</em> is set to haunt PS5 and PS4 on October 22, 2024.</p><h2><em>Towers of Aghasba</em></h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-gZNV3N2FK5I?feature=shared"></div>
</div>


<p><em>Towers of Aghasba</em> is an action-adventure builder set in a striking fantasy world where players are tasked with the challenge of rebuilding both their civilization and the surrounding ecosystem.</p><p>This one is scheduled to launch into early access in November 2024.</p><h2><em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins </em>release date</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-wEJj6ahC38s?feature=shared"></div>
</div>


<p>Koei Tecmo has officially revealed the release date for <em>Dynasty Warriors Origins</em>, set to launch on January 17, 2025, for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Steam. Treated as a mainline entry rather than a spinoff, <em>Origins</em> shifts towards a tactical action RPG format, with a story that begins before the Yellow Turban Rebellion to explore the origins of Zhang Jiao and his role in the uprising.</p><h2><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> release date reveal</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

<h2><em>Horizon Zero Dawn </em>Remastered</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-kMN-x9goE7M?feature=shared"></div>
</div>


<p>This one&rsquo;s been floating around the rumor mill for a while, and it&rsquo;s finally official. <em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em> is landing on the PS5 and PC on October 31.</p><p>The original, which dropped in 2017, already set a high bar with its stunning visuals, so it&rsquo;s a bit of a head-scratcher that Sony is pushing for a remaster. Still, fans can expect some next-gen polish, even if the game didn&rsquo;t exactly need it.</p><h2>Fantasian Neo Dimension release date</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-Zz37fdo_lqU"></div>
</div>


<p>This is a turn-based JRPG from the father of Final Fantasy Hironobu Sakaguchi. Teaming up with Nobuo Uematsu, the duo is teaming up for an original story that features some beautifully hand-crafted environments as you embark on a "multi-dimensional journey to reclaim your lost memories and save the world from the mechteria infection."</p><p><em>Fantasian Neo Dimension</em> releases on December 5.</p><h2><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> gameplay</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-AUOLOMDH-7M?feature=shared"></div>

    <div id="video-container-DCl5zKHy7ak"></div>
</div>


<p>We couldn't get enough of <em>Astro Bot</em>, and now there's even more to love! The hit platformer just dropped some FREE DLC, adding 50 brand-new worlds for players to explore. Best of all, it&rsquo;s available right now, so you can jump in and enjoy the fresh content immediately.</p><h2><em>The Midnight Walk</em></h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-QnBE7mU6ZsI"></div>
</div>


<p>A dark fantasy adventure with hand-made claymation visuals? We&rsquo;re all in for <em>The Midnight Walk</em>, the latest project from Moon Hand Studios, the creators of <em>Lost in Random</em>. In this eerie journey, you&rsquo;ll play as The Burnt One, accompanied by a lost lantern creature named Potboy. Together, you&rsquo;ll navigate a haunting yet wondrous world, using Potboy's flame to light your path through the dangers ahead. </p><p>This one is set to release on PS5 and PS VR2 in Spring 2025</p><h2>Hell is Us gameplay reveal</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-it9wGffvYGM"></div>
</div>


<p>We just got our first look at <em>Hell is Us</em>, a new game from Rogue Factor that blends elements of <em>Remnant</em>, <em>Dark Souls</em>, and <em>Control</em> into a mysterious and atmospheric third-person action experience. It's a significant departure for the studio, which is best known for its tactical RPGs set in the Warhammer universe.</p><p><em>Hell is Us</em> takes place in a war-torn country where something eerie and unexplained is happening. While the setup might not be the most original, the game&rsquo;s intriguing mix of genres and gameplay styles certainly makes it stand out. Expect this one to land sometime in 2025.</p><h2><em>Metro Awakening </em>VR </h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-4dvFiSwPFkU"></div>
</div>


<p>We can never say no to more <em>Metro</em>, even if this time it's a PSVR2 exclusive.</p><p>Revealed in its first trailer, <em>Metro Awakening</em> dives deep into the origin story of one of the series' most beloved characters, Khan, back when he was known as Serdar. The game promises an intense VR experience, with players reloading manually, charging gear, and scavenging to survive in the unforgiving world of <em>Metro</em>. </p><p><em>Metro Awakening</em> launches on November 7.</p><h2><em>ArcheAge Chronicles</em></h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

    <div id="video-container-iC2jLVGlux0?feature=shared"></div>

<h2>What is Connections?</h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. Like <em>Wordle, </em>you can share the results with your friends on social media.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>NOAA's cone graphic of storm Helene</h2><p>According to NOAA, as of 11 a.m. ET, a Hurricane Watch is in effect for much of the Mexican state of Quintana Roo, the Cuban province of Pinar del Rio, a swath of Florida spanning "Englewood to Indian Pass," and the densely populated Tampa Bay. In graphic form, that looks like this:</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

    </div>
<p>As a reminder, NOAA's cone graphic is a fairly reliable prediction of the range of paths the <em>center of the storm</em> may take. The cone is not &mdash; as it may appear at first glance &mdash; a prediction of an ever-widening storm exploding into the inland United States. Severe wind and storm surge can, and probably will, occur outside the cone, and some areas inside the cone will emerge from the storm totally unscathed. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>If you're reading this, and it turns out you end up directly in the path of a hurricane, an evacuation order will be hard to miss. At this phase, rather than speculating about whether your specific neighborhood will face the high winds and storm surge that come from a direct hit from a hurricane, in most areas it would be wiser to just heed NOAA's broader warning:   </p><blockquote><p>Heavy rainfall will likely result in locally considerable flash flooding across portions of Florida, with isolated flash and urban flooding possible across the Southeast, Southern Appalachians, and the Tennessee Valley Wednesday through Friday.</p></blockquote><h2>Spaghetti model for Helene</h2><p>Spaghetti models, like the NOAA cone model, visualize mathematical possibilities. </p><p>Unlike the cone, they present the actual paths predicted by a collection of computer models, all spilling out like spaghetti from Strega Nona's magical pasta pot. And like the cone, the spaghetti model can be deceptive. All the paths in the spaghetti model are both speculative and contradictions of one another. The actual storm will only follow one path, and it's almost certain that none of the predicted paths in this splatter of noodles will be perfectly predictive. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>The above model, posted online by Baton Rouge meteorologist Malcolm Byron appears to show about 20 potential paths, with one particularly ominous spaghetti strand in the far east clobbering Tampa Bay directly.

<p>What does "Hand Off" do? Well, Mac users will be very familiar with this feature because it already exists with Apple's similarly-named "<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102426" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Handoff</u></a>" feature.</p><h2>Microsoft's Hand Off vs. Apple's Handoff</h2><p>Hand Off basically allows users to continue whatever they were doing on one device seemingly on another device. For example, if a user utilizes the continuity feature on the Mac, they can pick up where they left off reading an article on Safari for iPhone. The Windows 11 feature will work similarly, allowing both iPhone and Android users to hand off what they were doing on their mobile device to their PC.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

In addition, Microsoft has the "Link to Windows" app in Apple's App Store which helps share data like notifications and contacts between the iPhone and PC. However, this experience is no where near how intuitive Mac's Handoff feature is.</p><p>With Apple's Handoff, all a user needs to do is check their macOS dock to see the mobile version of the app they have open on their iPhone.

<p>"We will be closing TikTok Music at the end of November in order to focus on our goal of furthering TikTok&rsquo;s role in driving even greater music listening and value on music streaming services, for the benefit of artists, songwriters, and the industry," Ole Obermann, TikTok's global head of music business development, said in a statement.</p><p>ByteDance has long had a strained relationship with the music industry in the United States. Earlier this year, a royalties dispute with Universal Music Group (UMG) led the publisher to pull its entire music library from the platform. While TikTok denied UMG&rsquo;s claims, the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/tiktok-universal-music-group-deal-taylor-swift" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">two eventually resolved the disagreement</a> and reached a new deal.</p><p>TikTok plays a major role in music discovery, with about <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1100836/number-of-us-tiktok-users/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">107 million users in the U.S.</a>, and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-tiktok-is-changing-music-industry" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">67 percent of those users saying they're more likely to seek out a song after hearing it on the app</a>. TikTok music, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/04/resso-music-india-bytedance/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">initially called Resso</a>, was rebranded to TikTok Music in 2023 and had expanded to Singapore, Australia, and Mexico on a possible path toward the United States. However, it faced setbacks, including being <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/india-bans-resso-tiktok-bytedance-music-streaming-service-major-market-2024-1" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">banned in India</a> earlier this year.</p><p>TikTok Music, like Spotify, operates as a freemium subscription service. With the service shutting down on Nov. 28, Apple users have until then to request refunds. Google Play subscribers with plans extending beyond Nov. 28 will automatically receive a refund or can request one through Google Play before the service sunsets.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>Before there was PlayStation and Xbox, there was Atari. This 2,532-piece building kit lets you bring the 1980s gaming icon to life in a faithful 1:1 replica. Besides the console itself, it also includes a joystick build, authentic replica gaming cartridges, a storage system and a hideen 1980s scene. There's also three mini builds depicting themes from three popular Atari games. The full set is usually $200, but during Target's Lego sale through Sept. 28, it's down to just $159.99.</p><h2>Best Lego Star Wars deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

This comes just three months after July's Prime Day, which brought some decent deals, but admittedly, didn't blow us away.</p><p>That being said, we're looking ahead to what a new event brings.

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>The Amazon Echo Show 5 works as a smart home hub that's more than just a speaker. It displays music, recipes, and even video calls with its built-in camera. While we normally prefer the Echo Show 8 over the 5, ahead of Prime Big Deal Days, we're thoroughly pleased with the $50 discount on the Echo Show 5.</p><p>With <strong>code ECHOSHOW50</strong>, score the Amazon Echo Show 5 for just $39.99. That saves you $50, for 55% off.</p><h3>More Echo deals</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/aDVMqR?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Amazon%20Echo%20Pop&object_type=article&object_uuid=009CYHJ9ykSAvEhTOWHlO2x&short_url=aDVMqR&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Amazon Echo Pop</a> &mdash;

That's 35% in savings and the lowest price we've seen since Black Friday.</p><h3>More kitchen deals</h3><p><strong>Air fryer deals</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/9ywZMe?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Chefman%20TurboFry%20Touch%20air%20fryer%20%284-quart%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=009CYHJ9ykSAvEhTOWHlO2x&short_url=9ywZMe&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Chefman TurboFry Touch air fryer (4-quart)</a> &mdash;

<p>Yes, for the first time in the show's history, our young heroine finds herself with no <a href="https://mashable.com/category/sex-dating-relationships" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">love</a> interest in sight. Not only is it a breath of fresh air, it's a quietly subversive move for a mainstream comedy.</p><h2>Mabel's romantic history is decidedly underwhelming.</h2><p>First, a glimpse back over Mabel's rather lukewarm romantic past. In the first season of the show, Mabel found herself reconnecting with Oscar Torres (Aaron Dominguez), an old friend and flame who was blamed for the death of their mutual "Hardy Boys" friend, Zoe (Olivia Reis). Oscar vanished from the show after just one season, with Mabel explaining his disappearance away, saying, "The trauma bond is strong but I think Oscar and I are just both waiting for the 'let's just be friends' text." Show creator John Hoffman later confirmed to <a href="https://deadline.com/2022/08/only-murders-in-the-building-revealing-murderer-season-two-finale-spoilers-1235098258/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Deadline</u></em></a>: "We made a call that we didn&rsquo;t want to see Mabel develop a relationship where the trauma bond is strong."</p><p>In the second season, Mabel explored a connection with artist and gallerist Alice Banks (Cara Delevingne). Despite Gomez and Delevingne being longtime friends, the on-screen chemistry between the two actors was lacking. Although she ultimately posed as the killer to help the show's core trio catch the real murderer, Alice was gone by the end of Season 2, with Mabel telling her she wouldn't be a part of her mural.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

They connected during the investigation into the death of Ben Glenroy (Paul Rudd), finding themselves stuck in a closet and discussing Tobert's love of filming the animal world. They went on a sexy, boozy date. Then, they had a rather bland farewell in the season finale as Tobert set off for Los Angeles and Mabel unconvincingly promised to visit. The news that Tobert's time was up came when Williams told <a href="https://people.com/jesse-williams-not-returning-only-murders-in-the-building-season-4-exclusive-8685065" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>People</u></em></a> rather bluntly, "I'm not on that show anymore."</p><h2>But Mabel needs a love interest&hellip;right?</h2><p>Mabel has had her fair share of romances, all conveniently within the walls of The Arconia, but none have been particularly gripping.

But in Season 4 of <em>Only Murders In the Building</em>, the tired, uninspiring parade of Mabel's love interests seems to have come to a blissful end. So far, there is no sign of any romance for the show's heroine. Nor has she or anyone else even so much as mentioned the idea.&nbsp;</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Steering her journey away from romance is a quietly bold move on the part of the show's writing team. For one thing, it reflects the reality of romance in her own generation. After all, many young people have chosen to embrace being single, focusing on self-love and single positivity. And the movement isn't new &mdash; <a href="https://mashable.com/article/single-positivity-movement-history" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">it has a </a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/single-positivity-movement-history" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>long history.</u></a> In recent years, the number of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-08-03/young-adults-less-sex-gen-z-millennials-generations-parents-grandparents" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">young people having sex has begun to decline</a>, with a quarter of Gen Z American women in 2021 claiming to have had no sex the previous year. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/teens-want-to-see-friendship-on-tv-not-sex-teens-and-screens" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>A recent survey</u></a> found that almost half (47.5 percent) of adolescents aged 13-24 think sex and sexual content isn't necessary for the plot of most TV shows and movies, while 44.3 percent believe romance is overused in media.

Meanwhile, they are also working with a team of Hollywood filmmakers as their podcast is set to be turned into a film.&nbsp;</p><p>Themes of doubles and twins are found everywhere this season.

Charles is confronted with a neurotic worrier. Oliver finds in his double a needy narcissist. Funnily enough, Mabel is confronted with everything she is not. Her counterpart, Longoria, has decided to play Mabel a little differently, even changing her "old person name" to "Mabelle."&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Longoria's "Mabelle" is "bold, she pops, she sells t-shirts." In other words, she knocks back wine at 10 a.m. and has no qualms about bursting into a suspect's home and accusing them of murder. And this is exactly what Longoria does.</p><p>Although the suspect in question was, in fact, not the murderer, Mabel is surprised to see how her own cautious, measured approach to detective work (and, we must presume, to life in general) sometimes leaves her a little stuck. "Maybe your Mabel's approach isn't that bad," she confesses.&nbsp;</p><p>As Mabel tries to take a bolder, more committed approach to life, she starts making real, tangible career moves. In the past, she's always been something of a millennial drifter, unsure of what she really wants to do or how she'll get there, even when offered major opportunities in Season 2 in the form of Cinda Canning's podcast. Now, she's finally brave enough to tackle her imposter syndrome and give herself an actual job title: podcast producer. Watching Mabel recognize and own her worth is far more rewarding than yet another mediocre love story.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2><em>Only Murders</em> hasn't given up on love altogether.</h2><p>Of course, this isn't to say that romantic love can't be an interesting theme. While <em>Only Murders</em> hasn't found a satisfying love interest for Mabel, or, for that matter, for Charles, who fell for Season 1's murderer, Jan (Amy Ryan), it has found a long-term romance worth focusing on in Oliver and Loretta (Meryl Streep). Loretta joined the narrative in Season 3 as an experienced actor who never had her big break. Cast in the production of <em>Death Rattle/Death Rattle Dazzle!</em>, Oliver recognised her talent while she recognised his. They fell in love while championing each other's work and it was utterly beautiful to watch.&nbsp;       </p><p>Streep is back this season as Oliver and Loretta's love story continues. After Loretta leaves New York for a TV job in LA, Oliver finds himself struggling with jealousy and insecurity. Their entire love story has been treated with the sincerity and gravitas of a love story between younger characters, from their timid first attraction to each other's talent, to their painfully awkward, bumbling first date, to their communication issues this season. Now, theirs is the only main romance on the show &mdash; a bold reminder that TV shows can and should expand their criteria of what makes a good and worthwhile love story.&nbsp;       </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>No matter how hard you try, camping inevitably leads to getting dirty. The dog ran into the biggest mud puddle around, the kids tracked sand from the beach into the tent, or you just ended up on a super hot hike.

Igloo mentions the 72-quart size can hold 101 12-ounce cans, so you'll be set for a long weekend away with the family in the great outdoors.</p><h3>More outdoor deals at Amazon</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/9g3RlD?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Coleman%20Portable%20Camping%20Chair&object_type=article&object_uuid=02ur7h2Fw5eTKPT3wgzGamk&short_url=9g3RlD&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Coleman Portable Camping Chair</a> &mdash; <strong>$31.43</strong> <s>$44.99</s> (save $13.65)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/avxmdo?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Coleman%20Triton%202-Burner%20Propane%20Camping%20Stove&object_type=article&object_uuid=02ur7h2Fw5eTKPT3wgzGamk&short_url=avxmdo&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Coleman Triton 2-Burner Propane Camping Stove</a> &mdash; <strong>$59.99</strong> <s>$89.99</s> (save $30)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/9lweVX?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Cuisinart%20Cleanburn%20Smokeless%20Fire%20Pit&object_type=article&object_uuid=02ur7h2Fw5eTKPT3wgzGamk&short_url=9lweVX&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Cuisinart Cleanburn Smokeless Fire Pit</a> &mdash; <strong>$159.99</strong> <s>$229.99</s> (save $70)</p></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

<p> It seems an explanation is needed on what Apple considers an &ldquo;obsolete&rdquo; product and how it makes the list. Put simply, if Apple stopped selling a product over seven years ago, it&rsquo;s deemed obsolete. This means Apple will no longer provide repairs &mdash; and third-party repair services can&rsquo;t order replacement parts either.</p><p>There's a separate "vintage" category for products that Apple stopped selling between five and seven years ago to indicate that repair parts might be limited, but are still possible.</p><p>Unfortunately, if your MacBook is on that list, it's <em>definitely</em> not possible (or at least not easy) to get a repair done at this point if it breaks. It may be time to upgrade.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It's rare that our top pick comes from the same brand <a href="https://mashable.com/article/amazon-deals-of-the-day-ultimate-ears-boom-4-sept-23" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">two days in a row</a>, but this new price drop was too good to pass up. The Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 4, a newer iteration of our <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-bluetooth-speakers" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">favorite sub-$100 Bluetooth speaker</a>, is down to just $69.99 at Amazon ahead of its October Prime Day sale. That's 30% off its usual price and its lowest price on record. The Wonderboom is tiny, but it's quite the powerhouse. We haven't tested the fourth generation speaker, but we did try its predecessor and found it had "excellent sound for its size and plenty of useful features that come in handy when you're taking it on the go." Its rugged design can endure drops from up to five feet or be submerged in water for up to 30 minutes. Plus, its battery life is pretty impressive at 14 hours. While it comes in a few different color options, only the black version is on sale for this ultra low price. The other colors will cost you $10 more.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>Halloween will be here before you know it. If you haven't started decorating, let this limited edition drop from Disney and Amazon be your incentive. When you bundle the Echo Dot (5th gen) with the new Jack Skellington shell from Disney, it'll only cost you $62.98 as opposed to $89.98. That's about $27 cheaper than purchasing both separately. The 5th gen Echo Dot sits atop your counter, desk, shelf, or bedside table and adds smart features to your daily life. Use it to receive reminders, save recipes, set timers, schedule tasks, talk to friends, listen to music, and more. The plastic Jack Skellington shell snaps on the outside of your Dot (without interfering with its features) and features a glowing grin (which comes from the light ring on your Echo Dot). </p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>Stop deleting old content to make space for new content and grab yourself a portable SSD instead.

<p>The feature generates custom playlists based on niche prompts.

The tool is still in beta and allows subscribers to choose from prompts or write their own. For example, if you're looking for the perfect Sunday morning cleaning playlist, then, theoretically, Spotify's AI should be able to generate one tailored to your tastes. </p><p>In a blog post the music streaming giant recommends subscribers stick to "genre," "mood" or "artist" prompts to generate the most successful playlists, but it stipulates that anything from movie characters to emojis can be used. Examples include, "Upbeat folk music for a scenic fall road trip," and "2000 era hype jams for the tailgate."</p><p>While some users might like not having to painstakingly curate their playlists, as Spotify leans further into AI, users stray further from their own unique taste. Instead of picking out the upbeat folk music that reminds you of fall memories or songs a trusted friend played for you, the AI Playlist tool encourages you to take a passive role in your listening, turning AI into a tastemaker.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Previously, if you opted out of making your own playlist, you might search on the platform for a tailgate playlist made by another human user. Now, Spotify wants an algorithm to do it for you. While you can still opt to make your playlists or listen to other user-generated playlists, the more "personalization" features Spotify launches, the less intuitive that behavior becomes. </p><p>To try out AI Playlist navigate to "Your Library" in the bottom right corner of your screen. Then, select the "+" sign in the top right corner and tap "AI Playlist." That should open up the chat tool, and from there, type out your playlist prompt. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Oh dear. The post has now been deleted, but clicking it took people to a phishing website that asked them to connect their crypto wallet in order to claim the non-existent "$OPENAI" token, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/23/crypto-scammers-hack-openais-press-account-on-x/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">per Techcrunch</a>.

<p>If convenience and portability are your top priorities, then the Air will be most suited to you. It's thin and light, and it even comes in a 13-inch option if you'll be lugging it around wherever you go. Plus, ever since the debut of Apple's M Series chips, the MacBook Air has become a pint-sized powerhouse. The <a href="https://mashable.com/review/m3-macbook-air-15-inch" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">most current model</a> utilizes the M3 chip, so you won't be sacrificing all that much in terms of power.</p><h2>Which generation MacBook is the best?</h2><p>This will come down to what you're willing to give up in performance, and in some cases, quality. But, whatever you <em>do</em> deem worthy of sacrificing, you'll be paid back in savings.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/05tr7rKoAbLjEyrwC02CAKg/hero-image.jpg" alt="Megan Stott stars in "Penelope" as a runaway living it up in the wilderness."><p>Few rejoinders sting quite the way <a href="https://mashable.com/article/log-off-touch-grass" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">"touch grass"</a> does. For those who aren't chronically online, the phrase essentially means you need to log off and go outside, but the deeper undercurrent is that you've lost touch with the real world and desperately need to reconnect to something tangible. It's "get real," minus the vintage appeal. Yet in Mel Eslyn's pilot for the YA drama <em>Penelope</em>, the concept of touching grass proves a wholesome jumping-off point for a modern teen's journey of self-discovery.&nbsp;</p><p>Written and directed by Eslyn, who also created the under-sung sci-fi gem <a href="https://mashable.com/article/biosphere-movie-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Biosphere</em></a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/biosphere-movie-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">,</a> <em>Penelope </em>centers on a 16-year-old girl (<a href="https://mashable.com/article/little-fires-everywhere-finale-hulu" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Little Fires Everywhere</em></a>'s Megan Stott) who abruptly decides to log off of everything and wander into the wilderness. However, while Penelope is essentially looking to touch grass (and trees and bunnies), the show is bled free from the vitriol that typically accompanies such a stinging sentiment. Instead, <em>Penelope</em> relishes the wonder and freedom of cutting loose from cell phones and social media.&nbsp;</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>Penelope is a cozy fantasy set in the real world.&nbsp;</h2><p>Though this is the story of a runaway fleeing from her family and all she knows, <em>Penelope </em>is not urgent with drama. There's no grim inciting incident that spurs its young heroine to strike out on her own. Instead, the pilot, <a href="https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/6569fca5fac9f41774c0387b" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">which is premiering as part of Sundance's Episodic Pilot Showcase</a>, begins with Penelope happily bopping around at a silent disco, where headphones allow the dancers to feel connected while not disturbing the animals of the surrounding forest. Penelope isn't like the others, though. While they are caught up in the music and each other, she makes eye contact with a wandering wolf. Just like that, she seems destined to depart her family's camping trip for parts unknown.&nbsp;</p><p>The script from Eslyn and Mark Duplass (who co-wrote and starred in <a href="https://mashable.com/article/biosphere-movie-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Biosphere</em></a>) is scant in detail, purposefully sketching Penelope's backstory as one of a kid with loving parents who check in with her via text to remind her she's got SAT prep coming up. As she's played by Stott, Penelope doesn't seem burdened by tech or the pressures of her parents; she just seems bored by them. So, she goes on a "solo hike" that leads her to a shop to buy camping supplies. She turns off the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/gen-z-find-my-friends" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">"share location"</a> option on her phone and hops onto a train car like a Mark Twain hero, giddy at her daring.&nbsp;</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Parents &mdash; or those of us who grew up in <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-black-phone-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">the Stranger Danger age</a>&mdash;&nbsp;might flinch at her choices, as she hitchhikes, puts her trust in randos, and goes out of her way to make sure that her folks can't track her down. Much of it seems like a recipe on how to become the subject of a future <em>20/20</em> special report, but Eslyn isn't making a harrowing drama about isolation or teen homelessness. The could-be threats of the real world are softened by a color palette that is breezy and inviting, and the score, which reverberates with electronically filtered women's voices, feels like a synth-y siren luring Penelope forward. The strangers she meets in the first episode provide help and warm smiles or curt advice, but never a reason for fear. <em>Penelope </em>offers us all the dream of walking into the warm woods and not looking back.&nbsp;</p><h2>Megan Stott is pitch-perfect in Penelope's pilot episode.&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Where much of YA shows and movies are full of snarking <a href="https://mashable.com/article/mean-girls-musical-review-movie" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Mean Girls</em></a><em> </em>or emotionally overwrought heroines, <em>Penelope </em>blooms from a place of quiet reflection. As its protagonist strikes out on her own, the show doesn't offer flowery speeches about her motivations. Instead, Stott's wide-eyed expressions communicate the wonder, curiosity, and excitement of each step of her journey. Deceptively simple cinematography lingers on her fingers as she reaches for camping supplies in a store, all on her own. The possibilities of the world are just at her fingertips! A sincere grin splashes across her apple cheeks as she overcomes a financial obstacle with a clever solution. Her physicality is alive but never anxious,&nbsp;like a kid waiting their turn at a diving board. And so, through her every motion, Stott urges us to dive in with Penelope.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, as a grown-up watching the show, it's easy to slip into our concerns about the dangers we know lurk outside Penelope's dreamy tunnel vision. Perhaps we wonder what was so bad that she had to run away to begin with. The only concrete clue the pilot offers is a text that she doesn't send: "Mom&hellip; Was I a happy kid?"&nbsp;</p><p>Implied here is that despite seeming to have it all &mdash; a phone, Apple Pay, loving parents who support her education and take her to things like silent discos &mdash; Penelope feels forlorn for some reason she can't put her finger on. So, she follows a trail back to nature to discover who she is outside of social media and societal expectations. Who might she be in the woods with herself as her only company? </p><p>We're invited to share in Penelope's awe and excitement as POV shots allow us to vicariously experience the thrill of literally hopping onto a speeding train, watching the world rush by. But there's still a distance between us and our eponymous heroine.&nbsp;</p><h2>Mel Eslyn gives Penelope her space.&nbsp;</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-EZ0iwJdVfNQ"></div>

<p>It's a thrill to watch a TV show that doesn't feel the need to spell everything out for you. (See also: <a href="https://mashable.com/article/true-detective-burning-questions-ep-1-season-4" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>True Detective: Night Country</em></a>). Through her direction, Eslyn gives us access to Penelope's unspoken concerns and wishes, but she also allows the character some space for mystery. A scene where she walks into the woods and out of focus reminds us that this journey is hers, and we are witness only to what she allows us. When she takes a photo of nature on her phone but looks dismayed at the result, there's no dialogue explaining why. Later, a conversation with a traveling musician (Austin Abrams) gives us some clarity.&nbsp;</p><p>Penelope asks gently why he's bothering touring at tiny coffee shops when Spotify exists. Why not "join this century"? As it turns out, his experience with online communities has also felt lacking. He explains that playing music live versus distributing it via the Internet is the difference between visiting a river and seeing a picture of a river. The difference is being there, a romance with the real that is undeniably beguiling through the eyes of these kindred spirits.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on the first episode, it's hard to guess where <em>Penelope </em>might go next. Will this play like a road trip story, bringing the girl from one curious location to another? Will the focus shift away from Penelope and to her parents, who have been left behind to worry and wonder? Will it combine those could-be threads in order to allow fantasy clash with anxiety? I couldn't say, but I can't wait to find out. As pilots go, <em>Penelope </em>is absolutely enchanting.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/98bKEO?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Penelope%2C%20all%20eight%20episodes%2C%20are%20now%20streaming%20on%20Netflix.&object_type=article&object_uuid=05tr7rKoAbLjEyrwC02CAKg&short_url=98bKEO&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Penelope, </em>all eight episodes, are now streaming on Netflix.  </a></p><p class="mx-auto">

<h2>What is Connections?</h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>
<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>
<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. Like <em>Wordle, </em>you can share the results with your friends on social media.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

Words can be made from linked letters &mdash; up, down, left, right, or diagonal, but words can also change direction, resulting in quirky shapes and patterns. Every single letter in the grid will be part of an answer. There's always a theme linking every solution, along with the "spangram," a special, word or phrase that sums up that day's theme, and spans the entire grid horizontally or vertically.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>The image on the left, a green box of premium quality "Olde Belgium" lager, is actually a throwback to <a href="https://mashable.com/article/only-murders-in-the-building-season-3-ending-explainer" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">the end of Season 3</a>. This is the case of beer that Sazz (Jane Lynch) brings to Charles (Steve Martin), shortly before she's killed. "I got a cold case for ya," says Sazz, but Charles suggests fetching the 1966 Argentinian Malbec from his apartment instead. If only they'd stuck to lager.</p><p>The second image is a mockup poster of the apparently upcoming <em>Only Murders in the Building</em> movie adaptation, complete with the names of the core cast &mdash; Eugene Levy, Eva Longoria, and Zach Galifianakis &mdash; and a line promising the film will be "only in theaters this Christmas".</p><h2>Episode 2, "Gates of Heaven"</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">
    <div class="flex justify-center">
                    <img class="border border-gray-100" src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/02rPqrFsaW8cbpvCke14KW6/images-2.fill.size_2000x1126.v1725893468.jpg" alt="A man stands in a bathroom, with a miniature pig visible in the bathtub." width="2000" height="1126" loading="lazy" srcset="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/02rPqrFsaW8cbpvCke14KW6/images-2.fill.size_800x450.v1725893468.jpg 800w, https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/02rPqrFsaW8cbpvCke14KW6/images-2.fill.size_1400x788.v1725893468.jpg 1400w, https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/02rPqrFsaW8cbpvCke14KW6/images-2.fill.size_2000x1126.v1725893468.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px">

<p>On the left we have the small pig that Oliver (Martin Short) and Mabel (Selena Gomez) discover in the bathroom of the abandoned apartment opposite Charles' &mdash; in the West tower. This appears to have been the place where the killer sniped Sazz from, so we're guessing the pig will surely be significant down the line? We don't know who exactly it belongs to, but it makes a grunting bid for freedom at the end of the episode when it flees through the apartment's open door.</p><p>On the right are some playing cards, presumably representing the game of "Oh Hell" that Oliver and Mabel play with "the sauce family" who live opposite Charles. Could the game itself be some kind of clue? It could also represent the poker game Sazz set up for Charles on set of <em>Brazzos</em> back in the day, described in a moving moment in the episode as the time Sazz "found friends" for the lonely star of the show. </p><h2>Episode 3, "Two for the Road"</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Of course, the object on the left is a ham radio. These radios play a key roll in episode 3, with Mabel, Oliver, and Charles finally going some way to revealing their mystery right before the end credits. "Howard [Morris, Michael Cyril Creighton's character] was clocking the same song on the radio," says Oliver, after he and Mabel break into an impromptu rendition of the theme tune for 1986 sitcom <em>Perfect Strangers</em>. "Yes, a person came on the line and said, 'Meet me at 445.'"</p><p>The group quickly works out that this is a frequency, but when they tune into it they receive a cold warning. "You shouldn't be on this frequency," says the strange voice that responds. "The last person who came around asking these questions got killed."</p><p>The object on the right is less mysterious. It's a screenshot of a web search for "squatters rights NYC", with the following sentence highlighted: "a squatter can be considered a legal tenant in as little as 30 days." This is a callback to Mabel's plan to stay in the abandoned apartment in the West tower of The Arconia, now that she doesn't have her own place.</p><h2>Episode 4, "The Stunt Man"</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/079NPjGh2F2WMtLR7WJ8C3T/hero-image.jpg" alt="A person looks at X on their cell phone."><p>X&rsquo;s block feature as we know it is about to be no more, CEO Elon Musk stated Monday on the social media site.</p><p>Musk confirmed the change in a reply to Nima Owji, a web developer who first reported the news.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Since its inception, the block feature on Twitter, X&rsquo;s former moniker, allowed users to prevent individuals from viewing or engaging with their public posts. With the change, blocked accounts will be able to view the blocker&rsquo;s posts once again, but cannot engage with the content via likes, replies, reposts, or direct messages. Musk actually <a href="https://mashable.com/article/elon-musk-removing-block-x-twitter" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">threatened last year to kill all features of the block</a>, save for a blocked user being able to DM the blocker.</p><p>Even though Musk&rsquo;s change isn&rsquo;t as extreme as his previous announcement, Monday&rsquo;s news is alarming to many who have faced harassment or stalking on X. Though the updated block feature prevents potential bad actors from causing trouble on X, anyone will soon be able to easily view information on the site and utilize it offline or via another site. Someone can now easily screen-capture a post on X from an account that previously blocked them, for instance, and repost it on Threads, Facebook, or Instagram; they can also screen cap that X post and post it on their own X account.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Some on X responded positively to the news, calling the current block function toothless.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/06op9RGGOiqbTO5Pcn8g3x0/hero-image.jpg" alt="Christopher Lee poses for a photo. "><p>To resurrect a late actor &mdash; as <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230718-how-ai-is-bringing-film-stars-back-from-the-dead" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">recent franchise films</a> have done using CGI &mdash; is akin to an act of puppetry, and <em>The Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee</em> tackles this idea with mischievous literalism. It employs, as its central narrator, a delightfully designed marionette of the late English thespian, known for playing Count Dracula in the Hammer horror films, as well as fantasy icons like Count Dooku and Lord Saruman.</p><p>However, this self-reflexive touch is the documentary's only deft or thoughtful flourish. The end result is too rote and mechanical to truly inform audiences about its subject either intellectually or emotionally, despite featuring numerous friends, family, and colleagues who undoubtedly had access to Lee's wildly interesting life &mdash; the dimensions of which the film never fully explores.</p><h2>What is <em>The Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee </em>about?</h2><p>A man whose voice and posture exuded presence, Christopher Lee was a screen legend with an unconventional film career, and an even more unorthodox job before that: In the years following World War II, he was a<a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/christopher-lee-a-giant-among-actors-cpfwp6chb2m" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"> <u>Nazi hunter</u></a>. However, <em>The Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee</em> is scarcely interested in exploring this side of the famous actor. In fact, it seldom sticks with any one topic or period of his life for long enough to create intrigue.</p><p>The film's opening images are its most pronounced. A visibly Lee-like silhouette sits in the darkness, as a nearby screen plays clips of various pals and confidants speaking on his behalf. It's a preview of what's to come: Lee looms large over the movie, but his story is told through other people's recollections. This shadowy figure is soon revealed to be a puppet on strings, voiced by fellow Star Wars alum Peter Serafinowicz (the voice of Darth Maul), who does an adequate impression.</p><p>Director Jon Spira has no qualms about revealing this ruse, and ensures that footage of Serafinowicz in a sound recording booth is prominently displayed. The film is not, after all, an attempted re-creation of Lee's thoughts, but a Brechtian dramatization of them, with no central source for his opinions despite his dialogue appearing in the first person.&nbsp;</p><p>One by one, Serafinowicz guides us through notable years of Lee's upbringing, his war service, and his early career leading up to his most famous roles, but little of this backdrop creates a wide enough portrait of who Lee really was. Much of this is owed to what the movie's interview subjects have to say &mdash; and notably, what they don't.</p><h2>Surely there are more interesting stories about Christopher Lee?</h2><p>There are enough reasons to dislike director John Landis (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/25/movies/the-twilight-zone-the-movie-accident.html" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>three in particular</u></a>), but his inflated presence in <em>The Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee </em>feels especially odd. Lee and Landis were friends, having collaborated on <em>The Stupids</em>, but the filmmaker sheds little light on Lee's private life despite discussing him at length. In fact, the closest he comes to sharing a meaningful anecdote involves him recalling Lee's refusal to discuss World War II. Rather than probing further, the movie simply leaves it at that, even though Lee's part in the conflict is well-documented elsewhere. It&rsquo;s hard not to wonder, from Landis&rsquo; musings, if the director knew him at all.&nbsp;</p><p>This lack of curiosity about its own subject plagues <em>The Life and Deaths</em> for much of its runtime, even though Lee&rsquo;s niece and son-in-law feature among the interviewees. However, that&rsquo;s likely only the movie's second-gravest sin. The larger issue is that the movie's imagined version of Lee is seldom as captivating as the real man, as evidenced by the eloquence and mysteriousness he often displayed in his own interviews, whether discussing the<a href="https://youtu.be/xcJLEyYNF_c?si=CEjLjW7o3VFOy480&amp;t=137" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"> <u>motivations</u></a> of his characters, or the way his<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TQARRckm6U" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"> <u>physicality</u></a> was informed by the real violence he saw up-close in the 1940s.</p><p>Instead, the movie mostly features banal recollections of things Lee might've said on one occasion, without ever weaving them into a larger tapestry. Each tidbit is isolated, and relatively meaningless on its own, with little journalistic probing as to its underlying meaning or what it says about the man himself. It also never gets to the root of its own title, and only mentions in passing that Lee often played characters who died on screen, but it never attempts to investigate what this might mean for a performer who lived in such close proximity to death.</p><p>If nothing else, the movie's visual execution at least falls perfectly in line with this mechanical approach.</p><h2><em>The Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee</em> is mechanically assembled.</h2><p>You could set your watch to the movie's use of any still photograph, on which it zooms in slowly for a few seconds apiece before cutting back to the most recent talking head. It's a repetitive form of editing that ensures a familiar rhythm, but one that offers no excitement or spark of imagination &mdash; let alone one that uses its images to punctuate what's being said. Instead, archival photographs are used to illustrate the words themselves, doubling down on how little the film actually has to say.</p><p>This is, of course, limited to the use of real pictures and footage. The movie also appears to make use &mdash; in limited but noticeable capacity &mdash; of A.I.-generated imagery to imbue some of these photos with movement. It also seems to use A.I. to create map inserts for transitional moments, when the topic being discussed is Lee's travel or relocation between countries (the places listed on these maps are total gibberish). For a film that seeks permission to bring a dead actor to life in humane ways, more akin to a biopic than ghoulish digital necromancy, it skirts the very same technological line in equally concerning ways.</p><p>However, even these generated elements don't add any spark or pizzazz to the proceedings. No matter its fleeting focus, the movie very quickly moves on from one topic to the next &mdash; in disconnected, rambling, "and then&hellip; and then&hellip; and then" fashion &mdash; as though it were simply running down a list of Lee's achievements from his Wikipedia page (which, incidentally, is far more informative).</p><p>Despite the numerous forms of stylization it attempts &mdash; on occasion, it portrays Lee's life through comic panels and eye-popping dioramas &mdash; <em>The Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee </em>presents what ought to be a poetic life in the form of blank verse. It's a chore to watch, with little sense of insight about a man who lived a truly intriguing life.</p><p><em>The Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee </em>was reviewed out of its North American premiere at Fantastic Fest.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Say you have an otherwise perfect shot that&rsquo;s ruined by one person in the group looking away or a photobombing animal. Generative Remove will wipe the unwanted part, and then replicate the background. It&rsquo;s smart enough to do all this without smudges, distortions, or dark spots.&nbsp;</p><p>Another feature, Lens Blur, allows you to blur any part of a photo to create more professional-looking cityscapes, portraits, or street photography.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html?gclid=CjwKCAjw7NmzBhBLEiwAxrHQ-SGIhXsOz3zldrXkb_tAip00cKBzRYMC7EE0Zxp1fEdnKzsfXodxLBoCsuEQAvD_BwE&amp;sdid=S6XGMK7H&amp;mv=search&amp;mv2=paidsearch&amp;ef_id=CjwKCAjw7NmzBhBLEiwAxrHQ-SGIhXsOz3zldrXkb_tAip00cKBzRYMC7EE0Zxp1fEdnKzsfXodxLBoCsuEQAvD_BwE%3AG%3As&amp;s_kwcid=AL%213085%213%21700188931134%21e%21%21g%21%21lightroom%21194972224%2115099779464&amp;gad_source=1" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Adobe Lightroom starts at $9.99 per month, with a seven-day free trial.</em></a></p><h2>Create social and marketing content on the fly&nbsp;</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>A dark fairy tale with culinary bite, <em>House of Spoils </em>dives into one chef's pursuit of perfection, a theme viewers might most recently associate with <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-bear-season-3-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>The Bear</em></a><em> </em>or <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-menu-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>The Menu</em></a>. But make no mistake, <em>House of Spoils</em>' similarities to those projects start and end with the fact that they take place in a high-end restaurant.</p><p>The chef in question has no name. She's just Chef (Ariana DeBose, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/west-side-story-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>West Side Story</em></a>), her sense of self so tied to her profession that there's no room for anything else. She gets the chance of a lifetime when she partners with smarmy restaurateur Andreas (Arian Moayed, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/succession-season-4-finale-ending-explained" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Succession</em></a>) on a rural restaurant upstate.</p><p>Covered in ivy and boasting a secret garden, Chef's new restaurant is straight out of a storybook, the magical launchpad for her greatest dream. Yet something is off. Namely, the food. Bugs squirm their way into her every dish, and mold overtakes her ingredients faster than biologically possible. Is this just some run-of-the-mill infestation? Or is it a curse from the property's previous owner, widely rumored to be a witch?</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Although it boasts its fair share of jump scares and ghostly figures lurking in the background, <em>House of Spoils</em>' true horror lies in its food. The sight of bugs crawling just below the surface of a dish calls to mind parasites wriggling below the skin of a host, and the thick blankets of mold-draped food are a surefire way to induce nausea.</p><p>But perhaps the most disturbing element of the restaurant's mysterious curse is how quickly it erases Chef's hard-earned work. Decay decimates an entire night of peaceful cooking prep, throwing a make-or-break meeting with an investor in disarray. Seeing Chef's plans fall apart time and time again, both by supernatural reasons and human doubt from Andreas, elicits more dread than even the spookiest jump scare. (Although those certainly help accentuate the pain!)</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Yet <em>House of Spoils </em>finds a flip side in the challenges Chef faces.

Food stylist Zoe Hegedus crafts concoctions that are as alluring as they are repelling, such as a funky mold-tinged bread and a mushroom dish that Chef encourages people to eat without any silverware. Chef's near-possession by culinary inspiration (or maybe something more?) is intoxicating, with Cole and Krudy luring viewers into a lush yet unsettling world of cooking.</p><h2><strong><em>House of Spoils </em>tackles toxic masculinity in the cooking world.</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p><em>House of Spoils </em>juxtaposes the lush world Chef enters with the cold, hyper-masculine cooking world she came from originally. It was her mentor and former boss Marcello (Marton Csokas) who made that claim about chefs tasting blood. He also asserted that cooking takes balls, a kind of masculinity Chef tries to emulate in her interactions with her co-workers, much to Lucia's disapproval. The sous chef describes fine dining as a "big swinging dick club" and decries some of Chef's "macho posturing." Contrast that with Chef's new gardening focus, which she and Andreas describe as "wild, feminine." In leaving the highly masculine world of her former workplace behind, is Chef discovering and embracing a new part of herself, one she didn't cultivate in favor of molding herself to the standards of other big shot male chefs?</p><p>Complicating matters here is the figure of the witch, who looms over Chef's dreams with an ominous command: "Feed the soil." That, coupled with the bloody, sacrificial vibes of the opening sequence, doesn't paint the most favorable portrait of her approach to cooking either.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/05yAlf3ih69ith1OZRuEXjs/hero-image.jpg" alt="Titan submersible"><p>Remember the Titan submersible?&nbsp;</p><p>Stockton Rush, founder and owner of the underwater tourism company OceanGate, took himself, a Titanic expert, and three tourists on a trip down to the infamous ship's remains on board the submersible in June 2023. However, the crew on the ground lost contact and the wreckage of the Titan submersible was later discovered. The sub had imploded and all five on board died.</p><p>New information about the tragedy is now being uncovered, thanks to an investigation by the U.S. government. Just last week, new footage was <a href="https://in.mashable.com/culture/82411/eerie-footage-shows-titan-submersible-underwater-for-the-first-time-since-2023-tragedy-watch" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>released</u></a> showing the wreckage of the Titan submersible.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, according to former OceanGate contractor Antonella Wilby, we know more about how the now heavily scrutinized OceanGate ran its underwater tourism operation.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>The Titan submersible depended on an Excel spreadsheet</strong></h2><p>During a recent US Coast Guard Marine Board of Investigation hearing, Wilby revealed that OceanGate relied on an Excel spreadsheet to map the submersible&rsquo;s navigation. Furthermore, the data was manually entered by hand into the Excel spreadsheet.</p><p>According to Wilby, the Titan&rsquo;s ultra-short baseline positioning system pulled data on the submersible using sound pings. This included attributes such as the sub's velocity, depth, and positioning.&nbsp;</p><p>As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/20/24250237/oceangate-titan-submarine-coast-guard-hearing-investigation" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>The Verge</u></a> points out, typically, this information would then be automatically collected and compiled into mapping software in order to keep tabs on the location of the submersible.&nbsp;</p><p>OceanGate, however, would write down the data in a notebook and then type it into an Excel spreadsheet.&nbsp;</p><p>Wilby called OceanGate's system "absolutely idiotic."</p><p>&ldquo;There were delays because there was this manual process of first writing down the lat-long coordinates and then typing them in,&rdquo; she explained in the hearing. &ldquo;We tried to do that every five minutes, but it was a lot to do.&rdquo;</p><p>The Coast Guard's investigation into the Titan submersible implosion continues this week.<br></p>]]></content:encoded>

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>Whip up game day snacks this season in a flash and save some money with this deal on the Ninja XL air fryer. It can fit up to three pounds of fries or wings in its 5.5-quart basket, yet it won't take up a ton of countertop space at just 14 inches wide. Beyond crispy air-fried goodness, it can also roast, bake, reheat, and dehydrate at the touch of a button. No need to wait for your oven to heat up. Ahead of October Prime Day, it's on sale for $109.99 at Amazon.

The 11-in-1 multicooker is basically all of your kitchen appliances wrapped up into one magical device. It can pressure cook, steam, slow cook, air fry, sous vide, roast, saut&eacute;, broil, dehydrate, keep foods warm, and make yogurt. It's also dishwasher safe and large enough to fit a five-pound chicken or three pounds of fries. Regularly retailing for $200, you can score it on sale ahead of October's Prime Day for just $129.99. That's 35% in savings and the lowest price we've seen since Black Friday.</p><h3>More multicooker deals</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/QOD4L7?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Instant%20Pot%20Superior%20cooker%20%287.5-quart%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=07CACG0BwjBdW4rXe8pTtsI&short_url=QOD4L7&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Instant Pot Superior cooker (7.5-quart)</a> &mdash; <strong>$59</strong> <s>$79.99</s> (save $20.99)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/ao5pjb?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Cuisinart%203-In-1%20Cook%20Central%20multi-cooker&object_type=article&object_uuid=07CACG0BwjBdW4rXe8pTtsI&short_url=ao5pjb&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Cuisinart 3-In-1 Cook Central multi-cooker</a> &mdash; <strong>$154.08</strong> <s>$199.95</s> (save $45.87)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/9lwkpO?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Instant%20Pot%20Duo%20Crisp%20Ultimate%20Lid%20%286.5-quart%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=07CACG0BwjBdW4rXe8pTtsI&short_url=9lwkpO&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Instant Pot Duo Crisp Ultimate Lid (6.5-quart)</a> &mdash; <strong>$159.99</strong> <s>$229.99</s> (save $70)</p></li></ul><h2>Best blender deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>Can't decide between a full-size blender and a personal one? The nutribullet Blender Combo offers the best of both worlds and it's on sale for under $100. It includes a 1200-watt motor base, a 64-ounce blender pitcher, a 32-ounce single-serve cup, and a 24-ounce single-serve cup with a handle for your at-home and on-the-go needs. Whether you want to whip up a protein shake, a creamy dipping sauce, a chunky salsa, or practically anything else, the three precision speeds, pulse function, and extract program offer all the controls you'll need. Slash nearly 30% off ahead of October Prime Day and get it for just four cents shy of its record-low price.</p><h3>More blender deals</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/z6b7rd?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=BlendJet%20portable%20blender&object_type=article&object_uuid=07CACG0BwjBdW4rXe8pTtsI&short_url=z6b7rd&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">BlendJet portable blender</a> &mdash; <strong>$29.99</strong> <s>$49.95</s> (save $19.96)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/QGVD3K?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Hamilton%20Beach%203-in-1%20blender&object_type=article&object_uuid=07CACG0BwjBdW4rXe8pTtsI&short_url=QGVD3K&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Hamilton Beach 3-in-1 blender</a> &mdash; <strong>$54.99</strong> <s>$74.99</s> (save $20)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/QbnYBx?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=nutribullet%20Pro%2B%20personal%20blender&object_type=article&object_uuid=07CACG0BwjBdW4rXe8pTtsI&short_url=QbnYBx&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">nutribullet Pro+ personal blender</a> &mdash; <strong>$99.95</strong> <s>$129.99</s> (save $30.04)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/QVDZRO?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Ninja%20BL660%20Professional%20blender&object_type=article&object_uuid=07CACG0BwjBdW4rXe8pTtsI&short_url=QVDZRO&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Ninja BL660 Professional blender</a>&mdash; <strong>$99.99</strong> <s>$119.99</s> (save $20)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/aXdZmR?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=nutribullet%20Blender%20Combo&object_type=article&object_uuid=07CACG0BwjBdW4rXe8pTtsI&short_url=aXdZmR&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">nutribullet Blender Combo</a> &mdash;<strong> $99.99</strong> <s>$139.99</s> (save $40)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/QddBGZ?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=nutribullet%20Triple%20Prep%20system&object_type=article&object_uuid=07CACG0BwjBdW4rXe8pTtsI&short_url=QddBGZ&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">nutribullet Triple Prep system</a> &mdash; <strong>$179.99</strong> <s>$229.99</s> (save $50)</p></li></ul><h2>Best coffee maker deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>If the end of the summer of espresso has you feeling down, this deal on the Philips Barista Brew semi-automatic espresso machine might just be the pick-me-up you need. It's regularly a whopping $650, but with a pre-Prime Day discount and an on-page coupon, you'll pay just $399.99. That's about $6 shy of its all-time low price and about a 39% discount overall. This fancy espresso machine allows you to brew like a barista at home, thanks to quality tools like the 58-millimeter portafilter, single and dual-walled filter baskets, a stainless steel milk jug, and a powerful steam wand for frothing.</p><h3>More coffee maker deals</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/ao5pAe?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Keurig%20K-Mini%20Coffee%20Maker&object_type=article&object_uuid=07CACG0BwjBdW4rXe8pTtsI&short_url=ao5pAe&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Keurig K-Mini Coffee Maker</a> &mdash;

This smart TV has 4K Ultra 2160p resolution, Alexa voice control via the voice remote, and access to your faves via the built-in Fire TV. This TV <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> have Dolby Digital Plus or HDR10 like the Amazon 50-inch model, but it&rsquo;s still a solid choice if you're on a budget.</p><h2>Best budget deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00oU2KtAmHV39v2q0X9uogf/hero-image.jpg" alt="a chatgpt logo on a ti-84 calculator"><p>It's pretty remarkable what technically savvy people can accomplish. To wit: A modder <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bicjxl4EcJg" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">posted a YouTube video</a> showing how they got ChatGPT running on a TI-84 calculator. </p><p>Now, how in the world could someone access an AI chatbot on a relatively analog machine designed to do calculations? Well, with a lot of work. </p><p>The creator, ChromaLock, posted how they accomplished the feat in detail.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-Bicjxl4EcJg"></div>
</div>


<p>To be frank, a lot of what they did was beyond my comprehension and certainly beyond my abilities. They used the TI-84's link port &mdash; typically used to transfer educational programs between calculators &mdash; to get internet access and a direct line to ChatGPT. ChromaLock said the ChatGPT-enabled TI-84 would be the ultimate cheating machine, but it doesn't seem likely students everywhere will soon follow their lead. </p><p>The process was pretty complicated, involving a custom circuitboard, a microcontroller, and lots of expertise. It's cool when someone does something so complicated just because they can. Meanwhile, my calculator tricks remain limited to writing the word "hello" by typing the number 0.7734 and turning the screen upside down. </p>]]></content:encoded>

But it tracks heart rate, sleep, rhythm and a variety of other aspects of your fitness journey. Plus, it can sync with your other Android devices to keep everything in check.

<p>The good news is that there seems to be a consensus on what's happening and how to fix it. The predominant theory right now is that the problem is software-based, specifically that the accidental touch algorithm in iPhones (which is meant to disable the screen from unintended taps and swipes) is too sensitive. With the very small bezels on the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max, it might be a little too easy to accidentally have part of your hand on the screen without realizing it, which would disable taps and swipes on the rest of the screen.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>9to5Mac also pointed out that this doesn't happen when the phone is locked, and is much harder to replicate if the phone is in a case. In other words, this is almost certainly a software problem that is fixable on <a href="https://mashable.com/category/apple" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple</a>'s end, and even before that happens, you can avoid it by putting your iPhone 16 Pro in a case or being more careful about where you touch the screen.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Now, released just a few months ago, the Boom 4 is improving on the already great speaker with enhanced deep bass radiators for bigger sound, a new software trick called megaphone, and the coveted USB-C port. It's regularly $149.99, but as of Sept. 23, it's down to just $117.85 at Amazon. That's 21% in savings and the <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0CVFKZ1LC" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">first time it's hit this low of a price</a>.

<p>Tile's starter pack is a solid introduction to Bluetooth tracking devices. It includes one Tile Mate (one of our <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-bluetooth-trackers" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">top picks for a Bluetooth tracker</a>) and one Tile Slim for just $38.56. That's 30% cheaper than buying each one separately. The Tile Mate attaches to your keys, luggage, and more without much bulk, while the Slim is the shape of a credit card, so it can slip inside your wallet or purse. The pair are designed to reliably help you keep track of your stuff through GPS. Plus, you can opt into a paid Tile Premium subscription and unlock extra features, like notifications when you leave stuff behind and item reimbursement.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>The Philips 4000 Series Smart Lock is on sale for just $117.20 at Amazon and serves as a great way to dabble in the smart home world without breaking the bank. It's usually $169.99, so you'll save about 31%. Just remember to check the box for the on-page coupon. We haven't had a chance to test the Philips smart lock, but our friends at <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/philips-4000-series-smart-lock" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">PCMag</a> (also owned by Ziff Davis) have and found it to be a sleek and effective device, but a bit expensive. Like any good smart lock, it gives you multiple ways to lock and unlock your door, including a fingerprint scan, PIN codes, a mobile app, and traditional keys. You'll need to purchase the WiFi bridge separately for remote access and voice control. But luckily, with this discount, you'll keep an extra $52.79 in your pocket. That's more than enough to pay for the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGVDZY?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=WiFi%20bridge&object_type=article&object_uuid=00RMTGCiSp4rhFSx6pRTwKk&short_url=QGVDZY&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">WiFi bridge</a>.</p><p><em>None of these deals catching your eye?

However, he argues, it can "also be used to harm, to threaten, and to intimidate."</p><p>"We, as a district, believe that social media companies must do more to protect and support our students when they use their product," the statement reads. "We believe that social media companies must do more to address threats and intimidation on their platforms. We believe that social media companies must do more to limit access to inappropriate material. To that end, the Lansing School District, along with hundreds of other districts across the country, is engaging in litigation. We look forward to the social media companies taking responsibility for their product and creating a safe environment for our children."</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>While Lansing appears to be the only plaintiff in this case, it's not the only school district in the country suing social media companies. <a href="https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/school-district-lawsuits-against-social-media-companies-are-piling-up/2024/01" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>According to <em>Education Week</em></u></a>, Lansing is just one of 200 school districts that have sued social media companies for similar reasons. In March 2023, the San Mateo County School Board sued YouTube, Snapchat, and TikTok, alleging that social media sites make kids depressed and anxious, leading students to act out, which drains school resources. Other districts have joined consolidated lawsuits against the platforms.</p><p>"Teachers and school administrators have been at the front lines of addressing this crisis and are overburdened by the negative effects on their students &mdash; from how it has affected mental health to behavior in the classroom," Lexi Hazam, an attorney with Lieff, Cabraser, Heimann &amp; Bernstein and co-lead counsel for the plaintiffs in a consolidated lawsuit, told <em>Education Week</em>. "Funds meant for educational purposes have been reallocated to address the misconduct of the corporations behind Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, YouTube, and Facebook. Social media companies should be held accountable and provide support to schools for the harms their products cause."</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

If all this time shifting messes with your head, you're far from alone. Here's your twice-annual reminder about what this all means, and what to do.&nbsp;</p><p>The shortening of days as the weather cools down means Daylight Saving Time (DST) is coming to an end, and it's almost time to switch back to standard time, when we set our clocks back an hour. Yes, this is the clock change where you get an extra hour of sleep, rather than losing an hour of sleep like you do in spring.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>When does Daylight Savings Time end in 2024?</h2><p>DST will technically end on <strong>Sunday, November 3, 2024 </strong>at 2 a.m. local time (if applicable in your area). Your <a href="https://mashable.com/category/mobile" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">smartphone</a> will most likely change itself, but if you have, say, an old grandfather clock in your house, and you want to experience the time change as it happens, wait until 2 a.m. and set your clock back to 1 a.m. &mdash; yes, repeating the hour that just happened.</p><p>Alternatively, just set your grandfather clock back an hour before you go to bed on the night of Saturday, November 2.</p><h2>What does the time change mean practically?</h2><p>The "saved" daylight in the warmer months is the daylight from hours around dawn transferred to the evening, meaning when we set our clocks back, mornings will feel brighter, but the dark will suddenly set in much earlier. You'll gain an extra hour of sleep on Saturday night, which might help you feel more rested on Sunday. You might feel like a night owl that first evening, having dinner under the stars instead of at twilight.</p><h2>Am I in an area where the time change is observed?</h2><p>If you are in the U.S., you probably have to participate in DST, but you might be an exception if you live in:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Hawaii</strong>, where the southern latitudes make the "Daylight Saving" concept less useful</p></li><li><p><strong>U.S. island territories</strong> like Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands (such as Saipan) where residents do not adjust their clocks for essentially the same reason as Hawaii</p></li><li><p><strong>Arizona excluding Navajo Nation</strong>, where there's no time change, just because</p></li></ul><h2>Why do we change our clocks to begin with?</h2><p>"Daylight Saving" is an attempt to make use of "extra" daylight during the evenings in warmer months. Shifting the clock in the summer means the already longer days feel radically longer because most people's wake-ups are recalibrated to occur around sunrise, rather than having the first hour of valuable summer sunshine occur when most people are asleep. &nbsp;</p><p>In the colder months, when there's no "extra" daylight to be conserved, we return to standard time, which re-aligns most of our wake-up times with the sunrise, and temporarily restores the accuracy of the term "high noon" because the sun is straight overhead once again.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I played a radio station curated just for me and it launched a classical music tune called "Piano Sonata No. 18 in D Major" by Yeol Eum Son. Since the Apple Watch Series 10 is so small and compact, I expected a tinny, metallic sound.</p><p>To my surprise, the song sounded richer, smoother, and more lush than I thought it'd be. I don't know how I could expect any different. If there's anything Apple gets right, it's nailing warm, full-bodied, balanced audio, whether it's on a <a href="https://mashable.com/review/15-inch-macbook-air-m2" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">MacBook</a>, a pair of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/airpods-4-hands-on-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">AirPods</a>, the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/iphone-16-pro-iphone-16-pro-max" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a> <strong>&mdash; </strong>and now, the Apple Watch.</p><p>Keep in mind, however, that I tested this in a quiet room, so my expectations were still high going into this quick shower experiment.</p><p>Before hopping the shower, I decided to switch gears and play some Frank Ocean.</p><p>I played "Thinking Bout You," swayed to the chill tune, and turned on the faucet to start the shower. I stepped in, but noticed one <em>tiny</em> little problem: the water droplets hitting the shower floor were overpowering Frank Ocean's crooning.</p><p>Even when I tried to turn the digital crown to increase the volume to the max, I could barely hear the song while showering. <em>Bummer!</em></p><p>The Watch Series 10's speakers aren't tinny, but they are <em>definitely</em> quiet.

<h2>What is Connections?</h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <a class="text-gray-600" href="https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1679674590203723778?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(opens in a new window)">

    </a>
</blockquote>
<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. Like <em>Wordle, </em>you can share the results with your friends on social media.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

Words can be made from linked letters &mdash; up, down, left, right, or diagonal, but words can also change direction, resulting in quirky shapes and patterns. Every single letter in the grid will be part of an answer. There's always a theme linking every solution, along with the "spangram," a special, word or phrase that sums up that day's theme, and spans the entire grid horizontally or vertically.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>By providing an opaque hint and not providing the word list, Strands creates a brain-teasing game that takes a little longer to play than its other games, like <a href="https://mashable.com/category/wordle" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Wordle</a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/category/connections" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Connections</a>.</p><p>If you're feeling stuck or just don't have 10 or more minutes to figure out today's puzzle, we've got all the NYT Strands hints for today's puzzle you need to progress at your preferred pace.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

Words can be made from linked letters &mdash; up, down, left, right, or diagonal, but words can also change direction, resulting in quirky shapes and patterns. Every single letter in the grid will be part of an answer. There's always a theme linking every solution, along with the "spangram," a special, word or phrase that sums up that day's theme, and spans the entire grid horizontally or vertically.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>What is Connections?</h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <a class="text-gray-600" href="https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1679674590203723778?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(opens in a new window)">

</blockquote>
<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. Like <em>Wordle, </em>you can share the results with your friends on social media.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/02jVfb3AmRRUVHIxnOIEd1F/hero-image.jpg" alt="TikTok logo on a phone screen"><p>California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill on Friday that could entirely reshape how kids in the state use social media. Among the potential changes: A requirement that could effectively reshape the TikTok "For You Page" as minors now know it. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>The bill, SB976, is set to take effect in 2027 in the state home to many of tech's biggest companies. There are two major components. One: It would bar social media platforms from providing "addictive feeds" &mdash; defined as feeds based on info given by or collected on the user &mdash; to minors with parental consent. And two: It would bar social media platforms from sending notifications to minors (sans parental approval) between 12 a.m. and 6 a.m., and between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m. on weekdays during the school year. </p><p>In short: Minors' feeds would have to be chronological order feeds of people they followed. That would mean, effectively, no more "For You Page" on TikTok or other such algorithmic recommendation-based feeds. </p><p>"Every parent knows the harm social media addiction can inflict on their children &mdash; isolation from human contact, stress and anxiety, and endless hours wasted late into the night," Newsom said in a statement, via the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/california-social-media-addiction-children-law-bc649326701f892a16be1159bc008d71" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Associated Press</a>. "With this bill, California is helping protect children and teenagers from purposely designed features that feed these destructive habits."</p><p>It should be noted that the law makes the aforementioned actions towards minors illegal "unless the operator does not have actual knowledge that the user is a minor." Which seems to leave some space for minors who get around potential regulations. However, the bill's authors note that the state's attorney general will have to implement age verification and parental consent regulations by 2027, though it remains unclear what those would look like. </p><p>Now, of course, TikTok is <a href="https://mashable.com/article/tiktok-ban-court-case-update" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">already engulfed in a legal battle with the U.S. government</a>, so there's a chance it's not even around in the U.S. in 2027. But no matter the social media landscape in a few years, this law would completely shift how the platforms operated.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-09-20/newsom-to-sign-california-bill-to-limit-addictive-social-media-feeds-for-kids" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>L.A. Times</em> reported the bill </a>has "an unusual collection of opponents," including the ACLU of California, Equality California, and associations representing tech giants like TikTok and Meta. While the law would have a massive effect on how kids use social media, it seems reasonable to assume there will be a legal battle between now and 2027. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Based on the novel by Peter Brown, <em>The Wild Robot </em>strands us on a deserted island alongside ROZZUM unit 7134 (voiced by <a href="https://mashable.com/video/lupita-nyongo-hot-ones" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Lupita Nyong'o</a>). Unable to complete tasks for her human owners as her programming demands, ROZZUM &mdash; or "Roz" for short &mdash; looks to the island's many wild animals to try to fulfill her function.</p><p>It quickly turns out that these animals don't love a robot barreling down on them with a cheerful cry of, "Do you need assistance?" No matter that Roz can mimic their movements or understand their language; to the inhabitants of this island, she's a frightening intruder, and is treated as such. Without any understanding of the island's ecosystem, Roz winds up in dust-ups with everyone from thieving raccoons to frightening bears, leaving her dinged up and all alone.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Roz's initial isolation opens the floodgates on the first of<em> The Wild Robot</em> many sob-worthy moments<em>. </em>I dare you not to hear her confused plea, "Did anyone order me?" without your heart breaking. Someone help this robot find her purpose, please!</p><p>That purpose comes to Roz in the form of an unhatched goose egg, the last survivor of its nest.

<p>Sanders is no stranger to crafting films that meld the classic fish-out-of-water trope with unlikely friendships. <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em>'s eponymous human-alien pairing is one of the greats, along with the dragon-rider dynamic between <em>How to Train Your Dragon</em>'s Hiccup and Toothless. With Roz and Brightbill in<em>The Wild Robot,</em> Sanders hits the jackpot once again. </p><p>Brightbill and Roz may be a goose and a robot, but so many of their interactions feel true to those between human parents and children. Roz is constantly concerned about doing right by Brightbill &mdash; something a wry mother possum named Pinktail (voiced by Catherine O'Hara) tells her is par for the course of parenting. Meanwhile, Brightbill walks the line between wanting independence and worrying about what will happen if he migrates away from Roz. Sure, he and Roz fight in the way that only mothers and teenagers do, but it's clear that they know they're each other's whole world.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>That sense of closeness is made all the stronger by the fact that both Roz and Brightbill are viewed as "defective" by members of their own kind. When Roz encounters the occasional other robot, they are confused by her ability to feel at all. For his part, Brightbill takes after his mother, developing a near-robotic voice and punctuating his every move with a whir or beep in order to mimic her, a habit that other geese find off-putting. Of course, in the end, these differences end up being Roz and Brightbill's greatest strengths, a message that, while nothing revolutionary, always bears repeating.</p><p><em>The Wild Robot </em>also widens its scope beyond Roz and Brightbill, showing how Roz relates to the island's other critters. In another one of the film's most touching relationships, Roz relies on conniving fox Fink (voiced by Pedro Pascal) for help with Brightbill. His philosophy, like that of many other animals on the island, is that there's one rule to life: Eat, or be eaten. Roz sees things differently, proposing that kindness can be its own survival mechanism. Over the course of the film, Fink and the other animals' outlooks shift from the former to the latter, a testament to Roz's impact on those around her. She's changing the island as much as it is changing her.</p><h2><strong>Roz is the next great movie robot.</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Roz's ability to bring misfits and entire communities together places her in conversation with other great animated robots in film, like Wall-E and the Iron Giant. So does her individual transformation, which <em>The Wild Robot </em>crafts with tremendous care. </p><p>Nyong'o's voice acting is impeccable here, and vital to Roz's journey. At the start of the film, she voices Roz as relentlessly chipper, with a hard robotic edge that mirrors how Roz stands out in an otherwise all-natural environment. As <em>The Wild Robot </em>continues, Nyong'o adds more emotions to Roz's vocal toolbox, letting her get mad, uncertain, and exasperated. The end result is a voice that's full of feeling yet still carries traces of the robotic; it's the culmination of a breathtaking tightrope of a vocal performance.</p><p>Nyong'o's work goes hand in hand with Roz's extraordinary design and animation. Her dynamism and versatility as a character &mdash; she can be a crab! A lighthouse! A builder! &mdash; is matched only by that of the artists who brought her to life. Every scene gives you something new to notice about Roz, whether it's the ever-flickering displays in her eyes or how the light strips along her body convey emotion. Like Nyong'o's performance, Roz's design also charts her arc on the island, with each mechanical injury or occasional plant growth acting as exquisite visual storytelling.</p><h2><strong><em>The Wild Robot </em>is a visual marvel.</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Speaking of exquisite, it's impossible to talk about <em>The Wild Robot </em>without highlighting its gorgeous animation. DreamWorks has shifted away from the 3D CGI look somewhat in past years, with a more illustrative style on display in films like <em>The Bad Guys </em>and <a href="https://mashable.com/video/puss-in-boots-antonio-banderas" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Puss in Boots: The Last Wish</em></a>. For <em>The Wild Robot</em>, Sanders opts for a watercolor-inspired aesthetic, with the film looking like something out of a fairy-tale storybook.</p><p>Pristine forests and tidal pools bloom to life on screen, their blue and green hues a sharp contrast to Roz's metal-gray plating and blinking lights. Flocks of geese take flight in a dazzling airborne montage. Roz's bright lights slash through a driving snowstorm. Each image is a marvelous snapshot on its own. But together, they create something wholly incredible, making <em>The Wild Robot </em>an unforgettable viewing experience and a perfect capstone to celebrate DreamWorks' 30th anniversary.</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/lVKqN?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3Btemplate=article&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=The%20Wild%20Robot%20hits%20theaters%20Sept.%2027.&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=03clwc9MKQejuJCF0xgE8fu&amp%3Bshort_url=lVKqN&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2F2024-fall-movie-preview&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=The%20Wild%20Robot%20was%20reviewed%20out%20of%20its%20premiere%20at%20Fantastic%20Fest.%20It%20hits%20theaters%20Sept.%2027.&object_type=article&object_uuid=00VXmiktrCkFZykYiuT3FKe&short_url=lVKqN&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>The Wild Robot </em>was reviewed out of its premiere at Fantastic Fest.<em> </em>It<em> </em>hits theaters Sept. 27.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

On the other hand, if you found out that none of them have atmospheres, that would be pretty sad, but also pretty interesting.

And the Jupiter region only receives three to four percent of the sunlight that <a href="https://mashable.com/article/earth-pictures-images-from-space" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Earth</a> receives. Hence the long wings, or arrays.</p><p>"You just need these giant solar arrays in order to power all your instruments," Phillips explained. "We're talking about a huge expanse of solar arrays."</p><p>Capturing loads of the distant sunlight will create some 700 watts of electricity, which is "about what a small microwave oven or a coffee maker needs to operate," NASA explains. But the craft also carries batteries to help power a host of moon-sleuthing instruments.</p><p>"I'm really excited about this payload that we're bringing to Europa," Phillips said. </p><q>
    "I'm really excited about this payload that we're bringing to Europa."

<p>An ice-penetrating radar will look beneath the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nasa-europa-flyby-moon-science" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">moon's icy, cracked crust</a>. It will see how this icy subsurface is composed, and <em>possibly, possibly</em>, detect where the ice meets the ocean. (Europa's ice shell is likely some 10 to 15 miles, or 15 to 25 kilometers, thick.) This radar could detect about half a mile deep, or it could be much more &mdash; that depends on how fractured the ice is and the purity of the ice (a fractured subsurface, for example, means the radar signal will bounce around more, as opposed to penetrating down). There's potential, however, that the radar will infiltrate a whopping 19 miles (30 kilometers) down. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>In addition to a suite of specialized cameras, Europa Clipper also carries an instrument called the SUrface Dust Analyzer, or SUDA, that will literally sample particles of Europa that have been ejected into space by tiny meteorites. "Micrometeorites constantly blast fragments of Europa&rsquo;s surface into space," <a href="https://europa.nasa.gov/spacecraft/instruments/suda/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">NASA explains</a>. "The ejecta are individually small, but scientists estimate that half a ton (about 500 kilograms) of Europa&rsquo;s surface material floats above the moon at all times." </p><p>One of the most exciting opportunities of the mission &mdash; though far from guaranteed &mdash; is the craft potentially flying through a water-ice plume blasted out from Europa's surface.

    "We would love to fly through a plume."
    </q>
<p>Plumes or not, mission scientists believe that some 50 close flybys of the surface will provide ample observations to prove whether or not Europa could harbor <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-prove-alien-life" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">life</a>.

And many of these lines were reddish, suggesting that something below the surface welled up to fill them. Planetary scientists also knew that as Europa swings by the gravitationally powerful gas giant Jupiter, its interior gets stretched and pulled, a process that produces heat on a world. This tugging could have provided heat on Europa for billions of years.</p><p>"This made Europa really, really interesting," Phillips noted.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Then, in the 1990s, NASA's Galileo mission captured legendary views of Europa's chaotic, ridged surface &mdash; suggesting there was water near the top. What's more, the spacecraft detected a strong magnetic signal from the moon. Saltwater, a really good magnetic conductor, could have provided this signal.</p><p>"Galileo showed Europa was even more interesting than suspected," Phillip said.</p><q>
    "It's a great detective story."

We won't know, until we get there in 2030. </p><p>"This is a voyage into the unknown," said Nicola Fox, who heads NASA's Science Mission Directorate.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Plus, you don't want something you're constantly fussing with; your headphones should help you stay focused during your exercises. </p><p>Mashable reviewers have tested <em>many</em> pairs of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-headphones" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">headphones</a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-earbuds" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">wireless earbuds,</a> and we can tell you which products stay put during a workout, and which buds will go tumbling onto the sidewalk as soon as you break into a run. To make sure we're recommending the right products, I tested five pairs of audio products during my daily workouts, ultimately choosing four. </p><h2>How to pick headphones for working out</h2><p>The right headphones for you depend significantly on the kinds of workouts you like to do and where you like to do them. If you <a href="https://mashable.com/article/strava-anxiety-joy-self-surveillance" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">like to run outdoors</a>, you need headphones that keep you safe in busy areas with reliable noise transparency. If you're pumping iron at the gym, you might prefer sports earbuds that block out the world with active noise cancellation so you can really lock in for your reps.</p><p>For this guide, I looked for two universal specs in all of the headphones I tested. First, workout headphones need to be wireless, giving you a full range of movement. You don't want to get tied up on the stairclimber.</p><p>Second, workout headphones need to be sweat- or water-resistant. This one is obvious. When you're working out, you're getting sweaty, and you want headphones that won't freak out at the first sign of moisture. Your gym earbuds don't have to be fully waterproof, but this will be helpful for outdoor athletes.</p><h2>Why are there no over-the-ear headphones on this list?</h2><p>When we review <a href="https://mashable.com/category/headphones" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">headphones</a> at Mashable, we look at all types, from <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-wireless-headphones" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">over-the-ear headphones</a> to <a href="https://mashable.com/category/earbuds" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">earbuds</a>, but you won't find any over-the-ear products here. The reason for this is simple: these headphones aren't good for working out. While we usually love them for their comfort and audio quality, their heft gets in the way when you're moving.</p><p>Plus, over-the-ear headphones and sweat are a terrible combination. Sweat gets under the ear pads, trapping moisture and leading to the headphones' fabric or leather disintegrating over time. Not to mention, they'll get smelly fast. But don't worry; if you don't like earbuds, you still have options.</p><p>So, whether you're hitting the gym or the pavement, here are the best earbuds and headphones for working out.</p>]]></content:encoded>

And just like <em>Wordle</em>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-20-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> resets after midnight and each new set of words gets trickier and trickier&mdash;so we've served up some hints and tips to get you over the hurdle.</p><p>If you just want to be told today's puzzle, you can jump to the end of this article for July 23's <em>Connections</em> solution. But if you'd rather solve it yourself, keep reading for some clues, tips, and strategies to assist you.</p><h2><strong>What is <em>Connections</em>?</strong></h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>When you receive a copypasta, you're supposed to copy and paste it &mdash; hence the name &mdash; and send it to more of your contacts. It's intended like a piece of chain mail, which we first started seeing around 2006 on 4chan. It was <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/copypasta" target="_blank">added the dictionary</a> in May 2021. </p><p>Many people remember these texts from middle school ("send this to 10 ppl or you'll never get kissed"), and there are, of course, various other ways the fun text format is used (spreading <a href="https://www.snopes.com/news/2020/12/29/fight-covid-home/" target="_blank">misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic</a>, for instance). We saw a modern <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/23/17890516/forward-this-or-youll-die-in-seven-days-on-the-persistence-of-chain-letters" target="_blank">resurgence of these chain messages in 2018</a>, but they seemed more tied to the texts you might get in middle school. Eventually, they floated into holiday territory and got a lot hornier (e.g., <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/18g1dff/merry_christmas_bitches/" target="_blank">Santa&rsquo;s about to slide &#127877;&#127998;&#128521; down your hot &#128293; hot &#128293;chimney tonight</a>). They became more political and more sexually explicit than ever before. And today, they're synonymous for the breaking news alert. </p><p>There's plenty of reasons for this evolution. The people who write them aren't terribly concerned with accuracy, so they can move quickly with breaking news. Our political world is continuously disappointing us in new and more horrifying ways, and copypastas are one way to add some levity to a system that has left us jaded. As <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/viral-copypasta-kissinger-santos-memes-1234910331/" target="_blank">several copypasta writers told CT Jones in <em>Rolling Stone</em> in 2018</a>, "the meme format isn&rsquo;t just a good laugh&mdash; it&rsquo;s a way for people to use humor to address a world that has become increasingly dystopian."</p><p>But I fear something for fans of the copypasta: its death may be approaching. </p><p>There's a cycle memes often fall victim to, not one unlike anything else embedded in popular culture. It looks like this: origin, niche spread, viral spread, peak popularity, adaptation and mutation, decline, obsolescence, and an optional resurgence. We're solidly in copypasta's second life &mdash; in the "adaptation and mutation" phase. The texts have moved from holiday texts and messages suited for middle schoolers to some of the horniest NSFW texts you'll receive. We got horny copypastas on the <a href="https://x.com/blossomreyn0lds/status/1479199904178311173" target="_blank">anniversary of the insurrection anniversary</a>, when former <a href="https://x.com/aubsburr/status/1796318591538585709" target="_blank">President Trump was convicted,</a> when someone attempted to <a href="https://x.com/carolinemurs/status/1812328761666244738" target="_blank">assassinate former President Trump</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/_sarah_rose_22/status/1815098422917243017" target="_blank">plenty about Biden dropping out</a>.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Adapting the meme by adding the horniness has kept it relevant for longer, but it can't stave off a decline forever. Eventually, we'll get bored of it, because the copypasta is mainstream. Its shock quality has been replaced with predictability &mdash; a sign of doom for anything that has any hope of maintaining comedic value. As Skyler Higley, a comedian and staff writer at After Midnight, <a href="https://x.com/skyler_higley/status/1815109012578570707" target="_blank">posted on</a> <a href="https://mashable.com/category/twitter" target="_self">X</a>: "it&rsquo;s all the same now. Joe Biden drops out. You get one of those long texts with the emojis. Someone posts the future meme 'biden dropping out reminds me of how I quit you'. people post fake texts between them and Biden. Et cetera. I feel empty."</p><p>We're reaching peak copypasta &mdash; and I'm calling it. We only have a few months before we all decide that copypastas have actually been lame all along and we experience a new meme renaissance. Start preparing your obituaries.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2><strong>iPhone 15 vs. iPhone 15 Pro: price</strong></h2><p>The iPhone 15 has a <a href="https://zdcs.link/qeXRq?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=starting%20price%20of%20%24800%20via%20Apple%27s%20official%20website&object_type=article&object_uuid=05pOpXtThV5P0vXJmxtgMrN&short_url=qeXRq&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">starting price of $800 via Apple's official website</a> &mdash; and it comes with the following specs:</p><ul><li><p><strong>128GB of storage</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>6GB of RAM</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>A16 Bionic chipset</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>6.1-inch display </strong></p></li></ul><p>Keep in mind that you can get more storage, but it'll cost you. If you want 256GB of storage, the iPhone 15 will set you back $900. Speaking from experience, I'd recommend getting the 256GB variant, particularly if you love hoarding photos and videos. Otherwise, the 128GB model will haunt you with a "storage full" error, forcing you to delete your treasured media content within a year (or less) of use.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>If you're a big spender, you can get the iPhone 15 with 512GB of storage, which costs $1,100. But if you have enough money to spend on <em>that</em>, you'd be better off upgrading to the iPhone 15 Pro with 256GB of storage, which is <strong><em>exactly</em> </strong>the same price.</p><p>Speaking of the iPhone 15 Pro, it has a <a href="https://zdcs.link/OyRg2?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=starting%20price%20of%20%24999%20via%20Apple%27s%20official%20website&object_type=article&object_uuid=05pOpXtThV5P0vXJmxtgMrN&short_url=OyRg2&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">starting price of $999 via Apple's official website</a> and comes with the following specs:</p><ul><li><p><strong>128GB of storage</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>8GB of RAM</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>A17 Pro</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>6.1-inch display</strong></p></li></ul><p>The most expensive iPhone 15 Pro, packed with 1TB of storage, will set you back $1,500.

However, if you don't mind deleting a few stuff along the way, or you have cloud storage, the 128GB variant should be fine.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h2><strong>iPhone 15 vs. iPhone 15 Pro: design</strong></h2><p>Cue Sia singing "Titanium" at the top of her lungs! The iPhone 15 Pro's biggest selling point is that it consists of a titanium frame, making it lighter and more durable than its predecessor's stainless-steel chassis.</p><p>The iPhone 15, wrapped in an aluminum enclosure, doesn't have a hint of titanium. <em>Womp, womp</em>! It is, however, a little lighter than its Pro sibling (6.03 ounces vs. 6.6 ounces).</p><p>As far as colors are concerned, I'd argue that the iPhone 15's colors are more fun and lively.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>They also have the same resolution: 2,256 x 1,179 pixels</p><p>Although the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro Max share the same screen size, they do <em>not </em>have the same display tech. For example, the iPhone 15 does <strong><em>not</em></strong><em> </em>have ProMotion technology nor does it have an Always-On display &mdash; but the Pro model has both of these perks.</p><p>What's ProMotion? It's just a fancy term for, "This phone has a variable refresh rate of up to 120Hz." In other words, the iPhone 15 Pro has a zippier display that adapts to your workflow. If you're simply scrolling through an article, the refresh rate will slowdown. However, if you fire up a fast-paced mobile game, the refresh rate will pick up. </p><p>Conversely, the iPhone 15 has a refresh rate of 60Hz, which will feel slower only if you've ever owned a phone with a refresh rate of 90Hz or higher. And for the uninitiated, an Aways-On display lets you get information like time, widgets, and more at a glance because &mdash; well &mdash; the screen is always on. I can't say the same for the iPhone 15.</p><p>Both have the snazzy <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-iphone-15-dynamic-island-standard" target="_self">Dynamic Island</a> featured at the top of the display, and plus, the duo can climb to a peak brightness of 2,000, according to Apple.</p><h2><strong>iPhone 15 vs. iPhone 15 Pro: cameras</strong></h2><p>Cameras are one of the biggest selling points smartphones, and as you might have guessed, the iPhone 15 Pro has an edge over the iPhone 15. Here's a break down of the camera specs:</p><h3><strong>iPhone 15</strong></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Wide camera - 48MP</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Ultrawide camera - 12MP</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Selfie camera - 12MP</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>No telephoto</strong></p></li></ul><h3><strong>iPhone 15 Pro</strong></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Wide camera - 48MP</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Ultrawide camera - 12MP</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Selfie camera - 12MP</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Telephoto - 3X optical zoom</strong></p></li></ul><p>Unlike the iPhone 15 Pro, the iPhone 15 does not have a telephoto lens, which means that zoomed-in shots will have a dip in quality. It's also worth nothing that the iPhone 15 Pro's ultrawide lens has a slightly wider aperture, which means low-light shots in dim environments should have a better outcome.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The iPhone 15, unlike the iPhone 15 Pro, does not support macro photography, Apple ProRAW, nor Night Mode portraits. (This isn't to be confused with Night Mode, which the iPhone 15 <em>does </em>have. It's just not available for portrait mode.) </p><h2><strong>iPhone 15 vs. iPhone 15 Pro: performance</strong></h2><p>The iPhone 15 Pro, without a doubt, is zippier and beastlier than the iPhone 15, thanks to its new A17 Pro Bionic chip. Meanwhile, the iPhone 15 sports the chipset featured inside the iPhone 14 Pro models: the A16 Bionic.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

Whether it's the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-pixel-watch-2-announcement-release-date" target="_self">Google Pixel Watch</a>, the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/galaxy-watch-4-review" target="_self">Samsung Galaxy Watch</a>, or the <a href="https://mashable.com/category/apple-watch" target="_self">Apple Watch</a>, all seemed superfluous for anyone who has a phone. When people tried to persuade me to join the smartwatch squad, they always brought up fitness as a use case, which has never been a priority for me &mdash; until now.</p><p>After hearing my doctor tell me that my blood pressure is too high, I decided to take exercise more seriously. What <em>really </em>drew me to consider an Apple Watch, however, is that I want to make sure I'm hitting &mdash; and maintaining &mdash; a target heart rate while running on the treadmill, ensuring effective calorie burning.</p><p>One of the best ways to track heart rate is to use an Apple Watch. But I've been faced with a dilemma. Should I get the SE (second generation) or spend a little more for the Watch Series 9? I decided to get both to determine their differences.</p><p><strong><em>Note: </em></strong><em>Keep in mind that Apple is reportedly working on the next-generation smartwatch known as the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-watch-10-everything-rumor-we-know-so-far" target="_self">Apple Watch Series 10.</a></em><em> </em></p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2><strong>Apple Watch Series 9 vs. SE: price and specs</strong></h2><p>I got the cheapest model for both variants. This means I spent $249 for the Apple Watch SE (second generation), which I purchased from <a href="https://zdcs.link/b1Veo?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%27s%20official%20website&object_type=article&object_uuid=041zHV4nuEy4RO8CDB4dhK0&short_url=b1Veo&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Apple's official website</a>.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The model I have comes with the following specs:</p><ul><li><p><strong>40mm case size</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Silver finish</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Aluminum chassis</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>GPS (no cellular)</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Ocean Blue solo loop</strong></p></li></ul><p>Some features require you to shell out a little more. For example, a stainless steel chassis is an extra $50. A larger case size (i.e., 44mm) is an extra $30. If you want GPS <em>and</em> cellular support, that will set you back $50.</p><p>The Apple Watch Series 9 costs $399 on <a href="https://zdcs.link/noZnj?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%27s%20official%20website&object_type=article&object_uuid=041zHV4nuEy4RO8CDB4dhK0&short_url=noZnj&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Apple's official website</a> (again, this is the cheapest you can get in this model).</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2><strong>Apple Watch Series 9 vs. SE: Display</strong></h2><p>The first thing I noticed about the Watch SE is that it has thicker bezels, which reduces its screen real estate &mdash; and the display is minimal to begin with.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The Watch Series 9's bezels are a lot less obstructive, but either way, I still found display navigation to be fine on both screens. Thicker bezels, in my opinion, aren't a big deal. </p><p>It's also worth nothing that the resolution is different for the watches:</p><p><strong>Watch Series 9 (41mm) - 430 x 352 pixels </strong></p><p><strong>Watch SE (40mm) - 394 x 324 pixels </strong></p><p>Looking at them side by side, the Watch Series 9 definitely delivers a sharper, clearer visuals. But if I were looking at the Watch SE independently, I would think that the display quality is sufficient enough. </p><p>Now, let's talk brightness:</p><p><strong>Watch Series 9 (41mm) - up to 2,000 nits</strong></p><p><strong>Watch SE (40mm) - up to 1,000 nits</strong></p><p>The Watch Series 9 is supposedly brighter than Series 9, delivering a max of 2,000 nits over the SE's 1,000-nit screen. However, while comparing both watches in the sun, I could see both of them just fine, even with the rays shining bright on them like a spotlight. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>You can tell the Watch SE is <em>slightly </em>dimmer, but the difference is negligible to the naked eye.</p><p>The main difference between the two screens, however, is the always-on display. I thought I wouldn't care about the Watch SE not having an always-on display (AOD). (For the uninitiated, AOD means that the screen is always feeding you visual information.)</p><p>However, I found myself getting frustrated that I had to keep either touching the Watch SE's screen or flick my wrist toward myself to check the time. Meanwhile, the Watch Series 9, well, <em>stays on</em>. As you can see in the photo below, the Watch SE's screen is completely dark, but the Series 9's display is still "active" (though it is dimmed). </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>I went with the Silver finish for the Watch SE along with the Ocean Blue solo loop &mdash; and I regret it. Oddly, the solo loop collects dirt easily. And unlike the sports band that's featured on the Watch Series 9, the solo loop requires custom sizing. Mine is a size 3, which fits OK, but it could stand to be a smidge tighter.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The sports band has an adjustable strap, allowing me to make it as tight or loose as I need it to be. The solo loop, on the other hand, is just a stretchy bracelet band.

<p>With the Apple Watch Series 9, you simply need to make sure it's turned on in Settings &mdash; and you can use Double Tap to accept and end calls, turn off alarms, play and pause songs, and more. However, with the Watch SE, you can only use Double Tap when prompted. For example, a blue-outlined prompt that says "End call" will appear on the Watch SE, allowing you to hang up. </p><p>It's worth noting, though, that the Watch Series 9's Double Tap feature lets you do more with it. For example, you can use Double Tap to trigger the shutter button on the Camera app or scroll through your Widget stacks (things you can't do with the Watch SE's Double Tap).</p><p><strong>Winner: </strong>Apple Watch Series 9</p><h2><strong>Apple Watch Series 9 vs. SE: Siri</strong></h2><p>Apple boasted that the Watch Series 9 lets you tap into Siri for your health data.

<p>Its worth noting that its <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-watch-fda-mddt" target="_self">AFib detection is the first digital-health tech</a> to qualify for the FDA's MDDT program. In other words, an official authority in the medical device space has green-lighted the Apple Watch for testing atrial fibrillation.

And, well, the Watch SE doesn't have a temperature sensor.</p><p>However, whether I was on the SE or Series 9, I could still log my menstrual cycle, allowing me to check when my next estimated cycle will arrive.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Speaking of the temperature sensor, on the Watch Series 9, you can get temperature readings of your skin by going to <strong>Settings &gt; Health &gt; Health Data &gt; Body Measurements &gt; Wrist Temperature</strong>. Not sure why I need to know that my right wrist is 96 degrees Fahrenheit, but er, it's there in case anyone asks, I guess.</p><p>Interestingly, I also noticed that both watches test for environmental noise using the mics.

<p>This is a surprising because Google typically rolls out its Pixel phones in the fall.</p><p>For reference, here are <a href="https://www.stuff.tv/features/google-pixel-9-preview-specs-rumours-release-date/" target="_blank">the release dates</a> for the previous device launches:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro - Oct. 4, 2023</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro - Oct. 6, 2023</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro - Oct. 19, 2023</strong></p></li></ul><p>The only time Google did <em>not </em>launch in October was in 2020, the year when the pandemic shook up the tech hardware industry. (Even Apple didn't launch their iPhone until October that year, even though they typically unveil their new handsets in September.)</p><h2><strong>Google Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro price</strong></h2><p>There aren't any credible rumors on pricing, however, Google already increased the price tags of both devices last year, bumping them by $100.</p><p>As such, we doubt that Google will instate yet another price hike for 2024. That being said, the expected price tags for the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro are the following:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Pixel 9 - $699</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Pixel 9 Pro - $999</strong></p></li></ul><p>Interestingly, however, according to <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/google-pixel-9-renders-design-exclusive/" target="_blank">91Mobiles</a>, Google may consider bringing a <em>third </em>phone into the mix, offering a trio of devices similar to the Galaxy S24 series.

<p>This wouldn't be the first time the Google introduced an "XL" phone into the mix. The last time we saw an "XL" device was the Pixel 5 series &mdash; and we haven't seen it since.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro XL will reportedly have the following specs:</p><ul><li><p><strong>6.5-inch, QHD+, OLED display with 120Hz refresh rate</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Triple-camera setup</strong></p></li></ul><p>Interestingly, if these specs are accurate, Pixel 9 Pro XL will feature a slight reduction from the Pixel 8 Pro's 6.7-inch display.</p><p>You may be wondering, "What does it look like?" Funny story. So popular leaker @Onleaks, also known as Steve H.McFly on X, revealed what they<em> thought</em> was the Pixel 9 Pro on Jan. 24. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>The Pixel 9 will have a dual-camera rear setup. The Pixel 9 Pro, alongside the Pixel 9 Pro XL, will reportedly have a triple-camera setup. At the time of writing, details on the shooters' specs are sparse.</p><h2><strong>Google Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro specs</strong></h2><p>According to <a href="https://rozetked.me/news/33143-eksklyuziv-zhivye-foto-google-pixel-9-pro-ot-rozetked" target="_blank">Rozetked</a> and 91mobiles, you'll find the next-gen Tensor chip inside the Pixel 9 series, likely the Tensor G4 processor.</p><p>Per the former, the Pixel 9 Pro will sport 16GB of RAM, a step up from the Pixel 8 Pro's 12GB of memory. As more companies take deeper plunges into the world of AI, this isn't surprising. While running AI in the background, these devices are going to need all the memory they can get.</p><p>Other specs you'll reportedly find across the Pixel 9 series:</p><ul><li><p><strong>New Qi2 charging technology, which increases wireless charging up to 15W and offers better alignment (similar to MagSafe)</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>New "Adaptive Touch" feature, which lets you adjust the display's sensitivity based on your surroundings</strong></p></li><li><p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-pixel-9-satellite-connection-addition-rumors" target="_self"><strong>Satellite connectivity</strong></a><strong> via a Samsung modem upgrade</strong></p></li></ul><p>The next big Google event is Google I/O, but don't expect the search-engine tech giant to reveal any of the Pixel 9 devices there. </p><p>Instead, keep an eye out for the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-pixel-8a-leak-colors" target="_self">Google Pixel 8a</a>.

The majority were of young girls. Offenders were also documented sharing advice and even AI models fed by real images with each other. </p><p>"Without proper controls, generative AI tools provide a playground for online predators to realize their most perverse and sickening fantasies," wrote IWF CEO Susie Hargreaves OBE. "Even now, the IWF is starting to see more of this type of material being shared and sold on commercial child sexual abuse websites on the internet."</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>According to the snapshot study, there has been 17 percent increase in online AI-altered CSAM since the fall of 2023, as well as a startling increase in materials showing extreme and explicit sex acts. Materials include adult pornography altered to show a child&rsquo;s face, as well as existing child sexual abuse content digitally edited with another child's likeness on top. </p><p>"The report also underscores how fast the technology is improving in its ability to generate fully synthetic AI videos of CSAM," the IWF writes. "While these types of videos are not yet sophisticated enough to pass for real videos of child sexual abuse, analysts say this is the &lsquo;worst&rsquo; that fully synthetic video will ever be. Advances in AI will soon render more lifelike videos in the same way that still images have become photo-realistic."</p><p>In a review of 12,000 new AI-generated <em>images</em> posted to a dark web forum over a one month period, 90 percent were realistic enough to be assessed under existing laws for real CSAM, according to IWF analysts. </p><p>Another UK watchdog report, published in the <em>Guardian </em>today<em>,</em> alleges that Apple is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jul/22/apple-security-child-sexual-images-accusation" target="_blank">vastly underreporting</a> the amount of child sexual abuse materials shared via its products, prompting concern over how the company will manage content made with generative AI. In it's investigation, the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) compared official numbers published by Apple to numbers gathered through freedom of information requests. </p><p>While Apple made 267 worldwide reports of CSAM to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) in 2023, the NSPCC alleges that the company was implicated in 337 offenses of child abuse images in just England and Wales, alone &mdash; and those numbers were just for the period between April 2022 and March 2023. </p><p>Apple declined the <em>Guardian's</em> request for comment, pointing the publication to a previous company decision to not scan iCloud photo libraries for CSAM, in an effort to prioritize user security and privacy. Mashable reached out to Apple, as well, and will update this article if they respond.</p><p>Under U.S. law, U.S.-based tech companies are required to report cases of CSAM to the NCMEC. Google reported more than 1.47 million cases to the NCMEC in 2023. Facebook, in another example, removed <a href="https://transparency.meta.com/reports/community-standards-enforcement/child-nudity-and-sexual-exploitation/facebook" target="_blank">14.4 million pieces of content</a> for child sexual exploitation between January and March of this year. Over the last five years, the company has also reported a significant decline in the number of posts reported for child nudity and abuse, but watchdogs <a href="https://www.comparitech.com/blog/vpn-privacy/child-abuse-online-statistics/" target="_blank">remain wary</a>. </p><p>Online child exploitation is <a href="https://mashable.com/article/online-child-exploitation-dangers" target="_self">notoriously hard to fight</a>, with child predators frequently exploiting social media platforms, and their conduct loopholes, to continue engaging with minors online. Now with the added power of generative AI in the hands of bad actors, the battle is only intensifying. </p><p>Read more of Mashable's reporting on the effects of nonconsensual synthetic imagery:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/ai-deepfake-porn-what-victims-can-do" target="_self">What to do if someone makes a deepfake of you</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/explicit-deepfake-mental-health-recovery" target="_self">Explicit deepfakes are traumatic.

We're expecting it to launch alongside the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/iphone-16-rumors" target="_self">iPhone 16</a> in September.</p><p>We're not too far from September, so as you can imagine, the leaks, rumors, and spilled beans have been flooding in.

<h2><strong>Apple Watch 10 release date</strong></h2><p>As mentioned, the Apple Watch 10 is expected to drop in September 2024. For reference, here are the release dates for some of the previous-generation Apple Watch devices.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Apple Watch Series 9 - Sept. 12, 2023</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Apple Watch Series 8 - Sept. 7, 2022</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Apple Watch Series 7 - Oct. 18, 2021</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Apple Watch Series 6 - Sept. 15, 2020</strong></p></li></ul><p>Save for the Watch Series 7, which was released in October, all the other smartwatches dropped in September, so we're expecting the same for the Apple Watch 10.</p><h2><strong>Apple Watch 10 price</strong></h2><p>There haven't been any credible leaks about pricing, but Apple Watch 10 is expected to have the same starting price as its predecessor: $399. This is because there haven't been many price hikes for the Apple Watch models in recent years, so we're expecting a similar strategy in 2024.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>For reference, the display size on the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-watch-series-9" target="_self">Watch Series 9</a> is somewhere between 1.6 inches and 1.8 inches, depending on the size you get. The Apple Watch Ultra's display is 1.9 inches big. That being said, Gurman is technically claiming that the Watch 10 will offer a new display size that comes closer to the 2-inch mark. </p><p>Gurman's claims echoed <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/2h24-%E6%96%B0%E6%AC%BEapple-watch%E9%97%9C%E6%B3%A8%E7%84%A6%E9%BB%9E-series-10-%E9%89%91%E5%8A%9B%E7%89%B9-3d%E5%88%97%E5%8D%B0-the-focus-of-the-2h24-new-apple-watch-series-10-and-98075c44ce92" target="_blank">a report from Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, another respected Apple analyst, who said that the Apple Watch 10 will feature new sizes: 45mm and 49mm (as opposed to 41mm and 45mm).</p><p>You may be wondering, "If the Watch 10 display will be closer to the Apple Watch Ultra 2, does it follow that the Watch Ultra 3 will get a redesign, too?" According to Gurman, the next-generation Apple Watch Ultra will not feature any significant design changes. Keep in mind that the Ultra line is relatively new, getting its debut in 2022.</p><p>Kuo also claims that Apple may add a new color of a darker hue to the Apple Watch 10, but the specific color is unclear.</p><p>Finally, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-08-13/apple-event-september-12-2023-apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-watch-x-later-ll9geb3n" target="_blank">Gurman claims</a> that the Watch 10 will feature a new magnetic mechanism for bands, making it easier to swap them out for other styles.</p><h2><strong>Apple Watch 10 new features</strong></h2><p>According to Gurman, here are the following health tools that Apple has been working on for the Apple Watch:</p><ul><li><p><strong>blood-pressure monitor</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>sleep apnea sensor</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>glucose monitor</strong></p></li></ul><p>However, according to Gurman, the blood-pressure sensor has been hitting a couple of snags during testing. So unfortunately, while the Cupertino-based tech giant may have planned to add the new health tool to the Apple Watch 10, it may not make it to the final product. As such, it may be postponed until the Apple Watch 11.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>"There have been particular concerns about the blood-pressure feature working properly with the new Series 10 design," Gurman said. Even if the new blood-pressure monitor <em>does </em>launch on the Apple Watch 10, it won't be a reliable alternative to the blood-pressure cuff. It's not supposed to give an actual reading. Instead, it will determine your baseline and determine whether your blood pressure is high based on that reference point.</p><p>The sleep apnea sensor, which depends on user's blood-oxygen levels, is also facing some challenges.

<p>This new processor will lay the groundwork for some AI-powered features in the future, however, don't expect <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-intelligence-ai-siri-wwdc-2024" target="_self">Apple Intelligence</a>, the company's new suite of AI features, to hit the Apple Watch models anytime soon.</p><h2><strong>Will the Apple Watch 10 be worth it?</strong></h2><p>If Apple Watch 10 can pull through with at least one new health tool, like sleep apnea detection and blood-pressure monitoring, it will definitely be more helpful for those who want to keep track of interruptive snoring and hypertension. Plus, the Apple Watch 10 has steep competition, considering that the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 already has these features.</p><p>If Apple isn't able to fix the snags it's been reportedly dealing with regarding the new health tools, it may be worth it to wait for the Apple Watch 11.</p><p>Keep in mind that there is also the Apple Watch Ultra 3 and potentially a new Apple Watch SE to watch out for, too.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h2>iPhone SE 4: 3 biggest upgrades</h2><p>These are some big upgrades and big news for those who love Apple devices, but don't want to spend a month's rent on a device.</p><h2><strong>Face ID</strong></h2><p>The upcoming iPhone SE 4 is rumored to feature Face ID and USB-C, marking a departure from the Touch ID Home button and Lightning port of previous models. These changes align with broader trends in Apple's product line, emphasizing convenience and compatibility with other devices.</p><h2><strong>Larger OLED Display</strong></h2><p>Another anticipated addition is a larger 6.06-inch OLED display, up from the current model&rsquo;s 4.7-inch screen. This would be the first time an iPhone SE model features an OLED panel, promising richer colors and better contrast.</p><h2><strong>Performance Boost</strong></h2><p>Finally, The iPhone SE 4 is  expected to offer up to 8GB of LPDDR5 memory, an A18 chip, and an aluminum chassis. Alongside a single rear 48-megapixel camera, the new generation SE should be able to match the performance of the rumored <a href="https://mashable.com/article/iphone-16-rumors" target="_self">iPhone 16</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[A new recovery tool from Microsoft helps speed up the process to fix computers affected by the faulty CrowdStrike update.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01iB3bysiZ8hvXVmTWeEX7f/hero-image.jpg" alt="CrowdStrike logo over the Blue Screen of Death"><p>The <a href="https://mashable.com/article/what-caused-the-microsoft-outage-crowdstrike-everything-we-know" target="_self"><u>massive global tech outage</u></a> that occurred on Friday due to an error in an update from the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike may largely be out of the public's mind today. And that's thanks to IT admins and departments around the world who sprung into action to fix the problem that took down many airlines, hospitals, and banks' Windows-based networks.</p><p>However, while things may be all and well for consumers, ITs are actually still dealing with getting their company's <a href="https://mashable.com/article/crowdstrike-windows-outage-what-now-consequences" target="_self">computers back up and running</a>. As Mashable previously reported, the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/what-caused-the-microsoft-outage-crowdstrike-everything-we-know" target="_self">faulty CrowdStrike update</a> that went out requires a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/crowdstrike-crash-microsoft-outage-bsod-fix" target="_self">technical fix</a> and direct access to each individual affected device. So, for big organizations, this will take awhile.</p><p>But, ITs now have a major assist thanks to an easier <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/new-recovery-tool-to-help-with-crowdstrike-issue-impacting/ba-p/4196959" target="_blank"><u>recently released fix from Microsoft</u></a>.</p><h2><strong>Microsoft's CrowdStrike recovery tool</strong></h2><p>CrowdStrike issued an updated fix soon after the faulty version went out, but for many computers that had automatically installed the update it was too late. Once installed <a href="https://mashable.com/article/crowdstrike-crash-microsoft-outage-bsod-fix" target="_self"><u>the fix</u></a> became a manual process that involved booting the computer in Safe Mode to get around the Windows "Blue Screen of Death" and then deleting the update file.</p><p>While this could be a bit technical for the average Windows user, it's not a problem for an IT professional. The issue, though, is that this is a time-consuming process: Boot into Safe Mode. Find the update file. Delete. Repeat. It has to be done for every single affected individual machine.&nbsp;</p><p>Microsoft's fix, released over the weekend, speeds things up considerably. Yes, the fix still requires manual work on every single computer. But, the more tedious processes are automated.&nbsp;</p><p>The recovery tool by Microsoft utilizes a bootable USB drive that logs into a lightweight version of Windows known as Windows Preinstallation Environment or Windows PE. From there, it automatically deletes the CrowdStrike update file that's causing the issue on the affected computer.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/21/24202883/microsoft-recovery-tool-windows-crowdstrike-issue-it-admins" target="_blank"><u>The Verge</u></a> points out, this saves time as it&nbsp; "avoids having to boot into Safe Mode or a requirement of admin rights on the machine, because the tool is simply accessing the disk without booting into the local copy of Windows."&nbsp;</p><p>While a third-party was responsible, the only affected devices were computers running Microsoft's Windows operating system. So, it appears Microsoft felt compelled to act in order to help out its many affected customers.</p><p>Microsoft has also provided <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5042421-crowdstrike-issue-impacting-windows-endpoints-causing-an-0x50-or-0x7e-error-message-on-a-blue-screen-b1c700e0-7317-4e95-aeee-5d67dd35b92f" target="_blank"><u>detailed steps</u></a> to fixing the CrowdStrike issue on various versions of Windows computers, including details on the USB tool.</p>]]></content:encoded>

If you're a fan of Amazon's ecosystem, and own a few Echo or Fire TV devices already, then this <a href="https://zdcs.link/joED1?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Amazon%20Fire%20TV%20Soundbar&object_type=article&object_uuid=01gxwnHaEisG9TELkkap2QP&short_url=joED1&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Amazon Fire TV Soundbar</a> might be worth your money.</p><p>As of July 22, the Amazon Fire TV Soundbar is back to its <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0C4BZ28PG" target="_blank">lowest price</a> of $99.99. That's a $17% discount, knocking off $20 off the list price of $119.99. Good soundbars are expensive, so this Amazon pick which lands under $100 is a great way to add some zest to your home theatre setup.</p><p>The key highlight here is that despite the budget price, this soundbar packs in a ton of features. You get dual speakers, which means proper stereo sound. In addition, this has all the Dolby bells and whistles, including Dolby Atmos for deep, crisp sound. You also get support for DTS Virtual:X, which promises three-dimensional virtual audio. What this means is you can expect clear, booming sound that fills your living room.</p><p>Picking a soundbar can be difficult because of the number of options available. The Amazon Fire TV soundbar is an easy pick for those who have Amazon Fire TV, letting you control the two devices with a single remote.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-airpods-max-review" target="_self">AirPods Max</a> dropped 28% to their lowest price on record during Prime Day, making them one of our favorite tech purchases during the two-day shopping event. A week later, they're now even cheaper at $382.70. That's a new record-low price for the fancy Apple headset. "The <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-prime-day-tech-deals-2024" target="_self">AirPods Max</a> are stupidly comfy, they sound amazing, look good, and play nice with Apple gadgetry," Senior Editor Stan Schroeder writes. There's just one catch: only the pink pair are down to the all-time low price.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>In the market for a new TV? It's hard to beat this $300 discount on a 65-inch ULED Fire TV. While it's not the lowest price on record, the Hisense 65-inch U6HF ULED Fire TV is a great deal for only $449.99. It features Hisense's version of QLED technology, which incorporates a blend of LED backlighting, local dimming, and quantum dot color enhancement for a richer visual appearance that's still budget friendly. It also packs smooth motion handling for gamers, lots of local dimming zones, a bezel-less design, and a dedicated gaming mode. </p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>Some air fryers are unnecessarily complicated and have a hefty learning curve. The Dash Tasti-Crisp makes things easy. Its analog design features just two knobs &mdash;&nbsp;one for temperature and one for time. Just select both, pop in your food, and you're good to go. This 2.6-quart version is pretty small, but if you're only cooking for one or two people, it should get the job done. And at only $34.99, it won't set you back too much. That's a savings of 30% with Prime and its lowest price on record.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>I didn't think about the need for a printer until I had multiple Amazon labels I needed to attach to returns with no way of retrieving them. Buying your own definitely pays off in time and energy. You don't need to spend a fortune, either. This HP DeskJet printer is down to a record-low $49.99 and can get the job done. Better yet, it comes with three months of ink to get you started.</p><p><em>None of these deals catching your eye?

The post contains leaked photos of what is purported to be a Google Pixel 9 Pro XL, which would be a new addition to the Pixel portfolio. Google plans to show off its latest line of Pixels at <a href="https://store.google.com/magazine/google_pixel_9_pro?hl=en-US" target="_blank">an event on Aug. 13</a>. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

            Google reveals Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro Fold in new videos
            <svg class="inline-block ml-1 w-4 h-4 font-normal fill-current"><use href="https://mashable.com/images/icons/spritemap.svg#sprite-arrow-right-thin"></use></svg>

<p>In the past year or so, Google has released four Pixel phones: The <a href="https://mashable.com/review/google-pixel-8-and-pixel-8-pro" target="_self">Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro</a>, the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/google-pixel-fold-review" target="_self">Pixel Fold</a>, and the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/google-pixel-8a-review" target="_self">Pixel 8a</a>. We already know for a fact that <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-pixel-9-pro-fold" target="_self">Google will show off</a> the Pixel 9 Pro and a new Pro version of the Pixel Fold on Aug. 13. That would normally leave just the regular Pixel 9 (a theoretical Pixel 9a wouldn't launch until next year), but if this leak is true, there will also be a Pixel 9 Pro XL for Google to show off.</p><p>There isn't a lot else to glean from this leak, unfortunately. The model posted in the leak apparently has 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, as well as a new internal modem courtesy of Samsung, per 9to5Google. It's difficult to tell from the photos without a direct comparison how much bigger it is than the Pixel 9 Pro &mdash; or if there are any noteworthy tech spec differences on the inside. </p><p>But still, if you've been wanting a bigger Pro Pixel, this might be your year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>We've seen 55-inch TVs from Hisense at a lower price than this 50-inch TV deal. However, smaller TV sizes are not too common today, so a 50-inch TV at this price isn't bad, especially if you have a smaller room. This is also the <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B09WNJT9X3" target="_blank">lowest price</a> we've seen on this particular model, which makes it a good time to buy it.</p><p>In addition to the smaller size, which means sharper picture at the same resolution, this TV also has QLED technology. What that means is that you get smaller lighting zones with the backlight, leading to better local contrast. So, the dark scenes will look better on this TV.</p><p>QLED, or Quantum dot LED TVs are a step up from LED and OLED models. They give a stellar price-to-performance ratio currently, so you're getting better value than an OLED TV. QLED TVs also give you the best picture quality without significant risk of burn-in. This particular model also comes pre-loaded with Amazon's Fire TV, which is an excellent smart TV platform, so you don't have to worry about the UI and app support.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>What happened to Grover Tully in episode 6?</h2><p>Lord of Riverrun, and the most important figure in swaying the allegiances of the ever-crucial Riverlands, Grover Tully, has been sick throughout Season 2. But in episode 6, we finally get word that he's passed away.</p><p>"Lord Grover is dead," <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-4-simon-daemon-harrenhal" target="_self">Castellan Simon Strong</a> (Simon Russell Beale) tells Daemon at the episode's end. "He'd been ill, of course. Riverrun's maesters have been at their wits' end. Our own healer, Alys Rivers, volunteered her renowned skills &mdash; she plied her craft, but there was naught more to be done."</p><p>At this, Daemon smiles, as if he suspects there was more to it than that. So was there?</p><h2>Did Alys Rivers kill Lord Tully?</h2><p>The short answer? Almost certainly yes. Lord Tully was a thorn in Daemon's side because his condition meant that Daemon was unable to approach him directly to ask for his allegiance.</p><p>Earlier in the episode, Daemon asks Alys Rivers for her counsel on how to keep the Riverlords in line.

<p>If you didn&rsquo;t get the chance to splurge during Prime Day, you might be in luck &mdash; Apple&rsquo;s most-coveted and most expensive noise-cancelling headphones, the Airpods Max, have hit a new record low price on Amazon. </p><p>Just in time for back-to-school season, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/2erVE?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=AirPods%20Max&object_type=article&object_uuid=052tBAY63FZV0XkLEZfiPEu&short_url=2erVE&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">AirPods Max</a> are currently on sale for $382.70, down from $549. That&rsquo;s $166.30 off the regular price, making this the lowest price we've ever seen for Apple's premium over-the-ear headphones. During Prime Day, the AirPods Max were <a href="https://mashable.com/article/prime-day-deal-2024-apple-airpods-max" target="_self">discounted to $394.99</a>, but this deal beats that by over $12. </p><p>While the AirPods Max may not be everyone&rsquo;s cup of tea, given their high price tag, they are some of the best noise-cancelling headphones on the market. They have remarkable sound quality, effective active noise cancellation, and a sleek design in a variety of color options. According to <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-airpods-max-review" target="_self">Mashable&rsquo;s review</a>, the AirPods Max &ldquo;check off almost all the boxes for what makes an excellent pair of headphones: great sound quality, ideal battery life, easy controls, and a stylish design."</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[In "House of the Dragon" Season 2, episode 6, Alicent speaks to her brother about her other son, Daeron. But who is he?]]></description>

Just take a look at <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-targaryen-family-tree-season-2" target="_self">the Targaryen family tree</a>: We have Aegon II (Tom Glynn-Carney), Aemond (Ewan Mitchell) and Helaena (Phia Saban), of course, but there's also another son who's never appeared in the show: Daeron.</p><p>You could be forgiven for thinking this spare kid was all but cut out, but after episode 6 it looks like he might finally be getting a look in.</p><p>So who exactly is Daeron, where is he, and how might he feature in the rest of Season 2?</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>Who is Daeron?</h2><p>Alicent's third son isn't in the show because, unlike his brothers and sister, he doesn't reside in the Red Keep. Daeron was sent to ward at Old Town when he was young, where he's been raised with the rest of the Hightower clan.</p><p>He's been mentioned in passing before &ndash; and he features in the book, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-book-vs-show" target="_self"><em>Fire &amp; Blood</em></a> &ndash; but it's not until episode 6 that we really learn all that much about him.</p><h2>What do we learn about Daeron in episode 6?</h2><p>When Alicent says goodbye to her brother, Ser Gwayne (Freddie Fox), she asks him about Daeron. We learn from Gwayne that he's sixteen years old, before the knight gives Alicent's third son the following, fairly glowing review.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>"He's stalwart," Gwayne says. "Clever. As adept with his lute as he is with his sword. And a feature in the fancies of many a young lady, I'd wager. He's kind."</p><p>This final tidbit is the one Alicent latches onto. "That's good," she replies. "Kindness is a quality I've found lacking in his brothers."</p><h2>Could Daeron be important later on in Season 2?</h2><p>Judging by <a href="https://mashable.com/video/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-7-trailer" target="_self">the trailer that's just been released for episode 7</a>, it seems the answer might be yes. He only gets a brief mention, but it's a significant one.</p><p>"Prince Daeron's dragon has taken to wing," says a voice in the preview, while we see shots of Aemond looking concerned at a Small Council meeting. "The Hightower host will be unstoppable."</p><p>So we know Daeron has a dragon, which already makes him kind of a big deal &mdash; but why does a mention of the Hightowers have the Small Council looking worried? They're on the same side after all, aren't they?</p><p>On paper, yes, but don't forget Aegon II recently banished his grandfather and former Hand, Otto Hightower (Rhys Ifans), from the Red Keep &mdash; and that Otto hasn't been returning Alicent's letters. Is it possible that he and his other grandson, Daeron, have been plotting something from Old Town?</p><p>We'll have to wait and see, but it is worth noting that Daeron definitely won't be appearing on screen this season. <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/house-of-the-dragon-twins-deaths-fight-funeral-1236035742/" target="_blank">As showrunner Ryan Condal confirmed to Variety</a>, he hasn't been cast yet.</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/el4jA?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3Btemplate=article&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=New%20episodes%20of%20House%20of%20the%20Dragon%20air%20Sundays%20at%209%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20HBO%20and%20Max.&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=00imlCa1Zf2bZssHTCnPdle&amp%3Bshort_url=el4jA&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Fhouse-of-the-dragon-season-2-book-vs-show&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=New%20episodes%20of%20House%20of%20the%20Dragon%20air%20Sundays%20at%209%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20HBO%20and%20Max.&object_type=article&object_uuid=04LgN2q2InrvDrWpfoc08AG&short_url=el4jA&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">New episodes of <em>House of the Dragon </em>air Sundays at 9 p.m. ET on HBO and Max.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"As we continue operational recovery, we apologize for the disruptions many customers are experiencing. Canceling a flight is always a last resort &amp; not taken lightly," Delta <a href="https://x.com/Delta/status/1815112343010861139" target="_blank">wrote in a post</a> on X. "We&rsquo;re notifying customers about delays &amp; cancellations in their itinerary via the Fly Delta app &amp; text message &amp; offering re-booking options that can be managed online."</p><p>United Airlines is another airline who was hit hard by the CrowdStrike outage, but it recovered better, having cancelled 266 flights on Sunday, Reuters reported. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>According to <a href="https://www.flightaware.com/live/cancelled/" target="_blank">FlightAware</a>, there has been a total of 771 flight delays globally on Monday, and a total of 1,084 cancellations today, 745 of which are within, into, or out of the United States. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/009ruRrs9mj1EV4sBRwG4kT/hero-image.jpg" alt="A phone displaying the New York Times game 'Connections.'"><p><em>Connections</em> is the latest <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/connections" target="_blank"><em>New York Times </em>word game</a> that's captured the public's attention. The game is all about finding the "common threads between words." And just like <em>Wordle</em>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-20-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> resets after midnight and each new set of words gets trickier and trickier&mdash;so we've served up some hints and tips to get you over the hurdle.</p><p>If you just want to be told today's puzzle, you can jump to the end of this article for July 22's <em>Connections</em> solution. But if you'd rather solve it yourself, keep reading for some clues, tips, and strategies to assist you.</p><h2><strong>What is <em>Connections</em>?</strong></h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <a class="text-gray-600" href="https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1679674590203723778?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(opens in a new window)">

<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. Like <em>Wordle, </em>you can share the results with your friends on social media.</p><h2><strong>Here's a hint for today's <em>Connections</em> categories</strong></h2><p>Want a hit about the categories without being told the categories?

"><p>One of the best horror movies of 2024 has an ending that's sublimely sick and satisfying. And that very last shot came by chance.&nbsp;</p><p>When <a href="https://mashable.com/article/oddity-wooden-man-damian-mccarthy" target="_self">Mashable sat down with </a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/oddity-wooden-man-damian-mccarthy" target="_self"><em>Oddity </em></a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/oddity-wooden-man-damian-mccarthy" target="_self">writer/director Damian McCarthy</a> &mdash;&nbsp;and the Wooden Man at the film's center &mdash;&nbsp;we learned how the last brutal beat in the multifaceted horror story came to be.&nbsp;</p><p>Sure, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/oddity-review" target="_self"><em>Oddity</em></a> begins with a frightening premise of home invasion: a woman alone, renovating her remote country house, hears a knock at the door only to be confronted by a wild-eyed stranger who warns her that someone has snuck inside and means to hurt her. But from there, McCarthy pulled from folk horror, haunted house movies, and killer doll flicks to craft a menacing medley of a movie, which has an anthology feel even as it centers on one house and the doomed people who cross its threshold.&nbsp;</p><p>While the flashiest figure in <em>Oddity </em>is undoubtedly its Wooden Man, McCarthy also looped in a pretty but haunted bell to strike the perfect tone for the film's final moment.</p><p>Be warned, the following will dig into spoilers for <em>Oddity'</em>s third act.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Oddity's </em>ending explained.&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The woman in the opening is Dani, the dark-haired twin to blonde (and blind) medium Darcy, who owns an oddity shop&nbsp;for which the film might well be named. When we first meet Darcy, she's mourning her sister, who was murdered a year before in the aforementioned country home. Reunited with her brother-in-law, Ted, Darcy tells the tale of a haunted desk bell she holds in her hands.&nbsp;</p><p>"There was a man &mdash; not a very pleasant one &mdash;&nbsp;who spent most of his life working as a bellboy at a hotel," she explains in the film's first act. "And one night, he was showing a drunk guest to his room, and the guest shoved him down the stairs, and he broke his neck and died in the fall. And a few days later, the receptionist rang the bell to summon the <em>new </em>bellboy. Only who did she see running towards her &mdash;&nbsp;not looking very happy?"&nbsp;</p><p>While Darcy is visibly enchanted by the story, Ted scoffs, daring her to ring the bell and "see what happens." She warns him, "It's not something to be played with, Ted, seeing as the last two people who rang it were found dead."&nbsp;</p><p>The bell will be set aside as they discuss the grim anniversary of Dani's death. But in the final scene, it comes back. After the true villain behind Dani's death has been revealed, and those who've gotten their hands bloody have paid for their sins, Ted returns to his home to find a package mailed from Darcy's shop. Clearly, before she surprised him and his girlfriend with the Wooden Man in the crate, she'd sent this small box off for a final part of her plan. And what lies inside? The haunted desk bell.&nbsp;</p><p>Home alone &mdash; as Dani was at the movie's start &mdash;&nbsp;Ted takes out the bell. And even now &mdash;&nbsp;even after his girlfriend's insistence on seeing Dani's ghost, his colleague's tale of the rampaging Wooden Man, and Darcy's cryptic threats &mdash;&nbsp;his mind is closed to the possibilities of the paranormal. So, Ted sits down and rings the bell, tempting fate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>He looks around his home and sees no dead bellboy. But just as it seems the movie might end &mdash; with Little Willie John's jaunty R&amp;B track "Now you Know" playing &mdash;&nbsp; McCarthy's <em>Oddity</em> cuts to a wide shot. In the foreground, Ted smiles, feeling smug about his seeming victory. But behind him &mdash; out of his line of view &mdash;&nbsp;is a dead bellboy, standing still but nonetheless menacing.&nbsp;</p><p>The film cuts to the credits, but even unseen, Ted's fate is assured.&nbsp;</p><h2>Damian McCarthy reveals how the ending of <em>Oddity </em>came to be.&nbsp;</h2><p>Speaking with Mashable, McCarthy said of <em>Oddity, </em>"One of the things that I wanted to do with the film was just that it would never take itself too seriously." While the movie involved murder, vengeance, and ghouls, there is a cheeky humor woven throughout. "The way people talk to each other, they're quite sarcastic or cutting," McCarthy said of his characters, adding, "I think that just makes the film more enjoyable."&nbsp;</p><p>From there, he revealed that this final moment &mdash;&nbsp;that final, darkly funny wide shot &mdash;&nbsp;was stumbled across in production. "We found that on the set," McCarthy explained, "Because originally, it was supposed to end with a close-up of this figure that's come for Ted." While the crew was setting up the next shot, Gwilym Lee, who plays Ted, and Shane Whisker, who plays the bellboy, were waiting patiently on set: the former seated at the dining table, the latter standing behind him with his hands folded at his belly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"They were just taking a break between setups," McCarthy recalled, "And just looking at it &mdash; Shane couldn't move because the contact (lenses) he was wearing completely blinded him. So he said, 'I'll just be safer standing here' &mdash;&nbsp;the way he's standing at the end of the film. And Ted was just taking five sitting down. And I was at the other side of the room, and like, 'That's a really interesting shot. Let's just get that as well.' And that ended up becoming the better, much funnier, darker ending than the one we originally planned."&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/dM6Gx?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3Btemplate=article&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=Oddity%20opens%20in%20theaters%20July%2019.&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=04ltb1ETMNcOkYIz1mOguWc&amp%3Bshort_url=dM6Gx&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fhelios-preview.mashable.com%2Farticle%2Foddity-wooden-man-damian-mccarthy&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Oddity%20opens%20in%20theaters%20July%2019.&object_type=article&object_uuid=05JTkHgOwPAvgHlNZ8uzUgH&short_url=dM6Gx&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><em><u>Oddity</u></em><u> opens in theaters July 19.</u></a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Here's where we are three days on from CrowdStrike's global Windows outage.</p><h2>CrowdStrike outage impacted 8.5 million Windows computers</h2><p><a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/07/20/helping-our-customers-through-the-crowdstrike-outage/" target="_blank">In a blog post on Saturday</a>, Microsoft revealed that an estimated 8.5 million Windows devices were impacted by the CrowdStrike update. While that is an undeniably enormous number, the company noted that it was still "less than one percent of all Windows machines."</p><p>"While the percentage was small, the broad economic and societal impacts reflect the use of CrowdStrike by enterprises that run many critical services," wrote Microsoft's Vice President of Enterprise and OS Security David Weston.</p><h2>Hundreds of U.S. flights are still being cancelled or delayed</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Though airlines are working to get back on track, they're definitely still seeing the effects of the CrowdStrike outage. Flight tracker FlightAware reported that <a href="https://www.flightaware.com/live/cancelled/today" target="_blank">1970 flights to, from, or within the U.S. were cancelled</a> on Sunday, while 9934 such flights were delayed.</p><p>For comparison, there were 932 cancellations and 12,579 delays on Thursday, the day before the outage.</p><h2>Bad actors have disguised malware as a CrowdStrike fix</h2><p>Amidst Friday's chaos, CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz warned people to stay vigilant for <a href="https://mashable.com/article/crowdstrike-statement-outage-bad-actors-exploit" target="_self">bad actors attempting to exploit the situation</a>. Though <a href="https://mashable.com/article/crowdstrike-crash-microsoft-outage-bsod-fix" target="_self">CrowdStrike had published a workaround for the outage</a>, the danger remains that panicking white-collar workers may first encounter malware disguised as a fix.</p><p>It was a pertinent warning. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fake-crowdstrike-fixes-target-companies-with-malware-data-wipers/" target="_blank">Bleeping Computer</a> reports that bad actors posed as CrowdStrike or the BBVA Bank and instructed people to install malware in at least two nefarious campaigns.

<h2>CrowdStrike's outage could cost billions of dollars</h2><p>With the dust slowly settling, many are wondering who will pay for the financial losses the global outage caused. Calculating the cost of the CrowdStrike outage is a tall order at this early stage, not in the least because systems are still recovering. However, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/21/business/crowdstrike-outage-cost/index.html" target="_blank">experts claim that it could</a> <a href="https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/counting-the-cost-economists-weigh-in-on-the-major-it-outages-impact-on-australia/1dx3d2e5x" target="_blank">amount to billions of dollars</a>.</p><p>Whether CrowdStrike's clients can claim compensation from the company will depend on factors such as the exact terms of their contract and whether it was breached. Failing that, those impacted may attempt to argue claims such as negligence. Either way, New Zealand law firm Russell McVeagh considers class action lawsuits <a href="https://www.russellmcveagh.com/insights-news/the-largest-it-outage-in-history-crowdstrikes-routine-software-update/" target="_blank">"a real possibility"</a> considering the massive scale of the outage.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

      <description><![CDATA[The ROG Ally X can play AAA games like a smooth criminal, but it's missing some of the Steam Deck's charm â and it's out of Asus' control.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/reviews/03oUS6NoeRBQ4F0TWsKP5q0/hero-image.jpg" alt="Asus ROG Ally X on a table"><p>The <a href="https://mashable.com/article/asus-rog-ally-x-hands-on" target="_self">Asus ROG Ally X</a> is like when you meet your crush's hot brother. Your crush is cute and all, but his brother? He's more refined, more mature, and more attractive. </p><p>Similarly, the ROG Ally X, a slight upgrade from the ROG Ally, isn't <em>too </em>different from its sibling. No, the tweaks won't have you screaming, "Stop the presses!", but they bring an air of sophistication to the ROG Ally X. They're intentional and purposeful, signaling that Asus has been listening to user feedback.</p><p>For one, the ROG Ally X no longer comes in white. Woo-hoo!</p><p>I know Asus likely wanted to stand out of the crowd with a white chassis for the ROG Ally X. After all, most of the Steam Deck wannabes have black models. However &mdash; and many gamers will agree with me when I say this &mdash; a white handheld gaming console will expose my snacking habit with tell-tale stains. And we don't want that!</p><p>Although this ain't no ROG Ally 2, this handheld gaming PC still holds its own in a Steam Deck-dominated market.</p><h2><strong>Asus ROG Ally X price and specs</strong></h2><p>The <a href="https://zdcs.link/6XngZ?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=ROG%20Ally%20X%20costs%20%24799&object_type=review&object_uuid=03oUS6NoeRBQ4F0TWsKP5q0&short_url=6XngZ&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">ROG Ally X costs $799</a> and comes with the same CPU and GPU as its predecessor, but there are some minor differences.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Before diving into Asus' tiny tweaks, allow me to list the specs:</p><ul><li><p><strong>AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>AMD Radeon GPU</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>24GB LPDDR5 on-board RAM</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>1TB of SSD storage</strong></p></li></ul><p>As mentioned, the processor and graphics have remained the same on ROG Ally X, but the RAM got upgraded from 16GB to 24GB while the 512GB storage got doubled to 1TB.

<p>My gripes are the Menu, Armoury Crate, View, and Command Center buttons: the symbols are too subtle and difficult to see. A brighter white for the icons would be nice. Plus, I wish the analog sticks were more symmetrical. However, the buttons and sticks are sturdy, steady, and clicky (and tighter and more resistant compared to the OG ROG Ally).</p><p>As a cherry on top, the sticks have LED light rings that add a gorgeous design touch to the ROG Ally X.</p><p>On the top, as expected, you'll find the right and left bumpers and triggers.</p><p>On the back, you'll find the programmable M1 and M2 buttons with satisfying tactile feedback. On the OG ROG Ally, these buttons used to sit annoyingly on top of the grips, but now they're <em>away </em>from your fingers. On the underside, you'll also find air vents and a diagonal, lustrous strip to add some eye-catching detail.</p><h3><strong>Weight and feel</strong></h3><p>The ROG Ally X is <em>slightly </em>heavier than the 1.4-pound <a href="https://mashable.com/review/steam-deck-oled" target="_self">Steam Deck OLED</a> with a weight of about 1.5 pounds. However, it's <em>much </em>lighter than the Lenovo Legion Go, which weighs about 1.9 pounds.</p><p>For what it's worth, the OG ROG Ally's weight matched the Steam Deck OLED.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Steam Deck OLED - 1.4 pounds</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Asus ROG Ally - 1.4 pounds</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Asus ROG Ally X - 1.5 pounds</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Lenovo Legion Go - 1.9 pounds</strong></p></li></ul><p>Out of all three, however, I still find the Steam Deck OLED to be the most comfortable. The ROG Ally's grips, where your hands are wrapped around while gaming, don't protrude as much as the Steam Deck, which is a downside. The Steam Deck's bulging grips give me more to hold on to during gameplay, providing a more comfortable experience.</p><p>But compared to the OG ROG Ally, the ROG Ally X <em>does </em>have fuller grips, which is a plus. And it's less bumpy, too, for a smoother feel. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>If you're coming from a Steam Deck to an ROG Ally X, you'll <em>definitely </em>notice the slight dip in comfort. If you're coming from the Legion Go, however, you'll find the ROG Ally X to be <em>more </em>comfortable &mdash; and lighter, too.</p><p>If you're new to handheld gaming PCs entirely, you likely won't notice any discomfort at all.</p><h2><strong>Asus ROG Ally X display</strong></h2><p>The ROG Ally X still sports the same 7-inch, 1080p display with a 120Hz refresh rate, but that's OK because, in the words of Bruno Mars, "girl you're amazing, just the way you are."</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Plus, the ROG Ally X is the only handheld gaming PC that supports a variable refresh rate. This means that, depending on what you're doing, the refresh rate can drop down to lower values or skyrocket to 120Hz. This way, it's not constantly churning out high frame rates and wasting energy.</p><p>It would be nice, though, to see an OLED panel on the ROG Ally X. It still sports an IPS screen. (The Steam Deck OLED has richer panel, in my opinion.)</p><p>I played <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>on the ROG Ally X, and no, the visuals won't blow you away or anything, but it has <em>just </em>the right amount of crispness and sharpness &mdash; and vividness &mdash; to help you enjoy your favorite games, particularly while you're on-the-go. The ROG Ally X has 500 nits of brightness, which isn't as bright as the Steam Deck OLED's 600-nit display, but it can still hold its own while gaming outdoors.</p><p>The Steam Deck OLED also has a slightly bigger display at 7.4 inches. The Lenovo Legion Go's 500-nit panel is even larger, with an 8.8-inch display, but I find it to be a bit too unwieldy. The 7-inch territory is the sweet spot.</p><h2><strong>Asus ROG Ally X ports</strong></h2><p>The Asus ROG Ally X added an extra USB-C port (a Thunderbolt 4 port at that). </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>I downloaded the Apple Music app on the Asus ROG Ally X. (I can do that because, as I'll explain later, the ROG Ally X runs on Windows.) And to my surprise, the sound on the ROG Ally X is a lot better than I thought it would be. I fired up Sabrina Carpenter's "Espresso," and at max volume, the spunky tune sounded loud, bombastic, and impactful.</p><p>While playing <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, the audio was able to overpower the loud fans that would disturb my ears while Performance Mode is on.</p><p>Plus, the sound actually has some depth &mdash; and a well-rounded quality to it, too. The Steam Deck, on the other hand, can sound a bit tinny. The ROG Ally X is definitely louder, too.</p><p>For what it's worth, unlike the OG ROG Ally, the ROG Ally X has a new Smart AMP feature that boosts audio and delivers clearer sound. </p><h2><strong>Asus ROG Ally X benchmarks and performance</strong></h2><p>The ROG Ally X has the same internals as the OG ROG Ally, but there's a slight performance uptick. This could be due to the extra RAM on the Ally X, which means you'll have a bit more headroom for triple-A games that demand a lot of video memory.</p><p>I ran Geekbench 6, which tests processor performance, on the ROG Ally X, and it got a multi-core of <strong>12,233 </strong>(a 6% performance increase compared to the OG Ally X)<strong>. </strong>The Legion Go, on the other hand, has a Geekbench score of <strong>10,414.</strong></p><p>I also ran <a href="https://benchmarks.ul.com/" target="_blank">3DMark's Time Spy</a>, which tests for graphics prowess, on the ROG Ally X. It notched a score of <strong>3,477</strong> compared to the Legion Go's <strong>2,982</strong> figure.</p><p>Unlike the ROG Ally X and the Legion Go, which are handheld PCs running on Windows, the Steam Deck OLED has a Linux-based operating system, so benchmarking was a little bit tricky. We don't have Geekbench nor Time Spy figures for the Steam Deck.</p><p>However, we ran the <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>benchmark on the Steam Deck (non-OLED version), and we got 30 frames per second (fps). The ROG Ally X pushed out more frames with a score of 47 fps. The Legion Go, on the other hand, also has a 30 fps cap on the same benchmark.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Steam Deck - Cyberpunk 2077 - 30 fps</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Lenovo Legion Go - Cyberpunk 2077 - 30 fps</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Asus ROG Ally X - Cyberpunk 2077 - 47 fps</strong></p></li></ul><p>It's also worth noting that, compared to the OG ROG Ally, the ROG Ally X has a full-sized SSD, which can lead to better performance, zippier read/write speeds, and quicker load times.</p><h2><strong>Asus ROG Ally X battery life</strong></h2><p>Asus said that it doubled the battery on the ROG Ally X from 40Whr to 80Whr, promising three to eight hours of battery life. </p><p>We ran the <a href="https://benchmarks.ul.com/" target="_blank">PCMark 10</a> gaming battery life test on the ROG Ally X and it lasted <strong>2 hours and 48 minutes</strong>. On the same test, the Lenovo Legion Go only lasted <strong>1 hour and 46 minutes.</strong></p><p>If it weren't for the bigger battery, the ROG Ally X would sill be seeing Legion Go-level battery runtimes. </p><p>We couldn't run PCMark 10 on the Steam Deck, but anecdotally, Mashable's Alex Perry said he got about <strong>three-and-a-half </strong>hours on it.</p><h2><strong>Asus ROG Ally X software and Windows</strong></h2><p>The Asus ROG Ally X running Windows is a blessing and a curse. On the plus side, you can download games from anywhere, whether it's Steam, the Epic Games Store, Ubisoft Connect, Microsoft Store, and more.</p><p>The downside is that setup is a pain. It's like setting up any Windows PC where you're dodging subscription pushes left and right, from Microsoft 365 to Xbox Game Pass. And that's on top<em> </em>of setting up the Wi-Fi, keyboard language, PIN number, inputting your Microsoft account, and more. Next, you have to navigate Windows, mostly with your fingers via the touchscreen, to download all your games, which can be quite the task.</p><p>With the Steam Deck on the other hand, setup is a lot more seamless. Input your Wi-Fi password before signing in with your Steam credentials, and voila, you're in. Of course, the con here is that there are some limitations with SteamOS (unless you want to go through the process of tinkering with the Steam Deck to install Windows).</p><h2><strong>Asus ROG Ally X worth it?</strong></h2><p>The Asus ROG Ally X, compared to the OG Ally, has a slight performance boost and better battery life. </p><p>Pinning it against the Steam Deck, the ROG Ally X beats it in three ways: better frame rates on triple-A titles like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, a convenient extra USB-C port (i.e., Thunderbolt 4), and better audio.</p><p>However, I'd argue that the Steam Deck still continues to have the best ergonomic design as well as the better operating system with SteamOS. </p><p>I enjoyed playing on the ROG Ally X, and yes, I totally recommend it for anyone looking for a Steam Deck alternative.</p>]]></content:encoded>

But in Season 2, episode 6, we reach what feels like the final boss of these visions, as Paddy Considine dons the crown of King Viserys Targaryen once again.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Viserys's return feels monumental because almost every vision Daemon has had so far has reminded him of his relationship with his late brother. Young Rhaenyra needled Daemon over Viserys passing him over as his heir, while his mother <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-5-daemon-harrenhal-mother-sex-vision" target="_self">Alyssa (Emeline Lambert)</a> told him that he would have been a much better, stronger ruler than Viserys.</p><p>So what happens when Viserys and Daemon come face to face? Does Viserys taunt Daemon about his wrecked marriage to Rhaenyra, or his failed attempts to muster strength in the Riverlands and become king in his own right?</p><p>Not exactly.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Instead, what we get is a near word-for-word replay of a scene from the very first episode of <em>House of the Dragon</em>. Viserys confronts Daemon for joking about the death of his wife Aemma (Sian Brooke), and for calling his late newborn son Baelon the "heir for a day." He then reveals he'll be naming a new heir, cutting Daemon out of the line of succession.</p><p>For present-day Daemon, this revisited memory must cut deeper than any fantasy he's witnessed in Harrenhal so far. It rehashes one of the worst moments of his life, one that still haunts him and drives him to this day, and there's nothing he can do to stop it. All he can muster is a soft "don't" as vision-Viserys begins to say, "I have decided to name a new heir."</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>While Viserys's dialogue remains almost exactly the same from this version of the scene in Season 1, Considine's performances are worlds apart. In Season 1, his grief drove him to loud bursts of anger. He sits high in the Iron Throne as he casts his brother out. Vision-Viserys, on the other hand, slumps over. His physicality recalls Viserys during the later stages of his illness, as if Daemon is viewing an amalgam of his brother across different stages of his life. There is no yelling here, just a soft, almost defeated sense of grief that matches Daemon's own sadness as he re-experiences Viserys's wrath.</p><p>Unlike in Season 1, Daemon does not fight back against Viserys's accusations. All the fire of this original encounter is gone, replaced first by disbelief &mdash; "You can't possibly still be angry about this" &mdash; then an overwhelming urge to escape. By this point, Harrenhal has broken Daemon down with its non-stop display of his worst insecurities. All he can do is hope for the vision to end.</p><p>Daemon does get a bit of closure on his relationship with Viserys &mdash; or at least, his ghostly counterpart &mdash; towards the end of episode 6. In this new vision, we experience an alternate version of the past: One where Daemon stood by Viserys's side as he grieved Aemma, instead of getting drunk in a King's Landing tavern. </p><p>"You should've been at my side," Vision-Viserys told Daemon earlier in the episode. Now, Daemon holds him as he cries. "You needed me," he says. "I'm here now."</p><p>This new vision is the first time Daemon's Harrenhal visions have offered him any respite. It's also the first time he's truly owned up to his mistakes in a vision and tried to make them right. Obviously, it's too late for Daemon and Viserys's real-life relationship. But maybe that healing embrace will mark a turning point for Daemon. After all, he <em>does </em>receive the good news of Grover Tully's passing right after he wakes up from that dream. Whatever cutting-edge ghost therapy treatment Alys Rivers (Gayle Rankin) is foisting on Daemon must be working, big time.</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/el4jA?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3B%3Btemplate=article&amp%3B%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3B%3Belement=offer&amp%3B%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3B%3Belement_label=New%20episodes%20of%20House%20of%20the%20Dragon%20air%20Sundays%20at%209%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20HBO%20and%20Max.&amp%3B%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3B%3Bobject_uuid=00imlCa1Zf2bZssHTCnPdle&amp%3B%3Bshort_url=el4jA&amp%3B%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Fhouse-of-the-dragon-season-2-book-vs-show&amp%3Btemplate=article&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=New%20episodes%20of%20House%20of%20the%20Dragon%20air%20Sundays%20at%209%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20HBO%20and%20Max.&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=00tyOpcdgw6rZZ0vnyM5fn6&amp%3Bshort_url=el4jA&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fhelios-preview.mashable.com%2Farticle%2Fhouse-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-6-cinematographer-vanja-cernjul-interview&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=New%20episodes%20of%20House%20of%20the%20Dragon%20air%20Sundays%20at%209%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20HBO%20and%20Max.&object_type=article&object_uuid=06wB05BQruErDE3hFb6Mdzv&short_url=el4jA&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">New episodes of <em>House of the Dragon </em>air Sundays at 9 p.m. ET on HBO and Max.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>While episode 6 features two extended dragon set pieces &mdash; both of which required extensive collaboration with <em>House of the Dragon</em>'s VFX team &mdash; the most planning on &#268;ernjul's end went into the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-6-the-shepherd-riots" target="_self">King's Landing riot</a>. Here, an angry mob surprises Alicent Hightower (Olivia Cooke) and her daughter Helaena (Phia Saban), and the two must fight their way through the crowds to escape in their carriage.</p><p>"We must have had 300 extras, and we had two days to shoot it," said &#268;ernjul on preparing for the scene. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Shooting on location added further complications: "With medieval architecture, it was a very challenging place to move the camera, because first, [Alicent and Helaena] run down very steep stairs, and then they [go] through the square, and then they hop into the carriage, all while being chased by a huge crowd of smallfolk," &#268;ernjul said. "We wanted [the scene] to have flow, so we shot it in order, and as much as possible consecutively."</p><p>The riot sequence locks us into Alicent's point of view until she and Helaena get in the carriage. A remotely operated camera awaited their arrival in the carriage to provide coverage for the interior section, keeping us trained on their anxiety as they departed the scene.</p><h2><strong>Aemond's Small Council meeting</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Small Council meetings are a staple of <em>House of the Dragon</em>, with episodes often showing the fraught Council sessions from both Team Black and Team Green. &#268;ernjul relished these kinds of scenes in particular, saying, "The most special scenes in that episode were scenes that only included a couple of characters in the room, talking and discussing how this war is going to unfold."</p><p>For these scenes, including a meeting of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-prince-aemond-villain" target="_self">Aemond's (Ewan Mitchell)</a> Small Council, <em>House of the Dragon </em>drew on another HBO heavy hitter for inspiration: <a href="https://mashable.com/article/succession-logan-funeral-day-after-election" target="_self"><em>Succession</em></a>. Episode 6 director Andrij Parekh &mdash; who &#268;ernjul attended film school with &mdash; directed several episodes of <em>Succession</em>, even serving as cinematographer for the pilot.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>"Andrij brought his experience from his previous projects of shooting these rooms where powerful people discuss the fate of other people," &#268;ernjul said. "He had a very good sense for developing a camera behavior that gives you a seat at the table, basically a fly-on-the-wall approach, where the camera also becomes a character that is subjectively reacting to whatever is happening."</p><p>In the Greens' Small Council meeting, that often meant the camera reacting to Aemond as he prowls around the room. "We wanted to shoot&nbsp;the&nbsp;scene in that observational style, but we also wanted Aemond to be&nbsp;at the center,&nbsp;so we granted him the power&nbsp;to move the camera in the scene," &#268;ernjul explained.&nbsp;"We designed&nbsp;blocking where Aemond was&nbsp;walking around the table&nbsp;throughout the scene&nbsp;while addressing the council. Two cameras were following him all the time,&nbsp;circling around the table on a so-called "dance floor," but then they would react to whoever Aemond was addressing. The camera movement appeared more observational, which worked well in contrast to <em>House of the Dragon</em>'s overall style, which has a more intentional and designed feel."</p><h2><strong>Seasmoke chases down Addam of Hull</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>It wouldn't be <em>House of the Dragon </em>without any dragons, and episode 6 features a first for the show: Seasmoke, a riderless dragon, chasing down a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-6-seasmoke-new-rider-addam-velaryon" target="_self">prospective rider in Addam of Hull (Clinton Liberty)</a>. The scene plays out with a fair bit of suspense, as Addam tries desperately to escape. It makes sense, then, that &#268;ernjul and Parekh drew on the work of the Master of Suspense himself, Alfred Hitchcock.</p><p>"To jumpstart the process of shot listing, we would use references from classical cinema, just to get us going," &#268;ernjul explained. "For that particular scene, we wanted to look at the famous scene from&nbsp;<em>North by Northwest</em>, where Cary Grant's character [Roger Thornhill] is being chased by the cropduster. We thought, 'It's just like the dragon&nbsp;in our scene, this plane.'"</p><p>The similarities extend to Roger and Addam as well. "[Roger] doesn't understand what's going on or why he is being chased. Same with Addam," said &#268;ernjul.</p><p>While the <em>North by Northwest </em>cropduster scene served as a jumping-off point, the Addam and Seasmoke scene grew into its own once &#268;ernjul and Parekh began developing it for its specific shooting location in Anglesey, Wales. However, they still wanted to maintain the cropduster scene's "kinetic energy," as &#268;ernjul said. Different shooting techniques proved key here.</p><p>"In that scene, we moved the camera in every possible way," &#268;ernjul said. "We shot handheld, we were on a dolly, we had a techno crane moving from an extreme high angle to an extreme low angle, a drone. We were moving the camera to match the energy of the scene."</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/el4jA?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3Btemplate=article&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=New%20episodes%20of%20House%20of%20the%20Dragon%20air%20Sundays%20at%209%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20HBO%20and%20Max.&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=00imlCa1Zf2bZssHTCnPdle&amp%3Bshort_url=el4jA&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Fhouse-of-the-dragon-season-2-book-vs-show&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=New%20episodes%20of%20House%20of%20the%20Dragon%20air%20Sundays%20at%209%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20HBO%20and%20Max.&object_type=article&object_uuid=00tyOpcdgw6rZZ0vnyM5fn6&short_url=el4jA&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">New episodes of <em>House of the Dragon </em>air Sundays at 9 p.m. ET on HBO and Max.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

With the help of the Targaryen family records, she seeks out members of other houses with Targaryen ancestors.

<p>However, that plan disappears in a puff of (Sea)smoke when the first dragonriding attempt goes disastrously awry. Turns out Seasmoke is simply more interested in barbecuing Ser Steffon Darklyn (Anthony Flanagan) than in bonding with him. Hey, that's just the risk you take when you try to claim a dragon.</p><p>Steffon's death forces Rhaenyra to abandon her plan, yet the episode ends on some intriguing news. Seasmoke has been spotted flying over Spicetown with a new, unknown rider. While Rhaenyra suspects this new dragonrider to be a member of Team Green, episode 6 has already given us his identity &mdash; and it could be a game changer for Team Black.</p><h2><strong>Who is Seasmoke's new rider?</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Seasmoke's new rider is none other than Addam of Hull (Clinton Liberty), the brother of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-4-who-is-alyn" target="_self">Alyn of Hull (Abubakar Salim)</a>. The two are the bastard sons of Corlys Velaryon (Steve Toussaint). But while Corlys acknowledges Alyn, elevating him to the status of first mate, he has yet to say anything to Addam. You can bet that will change once he learns that Addam claimed his trueborn son's dragon.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>While we don't see Addam actually getting on dragonback, we see everything else leading up to it. Seasmoke pursues Addam along the beaches of Driftmark, eventually cornering him. However, instead of burning Addam to a crisp like he did Steffon, Seasmoke approaches him with a soft curiosity. <em>House of the Dragon </em>cuts away before Addam can actually seal the bond, but since we hear about Seasmoke's new rider soon after, you can consider these dragonriding dots connected.</p><h2><strong>How can Addam of Hull be a dragonrider?</strong></h2><p>Addam being a dragonrider throws a bit of a wrench in Rhaenyra's initial plan, as he's not a Targaryen by blood. Instead, he's a Velaryon through Corlys.</p><p>Like the Targaryens, the Velaryons are a great family from Old Valyria, meaning Addam has Valyrian blood. Unlike Targaryens, the Velaryons were not dragonlords, so based on tradition and history, Addam shouldn't be a dragonrider either. Sure, there's a high chance Corlys Velaryon has a smidge of Targaryen blood due to some long-ago Targaryen-Velaryon marriage, or that Addam and Alyn's mother has some Targaryen ancestry. But there are other, more interesting explanations for Addam's new dragonrider status.</p><p>First, Rhaenyra believes that Seasmoke misses his bond with Laenor. What better way for him to replicate that bond than with another one of Corlys's sons? Remember, we've already seen Seasmoke circling over Addam's head in episode 2, so perhaps he already sensed the similarities to Laenor. Maybe Steffon's attempted claiming was the last push Seasmoke needed to seek Addam out, a draconic "screw it, I'll find my preferred rider myself" kind of moment.</p><p>Then, there's the simple possibility that Targaryen blood may not be the true key to riding a dragon. As Jacaerys (Harry Collett) tells Rhaenyra in episode 5, the Old Valyrian histories that highlight the importance of dragonlord blood were "written to gild [dragonlords] in glory." If the "dragonlord blood" narrative is just a tool to uphold Targaryen supremacy, could anyone try to be a dragonrider? Could Rhaenyra widen her pool of recruit candidates? (Might I suggest seeking out the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-5-who-will-be-the-next-dragonriders" target="_self">Targaryen bastards</a> we know are out there?)</p><p>Or, could it be the Targaryens aren't as powerful as they thought?</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/el4jA?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3Btemplate=article&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=New%20episodes%20of%20House%20of%20the%20Dragon%20air%20Sundays%20at%209%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20HBO%20and%20Max.&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=03jg0PhZrarqGYLH6vmYtlc&amp%3Bshort_url=el4jA&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Fhouse-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-5-who-will-be-the-next-dragonriders&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=New%20episodes%20of%20House%20of%20the%20Dragon%20air%20Sundays%20at%209%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20HBO%20and%20Max.&object_type=article&object_uuid=03V5PwCtaXC5HLKjmgAasL1&short_url=el4jA&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">New episodes of <em>House of the Dragon </em>air Sundays at 9 p.m. ET on HBO and Max.</a></p><div id="related-video" class="mx-auto mt-8 mb-12 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans md:mt-12 md:mb-16 text-primary-400">

<p>As the starving mobs chase down Alicent (Olivia Cooke) and Helaena (Phia Saban), an overzealous Kingsguard knight lops off a man's hand in an effort to defend his queens. Not only does this act mark a violent turning point for the riot, it could also be our introduction to a key character from <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-book-vs-show" target="_self">George R.R. Martin's </a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-book-vs-show" target="_self"><em>Fire &amp; Blood</em></a>.</p><h2>Who is the man without a hand in <em>House of the Dragon?</em></h2><p>Much later on in the Dance of the Dragons, Martin introduces a character known simply as "the Shepherd." Think of him as a precursor to <em>Game of Thrones</em>' High Sparrow (Jonathan Pryce). Like the High Sparrow, the Shepherd is a devout follower of the Seven who draws a large following. He preaches against Rhaenyra and the Targaryens, declaring dragons to be "unnatural" and Valyria a "vile cesspit."</p><p>Notably, the Shepherd is one-handed.</p><p><em>Fire &amp; Blood </em>suggests that the Shepherd lost his hand as a punishment for thievery. But what if <em>House of the Dragon</em>'s version of the character &mdash; who is unlikely to be officially introduced until further down the line &mdash; lost it in the episode 6 riot? What if he was the victim of Kingsguard violence?</p><p>That potential change might add an interesting twist to the Shepherd's character, whose backstory is left fairly ambiguous in <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>. Losing his hand in this riot would absolutely aggravate his hatred for the Targaryens, to the point of starting a movement against them. And while the anger during the riots was primarily directed at the currently ruling Targaryens, like Aegon (Tom Glynn-Carney) and Aemond (Ewan Mitchell), Rhaenyra's involvement in the blockade certainly wouldn't endear her to him. Plus, the Shepherd hates all Targaryens, no matter if they're Team Green or Team Black.</p><p>Finally, the Shepherd's presence at this riot would create a full circle moment for one of his most impactful scenes in <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>. As he gains influence, his words incite a mob of his own, which storms the Targaryen dragonpit &mdash; with disastrous consequences.</p><p>Of course, there's a high likelihood that this man in episode 6 is not going to go on to become <em>House of the Dragon</em>'s Shepherd. The Kingsguard or City Watch probably cut off citizens' hands every day. No wonder the smallfolk are so mad! However, the series still lingers on this man and his very specific punishment long enough to plant the idea of the Shepherd in the minds of <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em> fans. The Shepherd <em>is</em> coming, and he's going to be a big obstacle for Rhaenyra when he arrives.</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/el4jA?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3Btemplate=article&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=New%20episodes%20of%20House%20of%20the%20Dragon%20air%20Sundays%20at%209%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20HBO%20and%20Max.&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=00imlCa1Zf2bZssHTCnPdle&amp%3Bshort_url=el4jA&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Fhouse-of-the-dragon-season-2-book-vs-show&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=New%20episodes%20of%20House%20of%20the%20Dragon%20air%20Sundays%20at%209%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20HBO%20and%20Max.&object_type=article&object_uuid=06mFehsZTcyFy1Ia3OrbNNP&short_url=el4jA&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">New episodes of <em>House of the Dragon </em>air Sundays at 9 p.m. ET on HBO and Max.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>An example of that fleshing out is the relationship between Rhaenyra Targaryen (Emma D'Arcy) and Alicent Hightower (Olivia Cooke), whose fraught dynamic in the show benefits from the extra layers of seeing them grow up together before becoming bitter enemies. That strong adaptation choice is one of many that carries into Season 2, but there are plenty new deviations from <em>Fire &amp; Blood </em>on the way. Which ones work and add depth to the story of the Dance of the Dragons? Which ones are less successful? Let's break it down.</p><p>Here are all the biggest differences between <em>House of the Dragon </em>Season 2 and <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>.</p><h2><strong>Episode 1: We're back at the Wall!</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p><em>House of the Dragon </em>Season 2 opens with shots of snowy forests and the familiar sounds of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/game-of-thrones-theme-song-composter-interview" target="_self">Ramin Djawadi</a>'s Winterfell theme, which can only mean one thing for House Stark fans: We're so back.</p><p>After spending the first season mostly in and around Dragonstone and King's Landing, it's a delight to revisit the northernmost reaches of Westeros. Rhaenyra's eldest son Jacaerys (Harry Collett) flew up there in the Season 1 finale to treat with Lord Cregan Stark of Winterfell (Tom Taylor), and by the time we catch up with them at the beginning of Season 2, it seems like they've become good pals. They're taking a field trip up the Wall, bantering about the time Torrhen Stark bent the knee to Aegon the Conqueror, and discussing how the North can aid Rhaenyra in her war efforts.</p><div id="related-video" class="mx-auto mt-8 mb-12 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans md:mt-12 md:mb-16 text-primary-400">

<p><em>House of the Dragon </em>skips over quite a bit of material to get to Jace and Cregan's allyship. In classic <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em> fashion, there are several conflicting accounts of Jace's time in Winterfell in Martin's work. Of his many historical "sources," Grand Maester Munkun writes in his <em>True Telling</em> that the two became inseparable and swore a blood oath of brotherhood, while Septon Eustace claims that Jace badgered Cregan about converting to the Faith of the Seven. The most scandalous of all the accounts belongs, naturally, to court jester Mushroom, who says Jace fell in love with and married a bastard named Sara Snow, even though he was betrothed to his cousin Rhaena (Phoebe Campbell). </p><p>With only eight episodes in this season, <em>House of the Dragon </em>likely didn't have the time to get into all this potential Northern drama. We've got the Dance of the Dragons to kick off, people! Still, you can bet we haven't seen the last of Cregan Stark.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>In a move I didn't see coming (and that certainly isn't in <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>), Dowager Queen Alicent and Lord Commander of the Kingsguard Criston Cole (Fabien Frankel) are getting it on. Based on Alicent's assertion that they shouldn't hook up again (as if that's going to work), we can assume this affair has been going on for <em>a while</em>. So, when did this tryst begin? When did Cole come back around on the whole "breaking his Kingsguard oath of chastity" thing? When did Alicent decide, "Eh, screw it," and start doing exactly what she hated Rhaenyra for doing?</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Alicent and Criston's hypocrisy here doesn't bother me, as it's totally in keeping with their overly righteous characters. And it just makes sense that something would happen between these two. They're basically joined at the hip, and their joint animosity towards Rhaenyra adds a sweet psychosexual twist. Plus, as Alicent reckons with the increasingly unpredictable men in her circle, like her sons Aegon II (Tom Glynn-Carney) and Aemond (Ewan Mitchell), it also makes sense that she'd try to reclaim her power elsewhere. </p><p>What <em>does </em>bother me about this change is that Criston is having sex at all.

<p>In what is undoubtedly one of the darkest scenes ever featured in <em>House of the Dragon </em>and <em>Game of Thrones</em>, two assassins &mdash; known simply as Blood (Sam C.

<p>In the book, Blood and Cheese force Helaena to choose which of her sons she wants them to kill. When volunteering herself doesn't work, she chooses her youngest, Maelor, as Jaehaerys is heir to the Iron Throne. In a nasty twist, Blood and Cheese kill Jaehaerys instead &mdash; and tell Maelor that his mother wants him dead.</p><p>Things play out a little differently in <em>House of the Dragon</em>, although the final outcome is the same: Jaehaerys dies, and Helaena is traumatized for life. First off, Blood and Cheese's original target in the show is Aemond. That change already complicates the blame of Jaehaerys's death. It lets Daemon off the hook <em>a little </em>for bankrolling child murder, just as Vhagar's unauthorized chomping in the Season 1 finale means Aemond <em>technically </em>didn't murder Lucerys. But technicalities don't matter when children are dead.</p><p>Instead of finding Aemond, Blood and Cheese stumble upon Helaena and the twins Jaehaerys and Jaehaera. (Maelor is cut from the show entirely.) They make a snap judgment that one Targaryen son is as good as another and make Helaena tell them which of her children is Jaehaerys. She points him out, but there's a brief moment in which Blood thinks she's trying to double-cross them. After all, why would she give up the heir to the throne so easily? Surely she's actually pointing to Jaehaera. Cheese calls her bluff though and correctly surmises that she's actually singled out her son. With that, Jaehaerys becomes another victim in the Dance of the Dragons.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>This version of the Blood and Cheese scene nods a bit to the book version, with Helaena still having to make an impossible choice and there being trickery involved. However, there's an extra layer of tragedy here. Based on a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-helaena-rat-prophecy-blood-and-cheese" target="_self">rat-centric statement towards the beginning of the episode</a>, Helaena likely foresaw the arrival of Blood and Cheese in a prophetic dream. That means she's had quite a bit of time to think about this moment, and maybe even prepare for it. Her attempt to throw Blood and Cheese off of Jaehaerys's scent was her last-ditch effort to stop the inevitable. In failing, her action turns a horrifying scene into something even sadder.</p><h2><strong>Episode 2: The aftermath of Jaehaerys's death.</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Understandably, much of <em>House of the Dragon </em>Season 2's second episode deals with the fallout from Jaehaerys's murder at the hands of Blood and Cheese. Some elements from <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em> remain the same, such as Aegon's decision to murder all the ratcatchers. Other details are omitted. For example, the show's version of Alicent doesn't try to learn Blood's true name in order to "bathe in the blood of his wife and children." (Probably for the best.)

<p>Elsewhere, Hand of the King Otto Hightower (Rhys Ifans) views Jaehaerys's death as an opportunity to spread some good old-fashioned propaganda. He throws a funeral procession for Jaehaerys, with Helaena and Alicent riding with the young prince's corpse. Accompanying them is a crier telling onlookers to "behold the work of Rhaenyra the Cruel," weaponizing Jaehaerys's death against Rhaenyra. The scene is a show-only invention, yet one that's entirely in keeping with Otto's scheming persona. Plus, even though Alicent decries the procession as ghoulish, it seems like Otto's scheme actually works and wins sympathy points from the smallfolk. (At least, until Aegon hangs every ratcatcher in the vicinity.)</p><h2><strong>Episode 2: Rhaenyra and Daemon duke it out.</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>When Rhaenyra learns of Daemon's involvement in Jaehaerys's death, <em>House of the Dragon </em>treats us to a massive argument between the married couple (and uncle-niece pair). Rhaenyra worries that she can't trust Daemon, while Daemon claims Rhaenyra is as weak as her father. It's a brutal but deeply necessary fight, dredging up both characters' insecurities about their relationship, proximity to power, and different approaches to the brewing conflict with Aegon. And <em>none </em>of it is in <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>By this point in <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>, Daemon has already taken control of Harrenhal. He orchestrates the Blood and Cheese plot from afar, and we don't get enough of Rhaenyra's reaction to the murder to suggest that the two fall out over Daemon's actions. Instead, <em>House of the Dragon </em>fills in one of the emotional gaps of Martin's fictional history. The resulting scene gets at the heart of Rhaenyra and Daemon's fraught relationship, and puts the two in very different headspaces as we move into the next section of the season.</p><h2><strong>Episode 2: Arryk versus Erryk.</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Like much of <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-2-twins-erryk-arryk" target="_self">the duel between the Cargyll twins Arryk and Erryk</a> (Luke and Elliott Tittensor) is the subject of differing historical accounts. Munkun says their battle was epic, lasting for almost an hour and ending with the brothers dying in each other's arms. Mushroom, on the other hand, claims the fight was short-lived. Erryk (who fights for Rhaenyra) dealt Arryk (who fights for Aegon) a mortal blow fairly early on. He sustained a gut wound in the process, and succumbed to it after four painful days. Frankly, the latter seems more plausible, so we've got to give this round to Mushroom.</p><p>Also left ambiguous is the true goal of Arryk's mission to Dragonstone. Was he sent to kill Rhaenyra, or to murder her sons Jacaerys and Joffrey (Oscar Eskinazi)? <em>House of the Dragon </em>decides on the latter. It also moves the battle from "deep in the heart of Dragonstone" to Rhaenyra's chambers, putting her in more danger than in <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>. Here, she witnesses firsthand the kinslaying that will continue to take place should she and Aegon go to war outright. Will this prompt her to take swifter action, or will she stay her cautious course?</p><p>Perhaps the most interesting development in the Cargyll fight is the involvement of Mysaria (Sonoya Mizuno), who alerts Dragonstone to Arryk's presence. By this point in <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>, Mysaria and Rhaenyra haven't interacted much, although Mysaria does become Rhaenyra's unofficial mistress of whispers later on. However, Rhaenyra now owes Mysaria her life. Could this signal a greater (and earlier) partnership between the two, especially now that Daemon is gone?</p><h2><strong>Episode 3: The Battle of the Burning Mill and the Taking of Stone Hedge.</strong></h2><p>The first major battle of the Dance of the Dragons comes at the start of Season 2's third episode, when the long-feuding Blackwoods and Brackens take up arms against each other. The result is a slaughter, and while <em>House of the Dragon </em>doesn't show us the actual bloodshed, the field of corpses stretching as far as the eye can see is more than enough to get the job done. In <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>, the clash between the Blackwoods and Brackens becomes known as the Battle of the Burning Mill. The episode's opening shot of a turning mill (later seen burned to a crisp) is a solid nod to that. </p><p>However, <em>House of the Dragon </em>cuts the follow-up to the Battle of the Burning Mill. Martin's work sees what's left of the Bracken forces return to their seat at Stone Hedge, only to discover that Daemon, Caraxes, and several armies have taken it over in their absence. Getting rid of the Taking of Stone Hedge in the show isn't the greatest loss: Daemon has only just arrived in Harrenhal, meaning he hasn't had much time to assemble a host for Rhaenyra. Plus, the show appears to be saving up the first major dragon attack for a larger turning point, as Rhaenyra and Rhaenys (Eve Best) would rather opt for caution than unleashing a bloody war between dragons.</p><h2><strong>Episode 3: Daemon gets spooky visions at Harrenhal.</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Following the attempt on her life in episode 2, Rhaenyra makes the painful decision to send her youngest children away to the Vale (and hopefully later to Pentos). Rhaena (Phoebe Campbell) will accompany them, their hatchling dragons, and four unhatched dragon eggs. In <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>, it's Jacaerys who makes this call, as Rhaenyra is still grieving Lucerys. <em>House of the Dragon </em>brings Rhaenyra back into action much sooner, giving her the space to rule and make these decisions herself.</p><p>The most interesting change here involves the dragon eggs, three of which will look <em>very </em>familiar to <em>Game of Thrones </em>fans. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-3-daenerys-dragon-eggs" target="_self">Episode director Geeta Vasant Patel confirmed to Mashable</a> that the red, gold, and green eggs are the ones that will eventually find their way to Daenerys Targaryen. This confirmation marks a minor deviation from <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>, which heavily implies that Daenerys's eggs were stolen by a character named Elissa Farman during the reign of Jaehaerys I. Overall, though, the origin of Daenerys's eggs is left somewhat ambiguous, so their inclusion here is more of a fun (and literal) Easter egg. Plus, there's a sweetness to the fact that these eggs are the Targaryens' "hope for the future." From an audience standpoint, we know that they do find their way to the last Targaryen, centuries down the line.</p><h2><strong>Episode 3: Rhaenyra and Alicent reunite. </strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>In the biggest book-to-show change this season so far, Rhaenyra travels to King's Landing to speak directly to Alicent.

Alicent details how Viserys named Aegon as the Prince That Was Promised in his dying breath. Alarm bells immediately sound in Rhaenyra's head: This has all been a big misunderstanding about Aegon's dream of the Song of Ice and Fire! <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-green-black-rhaenyra-alicent" target="_self">Viserys never doubted Rhaenyra.</a></p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Back in Season 1, I found myself frustrated by the first mention of the Song of Ice and Fire, seeing it as cheap fan service for <em>Game of Thrones </em>fans. But with Viserys's last words, and with Rhaenyra's realization in her conversation with Alicent, <em>House of the Dragon </em>truly justifies its use of Aegon's dream. It's not just an attempt to connect to a series that came before. It's the point around which so much of this war revolves. (Also, just a cautionary tale about naming everyone in the family the same thing.)</p><p>Following Rhaenyra's revelation, a new question arises: How will Alicent act going forward, now that she knows she's made a grave error? </p><h2><strong>Episode 4: Alicent's abortion and her possible change of heart.</strong></h2><p>Season 2's fourth episode, "The Red Dragon and the Gold," sees Alicent undertaking two difficult tasks. First, she aborts a pregnancy from her affair with Criston using a specially brewed tea. Then, she scours historical texts looking for any sign of Aegon's dream. Since both her relationship with Criston and her <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-3-rhaenyra-and-alicent-meeting" target="_self">episode 3 discussion with Rhaenyra</a> are show-only additions, Alicent's story in "The Red Dragon and the Gold" is totally new.</p><p>Here, Alicent's research has the potential to set her on a new path from <em>Fire &amp; Blood </em>entirely. Now that she doubts Aegon II's claim and realizes how horribly she messed up, will she work to undermine the ruler she helped put on the Iron Throne? Based on her discussion with Larys Strong (Matthew Needham), that seems unlikely, as she's resigned to the fact that war is coming no matter what. However, since Larys knows about Alicent's doubts as well as her secret abortion, he's got some extra leverage against her should she choose to act against his interests.</p><h2><strong>Episode 4: Aegon and Aemond at Rook's Rest.</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Following the game-changing events at <a href="https://mashable.com/video/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-4-battle-making-of" target="_self">Rook's Rest</a>, we learn that <a href="https://helios-preview.mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-4-is-aegon-dead" target="_self">Aegon did not die</a>. Instead, he's horribly injured, covered in burns, with some of his armor nearly fused to his body. He's in no state to rule, so while he recovers &mdash; if he even can! &mdash; his Small Council must choose a regent to rule in his stead.</p><p>In <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>, Criston simply chooses <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-episode-4-aegon-dies-who-becomes-king" target="_self">Aemond</a> to be Prince Regent and Protector of the Realm. (This results in a delightfully catty moment where Aemond wears Aegon's crown and declares, "It looks better on me than it ever did on him.") <em>House of the Dragon </em>adds a wrinkle to the mix: Alicent puts herself forward as an option, having ruled while Viserys was ill. The men of the Small Council, including her usual allies Larys and Criston, opt for Aemond instead. For them, Alicent's caution is no match for her son's experience in battle, which will prove useful in the war ahead. </p><p>The decision sends Alicent into a contained spiral, with the remainder of the scene emphasizing her upset breathing over the Small Council's proceedings. This entire meeting is yet another example of Alicent being undermined by those around her and deprived of any meaningful say in the rule of Westeros. For example, in the book, it's Alicent who orders that the gates of King's Landing be barred to prevent anyone from coming and going. In the show, that command goes to Aemond.</p><p>Between this slight, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-episode-4-aemond-killing-aegon" target="_self">Aemond's poorly hidden fratricide attempt</a>, and her <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-3-rhaenyra-and-alicent-meeting" target="_self">discussion with Rhaenyra</a> about the Song of Ice and Fire, it seems like Alicent's belief in the Greens' cause is weakening from episode to episode. While that belief stood firm throughout <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>, could the show be hinting at a total change of heart for the Dowager Queen?</p><h2><strong>Episode 5: Daemon's in trouble in the Riverlands.</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>While the Brackens' fall at the Taking of Stone Hedge doesn't appear in episode 3 along with the Battle of the Burning Mill, it <em>does </em>happen offscreen in episode 5. There are still some notable changes, though: First, Daemon and Caraxes are not directly involved. Second, Daemon encourages a violent assault against the innocent residents of Bracken land here, instead of simply taking the castle. Third, the Blackwoods' resulting aggression at Stone Hedge has alienated Daemon from the rest of the river lords. This marks a significant divergence from <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>, where the Taking of Stone Hedge involves "a strong host made up of Darrys, Rootes, Pipers, and Freys." </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>By this point in the book, Daemon has already amassed a considerable army and is not facing infighting. He's basically the perfect general for Team Black. However, <em>House of the Dragon </em>turns Harrenhal into a testing ground for Daemon, where emotional turmoil and self-doubt about his relationships materializes in the form of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-4-daemon-harrenhal-vision-explainer" target="_self">haunting visions</a>. He may call himself King and plan to take the Iron Throne solo &mdash; a show-only development in itself &mdash; but it only reads as bluster and delusion in the face of his nightmares. </p><p>Not only do Daemon's woes offer a fascinating dive into his character, they also allow Jace to take some initiative of his own to try to secure allies in the Riverlands. We see this when he flies to meet the Freys at the Twins, where we get to watch the kind of bargaining and diplomacy he must have used during his stint up North. Look at this little king-in-training go!</p><h2><strong>Episode 6: Grover Tully meets an untimely death.</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Daemon's biggest problem in his stint at Harrenhal (besides the frequent hauntings) has been the fact that he's been unable to unite the Riverlords under one banner. The easiest way to do this would be getting Lord Grover Tully's full support. However, an illness has left Grover incapacitated, and his heirs dare not act without his word. As a result, Daemon finds himself in an impossible waiting game &mdash; although that didn't stop him from encouraging young Oscar Tully (Archie Barnes) to smother his grandpa in his sleep. Charming stuff!</p><p>The stalemate finally breaks in episode 6, when Grover succumbs to his illness. Not only does Grover's death come far earlier than in <em>Fire &amp; Blood </em>&mdash; it occurs differently, too. Here, <em>House of the Dragon </em>highly implies that Harrenhal's <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-4-daemon-harrenhal-vision-explainer" target="_self">resident witch Alys Rivers (Gayle Rankin)</a> had something to do with Grover's death after she volunteered to "tend" to him. When paired with Alys' pep talk to Daemon about the Tullys being the key to the Riverlands, it's pretty clear we're looking at murder here.</p><p>But why did Alys kill in order to further Daemon's cause? The two have already interacted more in the show than they ever did in the book, as the show has expanded upon Daemon's time in Harrenhal (and made him suffer even more while there). Does she have some hidden, witchy agenda that Daemon is the key to? Is she trying to keep her own head while such a volatile man resides in her castle? Or is she just having a fun, witchy time?</p><h2><strong>Episode 6: Rhaenyra and Mysaria are an item now!</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Season 2 has seen Rhaenyra and Mysaria grow much closer than their book counterparts by this point in the Dance of the Dragons. Rhaenyra offered Mysaria her freedom, Mysaria saved Rhaenyra's life by alerting her Kingsguard to the attempted Arryk/Erryk plot, and for the past several episodes, the two have conspired on how best to take down the Greens. In a surprising (but not at all unwelcome) turn, their relationship blossoms into something more in episode 6, when the two share a passionate kiss.</p><p>This romance is entirely new to the show, but following Rhaenyra and Mysaria's charged prior interactions this season, as well as queer readings of Rhaenyra (and especially her relationship with Alicent), it feels more than earned. Plus, it's a solid nod to the many canonically queer women of <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>, including the recently introduced Jeyne Arryn (Amanda Collin). Some of these women, like Princess Rhaena Targaryen (not to be confused with <em>House of the Dragon</em>'s Rhaena) and her lover Elissa Farman, weren't alive during the <em>Dance of the Dragons</em>, so they wouldn't appear in the show. Others, like Alysanne Blackwood and Sabitha Frey, have yet to be introduced, but do play a part in the Dance.</p><h2><strong>Episode 6: Addam claims Seasmoke &mdash; but not on Dragonstone.</strong></h2><p>By the end of episode 5, Rhaenyra and Jace<strong> </strong>hatch a plan to <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-5-who-will-be-the-next-dragonriders" target="_self">recruit more dragonriders</a> to their cause. That plan comes to a screeching halt in episode 6, after Seasmoke barbecues Ser Steffon Darklyn (Anthony Flanagan) mid-dragon claiming attempt. </p><p>In <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>, one knight dying is not enough to make Rhaenyra and Jace give up their search. They seek out anyone who may be of Targaryen descent, including bastards &mdash; known as "dragonseeds" or simply "seeds." Many, many hopeful dragonriders perish in the bloody process, which becomes known as the Red Sowing or the Sowing of the Seeds. However, one of the very few success stories is that of Addam of Hull (Clinton Liberty), bastard son of Corlys Velaryon (Steve Toussaint) and Seasmoke's new rider.</p><p>Addam's claiming of Seasmoke is a public affair in <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>, as is the rest of the Sowing. However, in <em>House of the Dragon</em>, it's almost an accident. Seasmoke clearly misses her bond with Laenor, but isn't willing to settle for someone like Steffon. Instead, she hunts down her own rider: Laenor's half-brother. We don't see the claiming onscreen, but we're able to infer that the new dragonrider Rhaenyra hears about at the end of the episode is none other than Addam.</p><p>So how will Rhaenyra react when she discovers Addam as the dragonrider? She'll likely restart the search for other dragonriders. But instead of just focusing on highborn candidates like Steffon, this new iteration of the Sowing will be open to bastards. And that could make all the difference.</p><p>We'll be updating this article as <em>House of the Dragon </em>Season 2 continues airing, so check back weekly for more differences between the show and <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>. </p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/el4jA?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=New%20episodes%20of%20House%20of%20the%20Dragon%20air%20Sundays%20at%209%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20HBO%20and%20Max.&object_type=article&object_uuid=00imlCa1Zf2bZssHTCnPdle&short_url=el4jA&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">New episodes of <em>House of the Dragon </em>air Sundays at 9 p.m. ET on HBO and Max.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

It's a clever bit of foreshadowing to the Dance of the Dragons (the name for the royal succession civil war between between Aegon II and Rhaenyra), as well as a nod to Helaena's prophetic dreams.

<p><em>House of the Dragon</em>'s new titles open with foreboding images of erupting volcanoes, dying dragons, and a city on fire that looks just like King Viserys' (Paddy Considine) Old Valyria model from Season 1. That can only mean one thing: This is the Doom of Valyria, the cataclysmic event that wiped almost all the dragonriders from the face of the earth.</p><div id="related-video" class="mx-auto mt-8 mb-12 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans md:mt-12 md:mb-16 text-primary-400">

<p>The only dragonriding family to survive was, of course, House Targaryen. That's because 12 years before the Doom even happened, Daenys Targaryen &mdash; a dreamer like Helaena and Aegon the Conqueror &mdash; told her father Lord Aenar Targaryen of a vision she'd had of the end of Valyria. He heeded her warning and moved the family to Dragonstone. Basically, the Doom and its destruction of all the other dragonriders is why the Targaryens are in Westeros in the first place. It's also why their connection to dragons is so rare and gives them so much power.</p><h2>Aegon's Conquest</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Next up on our House Targaryen history lesson is Aegon the Conqueror's invasion of Westeros, which takes place about a century after the Doom. The opening credits tapestry shows us Aegon as well as his two sisters/wives Rhaenys and Visenya flying on their dragons. While Aegon's Balerion and Rhaenys' Meraxes are gone by the time <em>House of the Dragon </em>rolls around, Visenya's <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-finale-vhagar" target="_self">Vhagar is still very much around</a>. At the start of Season 2, her rider is <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-prince-aemond-villain" target="_self">Aemond Targaryen</a> (Ewan Mitchell).</p><p>The credits continue Aegon's Conquest with an image of Vhagar and Balerion breathing fire over a castle and crowds of dying soldiers, which collapses several key battles into one tableau. The castle is Harrenhal, which, despite being considered impenetrable, proved no match for Balerion's fire. Meanwhile, the hordes of charred corpses represent the casualties in the Field of Fire, a massive battle during which the three Targaryen armies laid waste to the hosts of House Lannister and House Gardener.

<p>In the face of the sheer might of dragons (think of them as the nukes of Westeros), it's no surprise the Great Houses bent the knee to Aegon. The opening credits represent these pledges of fealty with kneeling figures decked out in the colors and sigils of some familiar families: the blue and white falcon and moon of House Arryn; the black and white direwolf of House Stark; and the silver, orange, and blue trout of House Tully. In a bit of history repeating, all three Houses could be players in Season 2 as well, as Rhaenyra (Emma D'Arcy) and Aegon II (Tom Glynn-Carney) will seek their allegiance in the war to come.</p><h2>Maegor the Cruel</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Aegon the Conqueror was a tough act to follow, and neither of his sons quite lived up to his name during their successive reigns. Aenys I was viewed as indecisive and weak, while Maegor I, aka Maegor the Cruel, was a total tyrant. We're talking executions, kinslaying, and tons and tons of burning. He also oversaw the completion of the Red Keep, after which he had everyone who worked on it beheaded in order to keep its secrets. Overall, not a great dude!</p><p>Maegor <em>did </em>go out in memorable fashion though, earning him a spot in <em>House of the Dragon</em>'s new title sequence. We pan down from the Red Keep to see him seated on the Iron Throne, impaled through the neck by one of the throne's swords and with his wrists cut. <em>Fire and Blood </em>keeps whether Maegor died by suicide or murder ambiguous. However, the death sets a pattern of Targaryen Kings being hurt or killed by the very Iron Throne they rule from. Remember how <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-king-viserys-dying-iron-throne" target="_self">Viserys kept getting cuts</a> from sitting on the Iron Throne? Turns out deadly furniture is a leading cause of death among Westerosi monarchs.</p><h2>Jaehaerys and Alysanne</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Where Maegor was a tyrant, his successor and nephew Jaehaerys I came to be known as the "Conciliator." His reign of 55 years is the longest in Targaryen history, which certainly merits him a section of the Targaryen tapestry. </p><p>The <em>House of the Dragon</em> credits show Jaehaerys alongside his sister/wife Alysanne, as well as an image of a pot of gold and a seven-pointed star, representing the Faith of the Seven. The former points to Westeros' prosperity during his reign, and the latter to how Jaehaerys mended the contentious divide between the crown and the Faith that started during Aenys' reign. They don't call him the Conciliator for nothing!</p><h2>The Great Council</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

First up is the Great Council of Harrenhal, where Jaehaerys and the lords of the Seven Kingdoms chose his successor from a crop of 14 possible heirs.</p><p>Viserys ended up on the throne, with the Council passing over Jaehaerys' granddaughter Rhaenys (Eve Best). The decision set a precedent for women not being permitted to rule, leading to Viserys' initial hesitation about making Rhaenyra his heir.

<p>Next, <em>House of the Dragon</em>'s new opening credits jump right into the conflict between Rhaenyra and Alicent Hightower (Olivia Cooke). We see Alicent standing at one end of a banquet hall, resplendent in a green gown that calls back to her <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-alicent-hightower-green-dress-meaning" target="_self">fashionable power move at Rhaenyra's wedding</a>. (Also, notice how the torches flanking her resemble House Hightower's fiery sigil).

On Team Green, we see Otto Hightower (Rhys Ifans), Criston Cole (Fabien Frankel), Aemond, Aegon II, and Helaena. Notice how Helaena wears gold instead of green, distancing her from the rest of her family. On Team Black, we see Daemon (Matt Smith), Rhaenys, Corlys Velaryon (Steve Toussaint), Jacaerys (Harry Collett), Lucerys (Elliot Grihault), and Joffrey (Oscar Eskinazi).</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>In the richest tableau these credits have to offer, Aegon II and Rhaenyra take their places as dueling rulers of the Seven Kingdoms. Aegon sits atop the Iron Throne, while Rhaenyra sits on the throne at Dragonstone.</p><p>The two are surrounded by a frame of red and gold &mdash; a nod to House Targaryen's colors and house words, "fire and blood." Hands emerge from beneath both of their thrones to send messages to prospective allies. Ravens flock from the green hand under Aegon II, representing Otto's diplomatic tactics at the start of the war. As we see in the Season 2 premiere, this approach already chafes the war-ready Aegon.</p><p>Aegon and Otto's green hand and ravens contrast with the black hand and dragons extending from Rhaenyra's section of the tapestry. Of the several dragons at Rhaenyra's disposal, only three are pictured here. The smaller ones resemble Jacaerys' Vermax and Lucerys' Arrax, corresponding to the young princes' missions to secure allies in the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-1-ending-explained" target="_self">Season 1 finale</a>. The longer red dragon is likely Daemon's dragon Caraxes.</p><p>Rounding out this tapestry is a border of sigils framing Rhaenyra and Aegon. Based on placement, we can tell which of the Great Houses have declared for which side. Of the major <em>Game of Thrones </em>and <em>House of the Dragon </em>players, Houses Lannister, Baratheon, and Hightower are on Team Green, while Houses Arryn, Stark, Tully, and Velaryon are on Team Black. </p><h2>Lucerys Velaryon's death</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>It's only fitting that these new credits close with the tragedy that closed out Season 1: <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-1-ending-explained" target="_self">the death of Rhaenyra's son Lucerys</a>. Here, we see the intertwined figures of Aemond, Vhagar, Arrax, and Lucerys, reminding us all of one of the first casualties of the Dance of the Dragons. </p><p>From here, the now-blank tapestry unfolds towards the ominous silhouette of the Iron Throne. The message is clear: For the past minute and a half, we've witnessed centuries' worth of bloody battles and the devastating power of dragons, all unleashed in the name of ruling Westeros. And with the schism between Rhaenyra and Aegon, these events &mdash; mostly tragedies &mdash; won't be stopping anytime soon. The Targaryen history is still being written; the tapestry is far from done.</p><h2>Jaehaerys' murder and the death of the ratcatchers</h2><p>As of <em>House of the Dragon</em>'s third episode, the opening credits tapestry replaces the image of Lucerys' death with new additions based on the events of Season 2's first two episodes.</p><p>First up is the funeral procession of Jaehaerys Targaryen, who was brutally beheaded by assassins <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-helaena-rat-prophecy-blood-and-cheese" target="_self">at the end of the season premiere</a>. We see the infant prince lying on a bier lined in green, a bloody gold thread weaving across his neck to represent both the nature of his murder and the way in which his head was sewn back on for display to the public.</p><p>From there, the tapestry transitions to the fallout from Jaehaerys' loss, showing us all the Red Keep ratcatchers Aegon had hanged in order to kill the one who had a hand in murdering his son. Blood seeps from their feet towards the Iron Throne, a reminder of the many casualties to come as the war between Rhaenyra and Aegon continues.</p><h2>Rook's Rest and the rise of Aemond Targaryen</h2><p><em>House of the Dragon </em>updates its intro tapestry once again in episode 6, giving us a look at the aftermath of the <a href="https://mashable.com/video/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-4-battle-making-of" target="_self">Battle at Rook's Rest</a>. Here, fallen dragons Sunfyre and Meleys lie curled up beside each other. An armored figure between them raises a sword, while a green dragon circles overhead. </p><p>Based on the long Targaryen hair, that figure is likely Aemond Targaryen, meaning the dragon is probably Vhagar, the only other dragon at Rook's Rest. The tapestry's perspective makes her look smaller than she really is. We're positioned on the ground, up close to the massive bodies of Sunfyre and Meleys, while Vhagar flies high above, the only one of these three dragons who can still take to the skies.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

            Rhaenyra Targaryen needs more dragonriders. Here are the three most likely candidates.

        </a>
    </div>
<p>This tapestry section also highlights Aemond's triumph at Rook's Rest, as he gained the most from the battle. Not only did he and Vhagar eliminate Meleys and Rhaenys, they also gravely injured Aegon, paving the way for <a href="https://mashable.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-alicent-aemond-knife-moment" target="_self">Aemond to become prince regent</a>.</p><p>But this new addition to the title sequence saves its most foreboding detail for last. We zoom in on Meleys' head and see her black blood mixing in with the red blood of the many soldiers who perished at Rook's Rest. It's now dragon's blood that creeps towards the Iron Throne to close out the credits, emphasizing that dragons are just as likely to become casualties as humans, and that even Targaryen gods may fall. </p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/el4jA?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=New%20episodes%20of%20House%20of%20the%20Dragon%20air%20Sundays%20at%209%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20HBO%20and%20Max.&object_type=article&object_uuid=06lZTSVicutMkerUHGnpIoB&short_url=el4jA&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">New episodes of <em>House of the Dragon </em>air Sundays at 9 p.m. ET on HBO and Max.</a></p><p class="mx-auto">

<p>The surprise success of "Twisters," which was only projected to generate up to $55 million on opening weekend, was also likely buoyed by the appeal of its rising stars Glen Powell and Daisy Edgar-Jones. The duo have powered through impressive press tour to promote the movie, including <a href="https://mashable.com/video/glen-powell-daisy-edgar-jones-hot-ones" target="_self">going head-to-head in a Hot Ones match up.</a></p><p>The $80.5 million opening of "Twisters" is the third-biggest opening weekend of the year behind &ldquo;Inside Out 2&rdquo; ($154 million) and &ldquo;Dune: Part Two&rdquo; ($82 million).</p>]]></content:encoded>

The battery also lasts up to 10 hours on a full charge.&nbsp;</p><p>Even though it's in near-mint condition, this iPad was still originally made in 2018, so it has a few years on it. The hardware specifications include 32GB of storage and 2GB of memory along with an 8MP iSight camera and a 1.2MP FaceTime camera for selfies. This iPad has a 2.3GHz Apple A10 Fusion chipset and supports Wi-Fi&nbsp;with dual-band capability and Bluetooth 4.2. Overall, it could run productivity apps like Google Workspace well, but if you want a tablet for gaming, this may not be an ideal match.&nbsp;</p><p>A few cool accessories also come with your purchase. That includes a case, screen protector, stylus, and charger. The color of the stylus and case might vary, but they all still work the same.&nbsp;</p><h2>Time is running out</h2><p>If you're on the hunt for a tablet you can use to work on the go or just catch up on your shows while you cook, this deal is a great opportunity that's not going to last much longer.&nbsp;</p><p>You have until July 21 at 11:59 p.m. PT to get a grade "A" <a href="https://zdcs.link/5MNJO?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=refurbished%20iPad%206th%20Gen&object_type=article&object_uuid=02IBwnuKHHdaBZfAcYZju7N&short_url=5MNJO&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">refurbished iPad 6th Gen</a> plus accessories for $149.97.

This remote brings a classic design to your modern smart amenities, and it's pretty cheap too. While it's on sale, you can get the Button Remote for Apple TV for $33.97 (reg. $39).&nbsp;</p><h2>Why get this instead of using the Siri remote?</h2><p>The Button Remote is a replacement for the voice control design of the Siri remote. They both have many of the same functions, but now you don't have to talk to your TV to get it to work. This remote brings some of the comfort and familiarity of older remotes to your modern Apple TV.&nbsp;</p><p>Setup is quick.

Make sure to check the button layout for guides on everything this little remote can do, but a few functions definitely stand out.&nbsp;There's an Infared without Bluetooth option for even less, at $23.</p><p>Media controls for volume and app switching are all in a central spot with the mute button at the center. Other functions are activated by holding different buttons down. That's how you open up the Apple TV control center. This remote also supports&nbsp;profile switching, sleep timers, and access to audio controls for AirPods and HomePod devices.</p><p>This remote is compatible with multiple Apple TV models and over 100 brands of TVs, soundbars, and receivers. The only thing you need to provide is two AAA batteries.&nbsp;</p><h2>Sale ends soon</h2><p>Upgrade your Apple TV setup.&nbsp;</p><p>You have until July 21 at 11:59 p.m. PT to get the<a href="https://zdcs.link/V0jpd?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Button%20Remote%20for%20Apple%20TV%2FApple%20TV%204K&object_type=article&object_uuid=02nx9f2ZNS66ALiro99eXLw&short_url=V0jpd&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"> Button Remote for Apple TV/Apple TV 4K</a> on sale for $33.97.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01fvuR5hC1sd86M6f4XWM1K/hero-image.jpg" alt="A phone displaying the New York Times game 'Connections.'"><p><em>Connections</em> is the latest <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/connections" target="_blank"><em>New York Times </em>word game</a> that's captured the public's attention. The game is all about finding the "common threads between words." And just like <em>Wordle</em>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-20-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> resets after midnight and each new set of words gets trickier and trickier&mdash;so we've served up some hints and tips to get you over the hurdle.</p><p>If you just want to be told today's puzzle, you can jump to the end of this article for July 21's <em>Connections</em> solution. But if you'd rather solve it yourself, keep reading for some clues, tips, and strategies to assist you.</p><h2><strong>What is <em>Connections</em>?</strong></h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <a class="text-gray-600" href="https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1679674590203723778?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(opens in a new window)">

<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. Like <em>Wordle, </em>you can share the results with your friends on social media.</p><h2><strong>Here's a hint for today's <em>Connections</em> categories</strong></h2><p>Want a hit about the categories without being told the categories?

<p>Trump <a href="https://mashable.com/article/twitter-locks-donald-trump-account-threatens-suspension" target="_self">was banned indefinitely back in 2021</a> after the Jan. 6 attempted insurrection at the Capitol. His ban was somewhat quietly lifted on Friday &mdash; as seemingly the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/windows-bsod-crash-crowdstrike-update-worldwide-outage" target="_self">entire online infrastructure melted down</a> due to the CrowdStrike outages. The reason Trump's allowed back? Well, after this week's Republican National Convention, he's officially the presidential nominee and thus, Twitch reasoned, newsworthy enough to be brought back. </p><p>"We reinstated former President Trump&rsquo;s Twitch channel," said a Twitch spokesperson, via <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/19/24202095/twitch-lifts-donald-trump-ban" target="_blank">The Verge</a>. "We believe there is value in hearing from Presidential nominees directly, when possible. Trump is now the official Republican nominee for US president."</p><p>Trump <em>could </em>find himself in hot water with Twitch again, however, because he <em>will </em>be subject to the company's normal community guidelines. The former president has proven time and again that abiding by such guidelines <a href="https://mashable.com/article/donald-trump-twitch-suspension" target="_self">proves</a> <a href="https://mashable.com/article/trump-facebook-ban-oversight-board-decision" target="_self">to be</a> <a href="https://mashable.com/article/meta-drops-donald-trump-account-restrictions" target="_self">a difficult task</a> for him. </p><p>"We continue to enforce our Community Guidelines and take necessary enforcement action when we identify violations of our rules," the Twitch spokesperson said. "Twitch doesn&rsquo;t have a 'public figure policy,' meaning all channels are equally subject to our guidelines, regardless of whether the channel belongs to a public figure."</p><p>You'd be forgiven if you thought Twitch had already made this move &mdash; many of the other social media sites have already allowed Trump to return. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/youtube-reinstates-donald-trump-channel" target="_self">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/elon-musk-reinstated-banned-twitter-accounts-list" target="_self">Elon Musk's X</a> dropped the bans and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/meta-drops-donald-trump-account-restrictions" target="_self">Meta recently removed</a> heightened suspension penalties previously in place for Trump's Instagram and Facebook pages. </p><p>In short: Trump is fully back online. </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[X, FKA Twitter, is working on a tool to block replies with links. The idea is to cut down on spam.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/06gKqR0OfBpH0daZRbj9LKg/hero-image.jpg" alt="x logo on phone with colorful background"><p>X is developing a new tool that'll allow users to block links in replies, which could help cut down on spam.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">
        <span class="font-bold text-primary-400">SEE ALSO:</span>
        <a href="https://mashable.com/article/x-twitter-dislike-button" class="text-secondary-300">
            X is flirting with dislike and downvote features (again)

        </a>
    </div>
<p>Engadget noted that the new tool first surfaced online via a post from independent app researcher&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/nima_owji" target="_blank">Nima Owji</a>, who has discovered such unreleased features in the past. </p><p>Owji, simply enough, posted, "X is working on the ability to let you disable links in the replies of your posts!" Owji included a screenshot of what the potentially forthcoming tool looks like. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <a class="text-gray-600" href="https://twitter.com/nima_owji/status/1814325667929989533" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(opens in a new window)">
        Tweet may have been deleted
    </a>
</blockquote>
<p>The feature looks simple enough. It'll just be a box to check to disable links in the replies. That could be helpful to stop the accounts that flood popular posts with spammy links, often to questionable products. Others <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/its-not-safe-to-click-links-on-x" target="_blank">post links</a> intentionally trying to mislead you. So blocking replies with links could certainly prove helpful. </p><p>Christopher Stanley, senior director for security engineering at X, posted a reply about the feature, confirming that it was real and that his team built the tool. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <a class="text-gray-600" href="https://twitter.com/cstanley/status/1814360465318764871" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(opens in a new window)">
        Tweet may have been deleted
    </a>
</blockquote>
<p>Soon enough you might be able to post a dumb joke without worrying about weird links in your replies. There's been a lot of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/x-twitter-elon-musk-grok-upcoming-features-discovered" target="_self">recent bad</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://mashable.com/article/x-twitter-livestreaming-premium-paywall" target="_self">change</a>&nbsp;for X, formerly Twitter, but maybe this could&nbsp;be a helpful tool. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<h3>I watched some of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlqGnY08uPk&amp;ab_channel=BleacherReport" target="_blank">your highlights</a> last night. The clean "swish" of the ball going through the net over and over is like ASMR. </h3><p>Yes! I feel the same way.</p><h3>Do you listen to ASMR? Or is there a sound like that that calms you down?</h3><p>I don't watch ASMR but I love stress balls. I use them when I study.</p><h3>You're going to be a sophomore at USC. How is school?</h3><p>School is great. I recently took a feminist theory class, which is like, crazy. I've actually taken two classes so far, learning about the different theories has been cool and so has learning about the history and how it all comes together. Right now I'm on track to be a communications major.</p><h3>I noticed a few Bear Bricks in an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C5gaGP2xwRH/?img_index=1" target="_blank">Instagram photo</a> you posted of your room. Are you a collector?</h3><p>I was collecting them and then I was just like, "Why am I spending so much money on these?" So unless I see one that I really really can't live without, I won't buy it. But it was a hobby of mine for a couple months. I have a Michael Jackson, Joker, and a Basquiat.&nbsp;</p><p>I think, honestly, that I go through phases when it comes to collecting &mdash; a lot of phases. And then I'll be like, why am I doing this? Sneakers I think will always be something I collect, though. I never seem to get tired of that. Right now I store them in shoeboxes, which I have to fix. I have to go to The Container Store and buy something more aesthetic, like the clear acrylic boxes.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

<h3>I've seen you're doing a lot more on camera work, how has that been? Your Morgan and Morgan ad was actually iconic.</h3><p>It's definitely crazy. I consider it like a side quest, honestly. I'm just doing things and getting better at it slowly. Sometimes I get a little nervous just because it's kind of out of my comfort zone.</p><p>For example, <a href="https://www.si.com/fannation/name-image-likeness/news/usc-star-duo-watkins-and-ellis-sign-nil-deals-with-morgan-morgan-law-firm-michael9" target="_blank">Morgan and Morgan</a> were like "show personality <em>[laughs],</em> try to be quirky" or something. When they give you a specific emotion and you try to replicate it, that's always the awkward part. When I feel like, "I wouldn't do that," it's like, "Okay, I have to act." And acting is out of the box for me a little.</p><h3>In March, basketball great Cheryl Miller <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l45blJmLJdI" target="_blank">asked if you'd found a "space for yourself"</a> amidst all the pressure of your career and you said no. Has anything changed since then?</h3><p>I've definitely gotten better, I think, just being in the offseason. During season, it could get a bit much. But then after season, you get to take a deep breath in and just chill. You grind and then you have vacation. I think that's just the circle of life. But I'm having fun. I went on my first vacation recently. I went to Mexico for a couple days and shopped. But I love LA, so that's just a vacation in itself.</p><h3>You're from Watts and a USC girl. How do you feel about New York?</h3><p><em>[Laughs]</em> It's not my fave. You guys have got great food, which is something I can always appreciate. I don't know, it just might be a little too much going on. It's a little busy for me. I like calmness. And the weather I can't really get with. Honestly, though, I feel like I haven't really gotten a chance to truly explore so maybe if I explore more, I'll enjoy it.</p><blockquote class="mx-auto instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/C1LBsJFS4pb/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="12" style=" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin-top: 1px; margin-bottom:1px; max-width:540px; min-width:326px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);">

I am a Pinterest girly. I use it to find inspo, tattoos, interior design for how I want to do my apartment.</p><p>I'm also on Instagram a lot more. Whenever I have cute pictures, I'll post them.

I usually find up and coming artists that way, like this one called Skaiwater. In terms of what I'm listening to right now, Kaytranada dropped an album that I was a fan of.

The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

Although <a href="https://mashable.com/article/mars-nasa-image-spacecraft" target="_self">Mars</a> today is <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/ames/is-mars-soil-too-dry-to-sustain-life/" target="_blank"><em>1,000</em> times drier</a> than the driest desert on Earth, the rover has spotted clues that long ago the Red Planet experienced momentous floods. It was a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/mars-nasa-water-covered-planet" target="_self">wet world</a>. </p><p>"This was not a quiet period on Mars," Becky Williams, a scientist at the <a href="https://www.psi.edu/" target="_blank">Planetary Science Institute</a> who researches Mars using the rover's Mast Camera, said in a statement. "There was an exciting amount of activity here. We&rsquo;re looking at multiple flows down the channel, including energetic floods and boulder-rich flows."</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>The images below show what Curiosity has recently found.</p><p>Below is a wide-view photo of a section of Gediz Vallis as it winds down Mount Sharp. You can see prominent buildups of rocks and boulders, such as those in the foreground on left. "This area was likely formed by large floods of water and debris that piled jumbles of rocks into mounds within the channel," <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-curiosity-rover-discovers-a-surprise-in-a-martian-rock" target="_blank">NASA explained</a>. Impressively, this debris pile-up extends some two miles down the mountain (though some of this was likely caused by landslides, too).</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Curiosity also closely examined these water-tumbled rocks. A number of them contain telltale "halo" markings, as seen in the image below. "Finally, water soaked into all the material that settled here," the <a href="https://mashable.com/category/space" target="_self">space</a> agency explained.

<p>Unlike <a href="https://mashable.com/article/earth-pictures-images-from-space" target="_self">Earth</a>, Mars no longer harbors an insulating atmosphere. The Red Planet's hot metallic core deep below its surface cooled long ago, and without a heated interior to generate a protective magnetic field, the once water-rich world was exposed to a relentless flow of particles from the sun, called the <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/news-articles/effects-of-the-solar-wind" target="_blank">solar wind</a>. The solar wind progressively stripped Mars of its thick atmosphere, leaving it the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/mars-life-survive-bacteria-space" target="_self">frigid, callous, irradiated desert we see today</a>.</p><p>The Curiosity rover, which landed on Mars in 2012, continues to scour Mars to determine if the planet could have ever harbored habitable conditions for microbial life. Meanwhile, NASA's <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nasa-mars-perseverance-rover-vortex-dust-devil" target="_self">Perseverance rover</a>, which landed in 2020, is equipped with instruments that sleuth for hints of past life called "biosignatures" &mdash; elements, substances, or features providing evidence of ancient organisms. This could mean telltale chains of molecules or structures that were almost certainly produced by single-celled Martians.</p><p>Although it's clear that Mars once hosted bounties of water, robotic Martian explorers have spotted no evidence, so far, that this rocky world ever hosted <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nasa-mars-organic-material-rocks-discovery" target="_self">life</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00F8nCawhlwYVUz0qaIi34A/hero-image.png" alt="A pit, leading to a cave, in the Mare Tranquillitatis region of the moon."><p>Scientists have long suspected the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/moon-facts" target="_self">moon</a> may harbor dark labyrinths. They now have proof one exists. </p><p>In 2010, NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, a satellite orbiting the moon, captured imagery of an intriguing pit on the moon's surface, in the same region where the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apollo-moon-landing-computer" target="_self">Apollo 11 astronauts</a> landed. It was unknown if this was part of greater caverns, but planetary scientists have reanalyzed the spacecraft's observations and determined it is indeed a cave. And elsewhere on the moon, there could be many more.</p><p>"We're just seeing the tip of the iceberg," Wes Patterson, a planetary scientist at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory who coauthored the new research in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-024-02302-y" target="_blank"><em>Nature Astronomy</em></a>, told Mashable.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>These caverns are most likely a lava tube, a geologic phenomenon created by volcanic eruptions. Found in regions around Earth, lava tubes are created by molten rock, or magma, leaking up near or onto a world's surface, and forming these natural tunnels. Tubes form from crusted-over lava, and the conduits are emptied when lava drains out or is diverted elsewhere. You can walk though <a href="https://www.nps.gov/havo/planyourvisit/day-hike-nahuku.htm" target="_blank">giant lava tubes</a> on Earth.</p><p>To determine if the pit was part of a greater tunnel system, the researchers looked at other data collected by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, specifically from a radar instrument called the Miniature Radio-Frequency. While flying over the pit in the volcanic plains of Mare Tranquillitatis (popularly called the "Sea of Tranquility"), the spacecraft sent a signal into the opening, which bounced back, ultimately providing (with the help of geometry and computer simulations) evidence of a tunnel at least some 130 feet (40 meters) wide and perhaps as much as 80 meters, or some 260 feet, long. It turns out the pit is actually a <em>skylight</em>.</p><p>"This is our first direct evidence of a conduit associated with one of those pits," Patterson said.</p><p>To buttress their lunar results, the researchers performed a similar analysis on a lava tube here on <a href="https://mashable.com/article/earth-pictures-images-from-space" target="_self">Earth</a>. Their process worked. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Such a tunnel isn't simply an intriguing geologic find. It could prove vital for future <a href="https://mashable.com/article/who-owns-moon-resources-nasa-artemis" target="_self">moon exploration</a>, or colonization.</p><p>"It is a place that can protect us," Patterson said.</p><p>On the moon's surface, astronauts from <a href="https://mashable.com/category/nasa" target="_self">NASA</a> and other agencies will be threatened by a quadruple whammy of micrometeorites, extreme cold, extreme heat, and radiation &mdash; <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nasa-mars-rover-solar-storm" target="_self">particularly from the sun</a>. The moon lacks an atmosphere, meaning, for example, humans would be exposed to temperatures reaching some 260 degrees Fahrenheit (127 Celsius) on the moon's illuminated side. They'll need shelter. (The <a href="https://mashable.com/category/space" target="_self">space</a> agency plans to <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nasa-astronaut-moon-training-artemis" target="_self">return astronauts to the moon</a> as soon as late 2026.)</p><q>
    "It is a place that can protect us."
    </q>
<p>"We could build things on the moon that would be just as safe as sitting in a lava tube, but it would take a lot more infrastructure to do so," Patterson noted.</p><p>Lava tubes might not be the only caverns on the moon. Conduits created by intense, heat-generating impacts might exist in other regions of the moon, near the poles. But this large lava tube in the Sea of Tranquility might be necessary for a future moon base, or landing area.  </p><p>And there could be much bigger, or interconnected, caverns out there. What else will future observations, perhaps from future moon-orbiting spacecraft, reveal about the moon's lava tubes?</p><p>"They may create extensive networks," Patterson said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[Will "The Bear" fans stick with the show after a plodding Season 3?]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/06ZHBqJL6tnQ8YmwNpf3TCK/hero-image.jpg" alt="Chef Carmy stands with his head against the walk-in refrigerator"><p>In the latest season of<em> <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-bear-season-3-review" target="_self">The Bear</a></em>, cousin Richie insults chef Carmy with a memorable dig during one of their rapid-fire kitchen fights, calling him a "baby replicant who's not self-actualized." </p><p>The line, which appears to be a <em>Blade Runner </em>reference, gets a laugh. It also sums up not just Carmy's trajectory over the show's three seasons, but also the frustrating nature of its latest outing. Season 3 leaves its terrific actors and their superbly flawed characters flailing in a tedious study of professional trauma. </p><p>In order for <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/the-bear-season-4-release-date-cast-plot-details" target="_blank">Season 4</a> of <em>The Bear</em> to succeed, Carmy (Jeremy Allen White) has to evolve beyond his stunted identity as a tortured chef. His desperation to achieve culinary genius &mdash; while ignoring his many psychic wounds &mdash; is poisoning everyone else around him, including Richie (Ebon Moss-Bachrach); his second-in-command, Sydney (Ayo Edebiri); and chef Tina (Liza Col&oacute;n-Zayas). </p><p>In his own way, Carmy could even experience <a href="https://mashable.com/article/covid-post-traumatic-growth" target="_self">post-traumatic growth</a>, putting him in the company of countless people who've endured hell but over time made something meaningful of their journey. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>This could be <em>The Bear</em>'s plan, but this loyal viewer would be grateful if Season 4 relied far less on heavy-handed repetition, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/02/arts/television/review-the-bear-season-3.html" target="_blank">I'm not alone</a> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2024/07/the-bear-fx-season-3-carmy-trauma/678938/" target="_blank">in that criticism</a>. </p><p><em>The Bear</em>'s ambitious stylistic treatment of workplace hazing and its psychological toll, for example, doesn't enlighten. The plot frequently stalls with flashbacks to Carmy's experience in a kitchen where an abusive chef berates and belittles him. These and other scenes from his past play in loops, blurring past and present. He's otherwise personally frozen with fear, unable to apologize to his former girlfriend for cruelly abandoning their relationship. </p><p>The redundant flashbacks drag the viewer into a thematic cul-de-sac from which there is no escape. Not even the charming weirdo Fak brothers (Matty Matheson and Ricky Staffieri) or Jon Cena's delightful cameo as a floor-buffing pro can save the most plodding episodes. (Don't say Mashable entertainment reporter Belen Edwards didn't warn you in her <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-bear-season-3-review" target="_self">expectation-lowering review</a>.) </p><p>Carmy does little more than painstakingly assemble dishes only to throw them in the garbage. Viewers could be forgiven for wanting to do the same with the series after this season's 10 episodes. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

</div>


<p>Feeling trapped may indeed be the point. As Smriti Joshi, chief psychologist at the mental health platform Wysa and a fan of <em>The Bear</em>, pointed out to me in an email, Season 3 begins right after Carmy is freed from the walk-in refrigerator where he spent the final moments of Season 2 temporarily imprisoned by a broken door. </p><p>Everything that went wrong during his meltdown there &mdash; accidentally rejecting his girlfriend, alienating his family and staff, unwillingly disappearing on the most important night of his life &mdash; has plunged Carmy right back into his past trauma. </p><p>Joshi, who felt the season's repetitiveness was warranted given Carmy's mental state, told me that his standstill can't realistically come to a quick end. Instead, his icebox reflections result in him feeling even more "haunted" than he did before. In Season 3, being haunted is played for laughs by the Fak brothers, but the idea is clearly more than just comic relief. Intrusive thoughts like the ones Carmy experiences again and again are like ghosts, too.</p><p>"Trauma doesn't have a neat resolution, and Carmy's character reflects the messy, often stagnant nature of living with unprocessed pain," Joshi said. </p><p>As someone who covers the depiction of mental health in popular culture, I have admired <em>The Bear</em>'s handling of the subject. I <a href="https://mashable.com/article/suicide-loss-survivor-stories-tv-bear-reservation-dogs" target="_self">applauded the first season's sensitive treatment</a> of suicide loss. Watching the second season, I was struck by how certain storylines subtly pressed chaotic characters into a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-bear-season-2-explained" target="_self">state of mindfulness</a>. </p><q>
    Trauma doesn't have a neat resolution, and Carmy's character reflects the messy, often stagnant nature of living with unprocessed pain.
            <footer>- Smriti Joshi, chief psychologist for Wysa</footer>
    </q>
<p>I think the effort to take viewers deep inside Carmy's mind was brave, but the season didn't need to pivot so obsessively around his memories for those of us watching to understand that he's stuck in damaging ways, or that he's plagued by intrusive thoughts. </p><p>You needn't look farther than the summer blockbuster <a href="https://mashable.com/article/inside-out-2-review" target="_self"><em>Inside Out </em></a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/inside-out-2-review" target="_self">2</a> to see a wholly original and moving depiction of emotional and physiological paralysis. The movie's culminating scene, in which a teen girl experiences a panic attack observed both from the outside and from within her own mind, doesn't take more than a few minutes to make its point. </p><p>Of course, an animated feature is not a 30-minute television "comedy," but every form of entertainment can draw power from trusting its audience. </p><p>I am personally rooting for <em>The Bear</em>'s next season to claw its way out of the claustrophobic world it has constructed for its characters. Though permanently trapping Carmy in arrested development may be truer to reality, <em>The Bear</em>'s biggest champions watch because they believe that something beautiful can be salvaged from the mess of every character's life. </p><p>Hollywood seems to understand the brilliance of <em>The Bear</em>'s past seasons, too. On July 17, the show earned a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/emmy-nominations-2024-list" target="_self">record 23 Emmy nominations</a> for a comedy. </p><p>Because of the eligibility calendar, those accolades recognize Season 2, which aired profound episodes of television. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/forks-fishes-the-bear-best-ep" target="_self">These include "Forks,"</a> in which Richie arguably becomes self-actualized,<em> </em>and "Fishes," a masterful if tense portrayal of family dysfunction <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-bear-season-3-guest-stars-josh-hartnett-john-cena" target="_self">guest starring</a> Jamie Lee Curtis as Carmy's mother, who misuses alcohol in ways that devastate her children. </p><p>Barring a couple standout episodes in Season 3, including the return of Curtis in "Ice Chips," I would be surprised if <em>The Bear</em> garners the same awards-season praise next year. </p><p>The show is at a crossroads. Liberating it from the oppressive tendencies of Season 3 could look like cutting a path toward post-traumatic growth for Carmy. Joshi said she'd love to see him reframe negative thoughts so that they're more positive and compassionate, and to make the space to process his trauma. </p><p>Frank conversations with his mother, Richie, and his sister, Sugar (Abby Elliott), about their difficulties with self-compassion could help too, along with individual grief therapy to fully grapple with the death of his brother Mikey (Jon Bernthal). </p><p>"Although it might not make for explosive TV, if Carmy experienced post-traumatic growth, viewers would gain valuable insight into the genuinely difficult work it takes to overcome intertwined grief and trauma," Joshi said. </p><p>This may sound too prescriptive, or like a recipe for turning <em>The Bear</em> into a predictable show about the virtues of therapy. But I hope its creators and writers ultimately transform Carmy, slowly but surely, into a fully integrated human being, as Richie might say. </p><p>The blueprint for that surfaced this season if you squinted hard enough. Every time Carmy or another character discussed their legacy, in the kitchen or in life, you could see Carmy registering and then suppressing a flicker of recognition that interpersonal conflict could be what he leaves behind, even to those he loves. </p><p>But at some point, <em>The Bear</em> has to stop dancing around the menacing titular beast that makes an occasional appearance in Carmy's nightmares.</p><p>"In order to grow, Carmy must face the bear in the cage and let him out," Joshi said.</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/OdBBE?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=All%20three%20seasons%20of%20The%20Bear%20are%20streaming%20on%20Hulu.&object_type=article&object_uuid=06ZHBqJL6tnQ8YmwNpf3TCK&short_url=OdBBE&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">All three seasons of <em>The Bear</em> are streaming on Hulu.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

Between work, hobbies, and trying to maintain some semblance of a social life, who has the time to actually <em>meet </em>people? That's where <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-apps" target="_self">online dating</a> comes in.</p><p>If you're already rolling your eyes, we hear you. Dating as a man in the 21st century is tough. It's not just the pressure to make the first move or the fear of rejection &mdash; it's the endless <a href="https://mashable.com/article/dating-apps-tinder-bumble-hinge-catfishing-easy" target="_self">swiping through fake profiles</a>, AI-generated thirst traps, bots posing as potential matches, and the relentless Instagram models trying to lure you into their <a href="https://mashable.com/article/what-is-onlyfans" target="_self">OnlyFans</a> scam. It's easy to get discouraged. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Despite these challenges (and the very long list of others we <em>didn't</em> mention), there are still plenty of real people out there looking for love, just like you. It's just a matter of finding the <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-apps" target="_self">best dating apps</a> and putting in the effort to weed out the fakes and the flakes.</p><h2>Do dating apps work for most guys?</h2><p>Yes! We're not going to sugarcoat it and say <em>everyone </em>finds love on their first swipe (or even their first app). But here's the thing: Real men and women are finding real connections on these apps every day. One <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2023/02/02/from-looking-for-love-to-swiping-the-field-online-dating-in-the-u-s/#:~:text=Three%2Din%2Dten%20U.S.%20adults,report%20facing%20harassment%20or%20scams." target="_blank">2023 Pew Research Center survey</a> found that one in 10 partnered adults met their significant other through online dating. The numbers are even higher for young people and members of the LGBTQ+ community.</p><p>When asked about their experiences with dating apps, 53 percent of users said they had a positive experience, with 14 percent even rating it as "very positive." Of course, your mileage may vary depending on who you are and what you're looking for. But the good news is that guys seem to be having a pretty decent time, with 57 percent reporting positive experiences and results compared to 48 percent of women. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>Which dating app should I use as a guy?</h2><p>The dating apps we've highlighted in this roundup are a great starting point for guys who are serious about finding a connection, whether it's <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-hookup-apps" target="_self">a casual fling</a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-sites-for-serious-relationships" target="_self">a serious relationship</a>, or something in between. Each app offers unique features and caters to different dating styles, so there's bound to be one that fits your personality and goals.</p><p>Don't be afraid to experiment; try out a few different apps and see what works for you. And most importantly, don't get discouraged by the occasional bad date or disappointing match. Remember, there are plenty of fish in the (digital) sea, and with a little effort, we're sure you'll find the one that's worth reeling in.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/04fLComR6l94grXjCXKGKkT/hero-image.jpg" alt="CrowdStrike logo on smartphone on top of Windows blue screen of death"><p><strong><em>Editor's note:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;Check out&nbsp;<a href="https://mashable.com/live/microsoft-outage-crowdstrike-live-updates" target="_self">our oft-updated live blog</a></em><em>&nbsp;for all new developments about the&nbsp;<a href="https://mashable.com/article/crowdstrike-crash-microsoft-outage-bsod-fix" target="_self">Microsoft/CrowdStrike outage</a></em></p><hr><p>Hospitals, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/grounded-flights-today-list-faa-airport-closures-microsoft-outage" target="_self"><u>airlines</u></a>, television networks, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/banks-affected-microsoft-outage-crowdstrike" target="_self"><u>banks</u></a> &ndash; you name it, it was likely disrupted, delayed, or canceled due to a massive global tech meltdown that took down many companies' systems on Friday.</p><p>The worldwide outages began in the very early morning hours in the U.S. and it became very clear right away that the issue was only affecting Windows-based computers and networks. But as it turns out, Microsoft wasn't to blame.</p><p>Who was behind the outage? A cybersecurity company out of Austin, Texas called CrowdStrike.</p><h2><strong>How CrowdStrike took down the Windows computers around the world</strong></h2><p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/crowdstrike-microsoft-outage-windows-blue-screen-explained" target="_self"><u>CrowdStrike</u></a> is a well-known company in the cybersecurity space. The company was co-founded by George Kurtz, who was the chief technology officer at the antivirus company McAfee. CrowdStrike is publicly traded and has more than 8,000 <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/crowdstrike-cybersecurity-software-global-it-outage-3ca536f6" target="_blank"><u>employees</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>However, CrowdStrike isn't a household name &ndash; at least not to the average consumer. That's because the company provides cyberattack protection to businesses. CrowdStrike has emerged as a leading name in cybersecurity, serving many of the world's largest companies. This widespread client base is why the current issue impacts numerous businesses and their customers.</p><p>CrowdStrike's mission is to ensure that a company's critical data remains secure from malicious actors and to prevent hackers from disrupting business computer systems through cyberattacks. Yet, as it turns out, a mistake made by CrowdStrike itself ended up taking down the computer systems of many of its global customers.&nbsp;</p><p>According to CrowdStrike, an error in a <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/statement-on-falcon-content-update-for-windows-hosts/" target="_blank"><u>recently pushed out update</u></a> for one of its products servicing Microsoft Windows computers ended up resulting in a global tech meltdown. The issue appears related to its cloud-based Falcon platform, specifically the Falcon Sensor product, which CrowdStrike says "blocks attacks on your systems while capturing and recording activity as it happens to detect threats fast."</p><p>As of publication, we don't yet know exactly how CrowdStrike's error was deployed on live client systems. However, based on the information that is available, cybersecurity experts <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/crowdstrike-outage-update-windows/" target="_blank"><u>believe</u></a> the CrowdStrike update issue is related to a kernel driver-related error. A kernel is essentially the core software component of your computer's operating system.&nbsp;</p><p>Usually, if there is an error in an application, a user will find that just that application won't work. However, due to the nature of cybersecurity software requiring deep access to your computer to run efficiently, an error in this type of software could result in your entire computer going down. And that appears to be exactly what happened.</p><p>Computer systems around the world are now experiencing the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/bsod-windows-blue-screen-of-death-explained" target="_self">dreaded</a> Windows "blue screen of death."</p><h2><strong>How long will the CrowdStrike outage last?</strong></h2><p>Once the error was discovered, CrowdStrike actually patched the issue fairly quickly. However, the update was already pushed out and any computer that automatically installed it was quickly affected.&nbsp;</p><p>CrowdStrike also <a href="https://mashable.com/article/crowdstrike-crash-microsoft-outage-bsod-fix" target="_self"><u>provided a fix</u></a> for those Windows systems that already installed the update. But CrowdStrike can't push out an automatic fix to these computers either. Each affected system must be dealt with individually.</p><p>Because each computer needs this individual fix, CrowdStrike CEO Kurtz is warning that it <a href="https://mashable.com/article/crowdstrike-microsoft-outage-how-long-will-it-last" target="_self"><u>might be awhile</u></a> before the outage is completely mitigated.&nbsp;</p><p>Mashable will continue to monitor the CrowdStrike / Microsoft outage and provide updates as we have them.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Nearly every industry was affected. Thousands of flights <a href="https://mashable.com/article/faa-flight-ground-stop-crowdstrike-microsoft-outage" target="_self">were canceled</a>, hospitals turned away patients, and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/banks-affected-microsoft-outage-crowdstrike" target="_self">banks were affected</a>.</p><p>Toward the end of the day Friday, <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/our-statement-on-todays-outage/" target="_blank">CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz put out a statement</a>. Though <a href="https://mashable.com/article/crowdstrike-microsoft-outage-statement" target="_self">hardly his first for the day</a>, he did delve into a few new territories. </p><p>"I want to sincerely apologize directly to all of you for today&rsquo;s outage," Kurtz wrote in a statement. "All of CrowdStrike understands the gravity and impact of the situation. We quickly identified the issue and deployed a fix, allowing us to focus diligently on restoring customer systems as our highest priority."</p><p>The apology seems pointed, considering that Kurtz and CrowdStrike were criticized early on Friday for the lack of an apology over the massive issue. </p><p>Later, Kurtz noted there could be danger ahead.</p><p>He <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/our-statement-on-todays-outage/" target="_blank">wrote</a>:</p><blockquote><p>"We know that adversaries and bad actors will try to exploit events like this. I encourage everyone to remain vigilant and ensure that you&rsquo;re engaging with official CrowdStrike representatives. Our blog and technical support will continue to be the official channels for the latest updates.</p><p>Nothing is more important to me than the trust and confidence that our customers and partners have put into CrowdStrike. As we resolve this incident, you have my commitment to provide full transparency on how this occurred and steps we&rsquo;re taking to prevent anything like this from happening again."</p></blockquote><p>While the issue on Friday was not a cyberattack, it's interesting to note that the CrowdStrike CEO warned of potential bad actors in the future. </p><p></p>]]></content:encoded>

But what is CrowdStrike? What's a "blue screen of death"? And how worried should Windows PC owners be? Here's what you need to know. </p><h3>What is CrowdStrike, and what is Falcon Sensor?</h3><p>CrowdStrike is a cybersecurity company, and Falcon Sensor is software designed to prevent computer systems from cyber attacks. Earlier this morning, on July 19, the company warned its users that Windows systems are "experiencing a bugcheck/blue screen error related to the Falcon Sensor," and said that its engineering teams are "actively working to resolve this issue."</p><p>Apparently, an update to the Falcon software is what caused the issue; the company rolled back the update but numerous machines are still affected. </p><p>Both Microsoft and CrowdStrike have now acknowledged the issue, which is only present on Windows machines, while Mac and Linux computers aren't affected.</p><p><strong>LIVE UPDATES:</strong> <a href="https://mashable.com/live/microsoft-outage-crowdstrike-live-updates" target="_self">Microsoft outage linked to CrowdStrike knocks users offline</a> </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>"CrowdStrike is actively working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts. Mac and Linux hosts are not impacted. This is not a security incident or cyberattack. The issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed. We refer customers to the support portal for the latest updates and will continue to provide complete and continuous updates on our website. We further recommend organizations ensure they&rsquo;re communicating with CrowdStrike representatives through official channels. Our team is fully mobilized to ensure the security and stability of CrowdStrike customers," George Kurtz, CrowdStrike's President and CEO, wrote on X. </p><h3>What's a blue screen of death?</h3><p>If you've been so fortunate to never see a blue screen of death, it is a type of critical error on Windows PCs which essentially halts whatever the computer's been doing and displays an error report on a blue screen. </p><h3>What is CrowdStrike's relationship with Microsoft?</h3><p>CrowdStrike doesn't really have a direct relationship with Microsoft. It is, however, a hugely popular cybersecurity company, especially for large businesses and institutions, due to its reputation of being able to stop cyberattacks in their tracks, and that means it runs on a lot of Windows machines. It is also available for Mac and Linux computers, though the current issue is only related to Windows computers. </p><p>A <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/idc-cover.jpg" target="_blank">report from IDC</a> dated February 2023 placed CrowdStrike at the number one spot when it comes to endpoint security, with a 17.7% market share. Microsoft's own endpoint security solutions are a close second with a 16.4% market share. </p><div id="related-video" class="mx-auto mt-8 mb-12 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans md:mt-12 md:mb-16 text-primary-400">

<h3>How widespread is this issue?</h3><p>CrowdStrike's software is popular and widely used, and as a result, there are numerous outages across platforms including Microsoft 365, Azure, Instagram, eBay, Visa, and AT&amp;T. A number of banks, such as Chase, Wells Fargo, TD Bank, and US Bank appeared to be having issues as well. <a href="https://downdetector.com/" target="_blank">Downdetector</a> is a good place to check which services are having issues. (Full disclosure: Downdetector is owned by Mashable's parent company, ZiffDavis.) </p><p>The problems are widespread enough to have caused some airlines, including Delta, American, RyanAir, and United Airlines, being grounded due to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/frontier-says-operations-impacted-by-microsoft-outage-2024-07-19/" target="_blank">communications issues</a>, apparently related to the outage. </p><p>Sky News was <a href="https://x.com/davidgrayrhodes/status/1814192421921534187" target="_blank">unable to broadcast live TV</a> early on Friday, also apparently due to this problem.</p><p></p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

For most users experiencing problems, this means that they should probably report the issue to their system admin and wait for resolution. </p><p>In a notice to users, CrowdStrike said that there is no need to open a support ticket with CrowdStrike as the company's engineers are aware of the issue and are actively working on it. </p><p>For support from CrowdStrike, users can go to the company's Support Portal over at <a href="http://supportportal.crowdstrike.com/s" target="_blank">supportportal.crowdstrike.com/s</a>. </p><p>There's also an active discussion on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1e6vmkf/bsod_error_in_latest_crowdstrike_update/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, where system admins are sharing their experiences while trying to resolve the issue. </p><p>If you're eager to try to fix the issue yourself, here's a <a href="https://x.com/mike_d_ok/status/1814187157562810388" target="_blank">workaround:</a></p><ol><li><p>"Boot Windows into Safe Mode or the Windows Recovery Environment</p></li><li><p>"Navigate to the C:\Windows\System32\drivers\CrowdStrike directory</p></li><li><p>"Locate the file matching 'C-0000029*.sys', and delete it.</p></li><li><p>"Boot the host normally."</p></li></ol><h3>How long will the Microsoft outage last? </h3><p>While the issue has been "identified, isolated, and a fix has been deployed," per CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz, actually fixing it is not always trivial. This is not a simple update which can easily be deployed to all systems over-the-air, as many of the affected systems crash right after booting up, meaning they're in an endless boot loop. This, in turn, means that the fix must be applied manually (see instructions above) to each affected system, and in large companies, this can take many hours. </p><p>In an <a href="https://www.today.com/video/crowdstrike-ceo-shares-what-spurred-global-outage-215232069726" target="_blank">interview with <em>TODAY</em></a><em>, </em>Kurtz admitted the issues could persist for a while longer.</p><p>"It could be some time for some systems that just automatically won&rsquo;t recover," he said. </p><p>Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella acknowledged the issue around midday Friday but did not provide a timeline for when people could expect the issues to be resolved. </p><p>"Yesterday, CrowdStrike released an update that began impacting IT systems globally," Nadella <a href="https://x.com/satyanadella/status/1814329337451344250" target="_blank">wrote</a> on X.

Osha begins the season as a supporter of the Jedi, even though her intense emotions and grief over losing her family led her to be kicked out of the Order. Her sister Mae, on the other hand, starts off as a devotee to a Sith master, hellbent on gaining justice on the Jedi.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>But by the end of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-acolyte-season-1-finale-review" target="_self"><em>The Acolyte</em></a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-acolyte-season-1-finale-review" target="_self">'s showstopping finale</a>, the twins have swapped places. Osha has turned to the Dark Side, killing Jedi Master Sol (Lee Jung-jae) and becoming the Stranger's (Manny Jacinto) acolyte. In support of her sister's new path, Mae agrees to have her memories wiped, only to wind up in service to the Jedi.</p><p>It's a game-changing finale, one that never loses sight of the relationships that drives it. So much of that is owed to Stenberg, who grounds the series in the connection between Osha and Mae. In an interview with Mashable, Stenberg discussed the catharsis the finale offers both twins, direction from showrunner Leslye Headland, and the already beloved ship between Osha and Qimir/the Stranger.</p><p><em>The following interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</em></p><p><strong>Mashable: The finale of <em>The Acolyte </em>has so many moment that made me stop and go, "Wow, I can't believe we're actually seeing this." So I'd love to know, when you were reading the script, what was the moment that stuck out to you as <em>the </em>showstopper, something you couldn't wait to dive into?</strong></p><p><strong>Amandla Stenberg<em>: </em></strong>I think it had to be Osha killing Sol. Leslye said to me, from the very beginning of the show, when we were in pre-production, "It's very important for a woman in a narrative arc to kill her father." [<em>laughs</em>] I was like, "What does that mean?" </p><p>At first I didn't understand it. But then, as we continued speaking on it, and I went on Osha's emotional journey with her, it made so much sense to me, because I think it's the metaphorical father that she's facing. It's the things that she has been told that she is, the things she's been told she's not capable of, the suppression of self that she has partook in for most of her life, the emotional repression. All of that is coming to a head in a moment in which it's able to release itself, and it takes the form of this tragedy. Knowing that's where Osha was arriving was always such a rich thing for me to get into as I constructed her arc over the season. How does a person arrive to that point? It just became such a fun question for me to delve into.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p><strong>Sol's death is also the first moment we see Osha wield a lightsaber and the Force. What did it mean to you to finally take up these iconic elements of Star Wars in this very emotionally charged context?</strong></p><p>Oh my God, it was so much fun. I freaked out. In the finale, I get to use a lightsaber and pilot spaceships. That was a dream come true for me; that was all I wanted to do.</p><q>

<p><strong>I love how in that moment, Mae's reaction to Osha killing Sol is more gentle and understanding than what we've seen from other Dark Side turns in Star Wars. What does her presence and her reaction mean to Osha as she starts down this new path?</strong></p><p>I'm so happy to hear that. That was something that felt really important to me when approaching Mae's role in those moments. Whenever you're playing someone, you have to think of them as a person. And I always felt that Mae was driven by a profound sense of loyalty and emotionality and identification with her family and where she comes from. So I kind of had that in my back pocket throughout the season, even when it wasn't revealed why she does the things that she does. </p><p>I think that Mae has this deep sense of gratification and release [when Osha kills Sol], both in gaining justice through Osha and also by allowing her sister to be the empowered one in their dynamic. She is used to, since childhood, controlling the power dynamic in their relationship, and she sort of relinquishes that control in that moment. There's a lot of beauty in his death.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p><strong>Then there's that wonderful parting moment between Osha and Mae at the tree on Brendok. When it came to shooting, I'm curious to know which side of the scene you chose to perform first, and why.</strong></p><p>I think I chose Mae first, because Mae's perspective at that moment just felt very clear to me. I wanted there to be the opportunity for there to be a softness in her. Both sisters, they, in this really satisfying way, get to have these parts of themselves that variables out of their control were preventing them from having until that moment. And I just wanted to think about, "Okay, when Mae has experienced this retribution and this release, what parts of her do we get to see?" It felt very important to me that there was a softness and a protectiveness that she felt over her sister, because she's always been motivated by her love for her family. That just felt very simple to me.</p><q>
     Both sisters...get to have these parts of themselves that variables out of their control were preventing them from having until that moment.
    </q>
<p>And then Osha is going through it. [<em>laughs</em>] Homegirl is in the trenches. I knew that Mae was going to be the supportive, guiding force in that moment, so I let that performance guide what Osha did.</p><p>Osha is going through such quick successions of change, while also being embodied. For me, it really felt like her embodiment was going to look like her allowing herself to feel things, which is just what the Dark Side is. It's unchecked emotionality. Her journey is her having this stifled sense of self and being so afraid of her emotions, to then getting to the place where she's allowed to feel and release.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p><strong>Speaking of the Dark Side and emotions, I know a lot of viewers have latched onto the Oshamir ship. I know I was really excited to see that hand-hold play out. What are your thoughts on how things shake out for them here, and what the future might hold?</strong></p><p>It's been really cool to see how into Oshamir people are, because we didn't necessarily know how people were going to respond to it.</p><p>Originally, the romantic arc was a much more significant part of the finale. We had this whole debate around, "Should they kiss? What should happen?" And we just wanted to prioritize Osha's choice of going to the Dark Side feeling more autonomous. That was something that Leslye always spoke to. She said, "I don't want it to feel like Osha was manipulated into making this choice. I don't want it to feel like it was something that was out of her control. I want it to feel like this was a choice that he made for herself, after she had all the information finally available to her."</p><q>
    We just wanted to prioritize Osha's choice of going to the Dark Side feeling more autonomous.
    </q>
<p>So it became more important for us to prioritize the ideological alignment that's happening between Osha and Qimir, and that Osha is finally acknowledged and seen in a deep way, allowed to be who she truly is by this other person. To me, that felt so much more romantically significant than any sort of physical intimacy could be.</p><p><strong>There's a little violin melody in that final moment, and I know that you play the violin. Were you approached to play that?</strong></p><p>No, I wish I could say that was me; that would be so cool!</p><p>I got the chance to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3hCVk5Z9po" target="_blank">play a piece by John Williams on my violin</a>, which was just a piece of video that we made as we were promoting the show. But I don't think anyone was really aware I played violin up until that point. Then our music supervisor came up to me at the premiere and was like, "What the hell! I would have gotten you into the studio months ago!" So if we have the opportunity to go back, maybe that would be something we could explore. </p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/gkAjD?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=All%20episodes%20of%20The%20Acolyte%20Season%201%20are%20now%20streaming%20on%20Disney%2B.&object_type=article&object_uuid=05OE6wUbUGyIs4Qn9ZW2Evz&short_url=gkAjD&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">All episodes of <em>The Acolyte </em>Season 1 are now streaming on Disney+.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00GLNLqUD7juEo5QHur0S0f/hero-image.jpg" alt="Crowdstrike headquarters in Silicon Valley; CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. is a cyber-security technology company"><p><strong><em>Editor's note:</em></strong><em> Check out <a href="https://mashable.com/live/microsoft-outage-crowdstrike-live-updates" target="_self">our oft-updated live blog</a></em><em> for all new developments about the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/crowdstrike-crash-microsoft-outage-bsod-fix" target="_self">Microsoft/CrowdStrike outage</a></em><em>.</em></p><hr><p>Updating your system is imperative to keeping it safe from cyber attacks and other threats. But sometimes it goes wrong &mdash; like it did late this week.</p><p>CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity company that protects companies and users from cyberattacks, made a mistake, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/banks-affected-microsoft-outage-crowdstrike" target="_self"><u>leading to a global meltdown</u></a>. Users with <a href="https://mashable.com/article/crowdstrike-microsoft-outage-windows-blue-screen-explained" target="_self"><u>Windows computers saw the "blue screen of death"</u></a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/grounded-flights-today-list-faa-airport-closures-microsoft-outage" target="_self"><u>flights were grounded</u></a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/banks-affected-microsoft-outage-crowdstrike" target="_self"><u>banks went dark</u></a>, and websites shut down.</p><p>"This was an update to the software that got pushed out to its company's clientele around the world, but particularly those that were using Windows servers, and within a certain time period," Derrick Cogburn, a professor at American University, the Executive Director of the AU Institute on Disability and Public Policy, and the Faculty Co-Director of the Internet Governance Lab, told Mashable. "So it wasn't everybody that uses CrowdStrike, but a pretty sizable set of the community."</p><p>Cogburn said it affected a connected network of companies that were just trying to do the right thing and protect themselves and their users. But "when a provider like CrowdStrike has a problem with an update, it can ripple throughout the industry globally."</p><p>"As we have raised awareness about cybersecurity, more companies and organizations have worked to protect themselves," Cogburn said. "CrowdStrike is one of the best companies out there at protecting companies and organizations from a variety of cyberattacks."</p><p>This was, of course, not a cyberattack &mdash; it appears to have been a mistake in an update &mdash; but these are the same kinds of issues that could arise from a cyberattack. Since CrowdStrike has positioned itself as the leading third-party company that provides safeguards against cyberthreats, many companies have adopted its services. Cogburn argues that CrowdStrike does a good job at combating those attacks &mdash; but it made one grave mistake that caused widespread mayhem. Too many companies are integrated with the same tool. When it fails, an entire global network of companies are affected.</p><h2><strong>How did one software update silence so many systems?</strong></h2><p>"The incident is a great example of the cascading failures that can occur given our relatively homogenous systems that comprise the backbone of IT infrastructure," Gregory Falco, cybersecurity expert and assistant professor of engineering at Cornell University, said over email.</p><p>Rory Mir, the Electronic Frontier Foundation's Associate Director of Community Organizing, told Mashable that these digital systems can't be perfect all the time. We rely on them to safeguard our sites, but they "are going to fail at some point," whether from deliberate attacks or a simple mistake.</p><p>"The problem is that we're really stuck in a digital monoculture, where decades of anti-competitive practices have created it so that just one system is responsible for so much of what we rely on from everything from airlines to hospitals to schools," Mir said. "One mistake that creates a big failure, it happens, it's an inevitability. But for it to have this sort of impact is a policy failure."</p><h2><strong>Who does this affect most?</strong></h2><p>Every time a disaster occurs, we're reminded that those most at risk are also those who are affected the most deeply by these kinds of systemic failures.</p><p>"Something we regularly see with any sort of system failure, things like malware attacks and data breaches, even if the nature of the failure affects everyone across the board, frankly people's resiliency and ability to cope with these things do have a disparate impact," Mir said. "People that have enough money to have backup systems and maybe can get another hotel so they can wait for another flight or something are more able to make it through this sort of disaster."</p><p>Ultimately, access to technology is expensive. And knowing how technology works is, as Mir says, "privileged knowledge."</p><p>"When you have something like this that's so widespread, you sometimes don't think about all of the unintended consequences," Cogburn said. You think about airlines and TV stations, but you might not immediately think about how SNAP EBT is affected (it was shut down for hours) or food services and educational services. While some people are able to pivot easily and drive to the office instead of working from home, others don't have that luxury.</p><p>"For people that have more limited options, if they're relying on connected devices [and] connected services, and those are shut off they may not have the kind of flexibility to pivot into a more face-to-face environment or face-to-face space," Cogburn said. "So I think that's one of the ways that underserved populations are being affected."</p><p>Smaller businesses might be hit harder than larger companies who can "weather the storm a little bit easier," Cogburn explained, because they don't have the same kind of resources to draw from.</p><p>Inevitably, it might lead to some people not trusting systems like CrowdStrike which, Cogburn argues, is "really dangerous." Think about how often you don't want to update your phone, but are then vulnerable to bugs and attacks &mdash; then scale that up by 100.</p><p>"You leave yourself incredibly vulnerable to the reason that the patch was developed in the first place," Cogburn said.</p><h2><strong>How can we make sure this doesn't happen again?</strong></h2><p>These kinds of failures are a bit of an inevitability, but their effects on society doesn't have to be. Mir argues that the widespread nature of this issue is due to a lack of antitrust enforcement by the likes of the DOJ and state attorneys general.&nbsp;</p><p>"So far, antitrust laws have really been focused on lowering prices for consumers, which is great and all, but it's also created this monoculture where it might just be one big company that offers a cheap deal, but then it becomes this huge single point of failure. And we can get this Y2K like scenario," Mir said.</p><p>Mir is hopeful that this massive and unprecedented failure will lead to legislative change.</p><p>"This is largely a failure from the antitrust enforcers themselves &mdash; the DOJ, the FTC, the Attorneys General &mdash; but I think hopefully this disaster will be a wake up call for all of them and potentially for legislators to make sure antitrust laws are working in the consumers and for reasons beyond lowering prices," Mir said.</p><p>Ultimately, this was an unprecedented failure. But, in some ways, we were lucky &mdash; it wasn't a cyberattack. We might not be so lucky next time, so we need to address it now &mdash; before it's too late.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The somewhat hidden Notes appear above comment sections and have a customizable audience.

<p>Instagram Notes were first introduced in 2022 as a way to encourage users to interact with their friends and followers beyond posts and stories, and to match the blueprint of Myspace and AIM away messages. Traditional Notes appear at the top of your chat log and disappear in 24 hours. </p><p>The feature was slow to gain hype among users, however, with the latest update prompting concern among some. Several accounts on Twitter have reported the surfacing of both consensual and <a href="https://x.com/us0ppvixen/status/1814380731742769171" target="_blank">nonconsensual</a> pornographic Reels on their timelines, allegedly because posts with added Notes are getting an early launch <a href="https://www.twitter.com/liahaberman/status/1813972197045940382" target="_blank">algorithmic boost</a>. Others have reported more content from strangers appearing on their feeds, most likely because they have unseen connections with other followers or commenters. </p><p>Just last month, a <em>Wall Street Journal</em> investigation found that the app was still <a href="https://mashable.com/article/instagram-recommends-explicit-content-minors-new-report" target="_self">recommending sexual content to minors via Reels</a>, despite content control limits.  </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>For users at large, such highly incentivized private engagement has others concerned about the feature's potential for online harassment or cyber bulling.</p><p>Earlier this year, Instagram expanded Notes with new music features and later added the ability to reply to Notes with <a href="https://mashable.com/article/instagram-notes-updates-mentions" target="_self">follower prompts</a> &mdash; both bids to get more users engaging with the feature.</p><h2>How to use new Notes on Reels </h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 max-w-3xl">

<p>"The FedEx network is operating across the globe, but potential delays are possible for package deliveries with a commitment of July 19, 2024," FedEx said. UPS, in a similar statement, said "there may be some service delays" but noted overall that its delivery fleet was functional. </p><p>A slightly delayed delivery is inconvenient, but far from the worst consequence of Friday's computer kerfuffle. The dreaded "blue screen of death" came for <a href="https://mashable.com/article/6-industries-affected-by-crowdstrike-windows-outage" target="_self">airlines, hospitals, TV stations, and even Times Square</a>. There is a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/crowdstrike-crash-microsoft-outage-bsod-fix" target="_self">fix for the problem</a> that unfortunately requires manual human intervention (meaning it'll take a bit before everything is back in order), but Friday's outages may be a wake-up call for those who didn't realize just how interconnected the world's technological systems are.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2><strong>Microsoft blames CrowdStrike for its woes</strong></h2><p>Nadella's statement came hours after <a href="https://mashable.com/article/crowdstrike-microsoft-outage-statement" target="_self">CrowdStrike provided one</a> to the press to confirm that the outages were not related to cyberattacks nor any other malicious activity. The outages provided anyone who woke up on Friday morning with constant news headlines about <a href="https://mashable.com/article/6-industries-affected-by-crowdstrike-windows-outage" target="_self">various sectors </a>dealing with delays or shutdowns. </p><p>Airports, banks, 911 emergency dispatchers, hospitals, and TV networks around the globe had to resolve technical issues first thing on Friday morning.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>The good news is the issue <em>is</em> resolvable. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/crowdstrike-crash-microsoft-outage-bsod-fix" target="_self">CrowdStrike released guidance</a> on how to fix the problem shortly after it was discovered, though it involves manually booting the machine into safe mode and deleting a file. As such, any company or service that relies on lots of Windows machines will have to spend some time fixing them all manually. </p><p>Definitely more interesting than your average Friday, if nothing else.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"Symptoms include experiencing a bugcheck\blue screen error related to the Falcon Sensor," CrowdStrike's alert continued. "Our Engineering teams are actively working to resolve this issue and there is no need to open a support ticket."</p><p>Though the CrowdStrike issue is specifically causing Windows to crash, the problem seems to be having further reaching implications. Considering that Windows is an incredibly popular operating system and CrowdStrike an incredibly popular cybersecurity company, companies and services worldwide have had massive issues all of Friday. </p><p>Microsoft acknowledged the issue as well. &ldquo;We're aware of an issue affecting Windows devices due to an update from a third-party software platform.

"We are aware of this issue and are working closely with CrowdStrike and across the industry to provide customers technical guidance and support to safely bring their systems back online."</p><h2><strong>The outages are global, and massive. Here's what's affected</strong></h2><p>Reports of outages have rolled in from several countries around the world, including the United States, <a href="https://x.com/CyberCX/status/1814181930679885902" target="_blank">Australia, New Zealand</a>, India, Japan, and <a href="https://x.com/SkyJacquie/status/1814175380556710308" target="_blank">the UK</a>. As of writing, crowdsourced outage monitor <a href="https://downdetector.com/" target="_blank">DownDetector</a> is indicating a spike in issues across a slew of platforms and businesses in the U.S. as well, including Instagram, eBay, Visa, ADT, and PlentyOfFish. </p><p>Mashable's Alex Perry broke down, in detail, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/6-industries-affected-by-crowdstrike-windows-outage" target="_self">six of the biggest industries and services experiencing problems</a>, but here are the broad strokes. </p><p>"This is a very, very uncomfortable illustration of the fragility of the world&rsquo;s core internet infrastructure," Ciaran Martin, the former chief executive of Britain&rsquo;s National Cyber Security Center, told the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/business/microsoft-outage-cause-azure-crowdstrike.html" target="_blank"><em>New York Times</em></a>.</p><h3>Airline outages</h3><p>Several U.S. airlines, such as American, Delta, and United Airlines, have been <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/frontier-says-operations-impacted-by-microsoft-outage-2024-07-19/" target="_blank">grounded due to communications issues</a>, seemingly also the result of the outage. Thousands of flights have been canceled across the globe.</p><p>UK's <a href="https://x.com/Ryanair/status/1814199381798658382" target="_blank">Ryanair announced</a> that their booking and check-in system is currently down. </p><p>The <a href="https://x.com/FAANews/status/1814236439359393845" target="_blank">Federal Aviation Administration</a> said on X it was "closely monitoring a technical issue impacting IT systems at U.S. airlines, with updates available at <a href="https://t.co/smgdqJN3td" target="_blank">fly.faa.gov</a>. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>See our detailed coverage of all <a href="https://mashable.com/article/faa-flight-ground-stop-crowdstrike-microsoft-outage" target="_self">affected airlines here</a>. </p><h3>Emergency services</h3><p>A number of hospitals and emergency services were affected by the outage. Boston hospital Mass General Brigham, for instance, <a href="https://x.com/BrighamWomens/status/1814270590141768016" target="_blank">said early Friday that</a> "all previously scheduled non-urgent surgeries, procedures, and medical visits are canceled today." Alaskan State Troopers <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AlaskaStateTroopersOfficial/posts/pfbid022K5MYDVWd8fKxJqbYVCm9sKz1UTCd2SB4T9z5s7tRA3ZP5cPupbg4TU6Ev4bxi5Ul" target="_blank">reported</a> on Facebook that "many 911 and non-emergency call centers are not working correctly across the State of Alaska." Worries were so widespread that other locales, such as New York City and Miami-Dade, put <a href="https://x.com/NYCMayor/status/1814276395926986874" target="_blank">out</a> <a href="https://x.com/MiamiDadePD/status/1814283391988125750" target="_blank">statements</a> that their emergency services were <em>not </em>affected. </p><p>As the day wore on, it became clear that countless hospitals across the country were forced to cancel non-emergency appointments while, thankfully, 911 and emergency services seemed to be operation in most places. A total of three states &mdash; Alaska, Oregon, and Arizona &mdash; had areas that had issues with 911 or emergency response systems, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/business/emergency-911-calls-tech-outage.html" target="_blank"><em>New York Times</em> reported.</a></p><h3>Other affected businesses</h3><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/jul/19/microsoft-windows-pcs-outage-blue-screen-of-death" target="_blank">Supermarkets, banks, airlines, telecommunications companies, and TV broadcasters</a> are among the businesses impacted, with <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-07-19/global-it-outage-crowdstrike-microsoft-banks-airlines-australia/104119960?utm_campaign=abc_news_web&amp;utm_content=link&amp;utm_medium=content_shared&amp;utm_source=abc_news_web#live-blog-post-102753" target="_blank">shoppers in Australia reportedly unable to pay for groceries</a> due to electronic payment systems being down. A look at <a href="https://downdetector.com/" target="_blank">DownDetector shows</a> a spike in outages across nearly all industries. Visa, Starbucks, Chase, TD Bank, Bank of America, Walmart, UPS, and countless other businesses appeared to be having issues. Even shipping services, like UPS and FedEX, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/microsoft-crowdstrike-outage-fedex-ups-delivery-delays/" target="_blank">said that deliveries</a> would be delayed due to the outages. The problem is so widespread it is difficult to understand its scope, but it appears to be one of, if not <em>the</em> largest, outages in history. </p><div id="related-video" class="mx-auto mt-8 mb-12 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans md:mt-12 md:mb-16 text-primary-400">

<p></p><h2><strong>Crowdstrike stock plummeting</strong></h2><p>CrowdStrike's stock is down more than 21% in pre-market trading on Friday. By this metric, the company's market cap has shrunk by $16 billion.</p><h2><strong>How long will the outages last?</strong></h2><p>In short: <a href="https://mashable.com/article/crowdstrike-microsoft-outage-how-long-will-it-last" target="_self">It could be a while before the outages are fixed</a>. While fixing the problem might be relatively simple, it needs to be done manually, which means it could take a long time for everything to be back to running normally. Crowdstrike's CEO even admitted it "could be some time for some systems that just automatically won&rsquo;t recover" in an <a href="https://www.today.com/video/crowdstrike-ceo-shares-what-spurred-global-outage-215232069726" target="_blank">interview</a> with <em>TODAY</em>. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><em>Challengers</em> has <a href="https://mashable.com/article/challengers-reactions-zendaya-mike-faist-josh-o-connor" target="_self">set the internet aflame</a> with its sexy love triangle drama. As Mashable Tech Reporter Elena Cavender noted, "It's got everything you want in a movie: a steamy love triangle between incredibly good-looking people (<a href="https://mashable.com/article/west-side-story-review" target="_self"><em>West Side Story</em></a>'s Mike Faist, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/la-chimera-review" target="_self"><em>La Chimera</em></a><em>'</em>s Josh O'Connor, and <a href="https://mashable.com/category/dune" target="_self"><em>Dune</em></a>'s Zendaya), thrilling tennis sequences, and an electrifying score from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross." What's not to love?</p><p>The film hit theaters at the end of April and it's still <a href="https://mashable.com/article/failmarriage-tashi-art-challengers" target="_self">making headlines</a>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;and we can only expect more to come as it is makes its streaming debut. See what director <a href="https://mashable.com/article/bones-and-all-book-vs-movie" target="_self">Luca Guadagnino</a> is serving up in <em>Challengers</em> and discover whether you're Team Art, Team Patrick, or Team Tashi. Here's everything you need to know about how to watch <em>Challengers</em> at home.</p><h2>What is <em>Challengers</em> about?</h2><p>Zendaya stars as a teenage tennis star on the rise, Tashi Duncan, who has what it takes to turn pro until an injury pitches her to the sidelines. Best friends and tennis players Art Donaldson (Mike Faist) and Patrick Zweig (Josh O&rsquo;Connor) are both in love with Tashi. She dates one, then marries the other, but who she'll end up with remains an ongoing question throughout the film. The love triangle plays out in and around the tennis court, with the audience getting smacked back and forth like a ball across a net.</p><p>Here's the official trailer:</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

<h2>Is <em>Challengers</em> worth watching?</h2><p>"While it may be too much for some audiences to handle, there's no doubt <em>Challengers </em>is hands down one of the best and sexiest movies of the year," declares Mashable Entertainment Editor Kristy Puchko. And she's not alone, as the film currently holds an <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/challengers_2024" target="_blank">89% critic rating</a> at Rotten Tomatoes.</p><p>It earned 15 million at the box office on its <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl2915664641/" target="_blank">opening weekend</a> and has gone on to earn about $47 million domestically, meaning it's still going strong a month later. </p><p>While many of the film's <a href="https://mashable.com/article/challengers-wtf-moments" target="_self">WTF moments</a> are certainly a hit on <a href="https://mashable.com/article/challengers-fan-edits-piracy" target="_self">social media</a>, the film is more than just a collection of memes. As Puchko noted, "<em>Challengers </em>is not just a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/challengers-twilight-similarities-zendaya-mike-faist-josh-oconnor" target="_self">sexy love story</a> or a suspenseful sports movie. Imbued with adrenaline in every frame, note, and beat, it is a breathtaking cinematic experience that thrusts you into the center of this love triangle, bounces you about like a ball that lives for the racket's smack, and leaves you breathless with a finale that is indulgent yet deeply satisfying."</p><p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/challengers-review-zendaya" target="_self"><em>Read our full review of Challengers</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2>How to watch <em>Challengers</em> at home</h2><p>Just a month after its theatrical debut, <em>Challengers</em> officially made its video-on-demand debut on sites like Prime Video and Fandango at Home (Vudu).

However, the film will actually be kicking off its streaming life on MGM+ instead. Starting July 29, you can stream the tennis flick on MGM's own streaming service (formerly EPIX). MGM+ is actually owned by Amazon, so it's not as random as you might think. The good news is it comes with a free seven-day trial to get you started, then costs just $6.99 per month.</p><h2>Can I get MGM+ for free?</h2><p>Yes! If you're new to MGM+, you can sign up for the streaming service for free for a week through <a href="https://zdcs.link/6XnL3?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=MGM%2B%20directly&object_type=article&object_uuid=03HDZiKwwL7vriaMMSXyECj&short_url=6XnL3&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">MGM+ directly</a> or as an <a href="https://zdcs.link/ZRkrP?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=add-on%20on%20Prime%20Video&object_type=article&object_uuid=03HDZiKwwL7vriaMMSXyECj&short_url=ZRkrP&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">add-on on Prime Video</a>.

<h2>Best MGM+ streaming deal</h2><h3><a href="https://zdcs.link/W0BNx?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=MGM%2B%20annual%20subscription&object_type=article&object_uuid=03HDZiKwwL7vriaMMSXyECj&short_url=W0BNx&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">MGM+ annual subscription</a></h3><p>As a relatively unknown streaming service compared to Prime Video or Netflix, MGM+ isn't exactly brimming with great deal options. All hope isn't lost, though. If you want to score the streamer for a deal, your best option is to sign up for the annual subscription versus the monthly subscription. You can save 30% by paying for a year up front &mdash;&nbsp;more savings than annual subscriptions at most other streamers.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>The iRobot Roomba j7+ (7550) lets you create a smart map and schedule cleaning sessions, while the self-emptying base means you don't have to empty the dustbin as often.

You may have heard about it.</p><p>But what you may <em>not</em> have heard about is just how many services have been affected by the biggest global IT outage in years. It's not quite a Y2K level of apocalyptic meltdown, but everything from airline travel to broadcasting, 911 calls, and even surgeries, have been troubled by the CrowdStrike outage. </p><p>Here is just a partial list of things that have been brought down by the CrowdStrike glitch.</p><h2><strong>Airlines</strong></h2><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Perhaps one of the most striking sectors to be disrupted by the CrowdStrike outage was the airline industry. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/grounded-flights-today-list-faa-airport-closures-microsoft-outage" target="_self">Flights were grounded globally</a> on Friday morning, with major U.S. airlines like Delta and Allegiant halting operations alongside airlines from countries like France, Spain, Australia, and India. </p><h2><strong>911 calls</strong></h2><p>Many public and private sector services rely on Windows machines for basic infrastructure and tasks &mdash; and the CrowdStrike outage has revealed that 911 emergency dispatchers are no exception. </p><p>Emergency call services went down in places like <a href="https://www.alaskasnewssource.com/2024/07/19/alaska-experiencing-statewide-911-outage/" target="_blank">Alaska</a> and <a href="https://www.wdtn.com/news/ohio/middletowns-911-system-hit-by-phone-outage/" target="_blank">Ohio</a>, with local authorities releasing lists of alternative phone numbers citizens can use instead. Weirdly, in Alaska, 911 was still working in Anchorage, the state's biggest city, even while the system was down in the rest of the state. </p><h2><strong>Hospitals</strong></h2><p>Medical systems around the world also suffered as CrowdStrike's update glitch brought Windows PCs down on Friday morning. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-19/global-it-outage-is-hitting-doctor-appointments-across-the-uk?embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a> reported that British hospitals were having trouble pulling up important patient data, while New York's Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center had to actually delay the start of any surgical procedures that use anesthesia. </p><p>One French hospital had employees manually direct patients to appointments because the check-in process was busted. Interestingly, Pittsburgh's UPMC healthcare provider claimed very few of its Windows devices had problems and there were no disruptions.</p><h2><strong>Stock markets</strong></h2><p>While one might expect a massive Microsoft-linked IT outage to have an effect on Microsoft's stock price, the outage actually temporarily prevented stocks from being traded <em>at all</em> in some places. For instance, the London stock exchange had to <a href="https://www.barrons.com/news/london-stock-market-hit-by-technical-glitch-d0b9bb24" target="_blank">delay the start of trading</a> on Friday morning. </p><p>Because companies runs different systems, many remained unaffected, including the the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, which <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/19/us-stock-exchanges-say-markets-are-operating-normally-not-impacted-by-crowdstrike-outage.html" target="_blank">got up and running</a> on Friday without any issues. </p><h2><strong>TV broadcasts</strong></h2><p>Obviously, TV broadcasting requires lots of computing technology, and with the global popularity of Windows, the CrowdStrike outage was sure to affect at least some networks. </p><p>One of the most prominent was the U.K.'s Sky News, which <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/global/sky-news-off-air-planes-disrupted-global-it-outage-1236078011/" target="_blank">went off the air for a bit</a> on Friday due to the Windows outage. <a href="https://gazettengr.com/french-tv-channels-affected-by-worldwide-tech-outage/" target="_blank">Multiple TV channels in France</a> were also hit, with one being unable to display weather information for viewers due to the technical difficulties. Here in the U.S., NBC News and MSNBC had temporary problems due to CrowdStrike, as have several smaller local networks around the country, per <a href="https://www.adweek.com/tvspy/data-security-program-crowdstrike-takes-out-tv-stations-around-the-world/" target="_blank">Adweek</a>.</p><h2><strong>Times Square</strong></h2><p>Lastly (and perhaps of least importance), Times Square in New York City went dark on Friday morning because, you guessed it, the big screens displaying advertisements in the area run on Windows. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>That workaround aside, global issues still persist. Think of how complicated it may be to individually fix the countless machines and services that use Crowdstrike.

This is not a simple update which can easily be deployed to all systems over-the-air, as many of the affected systems crash right after booting up, meaning they're in an endless boot loop. This, in turn, means that the fix must be applied manually...to each affected system, and in large companies, this can take many hours."</p></blockquote><p>Kurtz later <a href="https://www.today.com/video/crowdstrike-ceo-shares-what-spurred-global-outage-215232069726" target="_blank">admitted in an interview</a> with <em>TODAY</em> that a complete recovery from the issue would take a while. </p><p>"It could be some time for some systems that just automatically won&rsquo;t recover," he said.</p><p>So, uhh, buckle up for a Friday with lots of services down. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://mashable.com/category/prime-day" target="_self">Amazon Prime Day</a> is dead and gone (<a href="https://mashable.com/article/when-is-the-next-prime-day-2024" target="_self">until October</a>, at least), but there are still quite a few lingering deals that have our attention. If you were waiting for that paycheck to hit and missed out on shopping during the official event, we've rounded up a few great deals that are live two days later. Deals on most of Amazon's own devices dried up right after the event ended, but top brands like Apple, Soundcore, Fitbit, Yeti, and TheraGun still have deals going strong.</p><p>Here are our top picks for the best Amazon deals of the day on July 19, two days after the official <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-amazon-prime-day-deals-2024-still-live" target="_self">Prime Day</a> shopping extravaganza. </p><h2>Our top pick</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>If you're a Prime member, you can still snag this exclusive 30% off deal on the Soundcore Life Q30 noise-cancelling headphones. Regularly $79.99, the headphones are on sale for only $55.99. These babies pack dual noise-detecting microphones to sense and filter out up to 95 percent of low-frequency ambient sound. You can choose from three different noise-cancelling modes and listen for up to 40 hours on a single charge (or 60 without ANC turned on). The hybrid design also allows you to connect them using an AUX cable.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>One of Senior Editor Stan Schroeder's <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-prime-day-tech-deals-2024" target="_self">favorite tech deals of Prime Day</a> is still live: 28% off the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-airpods-max-review" target="_self">AirPods Max</a>. "The AirPods Max are stupidly comfy, they sound amazing, look good, and play nice with Apple gadgetry," he writes, noting that he wouldn't normally buy them at full price. However, at $394.99 (reg. $549), they're down to a record-low price that makes them much more worth grabbing.

<p>The new Fitbit Ace LTE by Google just <a href="https://mashable.com/article/may-29-google-fitbit-ace-lte-preorder" target="_self">debuted last month</a>, so a $50 discount is pretty impressive. The watch is designed for kiddos as a way to gamify getting active. It encourages and rewards movement and play throughout the day, while giving parents the ability to keep tabs on their little ones. Parents are able to call, text, and voice message their kids on an Android or iOS phone, see their real-time location, control who their child contacts, and restrict game access during specific times. It's a great pick for parents hoping to swap their kid's screen time for physical activity.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>Attention all gamers: GeForce NOW&rsquo;s summer sale is live, and you won&rsquo;t believe just how good it is this year. </p><p>From now until Aug 18, you can lock in a one-month or six-month <a href="https://zdcs.link/b10ww?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=GeForce%20NOW%20Ultimate%20or%20Priority%20membership&object_type=article&object_uuid=00q0foULmQcNFZZBOmhrKi6&short_url=b10ww&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">GeForce NOW Ultimate or Priority membership</a> for a whopping 50% off the regular price. Bonus: Nine new games were added to the cloud throughout this week, including <em>Capcom&rsquo;s Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em>, so the timing couldn't be better. </p><p>To get this deal, head to the GeForce NOW website and click &ldquo;Join Now.&rdquo; There, you'll see the 50% off Ultimate and Priority plans. Ultimate is around $19.99 per month, but with this discount, you&rsquo;re paying just $9.99 &mdash; that&rsquo;s the same price as a regular priority plan. If you choose a six-month Ultimate membership, you&rsquo;ll only pay $49.99 instead of $99.99. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>When you're on a student's budget, there's not always tons of room for extra expenses, especially when it comes to expensive streaming services. Now, the days of bumming logins can be over: Max is offering a special discount for college students. </p><p>This week, Max launched a new deal that lets college students score a Max with Ads subscription for 50% off. This takes the monthly subscription price down from $9.99 per month to $4.99. This extra $5 per month back in your pocket adds up to $60 over a year. The deal lasts for 12 months, and at the end of the cycle, students can sign up again (as long as they're still in college). </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

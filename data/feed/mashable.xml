<p>Similar to the painstaking reportage Taddeo undertook to write her book, <em>Three Women</em>'s 10-episode run (each running at roughly an hour) takes a really deep dive into the story, with mixed results.&nbsp;</p><h2>What is <em>Three Women</em> about?&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The series brings to our screens the stories from the near decade Taddeo spent interviewing three American women about their sexual desires, how society has impacted the way they manifest, and how they feel about expressing them.&nbsp;</p><p>The book was released in 2019 during the height of the #MeToo movement. Taddeo's incredibly in-depth study into three real women &ndash; Maggie, Lina, and Sloane &mdash; and their bodily, emotional, and sexual desires aligned perfectly with a wider narrative of women demanding to be heard.&nbsp;</p><h2>Who plays the Three Women?</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Creevy plays Maggie, who reflects on an abusive, coercive relationship between herself and her teacher years prior. The series covers said real-life teacher <a href="https://www.thedickinsonpress.com/news/knodel-and-wife-take-stand-deny-he-had-sexual-relationship-with-student" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Aaron Knodel's trial</u></a>, and the misogyny embedded in the justice system, especially when it comes to crimes of sexual violence. Creevy carries the story with a steely innocence, knowing that what happened to her was wrong but often feeling silenced and bullied in response to her efforts to seek justice.&nbsp;</p><p>Wise is striking as Sloane, a restaurant owner and mother who deviates from her husband Richard's (<a href="https://mashable.com/video/three-women-blair-underwood" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Blair Underwood</u></a>) rules when it comes to their polyamorous relationship; he predominantly chooses her matches. Sloane struggles with feeling limited without choice, especially when she meets Will (Blair Redford) and forges a new connection &mdash; only to be met with slut-shaming comments from different people in her life, including her husband. Wise navigates this performance with warmth, grace, and humour, but balances it with incredibly precise fury when needed &mdash; and boy, is it needed. Though Sloane's story is relatively underserved throughout the series, she delivers of the show's most impactful lines about the stigma, guilt and shame around desire: "If [it] makes me a bad person, even if it makes me the worst person, I still want what I want."&nbsp;</p><div id="related-video" class="mx-auto mt-8 mb-12 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans md:mt-12 md:mb-16 text-primary-400">

<p>The character of Indiana homemaker Lina is brought to life with soft vulnerability by Gilpin. Lina is left wanting due to the lack of intimacy in her marriage, and starts to seek it elsewhere as desire starts to eat at her. Additionally, she harbours intense, complicated feelings for her high school boyfriend, who neglected her after she was raped as a teenager.</p><p>Lina's friendship with writer Gia (a character played by Woodley and based on Taddeo, who is expanded upon considerably in the TV series) is fraught, intense, and dysfunctional &mdash; a source of support but also codependence. Woodley's Gia is compelling, as she navigates grief from losing her parents at a young age, as well as other fertility and health issues while fighting to finish her book before she runs out of money. Her portrayal of these issues is important, and devastating at points, but ultimately detracts from the stories of the three women that Taddeo so carefully and artfully portrayed in her book.</p><h2>How does the <em>Three Women</em> TV adaptation hold up?</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>In the book, Taddeo switches perspectives between chapters to hear from the different women, but in the show, the hour-long episodes make the switching difficult to follow and for the viewer to feel close to each story. Each woman&rsquo;s account requires time and sensitivity, and these jarring roadblocks don't allow time to sit with the complexities of their sex lives. A key issue with <em>Three Women</em> is honouring the dramatisation of these true stories without veering into documentary territory, or stretching out the narrative too much. <em>Three Women</em> is, unfortunately, at times guilty of the latter.</p><p>It makes sense to flesh out more of Taddeo&rsquo;s book in a 10-episode TV series, but it also results in us spending episodes away from each story, meaning narratives as intense as Maggie's disappear from our screen for too long. Maggie's story explores a much darker area of grooming, consent, and abuse. We witness her teacher's use of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/dating-app-terms-glossary" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>love-bombing</u></a> and manipulation in haunting scenes in episode 8 (fittingly named "Twilight"), where the show explores the role of novels like Stephenie Meyer's romanticise abusive power dynamics.</p><p>We also see the appalling ways that survivors are treated when they report such abuse, with Maggie being asked what she wore when she was around Knodel, as well as endless interrogations around her own morality. Like the 2020 TV series <em>A Teacher</em>, which also offered a nuanced portrayal of teacher-student grooming, Maggie's story stands as a poignant example of how feelings of desire can be manipulated.</p><h2><em>Three Women</em> covers myriad aspects of female health issues, sexuality, and desire on screen</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>That being said, while the pacing and characterisation choices might detract from the wider story, and the show is still ultimately limited in whose story gets to be told, <em>Three Women</em> does try to cover more variation on the female sexual experience than shows that precede it.</p><p>Through the series' many, many sex scenes, we see examples of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/rachel-thompson-rough-sexual-violence-book" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>stealthing</u></a> (an act of sexual violence when someone either lies about putting a condom on or removes it without the other person's permission), <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-have-period-sex" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>period sex</u></a>, as well as <a href="https://mashable.com/series/feeling-yourself" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>masturbation</u></a>. It brings into sharp relief the acute, overwhelming nature of desire, causing us to reflect on the ways that society often shames women for these feelings. By seeing these cravings up close, as well as the way women are often violated by men's desire, we are confronted with the realities of the female sexual experience &ndash; both the liberating and the damaging.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When it comes to the duty <em>Three Women</em> pays to the stories told about women's bodies, we also see the debilitating impact of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/endometriosis-sex-lives" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>endometriosis</u></a> pain and the dismissive nature of both Lina's husband and medical professionals about it. We also see Sloane's grappling with an eating disorder as well as the aftermath of a miscarriage.&nbsp;</p><p>So often, the stories told around women&rsquo;s bodies, as well as on-screen portrayals of female desire, feel either sanitised, romanticised, or one-dimensional, leaving out the nuance, messiness, and guilt that come with living in a patriarchal society. <em>Three Women</em> hits back against this norm.</p><h2><em>Three Women</em> is ultimately an empowering watch</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>What's refreshing about <em>Three Women</em> isn't just its close look at so many areas of the sexual and desire spectrums for women, but also its focus on different women's walks of life. While <em>Sex and the City</em> and <em>Girls</em>, for example, portrayed sexual exploration from a specifically metropolitan, New York City-centric, white point of view, Taddeo's characters are based on real-life women from middle parts of America, including North Dakota and Indiana. The result is a more holistic portrayal of women's sex lives &mdash; though it must be pointed out, three of the four lead actors are white women.</p><p>Ultimately, <em>Three Women</em> is about feeling heard and hearing others. All three women express the empowerment they feel at telling their story to someone, and Gia is empowered by hearing them. As Sloane tells Gia, "I'm tired of stories of women not winning."&nbsp;</p><p>It's debatable whether any of the women "win" in a wider sense &ndash; but perhaps their stories being told, and the people the TV series will touch as a result, is a victory in itself.</p><p><strong>How to watch: </strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/QGVo48?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Three%20Women%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Starz.&object_type=article&object_uuid=000hNP8z0N6JMJ6MHGt12My&short_url=QGVo48&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Three Women</em> is now streaming on Starz.</a></p><p><em>If you have experienced sexual abuse, call the free, confidential National Sexual Assault hotline at 1-800-656-HOPE (4673), or access the 24-7 help online by visiting <a href="http://online.rainn.org" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>online.rainn.org</u></a></em><em>.</em></p><p><em>If you feel like you&rsquo;d like to talk to someone about your eating behavior, text "NEDA" to the Crisis Text Line at 741-741 to be connected with a trained volunteer or visit the National Eating Disorder Association <a href="https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>website</u></a></em><em> for more information.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I was one of those<em> </em>'Is there something wrong with me?'<em> </em>AirPods users who had to purchase ear hooks to supplement my first-generation AirPods Pro because they kept falling out. (It seemed like everyone else had their AirPods Pro secured, but because my ears are an anomaly, I had trouble keeping them in.)</p><p>However, to my surprise, the AirPods 4 fit <em>super </em>snug. Shaking, tilting and bobbling my head, the AirPods didn&rsquo;t move an inch. How could this be? </p><h3><strong>Secure fit</strong></h3><p>Apple said that it analyzed thousands of ear shapes and over 50 million data points using advanced technology to design a more secure and precise fit (for <em>most </em>people) on the AirPods 4. And let me tell you, whatever Apple did during its analysis, it worked &mdash; for me at least. </p><p>I've got a set of unusual ears, and despite their weird, atypical shape, the AirPods 4 had a tight fit in my canal without taking a tumble.</p><h3><strong>Active noise cancellation is surprisingly good</strong></h3><p>Next, I fired up one of my favorite songs of the year: Sabrina Carpenter's "Espresso." There was a white noise simulation in the demo room, similar to the drone of an airplane, and then I turned on active noise cancellation.</p><p>Whoa!</p><p>It was as if the noisy world around me disappeared, allowing Carpenter's sugary sweet vocals to take center stage. Even if you're not in a crowded room nor a noisy street, you don't realize how cacophonous your surroundings are until you turn on ANC. From the tick-tock of a nearby clock and distant traffic to the hum of an air conditioner to the buzz of a refrigerator motor, these environmental sounds negatively affect the immersion of your listening experience.</p><p>"Espresso" already sounds like a warm vanilla brew with a frothy finish, but with ANC on, it felt like Carpenter was serenading me in a cozy soundproof caf&eacute; while I sipped on a pumpkin spice latte.</p><p>Why was I blown away? Well, for starters, it's darn-near unheard of to find ANC in an open-ear design like the entry-level AirPods. The AirPods Pro 2, for example, have silicon tips that create a tight seal in consumers' ears, making it easier to block external sounds alongside ANC technology. </p><p>But open-ear designs like the AirPods 4 are tricky because they don't fully seal your ears, leaving 'em somewhat exposed. However, Apple managed to pull it off, thanks to a m&eacute;lange of upgraded microphones, the H2 processor, and cutting-edge computational audio.</p><p>I'm eager to put the AirPods 4 to the test in more challenging environments, like airports, for example. The <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-airpods-max-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">AirPods Max</a>, in my opinion, are <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-airpods-max-vs-sony-wh-1000xm5-noise-cancellation" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">the best active noise cancellation headphones</a>. It's unlikely that the AirPods 4 will be able to compete with the AirPods Max, but I'm curious to see whether it could be a portable alternative with some trade-offs.</p><p>The AirPods 4 come in two models: one with ANC and one without.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/067lWt7LRKyjcHFRxNoAK8y/hero-image.png" alt="Apple Vision Pro"><p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-vision-pro-reviews" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple's Vision Pro</a> has a way of showing the world a virtual version of you while you interact with others in virtual reality. Unfortunately, this very feature &ndash; called Persona &ndash; could've been used by hackers to steal a Vision Pro user's sensitive data. </p><p>The security flaw was discovered by a group of six computer scientists from the University of Florida's Department of Computer Science, and it was first reported on by <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-vision-pro-persona-eye-tracking-spy-typing/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Wired</a>. </p><p>The <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/gazeploit/home" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">GAZEploit attack</a>, as it was dubbed by the researchers, works by tracking the eye movements of a user's Persona to identify when they're typing something on the Vision Pro's virtual keyboard. The researchers discovered that users tend to direct their gaze onto specific keys that they're about to click, and were able to construct an algorithm that identified what the users were typing. The results were quite accurate; for example, the researchers were able to identify the correct letters of users' passwords 77 percent of the time. When it came to detecting what people were typing in a message, the results were accurate 92 percent of the time. </p><p>The researchers disclosed the vulnerability to Apple back in April, and Apple fixed it in visionOS 1.3, which came out in July. In the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/120915" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">release notes</a>, Apple says that the flaw enabled inputs to the virtual keyboard to be inferred from Persona. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-DPYT8IH-R18"></div>
</div>


<p>"The issue was addressed by suspending Persona when the virtual keyboard is active," Apple wrote in the release notes. Vision Pro users who haven't yet updated to the latest version are advised to do so as soon as possible.</p><p>While simply disabling Persona while the user is typing was a pretty simple fix, the flaw does raise the question of just how much info a malicious hacker could infer just by observing a virtual version of you.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

    </div>
<p>The researchers said that the attack hasn't been used against someone using Personas in the real world. But what makes this attack particularly dangerous is that it only requires a video recording of someone's Persona while the person was typing, meaning an attacker could still use it on an older video. It seems that the only way to mitigate this issue is to erase any publicly available videos where your Persona is visible while typing; we've reached out to Apple for clarification on what can be done to protect your data.</p>]]></content:encoded>

If you want GPS <em>and</em> cellular support, that will set you back $50.</p><p>The Apple Watch Series 9 costs $399 on <a href="https://zdcs.link/noZnj?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%27s%20official%20website&object_type=article&object_uuid=041zHV4nuEy4RO8CDB4dhK0&short_url=noZnj&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple's official website</a> (again, this is the cheapest you can get in this model).</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2><strong>Apple Watch Series 9 vs. SE: Display</strong></h2><p>The first thing I noticed about the Watch SE is that it has thicker bezels, which reduces its screen real estate &mdash; and the display is minimal to begin with.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The Watch Series 9's bezels are a lot less obstructive, but either way, I still found display navigation to be fine on both screens. Thicker bezels, in my opinion, aren't a big deal. </p><p>It's also worth nothing that the resolution is different for the watches:</p><p><strong>Watch Series 9 (41mm) - 430 x 352 pixels </strong></p><p><strong>Watch SE (40mm) - 394 x 324 pixels </strong></p><p>Looking at them side by side, the Watch Series 9 definitely delivers a sharper, clearer visuals. But if I were looking at the Watch SE independently, I would think that the display quality is sufficient enough. </p><p>Now, let's talk brightness:</p><p><strong>Watch Series 9 (41mm) - up to 2,000 nits</strong></p><p><strong>Watch SE (40mm) - up to 1,000 nits</strong></p><p>The Watch Series 9 is supposedly brighter than Series 9, delivering a max of 2,000 nits over the SE's 1,000-nit screen. However, while comparing both watches in the sun, I could see both of them just fine, even with the rays shining bright on them like a spotlight. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>You can tell the Watch SE is <em>slightly </em>dimmer, but the difference is negligible to the naked eye.</p><p>The main difference between the two screens, however, is the always-on display. I thought I wouldn't care about the Watch SE not having an always-on display (AOD). (For the uninitiated, AOD means that the screen is always feeding you visual information.)</p><p>However, I found myself getting frustrated that I had to keep either touching the Watch SE's screen or flick my wrist toward myself to check the time. Meanwhile, the Watch Series 9, well, <em>stays on</em>. As you can see in the photo below, the Watch SE's screen is completely dark, but the Series 9's display is still "active" (though it is dimmed). </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>I went with the Silver finish for the Watch SE along with the Ocean Blue solo loop &mdash; and I regret it. Oddly, the solo loop collects dirt easily. And unlike the sports band that's featured on the Watch Series 9, the solo loop requires custom sizing.

<p>The sports band has an adjustable strap, allowing me to make it as tight or loose as I need it to be. The solo loop, on the other hand, is just a stretchy bracelet band.

<p>If you're more fitness-focused, and you don't mind the thicker bezels and lack of always-on display, the Watch SE is a solid choice.</p><p>You, like me, may assume that the Watch Series 9 has better battery life because it's pricier, but in my experience, both held up pretty well in terms of power efficiency (though the Series 9 edged out the Watch SE by an hour or so).</p><p>The only thing I'd warn against is getting the solo loop band for your Apple Watch. It seems to get loose after some time &mdash; and it's not very durable. Instead, get the sports band, allowing you to adjust the Apple Watch to your wrist as you like it.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

Is it worth $20-something per month? Depends on how much fishy content you're willing to overlook for a juicy sexting session. </p><p>We reached out to Kalyn Sanders, a business development executive at Friend Finder Networks, for updated AFF demographics.

(To whet your appetite upon signup, the main landing page flashes a few statistics, including "98,897,765 hot photos" and "3,495,277 connections," but we're not exactly sure what that means.) Most traffic originates from the United States, followed by visitors from the United Kingdom and Canada. Visits to AdultFriendFinder have dropped in recent months &mdash; it used to be the 25th most-visited adult site in the U.S. according to <a href="https://www.similarweb.com/website/adultfriendfinder.com/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">SimilarWeb</a>, but as of May 2024, it's ranked 33rd.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Specifics on the demographic that most people care about &mdash; the gender ratio &mdash;&nbsp;can be hard to track down. Sanders told us that "there's a two to one ratio of single men versus categories like single women, couples, and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/what-is-consensual-non-monogamy" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">groups</a>."

Despite trying to be a sex-positive site with blog posts, groups, a sex academy, and more, its language for the LGBTQ community has historically been anything but inclusive or positive. Previously, the AFF sign-up page listed "TG/TV/TS" as the "trans" gender selection &mdash; we'll let you infer what those stand for. After reaching out to AdultFriendFinder about it, this language has improved some with more gender options that are appropriately labeled &mdash; though "trans" is still a separate selection from "man" or "woman."</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>Should you sign up for AdultFriendFinder?</h2><p>If you're 100 percent over being grilled with relationship questions and the slow-and-steady pace on traditional dating sites like <a href="https://mashable.com/review/eharmony-vs-match" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">eharmony or Match</a>, AdultFriendFinder is your golden ticket to instant communication. Registering takes about 30 seconds &mdash;&nbsp;it requires nothing from you aside from an email address, a username, a password, and an introduction. Your notifications will start pouring in even without adding any juicy info (because people see nothing wrong with hitting up a profile with a gray silhouette as a profile photo, apparently), but it's probably best to add a few photos and a detailed description &mdash; both to up your chances of flirtation or finding someone who shares a super-specific fantasy, and also to signal to other users that you're not a bot.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>After registering, there are a ton of ways to personalize your account (way more than you'd expect for a hookup site, honestly). The more you fill out, the more attractive your profile will be to new viewers. There are the basic physical appearance questions about eye and hair color, and since I identified as a woman, cup size was an option. (If you identify as a man, I'm sure you can guess what question they ask.) </p><p>Many self-proclaimed hookup seekers can probably admit that they'd still like to hook up with someone they'd also like to grab a beer with, especially if they plan to see that person multiple times. Those people will appreciate that AFF gives a compatibility score with each user you come across: a metric that rates how well you might mesh with someone in the bedroom based on how you answered questions about what turns you on, whether you're dominant or submissive, and so on.</p><p>The site also features a personality test and a "My Kinks" form where you can select whether or not you're "curious about, into, or can't live without" a certain kink (e.g., anal, bondage, role play, etc.). It also lets you choose whether you're a voyeur, the giver, or the receiver. </p><p>One weird thing about the Personality Type test is that it asks several questions about whether or not you enjoy shopping at discount stores &mdash; not really sure what that's about. It also asks whether or not "a quiet time for prayer should be allowed in school." You can choose "strongly disagree, somewhat disagree, somewhat agree, or strongly agree."</p><p>Once you finish the personality test (20 questions), you can opt to have your Personality Type show up on your profile or have it hidden. It will also show you which personality types complement yours. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2>Finding a match on AdultFriendFinder</h2><p>Like a traditional dating site, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aeBO5?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=AdultFriendFinder&object_type=review&object_uuid=0584LOJucOI7y32ZFmDy9gV&short_url=aeBO5&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">AdultFriendFinder</a> gives you a collage of potential matches and will let you know who's online or close distance-wise. These will be random right after you sign up, but you can opt to update your preferences to refine your results: Choose your preferred gender(s), age range, location and mile radius, race, sexual orientation, body type, and marital status.</p><p>You <em>barely</em> have to scroll before noticing that there's no shortage of nudity. Depending on whether you set your preferences to men, women, or both, you'll see all of that stuff up close, personal, swinging around, in action. You name it, it'll pop up. </p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/aeBO5?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=AdultFriendFinder&object_type=review&object_uuid=0584LOJucOI7y32ZFmDy9gV&short_url=aeBO5&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">AdultFriendFinder</a> is basically like a <a href="https://mashable.com/category/pornhub" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">PornHub</a> that you can interact with. We probably don't have to say this, but AdultFriendFinder is NSFW and not safe to be on while kids are in the room. If you'd rather not see the site's raunchier side, it offers a "no nudity" option, but I still wouldn't trust this filter enough to be online in a family setting or at work. Some videos will be blurred out and read "Naughty video" until you upgrade to a Gold Membership, but trust me &mdash;&nbsp;you'll get to see a lot, even with the free version.</p><p>The message section is set up similarly to a Gmail account, and you can mark things as read or important just as you would on a real email. You'll receive some crude messages instantly (creeps on Tinder do the same thing), but some will be genuinely friendly.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>AFF is not all bad</h2><p>Once you get past the in-your-face sexplosion of naked profile pictures, horny AIM-era profile names, and explicit videos, there are actually an impressive number of resources to help make your experience as satisfying as possible. Some will cost money even outside of the paid subscription, which is kind of dumb. </p><p>Aside from the NSFW content, the website is relatively straightforward (albeit ugly). Every feature is advertised in big letters, notifications are displayed clearly with labels, and you don't really have to click around to find anything. This makes it super accessible for users of all ages, even those who aren't tech-savvy and can't even figure out Facebook. Buttons are all over the place, but you figure it out after messing around for a few minutes.</p><p>Activities range from direct messaging, sending virtual gifts and tips, watching live videos of people in your feed, joining adult chat rooms that can get <em>very </em>niche, or entering photo contests.</p><q>
    AdultFriendFinder is like a PornHub that you can interact with.
    </q>
<p>Think of AdultFriendFinder as the dating site version of New York City &mdash; it never sleeps. You'll find people who work the regular 9 to 5, people who work the night shift, and people in other time zones, so it's nearly impossible to log on and not have people to talk to. You know, like that booty call who's always awake when you text them.</p><p>Or at least that <em>used</em> to be the case... 10 years ago. What was once a hot site that a few <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/94sji/i_am_a_gold_member_on_adultfriendfinder_and_an/#bottom-comments" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Reddit users</a> were quick to hype up is now one of the dating sites that Reddit users can't help but diss &mdash; in the few instances that AFF is even being discussed at all. It's notable that, on a site where online dating is such a mammoth topic of discussion, AdultFriendFinder has rarely been mentioned in a positive light since the early 2010s. The Reddit community is diverse and open-minded; if a dating site exists, someone on Reddit has used it and has an opinion. When <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/25ss49/adult_friend_finder_is_it_useful_at_all_dangerous/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">an innocent soul does ask if it's legit</a>, AFF usually gets dragged for sketchy pricing and being riddled with bots.</p><p>However, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineDating/comments/11jk2qj/honest_review_on_adultfriendfinder_needed/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">some Reddit members</a> have praised AFF as a site for men meeting men.

<h2>Paid memberships are where things get... interesting</h2><p>You can do a decent amount of exploring without paying a cent: Limited messaging and emailing, visit and like most profiles, and enter some chat rooms. But just a few clicks on <a href="https://zdcs.link/aeBO5?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=AdultFriendFinder&object_type=review&object_uuid=0584LOJucOI7y32ZFmDy9gV&short_url=aeBO5&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">AdultFriendFinder</a> can send you deep down the rabbit hole, and a lot of that juicier hidden content can only be unlocked with a paid membership (called the Gold membership) or by earning points.</p><p>Points are AdultFriendFinder's non-monetary currency. If you use the free version, you'll have to earn points through on-site activity to unlock stuff that's exclusive to paying members. It's kind of like a game, with points acting like dollar bills at the strip club.</p><p>A Gold membership is pretty much the standard if you're a guy looking for girls. While researching on Reddit, we found a few women who said they wouldn't meet a guy unless he's a Gold member. A Gold membership puts a little bit more credibility behind someone's profile and makes the whole encounter feel a bit safer. It's easier to believe that someone's a real person if they're a paying, active member of the site, and it's nice to know that they're taking it slightly seriously. Plus, if you see a picture or profile that looks like it's 10 years old, it really might be &mdash;&nbsp;there are a ton of non-active, non-paying profiles from old members and escorts still lingering. </p><p>AdultFriendFinder also gives members the option to confirm their identity with ConfirmID. If you do this, the site promises to give you two weeks of Gold for free. The ConfirmID works by entering your legal first and last name, home address, gender, and date of birth and uploading a copy of your driver's license, passport, or other government-issued ID. </p><p>If you spend more quality time on the site than expected, becoming a paid member is definitely something to consider. Once you're paying, you basically become royalty on the site: Your profile will appear way higher in searches, you can use the most advanced searches, unlock profiles with private photo albums, check out video profiles, and message to your heart's content. A general rule is that increased involvement and payment on your end generally equals more success on the website, as your constant activity and heightened searchability make it easier for others to find you.</p><h2>AdultFriendFinder pricing</h2><p>Prices for a Gold membership fluctuate but generally get cheaper the longer your subscription is: Get one month for $27.95, three months for $20.95 per month ($62.82 total), or 12 months for $14.95 per month ($179.40 total). The three-month membership is billed quarterly, while the 12-month membership is billed annually. With a Gold membership, free members cannot contact you, but they can still see your profile. </p><p>In addition to the Gold membership, AdultFriendFinder also offers Voyeur (enhanced profile gallery and hi-res member videos viewing) at $14.99 per month, Interaction (enhanced member-to-member interaction) at $14.99 per month, Chat Plus (enhanced direct member-to-member communication) at $9.99 per month, and Advanced Search and Highlight at $4.99 per month.</p><p>This is the pricing at the time of publishing, but according to AdultFriendFinder, pricing is subject to change.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2>Good for: Very open-minded people looking to blow off steam</h2><p>Stating the obvious, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aeBO5?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=AdultFriendFinder&object_type=review&object_uuid=0584LOJucOI7y32ZFmDy9gV&short_url=aeBO5&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">AdultFriendFinder</a> is a space for people who want to <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-hookup-apps" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">bang with no strings attached</a>, people who are in a sexual rut, people who are tired of porn, and people who find sites like <a href="https://mashable.com/review/eharmony-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">eharmony</a> boring. Getting to know someone for weeks before meeting up can be exhausting, and sometimes, you want to skip the small talk and do the dirty with a random. It's gonna get kinky out there, and that's great for those who are dying to blow off steam and want someone who will respond well to a brusque, sexy message.</p><p>People are so active on this site that it's impossible not to feel desired. You'll probably get a flood of message notifications, and once you come across your first legit suitor, you'll start to loosen up. Even if you're left on read a few times, you'll learn which opening lines and flirty comments work and which don't. But since the site is aimed toward casual sex and encounters and not <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-sites-for-serious-relationships" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">serious relationships</a>, the whole rejection thing isn't nearly as prevalent. </p><p>As with all dating sites, catfishing is a big buzzkill. Your chances of being pursued are way higher if you have a lot of pictures of the same person (AKA you), videos, and a genuine profile that lets people know they're not dealing with something sketchy. Even if you've had bad luck with online dating in the past, AdultFriendFinder is the place to be honest. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>Bad for: People looking for a real relationship and the entire socially conscious community</h2><p>You know those warnings that thrill rides at amusement parks are required to put up that tell people who get dizzy easily or have heart problems to not get on the ride? AdultFriendFinder could use something like that. This site is not for the faint of heart &mdash; if you're a cynic, conservative by any means, get sketched out easily, or aren't a fan of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/cyberflashing-unsolicited-dick-pics-terminology" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">dick pics</a>, you'll probably hate it. Similarly, if you appreciate a well-crafted, aesthetically pleasing website that feels safe &mdash; no matter how badly you want to have sex &mdash; one glance at the landing page likely signals that it's not for you.</p><p>AdultFriendFinder is not the place to be if you're trying to make friends unless "with benefits" is tacked onto the end. Every inch of the site screams "this website is used to have sex," and you should really listen to that.</p><p>As illustrated by the recent flood of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/user-made-educational-instagram-guides" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">artsy activism guides on Instagram</a>, it's clear what content appeals to young people on the internet: Something aesthetically pleasing, sharable, and digestible. The "sharable" part doesn't totally apply to online dating, but apps like Hinge and OkCupid closely follow this design trend by limiting the number of words (and ads) in each tab, steering clear of endless scrolling, and ensuring that important info isn't cluttered with flashing clickbait. </p><p>For instance, <a href="https://zdcs.link/Gp84K?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Pure&object_type=review&object_uuid=0584LOJucOI7y32ZFmDy9gV&short_url=Gp84K&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Pure</a> is a modern, no-strings-attached hookup app that appeals to your horny side with a single, witty statement about sex rather than bombarding you with boobs and "Have sex in NYC now!" claims. Anyone older than a millennial may be totally used to this pop-up-ridden layout, which seemed to be popular in the early 2000s &mdash; but for younger folks, AFF's chaotic approach is way too reminiscent of Omegle.</p><h2>AFF could do so much more to make people take it seriously</h2><p>The entire website looks like an ad about hot MILFs that pops up when you're illegally streaming a movie. Seriously, it's bad. Even though the AFF website is technically legit, the pictures, word choice, and exclamation points everywhere <em>scream</em> "scam." No, AdultFriendFinder, "98,897,765 Hot Photos" is not the way to make potential new users trust you.</p><p>We're not knocking a quick hookup or no-strings-attached relations. This isn't about morals. Genitals are quite literally in your face from the moment you make an account, and that's just not cute. There are chiller ways to go about insinuating that this is a hookup website <em>without</em> feeling like you're trapped in a sex dungeon with strangers.</p><p>I could not get past the fact that the entire site looks like it's about to invite five viruses to your computer. We're talking terrible graphics that look like they were made on Microsoft Paint and pictures of women who look like they're from Pornhub in 2007. (That's when AdultFriendFinder was officially sold and rebranded from its original parent company.) <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Snoo53279/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Reddit user Snoo53279</a> summed it up in a comment from July 2020: "The people on AFF are definitely real, but there is a huge smattering of bots that also get in the way so it can be a bit of a PITA to use." If they're not bots, they could be <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/cnc46f/adultfriendfindera_study_in_all_thats_wrong_with/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">men posing as a couple</a> to seem less threatening.</p><p>The parade of women on the landing page is questionable for two reasons. This shouldn't even need to be clarified, but not everyone is looking for a woman. At the least, the advertising isn't inclusive &mdash; but this crosses into fetishization territory. The cherry on top is that the women in the photos (unsurprisingly) probably aren't even members of the site, according to a disclaimer at the bottom of the landing page.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>AdultFriendFinder's overall outdated vibe goes past an aesthetic annoyance &mdash; it's downright problematic at times. The lack of inclusivity for the LGBTQ+ community is nearly unforgivable, and we'd be scared to see some of the related rhetoric that AFF users feel comfortable spewing. Without even a dash of social awareness, it's hard to see how anyone who's not an out-of-touch straight cis man would feel comfortable on this site.</p><p>Attempting to navigate the shoddy design might be enough to smother your horniness. Three main issues can make the site borderline unusable: It looks shady as hell, an alarming portion of the user base is made up of bots and spam accounts, and the user interface itself is outdated and rife with bugs.</p><p>Other Reddit users mention that the desktop web version won't even load for them at random times &mdash; an especially frustrating roadblock for people who want to end their membership and stop monthly charges. A solution to the laggy web version might be to clear your cache or use the smartphone app, but your experience probably won't improve. <a href="https://zdcs.link/mvG1J?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=AFF%27s%20mobile%20page&object_type=review&object_uuid=0584LOJucOI7y32ZFmDy9gV&short_url=mvG1J&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">AFF's mobile page</a> doesn't even mention an Android app, and the link to the iPhone app brings up a "not available" pop-up in the App Store. For a site that claims to have over 50 million visitors each month, the lack of accessibility to a smartphone app is just plain <em>odd</em> &mdash;&nbsp;especially in 2023.</p><p>Adding to the sketchiness, a <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/adultfriendfinder-network-hack-exposes-secrets-of-412-million-users/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">network hack in 2016</a> exposed around 412 million accounts, including "deleted" accounts that weren't actually deleted from the database.

Signing up with a burner email and avoiding using your real name as a username are wise moves (pick a naughty word and add 69 to the end, IDK), though keeping your personal information private is hard when credit cards are involved. </p><p>In 2007, <a href="https://www.scmagazine.com/home/security-news/adultfriendfinder-com-settles-with-ftc/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">AFF was involved in a lawsuit with the FTC</a> over allegations that the site used malware to send explicit pop-up ads to computers owned by people who hadn't signed up for the service. Though we haven't seen reports like this recently, so we're hoping those ridiculous ads you see are at least confined to people who actually use the site.</p><h2>The alternatives to AdultFriendFinder</h2><p>Surprisingly, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aeBO5?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=AdultFriendFinder&object_type=review&object_uuid=0584LOJucOI7y32ZFmDy9gV&short_url=aeBO5&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">AdultFriendFinder</a> feels much more legit than its competitors. While other hookup sites like AdultFriendFinder have names like FreeSnapMilfs.com, Fuckswipe.com, and Instabang.com, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aeBO5?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=AdultFriendFinder&object_type=review&object_uuid=0584LOJucOI7y32ZFmDy9gV&short_url=aeBO5&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">AdultFriendFinder</a> will be the one you'd hate showing up in your Google search history the least. Most have the same general idea: to find sexual partners, have cybersex, etc., but with names like those, the authenticity is way too questionable. AdultFriendFinder boasts a much larger audience and has built credibility in a Tinder-saturated market where these blunt, friskier competitors may have trouble gaining trust.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>No matter <em>how</em> in the mood you are, your hungry eyes may not be able to look past AFF's heinous interface. We mentioned <a href="https://zdcs.link/emvp1?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Pure&object_type=review&object_uuid=0584LOJucOI7y32ZFmDy9gV&short_url=emvp1&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Pure</a> earlier. The aesthetically pleasing, hella-millennial UX design is simply more palatable than AFF and the blueprint of what a modern hookup app should be. Kind of like a Snapchat for sex; your uploaded selfies, personal info, and conversations will self-destruct every 60 minutes. The app will send the hookup version of an Uber request to anyone close and ready to rumble, and you can choose what information to disclose from there. </p><p>Remember when we said AdultFriendFinder would be a nightmare for gay and bi women? <a href="https://zdcs.link/p8BLv?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Feeld&object_type=review&object_uuid=0584LOJucOI7y32ZFmDy9gV&short_url=p8BLv&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Feeld</a> is our favorite alternative app dedicated to singles and couples looking for threesomes, foursomes, or however many people you want &mdash;&nbsp;<a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-apps-for-bisexual-people" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">minus the unicorn hunting</a> and rampant fetishization that many non-hetero, non-monogamous people face on traditional hookup sites and apps.

Feeld has since told Mashable that locations shared were not users' current exact locations, rather the name of the city, town, or borough.</p><h2>The final verdict: Is AdultFriendFinder worth it?</h2><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/aeBO5?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=AdultFriendFinder&object_type=review&object_uuid=0584LOJucOI7y32ZFmDy9gV&short_url=aeBO5&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">AdultFriendFinder</a> is a low-pressure way to find a friends-with-benefits situation without insulting anyone. Everyone is pretty much there for the same reason &mdash; and though it'll feel pretty unorthodox if you've only ever used Tinder to scope this type of thing out, AFF's blunt advertising at least means you won't have to explain that you're not looking for a relationship. It's niche-friendly, well-populated, and has a ton of interactive outlets to indulge your primal urges.</p><p>But that freedom comes with a price &mdash;&nbsp;the price is feeling like one of those people who fall for the ads that pop up before a free Pornhub video. It's not that a site dedicated to sex and sexting is inherently scammy &mdash;&nbsp;it's that AdultFriendFinder drowns you with explicit photos on profiles that might not even be real people while asking you to pay for a subscription with every click. </p><p>Unfortunately, no matter how in the mood you are, some people aren't cut out for the nothing-left-to-the-imagination approach with grammar mistakes all over the place. It wants to be sex-positive so badly, but the language the site has used in reference to the trans community is the furthest thing from that.</p><p>The functionality and safety of the site and the mobile app aren't where they need to be in 2023. If security measures were tightened, graphics and photos were cleaned up to feel more relevant, and decision-makers behind the scenes were given a lesson in inclusivity and pronouns/identities, AdultFriendFinder could be a handy tool to find attachment-free hookups and connect with a community that's down for anything.</p><p>This isn't a dating or hookup site we would personally use, but if you're feeling brave, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aeBO5?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=you%20can%20register%20for%20AdultFriendFinder%20here&object_type=review&object_uuid=0584LOJucOI7y32ZFmDy9gV&short_url=aeBO5&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">you can register for AdultFriendFinder here</a>.

Previous editions of the Razr caught my attention when they were first announced, but lackluster reviews had me hesitating. Yes, I used (and loved) my Razr V3 back in high school, but a foldable phone in 2024? It seemed more like a gimmick than genuinely useful, but the updated Razr+ had me intrigued, so I decided to try it out for myself.&nbsp;</p><h2>Using a foldable phone for the first time is weird</h2><p>Straight out of the box, the 2023 Motorola Razr+ was a bit bigger than I expected. It&rsquo;s more elongated than other smartphones I&rsquo;ve seen &mdash; it&rsquo;s over an inch longer than my iPhone 11 Pro, despite being nearly identical in width &mdash; which makes it feel slightly awkward in the hand. It&rsquo;s also longer than other foldable phones I&rsquo;ve seen on the market, like the 5.67-inch <a href="https://mashable.com/review/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5</a>, despite having similar widths and identical thicknesses.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Folded, however, the Razr+ is a portable dream. It&rsquo;s a slim 0.59 inches closed, making it easy to slip into any pocket, and I was shocked by how much I liked the form factor from the get-go. Is it weird the first time you fold it? Absolutely. But is it sturdy and durable? Surprisingly, yes.&nbsp;</p><p>The external display is also an immediate win, especially given its upgraded size. The 2023 Razr+ boasts a 3.6-inch pOLED display along with a 6.9-inch FHD+ flexible AMOLED main display, both of which are colorful, bright, and responsive. The device itself runs on Android 13, and &mdash; with 256GB of internal storage and 8GB of RAM &mdash; the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 processor makes this phone fast <em>and</em> fun.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Motorola Razr+ helped me cut down my screen time</h2><p>When I first heard about foldable phones, I had a sneaking suspicion that I would like them. Using the <a href="https://zdcs.link/a0XNr5?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Motorola%20Razr%2B&object_type=review&object_uuid=00t4cDGXt4TIG3OlSx9Grqa&short_url=a0XNr5&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Motorola Razr+</a> proved me right&hellip;and then some. Not only is it incredibly portable and convenient, but the external display changed how I interacted with my phone on a regular basis. While you can customize the apps on the external display, I chose to limit what I placed on that screen, and I basically turned it into a modified &ldquo;dumb phone.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>I could read text messages, make calls, view my calendar, listen to Spotify, and check the weather&hellip;but anything else required opening the phone itself. As a result, my phone usage plummeted. I wasn&rsquo;t scrolling on social media, watching YouTube videos, or playing games as much as I used to, which made the Razr+ a much-appreciated companion to my work-from-home life.&nbsp;</p><h2>The external display has clutch benefits</h2><p>Even for those who aren&rsquo;t trying to cut down on their screen time, the upgraded external display is wicked cool for a few other reasons. Not only is it almost a full inch bigger than the 2022 Razr, but that extra space actually makes sense. You can watch videos, play games, make payments, check email, and more &mdash; and it&rsquo;s easy to customize the external display to your own preferences.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Beyond that, one of my favorite features was the ability to use the external display as an image preview for the back camera. Not only did it make taking selfies a breeze, but &mdash; as someone whose partner isn&rsquo;t the best at taking flattering photos &mdash; I loved being able to pass him the phone, view the photo before he captured it, and adjust accordingly. Add in the ability to bend the phone at a 90-degree angle and place it on any surface without needing a stand or tripod? I can absolutely understand how a foldable phone is worth the hype, especially for content creators on the go.&nbsp;</p><h2>The camera left something to be desired</h2><p>While I loved how the external display changed the game when it came to taking photos or recording video, I found myself disappointed with one major area: the camera quality itself.</p><p>First things first, I&rsquo;m definitely not an expert in this area. I have a background in portrait photography, so I know how to capture a great photo, but camera specs definitely aren&rsquo;t my forte. However, I did some research and found that other users were similarly frustrated with the Razr+. It&rsquo;s not that the camera quality is bad, but it&rsquo;s just&hellip;OK.</p><p>The Motorola Razr+ (2023) comes with two rear cameras &mdash; a 12MP (f/1.5, 1.4&micro;m) primary camera with optical image stabilization, as well as a 13MP ultra-wide (f.2/2, 1.12&micro;m) &mdash; and a 32MP (f/2.4, 0.7 &micro;m) front camera. There&rsquo;s also an overwhelmingly large amount of camera software built in &mdash; including dual capture, live filters, auto night vision, pro mode, Google Lens integration, and more &mdash; but while some of it was fun to play with, none of it really wowed me.&nbsp;</p><p>Are the photos better than my old iPhone 11 Pro? Absolutely. But are they anywhere near as good as other smartphones on the market? Not in my opinion.&nbsp;</p><p>The video quality, in particular, was my biggest gripe. Even in good lighting, none of the cameras did a great job of capturing detail on my face, so my features were ever-so-slightly blurred. I tried switching to 4K &mdash; and snapped a quick selfie in the same lighting, which looked fantastic &mdash; but nothing seemed to work. Did it have great color balance? Yes. Was the sound quality better? Absolutely. However, I still found myself reaching for my iPhone to record video, especially if I was posting on TikTok.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>I&rsquo;m not sure the Razr+ can replace my iPhone</h2><p>Unfortunately, those weren&rsquo;t my only issues with the Razr+. The phone runs a little hot, the built-in speakers aren&rsquo;t great, and the 3800 mAh battery doesn&rsquo;t quite last as long as I&rsquo;d hoped with heavy use. That being said, I did find myself using this phone less than normal &mdash; which was a huge plus in my book &mdash; so I was able to make the battery life stretch simply because I wasn&rsquo;t on my phone as often.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2>Is the Motorola Razr+ worth it?</h2><p>For casual users &mdash; or diehard fans of foldable phones &mdash; it&rsquo;s definitely worth considering. Retailing at $999 (and frequently on sale), it&rsquo;s definitely a better phone than any of its predecessors, enough so that it feels like a worthy opponent to the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip5. The upgraded external display is fantastic, the phone itself is reliable and easy to use, and it comes in super fun colors, like the iconic viva magenta.&nbsp;</p><p>If you&rsquo;re on the fence, or if you&rsquo;re looking for a fantastic camera, then you might want to look elsewhere. It&rsquo;s not that the <a href="https://zdcs.link/a0XNr5?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=2023%20Motorola%20Razr%2B&object_type=review&object_uuid=00t4cDGXt4TIG3OlSx9Grqa&short_url=a0XNr5&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">2023 Motorola Razr+</a> is <em>bad</em>, it&rsquo;s just&hellip;not great, either. It&rsquo;s a solid phone with some solid specs, but it&rsquo;s solid &mdash; not spectacular. If solid is OK with you? Go for it. If you&rsquo;re looking for spectacular, this probably isn&rsquo;t it.&nbsp;</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

      <description><![CDATA["Flow" is an animated animal adventure unlike anything you've seen before. TIFF review.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/06cOHznU6rjV1xnoIEHlhMs/hero-image.jpg" alt="A scene from "Flow.""><p>There's a deceptive simplicity to <em>Flow. </em>The premise of this animated film seems familiar: A motley band of animals join together to survive a terrible threat. But part of what makes co-writer/director Gints Zilbalodis' outing so sensational is its gentle rejection of American cartoon cliches.&nbsp;</p><p>While the premise of this movie might sound like <em>Madagascar, Ice Age,</em> <em>A Bug's Life, </em>or <em>Zootopia </em>or any number of cutesy, kid-focused animated adventures, <em>Flow </em>refuses to turn its animals into wacky characters, perfectly suited for lunch boxes and plush toys. Zilbalodis' hairy heroes don't have big googly eyes or sport spiffy clothes. They aren't voiced by A-lister actors. They don't speak a human language at all. This gaggle of critters mew or moan or cluck or chitter. And they move not with an anthropomorphic flare, but with a realistic anatomy and act as their real-life cohorts might.&nbsp;</p><p>While Zilbalodis strives for authenticity in the physicality of his creatures, he rejects the photorealism of &mdash;&nbsp;for instance &mdash; <a href="https://mashable.com/video/mufasa-the-lion-king-trailer" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Disney's "live-action" remake of </a><a href="https://mashable.com/video/mufasa-the-lion-king-trailer" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>The Lion King</em></a><em>. </em>Instead, he creates <em>Flow </em>with a digital painting style that leans into the abstract. Every hair or feather or scale will not be dedicatedly rendered to awe the audience with the endeavor. His animals are made up of splotches of color that shift in light and shadow, effectively grounding them in an uncertain world that is wondrous, dangerous, and all theirs.&nbsp;</p><p>A breathtakingly beautiful to behold film, <em>Flow</em> tells a story that might well enchant children with its cuddly heroes, but it will rattle grown-ups who can understand the cause for their deadly dilemma.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Flow </em>is a wordless tale of climate crisis.&nbsp;</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

<p>This gorgeous film, which has been selected as Latvia's submission for the Best International Feature Oscar<em>,<strong> </strong></em>begins following a little black cat as it putters around a forest looking for food. Little clues suggest this has not always been an outdoor cat, like the cozy cabin surrounded by lovingly carved wooden statues of the feline's likeness. But like the discarded tools and empty bed, the cat has been abandoned by whatever human once lived here. And in this regard, he's not alone.&nbsp;</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>A pack of dogs made up of a mix of breeds frolic around the forest, learning how to clumsily catch fish in a nearby stream. It's as if a dog park party went stray. But as <em>Flow </em>progresses and its animals come upon more and more handcrafted trinkets and architecture in ruins, it becomes clear this beguiling film is set in post-human times. Another major hint to this setting is the massive wall of water that forces the animals of the forest to flee to higher ground, and eventually onto deserted boats.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Flow </em>is a parable of reluctant teamwork.&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The little cat scrambles onto a battered sailboat, where it is riled to discover a resting <a href="https://mashable.com/video/capybaras-explained" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">capybara</a>. Reluctantly, the cat realizes this big but gentle rodent is no threat, and a motley crew of sailors begins to come together. A yammering lemur, whose tendency toward gathering baubles can be a risky compulsion, joins up. A majestic crane takes hold of the rudder. A tongue-wagging Golden Retriever hops aboard, eager to make new friends.&nbsp;</p><p>There's an elegant pleasure in watching these unlikely animal friends grow close, and it's impossible to overlook Zilbalodis' dedication in keeping true to their natures. He doesn't cheat these moments of growth; there's pleasantly predictable bickering as the animals collide with each other's quirks. For instance, the lemur lovingly lays out his loot on the boat's seat, which attracts the cat, who naturally&nbsp;swats a treasure to the ground, much to the lemur's annoyance. But as moments of crisis &mdash; be it a predator on the horizon or an obstacle in their path &mdash;&nbsp;arise, these animals snap to attention and slowly but surely learn to trust each other.&nbsp;</p><p>Visually, it's richly rewarding, as Zilbalodis paints a pretty world destroyed and yet alive with hope and hard-won harmony. It's heart-warming, as we witness these creatures (who are in some cases natural enemies)&nbsp;band together not just for a common goal, but ultimately a common bond. And because Zilbalodis rejects so many expectations of animated animals &mdash; from their appearance to their movements and their noises &mdash;&nbsp;<em>Flow </em>has an exciting spontaneity, as if truly anything could happen. And what ultimately does is epic and emotional.&nbsp;</p><p>Refusing to pander to its audience, <em>Flow </em>is an animated adventure that is poignant, unique, absolutely gorgeous, and a must-see. While it should safely snag that Best International Feature spot, the American studios should be more worried about its chances in Best Animated Feature.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Flow </em>was reviewed out of the 2024 Toronto International Film Festival. <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7bYKP?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=The%20movie%20will%20open%20in%20theaters%20in%20the%20U.S.%20on%20Nov.%2022.&object_type=article&object_uuid=06cOHznU6rjV1xnoIEHlhMs&short_url=z7bYKP&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">The movie will open in theaters in the U.S. on Nov. 22.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

Her ex Alex (Jocko Sims) chooses that very day to send out his wedding invites. And on top of all of that, Mel straight-up <em>dies</em>. Just for three minutes, but it's enough to make an impression.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Mel's death and its circumstances &mdash; alone, crushed under furniture, and choking on a crab rangoon &mdash; prompt some serious soul-searching. As Mel sees it, her love life is nonexistent, her family doesn't believe in her, and in some kind of cruel cosmic joke, she's an airport employee who's too scared to fly. Is this really the life she wants to flash before her eyes when she dies for real? No, no, it's not.</p><p>Created by Rothwell, <em>How to Die Alone </em>takes Mel down a winding road of self-discovery, one full of hard truths, awkward romantic encounters, and <em>just </em>enough hope to keep her pushing for the life she deserves. The ensuing journey is hilarious, yes, but also a deeply candid portrait of a woman in the never-ending process of figuring it all out.</p><h2>What's <em>How to Die Alone </em>about?</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Following her near-death experience, Mel decides to embrace her inner "boss-ass bitch." At her job as a cart driver at New York's JFK airport, that means trying to get into a management program &mdash; and quelling any feelings she may still have for Alex, who is also her boss.

<p><em>How to Die Alone</em>'s airport setting creates several opportunities for elaborate hijinks in the vein of workplace comedies like <a href="https://mashable.com/category/the-office" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>The Office</em></a><em> </em>or <a href="https://mashable.com/article/superstore-robots" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Superstore</em></a>. A hunt for confiscated painkillers leads Mel and Rory deep into the bowels of JFK. Elsewhere, a terminal-wide lockdown forces Mel and Alex's fianc&eacute;e Julie (Chantel Riley) on an awkward side quest. However, as fun as these moments may be, <em>How to Die Alone</em>'s workplace comedy side isn't the show's primary focus. It can occasionally chafe against the show's more grounded core of Mel's personal growth instead of complementing it. Thankfully, <em>How to Die Alone </em>figures out a balance between the two as its first season picks up steam, giving Rothwell space to deliver not just some great physical comedy but some seriously vulnerable work as well.</p><h2>Natasha Rothwell is delightful and vulnerable in <em>How to Die Alone</em>.</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Rothwell has always shined in supporting roles, from <a href="https://mashable.com/article/insecure-prentice-penny" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Insecure</em></a><em> </em>to <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-white-lotus-season-3-cast" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>The White Lotus</em></a>. But in <em>How to Die Alone</em>, she gets to take center stage <em>and </em>creative control, helming the series alongside co-showrunner Vera Santamaria (<a href="https://mashable.com/article/pen15-season-2-part-2-review-immigrant-moms" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Pen15</em></a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/bojack-horseman-season-6-finale-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>BoJack Horseman</em></a>). The result is a performance that isn't afraid to get messy or vulnerable, whether Mel is bemoaning her dating life &mdash; "Because of societal standards, I'm like human cilantro," she tells her friends &mdash; or self-sabotaging in order to avoid being hurt down the line.</p><p>While Rothwell shines consistently throughout <em>How to Die Alone</em>, there are still some standout moments where she and her co-stars go above and beyond. Mel and Rory's painful unpacking of their friendship in one episode is an absolutely devastating blowout. A tense Thanksgiving conversation between Mel and her brother Brian (Bashir Salahuddin) cuts deep and provides a much-needed opportunity for both characters to vent their frustrations. These are the kind of scenes that can only happen thanks to layered, complicated relationships between characters, and luckily, Rothwell and Santamaria keep Mel wrapped in an intricate web of connections that accrues more and more meaning as the show<em> </em>progresses.</p><p>Among these connections is a love triangle that slowly creeps to the forefront in <em>How to Die Alone</em>'s final episodes. Our candidates are Alex, who still supports Mel even though she rejected him two years ago, and JFK ground crew member Terrance (KeiLyn Durrel Jones), Mel's go-to conversational partner on her smoke breaks. In my mind, there's a clear answer on who Mel should go with, but trust <em>How to Die Alone </em>to keep you guessing. Even when it's playing up some classic rom-com tropes, the series may just turn around and hit you (and Mel) with a heartbreaking gut punch.</p><p>As juicy as Mel's romantic endeavors can be, it's her quest for personal happiness &mdash; whether that involves a man or not &mdash; that proves the most rewarding. She learns some fairly valuable life lessons throughout <em>How to Die Alone</em>, sprinkled amid quality one-liners and her many, <em>many </em>poor decisions, and it's a treat to watch her find her footing alongside the series. Mel may not be ready to get on a plane yet, but Rothwell and <em>How to Die Alone </em>are ready to soar.</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/ZR2pn?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3Btemplate=article&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=How%20to%20Die%20Alone%20premieres%20Sept.%2013%20on%20Hulu.&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=02VQ2239YaLKhBpfVzj6OVP&amp%3Bshort_url=ZR2pn&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Ffall-tv-preview-2024&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=How%20to%20Die%20Alone%20premieres%20Sept.%2013%20on%20Hulu%2C%20with%20new%20episodes%20every%20Friday.&object_type=article&object_uuid=01V2HZBniVrwv53ZxqkbNcC&short_url=ZR2pn&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>How to Die Alone</u></em><u> premieres Sept. 13 on Hulu, with new episodes every Friday.</u></a></p>]]></content:encoded>

There are simply too many different services. Networks like NBC and CBS have their own streaming apps, but ABC doesn't. So what can cord cutters do?</p><p>Live TV streaming services are cable alternatives, giving you live access to a well-rounded channel selection via your internet connection (rather than a cable connection). Unlike cable, these services are contract-free, so you can cancel whenever you wish. And as a bonus, many of them offer free trials &mdash; that means you could very well watch the Emmys live for free, then cancel before you're charged. But we'll leave that up to you. </p><p>You can also use a digital TV antenna, a one-time purchase that will unlock all the local networks &mdash;&nbsp;ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC &mdash;&nbsp;within range.</p><p>Below, we've rounded up your best options (and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-streaming-deals" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">streaming deals</a>) for watching the <a href="https://mashable.com/category/emmys" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Emmys</a> without cable.</p><h3>Best way to watch the Emmys for free: <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVDrLO?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=YouTube%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=07MWtZrgnOk7azE8HBRZWS0&short_url=QVDrLO&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">YouTube TV</a></h3><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

However, it's a bit pricier at $76.99 per month. But we still recommend it for two reasons. First, you get three days for free to test the waters, and second, your subscription comes bundled with Hulu with ads, Disney+ with ads, and ESPN+ with ads (a $14.99 per month value). That's three premium streaming libraries on top of nearly 100 live channels&nbsp;all for just $76.99 per month. </p><p>Stream the Emmys for free during your three-day trial, then decide whether you want to stick it out for a whole month or cancel before you're charged.</p><h3>Most affordable overall: <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qx7p3j?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Sling%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=07MWtZrgnOk7azE8HBRZWS0&short_url=Qx7p3j&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Sling TV</a> (only for select areas)</h3><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>While we love Sling TV for its <em>a la carte</em> setup and affordable pricing, we're hesitant to call it our favorite since some markets cannot access local networks. In order to watch the Emmys live, you'll need access to ABC, which is included in <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qx7p3j?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Sling%27s%20Blue%20base%20package&object_type=article&object_uuid=07MWtZrgnOk7azE8HBRZWS0&short_url=Qx7p3j&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Sling's Blue base package</a>. However, live local streaming of ABC (as well as NBC and FOX) is only available to Sling customers in or around specific cities. </p><p>Check to see if your <a href="https://www.sling.com/help/en/subscription-programming-questions/channels-programming/local-channels#stream" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">local market</a> includes ABC before you pull the trigger &mdash; Chicago, Fresno, Houston, Los Angeles, and more are included. Typically, Sling's base package costs $40 per month, but with the current introductory offer, you'll pay just $20 for your first month.</p><h3>Best for streaming later: <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGVo1W?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Hulu%20with%20ads&object_type=article&object_uuid=07MWtZrgnOk7azE8HBRZWS0&short_url=QGVo1W&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Hulu with ads</a></h3><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>If you're able to avoid spoilers and don't mind waiting a day to watch the ceremony, a regular Hulu with ads subscription will give you access to the Emmys on Sept. 16, the day after the live show. It's definitely the cheapest option: you can sign up for free for 30 days, then it'll cost you just $7.99 per month. You won't get the excitement of watching live, but if you don't mind that, this is a solid bet.</p><h3>Honorable mention: <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7bYXD?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=FuboTV&object_type=article&object_uuid=07MWtZrgnOk7azE8HBRZWS0&short_url=z7bYXD&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">FuboTV</a></h3><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>Another live TV streaming service option is Fubo. Though it's more geared toward sports fans, with over 200 live channels, it does include access to your local ABC network. You can test it out for seven days, then get $30 off your first month, knocking it down to just $49.99. After that, you'll have to pay $79.99 per month for the Pro plan, making it one of the more expensive options on the list.</p><h3>Another option for watching live: Get a digital antenna</h3><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>As, unfortunately, not everyone's hometown has a gayborhood, Grindr hopes to bring a "<a href="https://zdcs.link/zjGMx2?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=global%20gayborhood&object_type=article&object_uuid=03H5z5ygOpvtxfmHM7uksvg&short_url=zjGMx2&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">global gayborhood</a>" &mdash; a digital space within the app that connects and provides resources for the worldwide LGBTQ community &mdash; to life. In tandem with the show, the app is developing an interactive map to help users find LGBTQ-friendly hotspots and events.  (This feature isn't fully rolled out yet, but you might see it before the year's end.) Additionally, the company is testing a new <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3bk42?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=%22Roam%22%20feature&object_type=article&object_uuid=03H5z5ygOpvtxfmHM7uksvg&short_url=z3bk42&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">"Roam" feature</a>, which will let users temporarily set their profile location to anywhere in the world so they can chat and connect with locals ahead of their trip.

However, at a recent presentation at Grindr HQ (which I attended in person), company leaders revealed that approximately 3.5 million people already use the app to make traveling in new cities easier &mdash; from finding LGBTQ-friendly accommodations to connecting with locals for recommendations and events.</p><p>We're excited to see what other travel-focused features Grindr has planned, and will keep you updated as more details are shared in the coming months. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Time-travel movies mostly fall into three categories, all of them fixated on change for better or worse. There's the <em>Groundhog Day</em> time-loop, where a hero repeats a cycle over and over until they get this one pivotal day right. There's the <em>Back to the Future </em>model, where a fun-seeking dip in the past could irreparably change your future, even erasing you from existence. (See also: much of <a href="https://mashable.com/category/doctor-who" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Doctor Who</em></a><em>.</em>) Then there are the many, many movies &mdash; be they <em>Terminator</em> or <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-greatest-hits-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>The Greatest Hits</em></a> &mdash;&nbsp;that take the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/quantum-leap-reboot-comparison" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Quantum Leap</em></a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/quantum-leap-reboot-comparison" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"> </a>approach: traveling back in time to set right what once went wrong! <em>My Old Ass </em>isn't really any of these. And that's wildly refreshing.&nbsp;</p><p>This very different spin on time travel begins with the casting of Aubrey Plaza, who between <em>Parks and Recreation, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, </em>and her <a href="https://mashable.com/video/aubrey-plaza-drew-barrymore-be-my-mommy" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">chic yet surly interview persona</a>, encapsulates a distinctive brand of elder millennial over-it. So the moment she shows up next to a bubbly, blonde Maisy Stella &mdash; 18-year-old Elliott, a small-town girl on the brink of booking it to the big city &mdash; you know this isn't going to be your standard "save the future" adventure. Not that Plaza's elder Elliott doesn't try.&nbsp;</p><p>While younger Elliott is out in the woods, celebrating her birthday with <a href="https://mashable.com/feature/paul-stamets-magic-mushrooms-psilocybin" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">a shroom trip</a> among friends, 39-year-old Elliott party crashes with some advice that is as admittedly cliched as it is true: Be nicer to your mom. Beyond this, "My Old Ass" (as she labels herself in teen Elliott's cellphone contacts) refuses to speak much about the future, fearing this unplanned meeting could have massive consequences. She occasionally alludes to some major disasters to come, but her only warning is comically simple: Avoid Chad at all costs!&nbsp;</p><p>Naturally, what follows is younger Elliott skinny-dipping into a meet-cute with a sweet boy named Chad (<a href="https://mashable.com/article/wednesday-season-2-questions" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Wednesday</em></a>'s Percy Hynes White), with whom she shares an undeniable chemistry no matter how much she tries to ignore it. </p><h2>Maisy Stella outshines Aubrey Plaza in <em>My Old Ass.&nbsp;</em></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Where Plaza is here to be the cynical sage, Stella is radiant as the free-spirited goofball. Whether she's partying with friends, hooking up with her hot girlfriend, or grousing at her family, Elliott's charm is intoxicating &mdash; not because she's exceptional, but because she's not. Rather than setting her protagonist up as some noble savior of the future, Park allows Elliott to be a pretty average small-town girl desperate to move out and on to a life of her own. As such, Elliott is exuberant, horny, and reckless, colliding into awkward situations and unexpected vulnerabilities as if she's driving a bumper car full speed down the winding road of this formative summer. Park captures the joy of carefree youth without romanticizing it, and she offers the same determined empathy for Elliott's older half.&nbsp;</p><p>With Plaza's beleaguered eye rolls, Park swiftly dispels these fantasies that as we get older, we'll have it all figured out. Instead, <em>My Old Ass </em>challenges juvenile notions that with age comes a coveted completeness, the sense that we're not just settled but have life all figured out. The movie suggest such a hope is as absurd as our youthful ambitions to be a marine biologist <em>and </em>a professional dancer <em>and </em>President of the United States. So this story becomes less about a mission to change the past to impact the present, and more about coming to terms with our choices and who we were and are.&nbsp;</p><p>While thematically, Park's script is moving and spirited &mdash;&nbsp;just as <em>The Fallout </em>before it was &mdash;&nbsp;Plaza struggles to nail this balance. While she's shown range in series like <em>Legion </em>and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-white-lotus-season-2-cameron-hbo" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>White Lotus</em></a>, here she wobbles when playing anything but irritated. In scenes of bonding between the two, there's an buzzing edge to Plaza's tone even as she smiles at her character's younger self. When the third act calls for softness, Plaza's vulnerability feels performed instead of organic. Here's where <em>My Old Ass </em>undercuts its sharp self-awareness and sincerity and slips into saccharine.&nbsp;</p><p><em>My Old Ass </em>rebuffs time-travel standards, like looking into the future to see how Elliott's life changes. It treats the mission, and even the sci-fi premise, as little more than a launchpad for its heroine's summer of reflection. If anything, the movie is more a teen coming-of-age comedy about that leap from high school to whatever comes next than a Quantum Leap at all. </p><p>Yet where those two subgenres collide is in a shared sentimentality over the past, and that veers into schmaltzy, for better or worse. Still, aside from this trip into treacle, <em>My Old Ass </em>is a spirited comedy about growing up and moving on that's a true joy &mdash;&nbsp;just as Stella is a star on the rise to watch.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/BdWRN?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=My%20Old%20Ass%20opens%20in%20theaters%20Sept.%2013.&object_type=article&object_uuid=07HJfqyMSIZA4j4A74TbsCv&short_url=BdWRN&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>My Old Ass </em>opens in theaters Sept. 13. </a></p>]]></content:encoded>

But the film itself embraces the blurring of fact and feeling to deliver a propulsive and political romp that rejects the austere approach of so many indulgent Oscar-chasing biopics. And thank God and all the saints for that!&nbsp;</p><p>Too often, larger-than-life rock stars or pop divas or legendary musicians are reduced by a color-by-numbers approach that fails to capture exactly why they were so enthralling to begin with. (For recent examples, see <a href="https://mashable.com/article/elvis-movie-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Elvis</em></a><em>,</em> <a href="https://mashable.com/article/back-to-black-amy-winehouse-movie-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Back to Black</em></a><em>, and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/bob-marley-one-love-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">One Love</a></em> &mdash;&nbsp;or don't.) However, <em>Kneecap</em> embraces the raw and reckless energy of Naoise &Oacute; Caireall&aacute;in, Liam &Oacute;g &Oacute; Hannaidh, and JJ &Oacute; Dochartaigh, who perform under the stage names M&oacute;gla&iacute; Bap, Mo Chara, and DJ Pr&oacute;va&iacute;. So, early on, a sprawling club scene with flashing lights and hard drug-taking spills into a dark, forbidding forest &mdash;&nbsp;not nearby, but connected &mdash;&nbsp;as the police (or "peelers," as the boys call them) chase them down.&nbsp;</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>By collapsing the set of a nightclub into a forest that seems plucked out of nightmarish fantasy, director/writer Richard Peppiatt swiftly establishes that <em>Kneecap </em>won't play by the rules. Hand-drawn graphics burst onto the screen, emphasizing motions and odd analogies. Claymation will be employed to illustrate the mind-bending effects of an ill-timed ketamine trip. And alongside the band, who play themselves in the film, two-time Academy Award nominee Michael Fassbender strides onscreen to bring a bit of surreal grit.&nbsp;</p><p>Combined with a soundtrack flushed with Kneecap's high-octane hip-hop, the result is a rush to the head that's hard to shake. But why would you want to?</p><h2><em>Kneecap</em> is a fuck-you to boring biopics and tedious vanity projects.&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The premise of <em>Kneecap </em>might sound a bit dry if you're new to the group's music. A few years back, a debate brewed over the proposed Irish Language Act, which would formally recognize the native tongue alongside English. While advocates and academics rallied for the dying language, an unlikely resurgence came to it through fast-growing interest in a band from Belfast, who rap in Irish about drugs, sex, and rebelling against British authority &mdash;&nbsp;including the police.&nbsp;</p><p>Smartly, <em>Kneecap </em>interweaves this larger political story into the playful personal stories of its three members. Liam &Oacute;g serves as the cheeky narrator, providing voiceover to all parts, including his Romeo-and-Juliet romance with a British party girl (Jessica Reynolds), who likes a kinky night in. However, the story begins with Naoise's baptism, which was raided by a police force suspicious of his father, a Catholic radical Republican named Arl&oacute; (Fassbender), who had a habit of planting bombs in the name of rebellion. Raised under the shadow of his dad's politics, Naoise is stuck between a rock and a hard place, pressured by Arl&oacute;'s admirers to follow in his dad's footsteps and the snarl of a police force that expects him to.&nbsp;As the Irish language was previously banned by the imperialist English authorities, Naoise's embrace of it does follow in his father's edict that "Every word of Irish spoken is a bullet fired for Irish freedom" &mdash;&nbsp;though perhaps not as Arl&oacute; intended.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>While these "Ceasefire babies" are painted as altar boys corrupted by the bad streets of West Belfast &mdash;&nbsp;and not troubled about that or The Troubles &mdash;&nbsp;JJ is introduced as a middle-aged music teacher on the brink of dying of boredom. A chance encounter over a police interrogation table changes everything, when JJ becomes inspired by Liam's in-your-face lyrics and proudly Fenian posturing. Just like that, a band is born. But their rise will be rife with violence, huge mistakes, and lots of drugged-up shenanigans.

<p><em>Kneecap </em>throws up a brazen middle finger to another "North of Ireland" set biopic, Kenneth Branagh's <em>Belfast</em>. Where the world-renowned actor/director made a prestige pic out of his childhood, Mo Chara, M&oacute;gla&iacute; Bap, and DJ Pr&oacute;va&iacute; reject the opportunity to gloss up their images. Instead, they gamely present themselves as fun-loving fuckups, never shying away the havoc that lies in the wake of their road to stardom.&nbsp;</p><p>They welcome us to witness them stumbling on stage, too high to function after a dime bag mix-up. They invite us to laugh at sexual proclivities that thrust into political orgasms. They show their asses, literally and metaphorically, which proves crudely inspiring. These three didn't set out to change their nation. They set out to sing (or rap) a song for themselves, and in doing so, connected to an undercurrent of cultural pride and resilience that connected them to others.&nbsp;</p><p>But what first unites us to them is their rough-hewn charisma. Playing themselves on-screen could have spelled disaster, as plenty of musicians have fumbled at acting. But they excel, managing to play scenes of clownish absurdity and more tender moments with stirring screen presence. DJ Pr&oacute;va&iacute; proves the strongest &mdash; to the point where I wondered if his signature onstage attire of an Irish flag balaclava allowed them to cast an established actor for the role. But the whole crew thrives on-screen as they do onstage, exploding in a frenzy of humor, music, and attitude that is wicked fun.&nbsp;</p><p>In the end, Peppiatt has done a superb job of not only shaking off the oh-so-serious shackles that are musician biopic conventions, but also enthusiastically embracing the hip-hop energy of his subjects, allowing them to be both the stars and fuel of their story, propelling them to a climax that deserves its rowdy encore across the credits.&nbsp;</p><p>Simply put, <em>Kneecap </em>is sensational, silly, sharp, and ultimately sublime.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/weopy?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Kneecap%20opened%20in%20theaters%20Aug.%202.&object_type=article&object_uuid=03lFiSiwEbSF79OoV5mtLj2&short_url=weopy&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Kneecap </em>opened in theaters Aug. 2.</a>&nbsp;It is <a href="https://zdcs.link/ao5LEL?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=returning%20to%20select%20theaters%20Sept.%2013&object_type=article&object_uuid=03lFiSiwEbSF79OoV5mtLj2&short_url=ao5LEL&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">returning to select theaters Sept. 13</a>, and was just announced as Ireland's Oscar submission.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>What is Connections?</h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <a class="text-gray-600" href="https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1679674590203723778?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(opens in a new window)">

    </a>
</blockquote>
<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. Like <em>Wordle, </em>you can share the results with your friends on social media.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

Words can be made from linked letters &mdash; up, down, left, right, or diagonal, but words can also change direction, resulting in quirky shapes and patterns. Every single letter in the grid will be part of an answer. There's always a theme linking every solution, along with the "spangram," a special, word or phrase that sums up that day's theme, and spans the entire grid horizontally or vertically.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>The verdict? The Anker 535 PowerHouse did effectively charge and power up multiple of my devices simultaneously. At $500, I can say that it is worth the investment for somebody who needs to be prepared for inclement weather (like myself living in Florida) or spends lots of time in remote areas and may not have access to outlets such as campers or those on a road trip. However, for a person looking to charge their phone or power devices regularly, it is a bit pricey and heavy for day-to-day use.&nbsp;(Though we have seen the power station's price dip below $350.)</p><h2>The Anker PowerHouse is easy to use even for beginners</h2><p>When I opened the box, I immediately saw the user manual which was filled with helpful diagrams showing how to recharge the power device and the various ports (four AC, one USB-C, and three USB-A ports). I was able to easily unwrap the car port charger and power adapter and plug it in for charging.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>I also liked that it came with a light. Although I did not need to use it, I still tried turning it on and off which could be easily done with the push of a button.&nbsp;</p><p>However, it is important to note that any Lightning or other cables that may be required to charge a laptop, phone, etc. are not included with the Anker 535 PowerHouse. Although I wish they were included (considering the $500 price tag), I luckily had them at my apartment, so I could get right to testing without having to order any additional cables.&nbsp;</p><h2>How long does the Anker 535 PowerHouse battery take to charge?</h2><p>Since it was my first time using the device, the instruction manual advised that I fully charge it first. The box advertised that the device could be fully recharged using the in-box adapter in four-and-a-half hours and I wanted to see if I would experience that quick charge time. When I initially plugged in the power adapter charger to the outlet in my apartment, the device was already at 27 percent (I had assumed it would be at zero percent considering the instructions read to fully charge it before use). It took three-and-a-half hours to reach 100 percent (from 27 percent) which I thought was in line with the box&rsquo;s claim and extremely quick considering the battery&rsquo;s capacity of 512Wh.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2>The Anker 535 PowerHouse can charge and power up multiple devices fairly quickly</h2><p>To test the portable generator&rsquo;s charging capabilities, I charged my MacBook Air, iPhone, Bluetooth headphones, and Nintendo Switch simultaneously.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>It took two hours and 20 minutes for my phone to charge from zero percent to 100 percent.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>It took two hours and 10 minutes for my laptop to charge from zero percent to 100 percent.</p></li><li><p>It took two hours and 50 minutes for the Nintendo Switch to charge.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>Considering all of the devices were charging at the same time, I thought that under three hours to fully charge all three devices was fast.&nbsp;</p><p>I found it helpful that the LCD display showed how many Watts of power were being used as the devices were being charged as well as the remaining battery hours. This makes it easier for one to prepare.&nbsp;</p><p>I tested the AC port by plugging in the lamp by my desk and it turned on easily with no issues.&nbsp;</p><p>Even with all of the charging that was being done, the battery only lowered to 74 percent, which was impressive considering it was charging four devices for three and a half hours.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Anker 535 PowerHouse was unable to accept three-prong AC power cords</h2><p>I wanted to fully power my <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/home-office-starter-kit" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">home office</a> using the Anker 535 PowerHouse, but unfortunately, I was unable to plug in my monitor as it was equipped with a three-prong AC power cord. The machine is only able to accept two-prong AC power cords. This was slightly disappointing and is something to make a note of in case you want to use this power station to connect an appliance that is equipped with a three-pronged cord.&nbsp;</p><p>However, I was able to plug in some of the electronics in my office, including my lamp.</p><h2>Is the Anker 535 PowerHouse worth it?&nbsp;</h2><p>Do I think the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aB1m18?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Anker%20535%20PowerHouse&object_type=review&object_uuid=07CumuSBCbqAv6RyNxhJZhw&short_url=aB1m18&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Anker 535 PowerHouse</u></a> is worth the value? I think it depends on who you&rsquo;re asking or what one plans on using it for. As someone who lives in Florida, I think the Anker 535 PowerHouse is definitely worth the price, especially during hurricane season. Although it can efficiently charge and power multiple devices at once with its nine ports, the battery is fairly heavy and would be kind of a pain to transport.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're solely looking to use the Anker 535 PowerHouse for day-to-day use to charge your phones, laptops, etc., then it is not worth the price as there are other smaller, more portable, and cheaper chargers on the market. However, if you&rsquo;re looking to use it while camping to power multiple appliances including lamps, mini coolers, or the like, then I would say it is worth the $500 investment &mdash; or $330 investment if you can snag it on sale.&nbsp;</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

The game became a massive hit in early 2014 on both iOS and Android, and quickly brought its creator, Vietnam-based Dong Nguyen, fame and fortune. <em>Flappy Bird</em> at one point was reportedly bringing in tens of thousands of dollars in ad revenue per day.</p><p>By February 2014, however, Nguyen had completely removed the game from all mobile app stores. Others have attempted to clone the game over the years, but were never able to replicate the success of the original.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>It is called <em>Flappy Bird</em>. The original yellow bird character is back. Players still tap on the screen to flap their wings and move up and down to avoid hitting pipes.&nbsp;</p><p>However, there's much more to the new <a href="https://flappybird.org/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Flappy Bird</u></em></a> now too according to the game's new website.</p><p>There are additional playable characters as well as different levels. The trailer shows a world map which suggests there will be a storyline mode. There's also other gameplay modes which involve guiding your <em>Flappy Bird</em> character through basketball hoops. It appears there will be an online mode called Flappy Bird Rivals too where players can take on 99 other competitors.</p><p>The new <em>Flappy Bird</em> is set to release in October on the web and other platforms with dedicated iOS and Android apps coming in 2025.</p><h2><strong>The return of <em>Flappy Bird</em>? Sort of.</strong></h2><p><em>Flappy Bird</em>'s "return" is odd as its creator Dong Nguyen is not involved. In fact, Nguyen apparently has nothing to do with <em>Flappy Bird</em>'s comeback whatsoever, and reportedly didn't sell the rights to it.</p><p>Nguyen said he was unhappy with the attention <em>Flappy Bird</em> brought, and has previously said that he did not want <em>Flappy Bird</em> to exist at all.</p><p>"Flappy Bird was designed to play in a few minutes when you are relaxed," Nguyen told <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lananhnguyen/2014/02/11/exclusive-flappy-bird-creator-dong-nguyen-says-app-gone-forever-because-it-was-an-addictive-product/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Forbes</u></em></a> in an interview in February 2014 shortly after taking the game off of the app stores. "But it happened to become an addictive product. I think it has become a problem. To solve that problem, it's best to take down <em>Flappy Bird</em>. It's gone forever."</p><p>So, how is the Flappy Bird Foundation reviving the game?</p><p>In its post announcing "I AM BACK!!" the<em> Flappy Bird</em> account on X shared that "the decade-long mission" to revive the game "involved acquiring legal rights and even working with my predecessor to uncage me and re-hatch the official <em>Flappy Bird</em>&reg; game!"</p><p>But the Flappy Bird Foundation acquired the rights from Gametech Holdings LLC., not Nguyen. According to <a href="https://www.law360.com/ttab_cases/651c133ff1aa5d012d8ff9cc" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>court documents</u></a>, Gametech Holdings LLC acquired the <em>Flappy Bird</em> rights by filing to take over the abandoned trademark rights from Nguyen.

<p>Initially dubbed "Project Strawberry," the model was released to the public as "o1" on Thursday. As expected, o1 is able to "think" (process) before answering a prompt, which differs from previous large language models that use predictive text to form their responses. "We've developed a new series of AI models designed to spend more time thinking before they respond," said OpenAI in the <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">announcement</a>.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>In a demo shared on the OpenAI site, the video shows a user asking o1 in ChatGPT to "write a grammatictlly [sic] correct sentence without using any letters more than once." The model then uses its new reasoning skills to weigh options and evaluate the sentence. According to the demo, after 39 seconds, o1's cheeky response to the query is "go fix my bed." </p><p>Another video features Research Lead Jerry Tworek asking o1 to solve a logic puzzle about the ages of a prince and princess. The model is shown decoding the problem, by understanding the different variables and determining which equations are needed to solve the problem, and goes step by step answering the age equation. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-Jh2NdbPDVrQ&amp;ab_channel=OpenAI"></div>
</div>


<p>As demonstrated from the demos, o1 works best for solving complex math problems in the realm of science, physics, and coding. "o1 can be used by healthcare researchers to annotate cell sequencing data, by physicists to generate complicated mathematical formulas needed for quantum optics, and by developers in all fields to build and execute multi-step workflows," said the announcement. </p><p>That also means the o1 preview comes with certain limitations. It can't browse the web or take in uploaded files and images. For tasks like those, OpenAI says, GPT-4o is still the best model to use. </p><p>In a section about safety, OpenAI said the U.S. and UK Safety Institutes were granted early access to testing o1, per the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/openai-anthropic-agree-models-tested-before-making-them-public" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">previous mandates</a> from President Biden's AI <a href="https://mashable.com/article/white-house-drops-ai-regulation-bombshell" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">executive order</a>. </p><p>OpenAI's o1 model is available through the developer AI and ChatGPT Plus users in preview.

<p>Apple announced the Hearing Aid mode on Sept. 10, noting the company anticipated federal approval to come "soon," but the FDA moved quicker than expected. </p><p>"Today&rsquo;s marketing authorization of an over-the-counter hearing aid software on a widely used consumer audio product is another step that advances the availability, accessibility and acceptability of hearing support for adults with perceived mild to moderate hearing loss," wrote Michelle Tarver, FDA director of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health. </p><p>The FDA's approval also provided more information on the feature's clinical testing. Apple's HAF was evaluated in a study featuring "118 subjects with perceived mild to moderate hearing loss, at multiple U.S. sites," the FDA explained. "The results demonstrated that subjects who used the HAF self-fitting strategy achieved similar perceived benefit as subjects who received professional fitting of the same device. Results also showed comparable performance for tests measuring levels of amplification in the ear canal, as well as a measure of speech understanding in noise. No adverse events related to the device were observed in this study."</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

    </q>
<p>"Evidence isn't dead," Rand told Mashable. "Facts and evidence do matter to a substantial degree to a lot of people."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Rand, who is a professor of management science and brain and cognitive sciences at MIT, and his co-authors didn't test whether the study participants were more likely to change their minds after talking to a chatbot versus someone they know in real life, like a best friend or sibling. But they suspect the chatbot's success has to do with how quickly it can marshal accurate facts and evidence in response.&nbsp;</p><p>In a sample conversation included in the study, a participant who thinks that the Sept. 11 attacks were staged receives an exhaustive scientific explanation from the chatbot about how the Twin Towers collapsed without the aid of explosive detonations, among other popular related conspiracy claims. At the outset, the participant felt 100 percent confident in the conspiracy theory; by the end, their confidence dropped to 40 percent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For anyone who's ever tried to discuss a conspiracy theory with someone who believes it, they may have experienced rapid-fire exchanges filled with what Rand described as "weird esoteric facts and links" that are incredibly difficult to disprove. A generative AI chatbot, however, doesn't have that problem, because it can instantaneously respond with fact-based information.</p><p>Nor is an AI chatbot hampered by personal relationship dynamics, such as whether a long-running sibling rivalry or dysfunctional friendship shapes how a conspiracy theorist views the person offering counter information. In general, the chatbot was trained to be polite to participants, building a rapport with them by validating their curiosity or confusion.&nbsp;</p><p>The researchers also asked participants about their trust in artificial intelligence. They found that the more a participant trusted AI, the more likely they were to suspend their conspiracy theory belief in response to the conversation. But even those skeptical of AI were capable of changing their minds.&nbsp;</p><p>Importantly, the researchers hired a professional fact-checker to evaluate the claims made by the chatbot, to ensure it wasn't sharing false information, or making things up. The fact-checker rated nearly all of them as true and none of them as false.&nbsp;</p><p>For now, people who are curious about the researchers' work can try it out for themselves by using their <a href="https://www.debunkbot.com/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>DebunkBot</u></a>, which allows users to test their beliefs against an AI.&nbsp;</p><p>Rand and his co-authors imagine a future in which a chatbot might be connected to social media accounts as a way to counter conspiracy theories circulating on a platform. Or people might find a chatbot when they search online for information about viral rumors or hoaxes thanks to keyword ads tied to certain conspiracy search terms.</p><p>Rand said the study's success, which he and his co-authors have replicated, offers an example of how AI can be used for good.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, he's not naive about the potential for bad actors to use the technology to build a chatbot that confirms certain conspiracy theories. Imagine, for example, a chatbot that's been trained on social media posts that contain false claims.</p><p>"It remains to be seen, essentially, how all of this shakes out," Rand said. "If people are mostly using these foundation models from companies that are putting a lot of effort into really trying to make them accurate, we have a reasonable shot at this becoming a tool that's widely useful and trusted."</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Christopher Sewell, director of DETR, told <em>Gizmodo</em> that humans will still be be heavily involved in unemployment decision making. "There&rsquo;s no AI [written decisions] that are going out without having human interaction and that human review. We can get decisions out quicker so that it actually helps the claimant," said Sewell. </p><p>But Nevada legal groups and scholars have argued that any time saved by gen AI would be cancelled out by the time it would take to conduct a thorough human review of the claim decision. Many have also noted concerns about the possibility of private, personal information (including tax information and social security numbers) leaking through Google's Vertex AI studio, even with safeguards. Some have hesitancies surrounding the type of AI itself, known as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which has been found to produce incomplete or misleading answers to prompts. </p><p>Across the country, AI-based tools have been quietly rolled out or tested across various social services agencies, with gen AI integrating itself further into the administrative ecosystem. In February, the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ai-cant-be-used-to-determine-health-insurance-coverage" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">ruled against using AI</a> (including generative AI or algorithms) as a decision maker in determining patient care or coverage. This followed a lawsuit from two patients who alleged their insurance provider used a "fraudulent" and "harmful" AI model (known as nH Predict) that overrode physician recommendations. </p><p>Axon, a police technology and weapons manufacturer, introduced its first-of-its-kind Draft One &mdash; a generative large language model (LLM) that assists law enforcement in writing "faster, higher quality" reports &mdash; earlier this year. Still in a trial period, the technology has already <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/05/what-can-go-wrong-when-police-use-ai-write-reports" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">sounded alarms</a>, prompting concerns about the AI's ability to parse the nuance of tense police interactions and potentially adding to a lack of transparency in policing. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Plus, iPhone users will enjoy the same benefits of easy connectivity that you find in AirPods. At $199.95, they're already more affordable than a pair of AirPods Pro.</p><p>However, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aB1mKB?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Beats%20Fit%20Pro&object_type=article&object_uuid=04Syiz5CVvvnJgCkqPM5U7X&short_url=aB1mKB&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Beats Fit Pro</a> are currently down to $159, saving $40.95 for 20% off.

<p>Unveiled in April 2023, the Roborock S8 Pro Ultra &mdash;&nbsp;on paper &mdash; is one of the fanciest robot vacuum and mop combos you can buy. It features self-washing and self-drying mopping pads, above average suction power, reactive 3D obstacle avoidance, floor type customization, and liftable brushes and mop that adapt to different tasks. Former Mashable intern Stacia Datskovska <a href="https://mashable.com/review/roborock-s8-pro-ultra-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">tested it ou</a>t and found that while it may be loaded with perks, they don't justify the outrageous price of $1,599.99. Fortunately, though, it regularly goes on sale. As of Sept. 12, it's down to just $949.99 &mdash; that's 41% in savings and its lowest price on record.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>Though they're a few years old, the Beats Fit Pro still stand up to the latest earbuds on the market. Mashable's Alex Perry reviewed them and <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-beats-fit-pro-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">noted</a> they "offer excellent active noise cancellation, magnificent audio output, elite comfort, and a <em>long-lasting</em> battery," putting them lightyears ahead of the third-generation AirPods. Typically just under $200, you can pick up a pair on sale for just $159 as of Sept. 12. That's 95 cents cheaper than the sale price they've been chilling at for months&nbsp;&mdash; a 20% savings overall.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>Small, yet mighty, the Anker Soundcore 2 Bluetooth speaker is tough to beat in terms of value. It offers impressive stereo sound, a durable design with IPX7 protection against rain, dust, spills, and more, and a 24-hour battery life to keep your tunes coming all day and night. For those specs, the price tag is pretty insane at just $27.99 on sale. That's 30% off its usual price as of Sept. 12.</p><p><em>None of these deals catching your eye?

You're almost always trading in an old device or getting some kind of carrier discount, right? Well, if you're doing the former, you may want to keep your old iPhone in good shape.</p><p><a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2455367/trade-and-switch-apple-wants-to-recycle-my-iphone-15-pro-max-for-0.html" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">MacWorld</a> executive editor Michael Simon wrote a cautionary tale purporting that Apple would not accept a 256GB variant of the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a> (which should have nearly the highest trade-in value of any existing iPhone) for trade-in because the back of the phone was cracked from a drop. As Simon pointed out, the cost of repairing this blemish would be only $29, but rather than deduct $29 from the trade-in value, Apple instead decided his iPhone was worthless during the trade-in process.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>The big lesson here is to just pay the $29 (or whatever your repair fee happens to cost) if there's any kind of imperfection with your iPhone before trading it in for an <a href="https://mashable.com/article/should-i-upgrade-to-iphone-16" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">iPhone 16</a>.

<p>When it comes to buying a new <a href="https://mashable.com/category/smartwatches" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">smartwatch</a>, there are tons to choose from, including the newly-announced Apple Watch Series 10. But if you don't want to overspend, or you're an Android user, that upgrade may not be on the table for you. If that's the case, you can save big on an excellent watch right now with a host of great features that can go toe-to-toe with what Apple is offering. Best of all, you can get it for just under $200, which you can't say for most of Apple's product lineup. </p><p>As of Sept. 12, you can get the <a href="https://zdcs.link/98bpxd?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%20Galaxy%20Watch%206%20Classic%20%2847%20mm%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=04M1BiYxLTXoIoyOFJHMrMm&short_url=98bpxd&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic (47 mm)</a> for just $199.99, down from its usual price of $479.99. That's a discount of $280, or 58% off. This sale only applies to the Silver colorway right now, so if you want something else, you'll have to pony up a bit more cash. This is the <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0CG7PYYS1" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">lowest price</a> we've seen for this particular model &mdash; a full $70 lower. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>This smartwatch doesn't take cues from the rest of the competition that tries a little too hard to be techy. Instead, it looks much more like a regular timepiece with smart features. It offers heart rate, heart rhythm, sleep, and fitness tracking as well as sync options with other Samsung Galaxy devices you may already have. It looks slick on the wrist, it's sturdy, and it has plenty of customization options so you can make it your own. </p><p>For anyone using the Android ecosystem, it's well worth investing in, especially at this price. You won't want to pass it up for $199.99, but it'll likely go quickly while it's on sale. The holidays are just around the corner, so lock it in while you can. </p>]]></content:encoded>

With the camera's pan and tilt functions, you'll be able to get a 360 degree horizontal view and a 133 degree vertical area of coverage.</p><h3>More home security deals</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/a0XYGe?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=WYZE%20outdoor%20wireless%20security%20camera&object_type=article&object_uuid=02guk0vTFqtSaN4Ey5Eponx&short_url=a0XYGe&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">WYZE outdoor wireless security camera</a> &mdash; <strong>$19.98</strong> <s>$29.98</s> (save $10)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/QWd5pd?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=eufy%20Security%205-piece%20home%20alarm%20kit&object_type=article&object_uuid=02guk0vTFqtSaN4Ey5Eponx&short_url=QWd5pd&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">eufy Security 5-piece home alarm kit</a> &mdash; <strong>$99</strong> <s>$159.99</s> (save $60.99)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/Q4bGOy?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=eufy%20security%20eufyCam%202C%20Pro%203-cam%20kit&object_type=article&object_uuid=02guk0vTFqtSaN4Ey5Eponx&short_url=Q4bGOy&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">eufy security eufyCam 2C Pro 3-cam kit</a> &mdash; <strong>$259.99</strong> <s>$389.99</s> (save $130)</p></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

The boys were six or seven and had happily been swept up in the burgeoning cultural phenomenon dubbed "Pok&eacute;mania."

Like many other kids his age, my brother collected Pok&eacute;mon cards and captured the creatures on his Game Boy.

<p>Today, new generations are discovering the franchise as older ones embrace its nostalgia. Nowhere was that clearer than this summer's Pok&eacute;mon GO Fest, a three-day in-person event celebrating the franchise's mobile game in New York City. There, families in matching outfits bent over their phones together as if saying grace at the dining room table. Babes in strollers clutched stuffed Pok&eacute;mon toys as their parents discussed capturing new creatures.</p><p>Offline, the Pokemon trading card game &mdash; which littered early-aughts pavements at recess and became such a distraction that it was <a href="https://www.marquette.edu/cgi-bin/cuap/db.cgi?uid=default&amp;ID=4714&amp;view=Search&amp;mh=1" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>banned</u></a> in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemoncards/comments/18mgky6/when_schools_were_banning_pok%C3%A9mon_cards_in_1999/?share_id=j_AKcl51Bus65-MBA8ct2&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>some schools</u></a> &mdash; has seen a resurgence.

Between 2022 and 2023, PSA saw a 50 percent growth in authentication and grading submissions of Pok&eacute;mon cards, compared to just a 16 percent increase in baseball cards over the same period.&nbsp;</p><p>"We've seen a major surge in the collectibles industry, specifically Pok&eacute;mon, due to the rising trend of nostalgia-driven primarily by Millennials and Gen Z," Ryan Hoge, president of PSA, told Mashable. "As the first generation of Pok&eacute;mon collectors have grown up and had kids, they&rsquo;ve gravitated back to the nostalgic pieces of their childhood and have resurrected the demand for Pok&eacute;mon trading cards."</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>PSA has graded only three subjects more than one million times: Michael Jordan and Pok&eacute;mon characters Charizard and Pikachu. "Charizard and Pikachu have now had 30-year careers spanning multiple generations," a spokesperson for the company noted.</p><p>The same nostalgia fueling Pok&eacute;mon card collecting is also enlivening a dedicated faction of players of the franchise's Pok&eacute;mon GO mobile game. </p><p>The game became a sensation virtually overnight when it was first released in the U.S. in 2016, capturing the hearts of fans and non-fans alike.&nbsp;It used augmented reality to overlay Pok&eacute;mon in real-world environments, transforming the player into a Pok&eacute;mon trainer tasked with collecting as many creatures as possible. A key element of the game was that it required the player to walk outside to find new Pok&eacute;mon in the wild.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Many saw their journey to GO Fest as a kind of pilgrimage.&nbsp;For Rose Dinelli-Figueroa, 36, GO Fest has become a family tradition. She has traveled from Puerto Rico to attend Pok&eacute;mon GO Fests in Seattle, London, and Las Vegas with her husband, parents, and two children. The family's youngest member, 7-year-old Jade, is dressed as Pok&eacute;mon trainer Misty and was not yet born when her mother began playing Pok&eacute;mon GO in 2016.</p><p>About a 10-minute walk away, on a large lawn, an Illinois man who goes by "Uncle Bob" stands on an oval of astroturf across from a teen named Theo. They stare at their phones, battling each other digitally in the app. Uncle Bob has attended every GO Fest since the first iteration of the event was held in Chicago in 2017. Theo is far from home and reveling in a thrilling change of pace. "There are not as many players in my hometown [of Wiener Neustadt, Austria]," he tells <em>Mashable</em>. Back in Austria, he usually has to pay to join group gaming activities called "remote raids" in cities with more players.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>A couple nearby, Amy, 37, and Gary, 38, use the game to stay connected in their long-distance relationship. "He lives about four hours away from me," Amy says, dressed in a blue body suit, cosplaying as Vaporean, her favorite evolution of the Pok&eacute;mon Eevee. "And there's a feature in the game where you can send each other postcards. So I have a lot of fun sending him postcards when we're away from each other."&nbsp;</p><p>Pok&eacute;mon GO appears to be a popular pillar of romantic relationships. Niantic, the app's developer, helped organize five marriage proposals during this year's GO Fest. One of the couples, Alex, 32, and Courtney, 31, began dating in 2020 and play Pok&eacute;mon GO together while walking their dogs. They came down from New Hampshire to attend Pok&eacute;mon GO Fest last year, even though Courtney was recovering from foot surgery in a walking boot. "We look back at it like, 'That was so much fun.'" says Courtney. "We were showing [people] pictures of it from last year, and we got some of our friends at work to start playing it as well."</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Another member of the group, Brayden, 29, notes how much the franchise has expanded since establishing its reputation as a children's game of the early aughts. "My mom is like level whatever; she is intense," he says. "She's better at it than I am." He points at his friends standing nearby. "They'll be like, 'Oh yeah, I raided with your mom.'"</p><p>Canadian sisters Tania, 49, and Shelley, 53, are two of the oldest attendees Mashable interviewed at the event. When Pok&eacute;mon GO first dropped in 2016, Shelley says she "didn't want to be one of those old people that just assume that because I don't understand it, it's not cool." So she asked a young person she worked with to explain it to her. "I don't know anything about Pok&eacute;mon. I didn't play the game. I didn't grow up with it," says Shelley. "But I downloaded it and was like, 'This is fucking fun.'" Two weeks later, on a family vacation, she got Tania hooked on the game, too.</p><p>It seems that the core of Pok&eacute;mon brand's legacy &mdash; what has made it the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_media_franchises" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>highest-grossing media franchise</u></a> on earth and an enduring cultural phenomenon for 25 years &mdash; is its ability to bring people together to have a good time.</p><p>The sisters point to their bright yellow paper Pikachu hats, which organizers distributed for free to attendees earlier in the day. "We had to get the hat. We were asking little kids, 'Where'd you get your visor?'" Tania laughs. "It's ridiculous, and we love it. You've gotta lean into the fun."</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Another striking perk that hit the iPhone 15 line last year? The new "tetraprism" telephoto feature, which is just marketing mumbo jumbo for a new 5X optical zoom capability (up from 3X). This feature was reserved for the iPhone 15 Pro Max, so the iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, <em>and </em>iPhone 15 Pro were left out of the party.</p><p>This time around, with the launch of the iPhone 16, Apple is a little less stingy.

<p>Surprisingly, Camera Control isn&rsquo;t a Pro-only feature &mdash; it&rsquo;s available across the <em>entire</em> lineup. I hope Apple isn&rsquo;t reading this (because I don&rsquo;t want them getting any ideas), but as someone who always snaps up the pricier Pro Max, Ultra, or XL models for that "crown jewel" feature, I have to admit &mdash; for the first time in years &mdash; I don&rsquo;t feel the need to with the new iPhone 16.</p><p>I suspect I'd be "complete" with the iPhone 16, which is a rare feeling when it comes to entry-level smartphones these days. </p><p>Sure, I'll lose out on the iPhone 16 Pro Max's new features like 4K video capture at 120Hz, studio-quality mics, a spacious 6.9-inch display, audio track layering in Voice Memos, and more, but I could live without those. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Even though the iPhone 16 doesn't a telephoto sensor, Apple discovered a way to somewhat compensate for this, so much so that you can reportedly get high-quality zoomed-in photos by up to 2X.

<p>Kemen was a somewhat minor presence throughout <em>The Rings of Power </em>Season 1, albeit an unmistakably slimy one. As a rising politician, he worked with his father Ar-Pharaz&ocirc;n (Trystan Gravelle) behind the scenes to turn the people of N&uacute;menor against Queen Tar-M&iacute;riel (Cynthia Addai-Robinson). He even tried his hand at some sneaky arson in order to stop the N&uacute;menorean forces going to Middle-earth.</p><p>But now that Pharaz&ocirc;n is king, Kemen is able to operate in the open, with all the authority of N&uacute;menor behind him. That kind of unchecked power leads to some seriously nasty, entitled behavior. In<em> </em>just the fifth episode of Season 2, Kemen goes on quite the evil tear, cementing himself as one of the biggest threats to Middle-earth &mdash; and the most punchable character in the series.</p><p>Kemen's reign of terror begins with a task from his father: Strip the members of the Sea Guard of their ranks. That includes Captain Elendil (Lloyd Owen), whose loyalty to M&iacute;riel and faithfulness to the Valar constitute as treason in Kemen's eyes. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Kemen only gets worse as the episode goes on, waltzing into the oldest shrine to the Valar in N&uacute;menor and breaking up a memorial service for the soldiers who died in Middle-earth. Hey, wasn't one of the biggest reasons people hated M&iacute;riel because she let soldiers go to Middle-earth in the first place? The hypocrisy is off the charts! The least you could do is let people grieve these losses in peace before you start condemning their shrines.</p><p>But Kemen isn't into doing the least evil. He's here to do the absolute <em>most</em>, whether that's pettily smashing a Valar relic, poking at Elendil's strained relationship with E&auml;rien, or smirking like there's no tomorrow. Serious props to Wadham for selling Kemen's infuriating self-satisfaction so hard. He somehow manages to make a seemingly innocuous statement like "It's in the way of the new aqueduct" the most enraging line in the entire show.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Thankfully, Elendil must have heard my pleas for someone to haul back and punch Kemen in the face, because the legend smacks the living daylights out of him. Remember when Tyrion slapped Joffrey in <a href="https://mashable.com/category/game-of-thrones" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Game of Thrones</em></a>? Yeah, I felt the exact same levels of hype here.</p><p>The ensuing brawl doesn't end well for Elendil's men, but I'd be lying if I said it didn't rock to see Kemen get absolutely bodied by former Sea Guard member Valandil (Alex Tarrant), though he's ultimately too honorable to finish Kemen off. But you know who doesn't have any problem being dishonorable? That's right, Kemen. N&uacute;menor's biggest twerp stabs Valandil in the back, and just like that, I need him to get decked in the face again. Too bad Elendil's being thrown in jail; otherwise I <em>know </em>he'd follow through.</p><p>Kemen's rage-inducing behavior throughout this episode is not only proof of him being an all-around bad guy &mdash; it's also proof of the corruption of N&uacute;menor, and the Men who live there. No wonder this episode also focuses on <a href="https://mashable.com/video/lord-of-the-rings-of-power-season-2-interviews" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Sauron's (Charlie Vickers)</a> efforts to convince Celebrimbor (Charles Edwards) to make Rings of Power for Men. He knows that people like Kemen exist, and that they'd do anything for power. </p><p>Truly, if Kemen ever comes to Middle-earth, he's a prime candidate for one of the nine rings for Men. <em>Lord of the Rings </em>fans know how that would turn out: with ultimate corruption, and transformation into a Ringwraith. According to Pharaz&ocirc;n, Kemen's late mother <em>did</em> prophesy that he would come to an "ill end," and I'd say becoming a Nazg&ucirc;l falls under that umbrella. (Getting punched again would also qualify, and it would be more than welcome!)</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/zEVoby?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=The%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings%3A%20The%20Rings%20of%20Power%20Season%202%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Prime%20Video%2C%20with%20a%20new%20episode%20every%20Thursday.&object_type=article&object_uuid=00lxP43nQJfL9brctE3veQi&short_url=zEVoby&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power </em>Season 2 is now streaming on Prime Video, with a new episode every Thursday.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

If that&rsquo;s not your cup of tea and you need a little more of the getting-to-know-someone before jumping into bed with them, these might not be the right sites for you.</p><h2>What precautions should you take when using a NSFW dating site?</h2><p>If you&rsquo;re on a site where you need to share personal information or choose a username, be careful about the information you&rsquo;re giving out &mdash; and about what kind of information it is. Things like credit card numbers are vulnerable to hackers, and using your real name on platforms like these can compromise your safety if you happen to stumble upon the wrong sort of people on the sites.</p><p>Always choose a username that doesn&rsquo;t have a relationship to your first name, and be careful about the personal information you share (like where you live, etc.).</p><h2>What else is important to know when using a NSFW dating site?</h2><p>Besides not giving away any personal information, especially for things like anonymous encounters on cam or sexting sites, know the risks when it comes to sending nude or partially nude photos containing identifying details like your face or tattoos. While it&rsquo;s against the law in many places to circulate private sexual images, that doesn&rsquo;t stop people from doing it.</p><h2>What is the best NSFW dating site?</h2><p>There are plenty of raunchy dating sites out there that should suit just about everyone, but we get that you probably don't want to spend all day perusing the options (or maybe you do). To help you find the best NSFW dating site for you, we have lined up a standout selection.</p><p>We've tried to find something for every type of dater, with popular sites like <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/fcny?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=AdultFriendFinder&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=06UTlKxWKbparvI2r89U3Lw&short_url=fcny&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">AdultFriendFinder</a> and <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/fco0?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=GetItOn&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=06UTlKxWKbparvI2r89U3Lw&short_url=fco0&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">GetItOn</a> making the cut.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/roundups/05RuzISfTYCPalBzradvTnG/hero-image.jpg" alt="Person using laptop"><p>Prime Video is the seriously popular on-demand streaming service that hosts literally thousands of movies, shows, and award-winning Prime Originals. <a href="https://zdcs.link/Albr5?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Amazon%20Prime&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=05RuzISfTYCPalBzradvTnG&short_url=Albr5&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Amazon Prime</a> offers one-day delivery, unlimited music, and includes this impressive streaming service. </p><p>Amazon Prime Video works out at a similar rate to other streaming video services like Netflix. However, you don't get a delivery service, music streaming, and access to the Kindle library with <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-netflix" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Netflix</a>. It's for this reason that so many people continue to sign up to Amazon's video <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-for-streaming-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">streaming service</a>. Amazon Prime Video is available to stream on all the Kindle Fire tablets and more than 600 other devices, including pretty much every computer, smartphone, console, and smart TV you can imagine. </p><p>This all sounds great, but imagine for a moment that not everything is perfect. Imagine that everything is not well with the world, because you have signed up to Amazon Prime Video to specifically watch one programme, and it's only shown on the U.S. version of the service. It's a troubling thought and it seems to happen fairly regularly. </p><p>Fortunately, there is something you can do to avoid this annoying issue. You can use a VPN to gain access to all of the best American content from the UK.</p><h2>What is a VPN?</h2><p><a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Virtual Private Networks</a> (VPNs) provide online privacy and anonymity by creating a private network from a public internet connection. VPNs hide your real IP address so all of your online activity is untraceable and secure. </p><p>Does this make sense? We understand that this sort of technology can be confusing, so it can help to think of a VPN as a tunnel through which all of your online traffic passes. This tunnel is encrypted, meaning that nobody can see into it, and everything inside is protected against online threats like hackers, viruses, and malware.</p><h2>What are the benefits of using a VPN?</h2><p>VPNs are used to provide <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-for-anonymity-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>protection for your sensitive information</u></a>, and this is obviously important. These services are vital for improving you cybersecurity, there is another reason that VPNs are so popular. </p><p>These tools can also be used to watch content that is normally blocked in your location by hiding your real IP address and connecting you to a server in another country. This simple process tricks leading streaming sites into thinking you are based in another country, meaning you can watch all of the extra content from global libraries.</p><p>VPNs are keys to the online world, granting you access to more of the shows and films you love by bypassing geo-restrictions. </p><h2>How do you unblock U.S. Prime Video with a VPN?</h2><p>The process of accessing the American version of Prime Video with a VPN is actually really simple. All you need to do is open up your preferred VPN, select an American server in order to spoof your IP to a U.S. address, and then head to Prime Video. </p><p>There is a bit of a cat and mouse situation with streaming sites and VPNs, as sites like Prime Video and Netflix look to detect VPN usage and block servers. This is why you should always try and pick a VPN with a large and diverse network of servers, so you always have plenty of options to bypass restrictions.</p><p>You will still need to be subscribed to Prime Video for this trick to work. A VPN is not going to grant access to the streaming site for free. Instead, a VPN provides access to more libraries from around the world, once you're subscribed.</p><h2>What is the best VPN for Prime Video?</h2><p>There are plenty of VPNs out there that can bypass online restrictions to unblock Prime Video, which is good and bad. It's great to have options, but with so many VPNs to consider, it can be tough to pick the best option for you. This is where we come in.</p><p>We have outlined the best VPNs for the job. If you're looking to unlock more content from anywhere in the world, we recommend checking out <a href="https://go.expressvpn.com/c/190434/1462855/16063" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">ExpressVPN</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aepMy5?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=PureVPN&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=05RuzISfTYCPalBzradvTnG&short_url=aepMy5&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">PureVPN</a>, <a href="https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=340&amp;aff_id=682" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">NordVPN</a>, and the other names in this list. There should be something for everyone and every budget. You just need to weigh up each VPN against your own set of preferences, and pick a favourite. </p><p>These are the best VPNs for Prime Video in 2024.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[We've lined up the best gaming-friendly VPNs, including popular services like ExpressVPN and NordVPN.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/roundups/06Yjajrhg96H0Qhq9PlnJCx/hero-image.jpg" alt="Hand on keyboard"><p>You've probably come across VPNs. These security services protect your data and identity when you're navigating the online world. They are increasingly important in today's world, as the fight against <a href="https://mashable.com/category/cybersecurity" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">cyberthreats</a> becomes more serious every day. Of course, not everyone uses these services for boosting cybersecurity. </p><p>A lot of subscribers sign up to unlock more content from around the world or give themselves an advantage when gaming.</p><h2>What is a VPN?</h2><p>A Virtual Private Network, or VPN, is an essential service that secures your internet connection, giving you greater control over how your online activity can be tracked, and providing a combination of security (keeping your computer and data protected) and privacy (keeping your identity protected). </p><p>So how does a <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-netflix" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">VPN</a> accomplish this? By creating an encrypted connection between your computer and a server operated by the VPN service, that&rsquo;s how. When you&rsquo;re connected to the VPN server, all of your network traffic passes through a safe, protected tunnel that no one else should be able to monitor. That's the theory anyway.</p><p>Even the very <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-deals" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">best VPNs</a> will likely have an impact on your connectivity, though, sometimes to the point where lag gets in the way of your gaming &mdash; which is unacceptable, particularly if you&rsquo;re a first-person shooter fan. </p><h2>Do you need a VPN for gaming?</h2><p>First and foremost, VPNs should be used to protect your personal information when you're online, and that doesn't change if you're gaming. It's important to remain anonymous as hackers and other online threats can still access your personal details when you're playing your favourite titles. The best way to ensure that you're data is private is with a VPN.</p><p>There is an argument that using VPNs can also increase your chances of success when gaming. With games that use skill-based matchmaking, VPNs can help you find easier lobbies. By connecting to a VPN, you can hide your real IP address and connect to a secure server in another location. This simple process tricks the game into thinking you are based elsewhere. Why is this useful when it comes to games like <em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em>? You can connect to a country with fewer gamers, or connect to a country at a less busy time of the day. This reduces your chances of meeting skilled players.</p><h2>What is the best VPN for gaming?</h2><p>So how do you select a VPN when both security and gaming are priorities. You need a <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/cheapest-best-vpn-deals" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">VPN</a> that ticks three boxes &mdash; speed, ping, and protection &mdash; so that when you&rsquo;re in a virtual life and death situation, lag doesn&rsquo;t deliver the killer blow.</p><p>These are the best VPNs for gaming in 2024.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/roundups/01znTPixp2LSOKjC1eYezLJ/hero-image.jpg" alt="Couple holding hands"><p>The chilly period between the beginning of autumn and the start of spring, in which anyone not coupled up finds themselves seeking to be tied down by a serious relationship, is known as <a href="https://mashable.com/archive/awesome-headline" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">cuffing season</a>.&nbsp;It's that time once again.</p><p>We might like to think that we are all deeply complex individuals, but we're actually pretty simple creatures. In the summer, when the sun is shining and temperatures soar, we are more content to remain single. We socialise more, meet <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-hookup-apps-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">new people</a>, and enjoy the feeling of being untethered. However, as we enter the colder months, we yearn for companionship. It&rsquo;s a fact. It&rsquo;s science. It&rsquo;s instinct. </p><p>Much like the bear, we naturally want to bunker down and protect ourselves against the oncoming freeze. That means <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-netflix" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">movie marathons</a>, duvet days, and ideally someone to hold. As the cold weather bites, you owe it to yourself to find that special someone, even if what you are really searching for is a human-sized hot water bottle. Either is fine.</p><h2>Do you actually need to use a dating site?</h2><p><a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-dating-sites-women-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Dating sites and apps</a> can make finding a compatible potential partner easier, but it's still dating. Not everyone is going to be a match. While apps like Bumble let you display what kind of relationship you're looking for, others don't, so you might end up going out with someone only to realise you're not looking for the same thing.</p><p>Having said that, there will be people on dating sites who are looking for the same thing as you. And using a dating app to find them is a lot easier than going up to strangers on the street or in bars and asking if they're looking for a relationship. Apps and dating websites expand your dating pool and allow you to meet people with similar interests you might not run into naturally in your everyday life.</p><h2>Should you use free dating apps?</h2><p>There are a lot of free dating sites and apps out there, and the likes of Tinder and Hinge are seriously popular options with massive networks of users. Plus, most of the biggest and best dating sites have free versions with limitations on certain features. So yes, you can easily enter the online dating game without spending anything. There are levels to this game though, and sometimes free apps just don't cut it.</p><p>This won't be a surprise to hear, but you get what you pay for with dating sites and apps. For the best experience with the greatest possibility of finding exactly what you're looking for, you are going to have to cough up the cash. We're sorry to break it to you, but the best dating sites don't come cheap.</p><p>Why should you consider upgrading to a paid site when there are free services? It all comes down to access to advanced and premium features. You can still find a hookup with a free app, but if you're looking for compatibility tests, chat rooms, videos, and a greater level of control, we recommend upgrading.</p><h2>What is the best dating site for cuffing season?</h2><p>We have compared the best dating sites and apps to help you in your journey, so you can make the most of cuffing season this year. We have lined up a selection of your best options for cuffing season, including popular sites like <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wG7JA?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=AdultFriendFinder&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=01znTPixp2LSOKjC1eYezLJ&short_url=9wG7JA&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">AdultFriendFinder</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qx7NYp?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Match&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=01znTPixp2LSOKjC1eYezLJ&short_url=Qx7NYp&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Match</a>, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGVb2x?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=eharmony&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=01znTPixp2LSOKjC1eYezLJ&short_url=QGVb2x&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">eharmony</a>.

<p>This means not deleting and re-downloading Tinder after every breakup or every time you ghost (or get ghosted by) your current entanglement.&nbsp;Tinder can truly be a great place to meet genuine people who are open to getting serious, to find a reliable friend with benefits, or to get a good-old-fashioned confidence boost from a mutual right swipe. But if you're frustrated with horny users disguising themselves as relationship seekers or relationship seekers who can't handle it when you say you're just looking for a hookup, opting for a dating site more finely-tuned to what you're looking for means you'll spend less time dealing with people who aren't looking for the same thing.&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe you can't stand starting every conversation from scratch. Maybe your biggest fear is ending up on a date with someone who doesn't care about cats. Instead of a lazy bio, dating apps that delve into someone's hobbies, favourite movies, career goals, or political views before even talking to them opens up a wealth of clever ice breakers, and ensures that you aren't going into things blindly.&nbsp;</p><h2>What are dating apps doing to make dating safer?</h2><p>Meeting someone from the internet in person for the first time is nerve-wracking for anyone. But for women, it can dredge up the same fear that occurs when walking alone past a big group of men.&nbsp;</p><p>Match Group is making strides toward a safer dating experience: Tinder was the first to unveil new features coming out of its partnership with <a href="https://mashable.com/article/tinder-noonlight-safety-features-photo-verification" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Noonlight</u></a>, a safety app that tracks the location of users and notifies authorities if there are concerns. Before heading out on a date, Tinder users can log info about where they're going and who they're meeting, as well as hit a panic button to alert authorities if there's an emergency. </p><p>Match Group plans to roll out the same features for its other apps, like Hinge and OkCupid, later. In March 2021, Tinder announced plans to let users run a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/tinder-background-check-garbo" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>background check</u></a> on their matches.</p><h2>Should you use free dating apps?</h2><p>There are plenty of free dating sites and apps out there, and the likes of Tinder and Hinge are popular options with massive networks of users.

<p>Design plays a massive role in the Acer Aspire Vero 16, as it's the heart of the laptop's sustainability. The build is a departure from classic metal frames, instead built from PCR (post-consumer recycled) plastics. Plus, the exterior is VOC- and paint-free to further its sustainability, with a touchpad made from ocean-bound plastics.</p><p>The exterior instead feels like thick, smooth plastic that reminds me of other recycled plastic materials with its speckled gray color. It is meant to be cement-inspired, which... yeah, that's what it's giving. With the plastic structure, it's highly durable with a MIL-STD-810H military-grade rating. It's a rugged laptop designed to withstand shock from drops or temperatures. So, while it is technically plastic, this isn't a crumbling, cheap <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-chromebooks" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Chromebook</a>.</p><p>While one might expect the Aspire Vero 16 to weigh less being made from plastic, it's heavier than its metal counterparts. It weighs 3.97 pounds compared to the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/m3-macbook-air-15-inch" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">15-inch MacBook Air</a>'s 3.3 pounds. Even though the difference is slight, it still feels substantial. I felt that weight when carrying it with one hand like I would my 15-inch MacBook Air. The Acer Aspire Vero 16 was far more difficult to carry with a top-heavy, unbalanced feel.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The biggest design drawback is the recycled plastic touchpad. It was consistently unresponsive as I guided the mouse around the screen. Clicking right and left takes so much pressure that I often felt like I had to slam my hand down to get a response. After my first hour with the laptop, I gave up and plugged in a USB mouse to feel like I could actually use it successfully.</p><p>Luckily, the laptop has an abundance of ports. Maybe it's because I'm usually a MacBook user, but I felt spoiled to have access to multiple USB-A and USB-C ports and an HDMI. When I first saw the plethora, I took a sigh of relief, knowing I wouldn't need the usual adaptors.</p><h2>Acer Aspire Vero 16 performance and battery</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Using the Acer Aspire Vero 16 wasn't the most thrilling experience. It's a solid performer that lives up to daily tasks; however, it never blew me away. Initially, I thought it was a slow mover, taking a while and several clicks to open apps and windows. However, most of that problem was a result of the touchpad. Once I moved over to using a USB mouse, things went faster, sparking the realization that the computer isn't a slow processor; the touchpad is just poorly designed.</p><p>It balances multiple tasks well; I was able to move between various programs while working, juggling word processing, email, Slack, and Spotify. Streaming was mostly seamless. The graphics were disappointing while I was watching YouTube videos or streaming episodes of <em>Survivor</em>. I found the video to look grainier and more pixelated compared to the stellar resolution I'm used to with my MacBook. However, if I weren't so picky, I'd think it looks fine, just a little dull.</p><p>Running <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ipad-pro-2024-m4-benchmarks" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Geekbench 6</a>, its multi-core test came in at <strong>6,274</strong>, middling in range, which I felt occasionally in its performance. After streaming for several hours, I could feel the laptop working harder as it would stall between apps, needing some buffering time to load windows.</p><p>Despite the lackluster graphics, I was surprised at the webcam's resolution. When I tuned into a regular video call, I was pleased with how clear my picture was. However, I was alarmed by how orange I looked, finding quite a bit of color distortion. So, while the 1440p QHD webcam will have your picture sharp, you lose color accuracy.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>On the sound front, both the mic and speakers worked as expected. I could listen to music clearly without a busted, tinny sound.</p><p>The Acer Aspire Vero 16 struggles the most with its performance in terms of battery life. With daily use, I didn't notice how short the battery life was, as I was primarily using it at my desk with close access to the charger. Since it was so bulky, I didn't really want to haul it around.</p><p>I ran a video run-down test to assess the battery, playing <em>Tears of Steel</em> at 1080p on a loop until the battery ran out. The battery life came in at <strong>5 hours 52 minutes</strong>, which is outrun by many other laptops we've tested. It won't get you through an entire workday, but that might not be an issue. Its size and heft make it a reasonably stationary laptop, so you may always be close to your charger anyway.</p><h2>Is the Acer Aspire Vero 16 worth it?</h2><p>Answering if the <a href="https://zdcs.link/znOZE3?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Acer%20Aspire%20Vero%2016&object_type=review&object_uuid=03pN36CLedWwCHPNmmo1V44&short_url=znOZE3&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Acer Aspire Vero 16</a> is worth it is a game of priorities. If sustainability and purchasing products with responsibly sourced materials is what you care about most, then the Acer Aspire Vero 16 is certainly a good option. With its thick recycled plastic frame, you can feel good about what it's made of and enjoy the added durability benefits. With its army-grade durability rating, it will take a tumble and not sustain damage. Plus, at $749.99 with 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD, it's a decent value for the specs.</p><p>However, if you're just looking for a good, budget-friendly, solid-performing Windows laptop, I would look elsewhere. The Acer Aspire Vero 16 is weak in processing, scoring just 6,274 on the Geekbench 6, and lacks battery life, lasting just under six hours.

<p>Glossing over the low points of Williams' journey earned the film mixed reviews out of its debut at Telluride Film Festival. But the more I mulled over what this movie does offer, the more I was won over by its playful, glossy approach.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Piece By Piece </em>turns America's biggest hip-hop stars into mini-figs.&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>To find the arc of Williams' story, Neville interviewed the multi-hyphenate star, his wife Helen Lasichanh, and a dazzling array of collaborators and colleagues, including Snoop Dogg, Missy Elliott, Jay-Z, The Neptunes' Chad Hugo, Gwen Stefani, and many more. In an interview with Mashable, Williams revealed many of these interviewees had no idea their contribution would be filtered through a Lego lens, and only discovered they'd been transformed into mini-figs when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDlnwQCkiSA" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>the first trailer hit.&nbsp;</u></a></p><p>Neville's visual translation of these interviews includes amusing flourishes, like turning Snoop Dog into a Lego Doberman, and making metaphors about bakeries literal, with Lego Pharrell selling sweet treats the way he sold hit beats. In one instance, the idea of blowing one's mind with a sick bit of music is illustrated by having a smiling mini-fig&rsquo;s head pop right off its base in amazement. These choices bring a playfulness into the film that not only is sure to delight fans of <em>The Lego Movie </em>and <em>The Lego Batman Movie</em>, but also reflects the tone of Williams' hits, like "Happy" and "Get Lucky."&nbsp;</p><p>More than this however, by turning himself into a plaything, <em>Piece By Piece </em>gives Williams a creative distance to reflect on his own life as if it is one of his many media projects. Through warm narration, he opens up about his childhood in the Atlantis Apartments in Virginia Beach, Virginia. The colorful blocks not only reconstruct his humble home but also a more fantastical version of Atlantis, where an Afro-wearing baby Pharrell swims about with a giant goldfish as Poseidon looks on. This charming spectacle showcases Pharrell's imagination manifesting big, surreal scenarios, which becomes a recurring theme &mdash;&nbsp;down to dreaming up a Lego music biopic.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Piece By Piece </em>is a <em>Little Engine That Could</em> tale that kids will relish.</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>After this whimsical dip into brick-made oceans, Williams admits he was considered an oddball by others, confessing, "It broke my spirit." But weird kids out there (or the weird adults they became) might find solace as little Pharrell finds his crew, each of whom also revels in making music. From there, <em>Piece By Piece </em>becomes a story of succeeding by staying true to yourself and putting in the work to build your dream, brick by brick. Along the way, Neville laces various hits that Pharrell has contributed to, from "Hot in Herre" and "Shake Ya Ass" to "Hollaback Girl" and "Blurred Lines." (Parents, don't fret. Some of the racier lyrics have been delicately plucked out.)&nbsp;</p><p>While it's initially fun to indulge in the nostalgia as Neville recreates iconic music videos with mini-figs, this device begins to get old as the story of his rise makes for a lot of name- and track-dropping. Pardon the pun, but things get a bit one-note. Then when it comes to a low point &mdash;&nbsp;a necessity for any biopic or story for that matter &mdash;&nbsp;Williams pulls back.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Piece By Piece</em> can't commit to its big swing.&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Rosy memories of childhood troubles is one thing, but sharing why his career took a dip is a Lego bridge too far. Instead of probing questions, Neville paves a path with platitudes about how his subject's greatest weakness is he has too many ideas. Colleagues speak vaguely about some business missteps or shameless yes-men who gave Williams bad advice, and these unnamed negative influences are imagined as a trio of gray-skinned ghouls wearing smiles and business suits.&nbsp;</p><p>Here the film suffers. Even with the mask of the mini-fig, Williams can't let his audience into the dark moments. (On the other hand, this is where <a href="https://mashable.com/article/better-man-review-robbie-williams" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Better Man</u></em></a> positively thrives.) Swiftly, Williams has reconnected with his pure inspiration, and the third act becomes a rousing celebration of song, dance, and Lego bits humorous and heartfelt. But this fumbled beat undercuts the movie's message. Being true to yourself isn't a one-time battle; it's ongoing. But with a community &mdash;&nbsp;like the mini-fig friends and family in <em>Piece By Piece</em> &mdash;&nbsp;one might get their block knocked off and still rebuild.&nbsp;</p><p>Even with help from an on-screen avatar, can Williams not admit the ugly truths of his own story? Or did he and Neville fear self-doubt in anything but the briefest mention might bring down the joy of their movie? To that, I'd point to the other Lego movies, where the Lego universe and Lego Gotham are brought to the brink of utter destruction without us losing faith in their mini-fig heroes. Heck, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/lego-movie-2-the-second-part-movie-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part</u></em></a><em> </em>even made the dark side of its happy hero the mini-fig villain!&nbsp;</p><p>This wobble aside, <em>Piece By Piece </em>is a winsome reinvention of the music biopic. Animation is enthusiastically employed to bring the audience into the experience of being Pharrell Williams. The colorful blocks not only allow the construction of musical beats to become a physical act rather than an abstract idea, but also give a <em>Ratatouille-</em>like understanding of how this art form affects its hero. His synesthesia is showcased in waves of color as the beat bounces.&nbsp;</p><p>While this colorful concept means <em>Piece By Piece </em>can be a hit with kids, it's easy to wish the movie dared to delve a bit more into the problems of being a grown-up. But all in all, <em>Piece By Piece </em>is a delight that could well have audiences dancing in the aisles.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Piece By Piece </em>was reviewed out of its International Premiere at the 2024 Toronto International Film Festival. <a href="https://zdcs.link/aXd7DO?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=The%20movie%20will%20hit%20theaters%20Oct.%2011.&object_type=article&object_uuid=05CiYKZQBNgWR1QnQltQ1kH&short_url=aXd7DO&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">The movie will hit theaters Oct. 11.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

    </div>
<p>Nearly three months after launching the culturally inclusive chatbot, CEO and founder Erin Reddick, 30, spoke with Mashable about the platform and her journey in the tech world.</p><h2><strong>Mashable: What is ChatBlackGPT?</strong></h2><p><strong>Erin Reddick</strong>: ChatBlackGPT is a culturally informed AI. It's [a] generative AI that's rooted in the acknowledgment of social, economic, and systemic racism &mdash; and the diaspora of Black and brown people in America. It's an opportunity for people of color to have relatable conversations with AI.</p><h2><strong>What was your experience with AI and tech prior to founding ChatBlackGPT?</strong></h2><p>[It's been] all together, about five years. Between Amazon, Microsoft, and AWS...it's been an amazing journey. It's always been inspiring to work around the most brilliant people out there, and it's true that it can be quite isolating. You need to have thick skin and know who you are to succeed in the space. But it's built me into the person I am today, who can own their own narrative in the technology space and feel confident doing so.</p><h2><strong>Why did you decide to make ChatBlackGPT, and how did you go about creating it?</strong></h2><p>I always like to say one word: racism. Honestly. Because if it didn't exist, there wouldn't be a need for what I do, and it wouldn't be celebrated and appreciated the way that it is. </p><p>For example, if you ask prominent leaders today how they feel about the technology, a lot of them say that it's low risk. But it's not low risk, in reality, for Black and brown people because the biases that persist are affecting our daily lives, inside and outside of the work environment. It is a high-risk technology for us, and I want to build something so that we don't get stuck waiting for a policy to force companies to mitigate risk and have to suffer in the meantime.</p><h2><strong>Can you unpack the role of bias in AI?</strong></h2><p>Bias is everywhere, and it's impossible to fully be rid of it. If you were to ask a usual chatbot, and I have, "What is a Black job?" It answered that it was under-the-table work, drug trafficking un-taxed, with no benefits. But when you ask, "What is a white job?" It says, usually educated, insured, legal, tax-paying. While that might not outwardly appear as a bias, what it does is, it reaffirms a bias that a lot of people who hold racist or superiority complexes, and views &mdash; it confirms their bias against Black people. It is offensive because we are Black people who work any job that there is, not just the jobs that AI describes.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What is "responsible AI?"</strong></h2><p>I would describe it as having a clean diverse data set. Something that helps mitigate risk or is responsible in the way that it functions without hurting people, and is fair and doesn't produce the ability to be destructive. </p><p>It<strong> </strong>is developed with red teaming and bad actors in mind so&nbsp;that you can make sure that people who are going to take advantage of it in a negative way aren't able to. Building it responsibly to have an inclusive design. Using it responsibly is, first of all, not taking it at face value and trusting it right away. Also, make sure that you check what you're looking at, and then do not put your personal information into these systems just to understand how powerful it is, and also ask, "How many shortcomings can it have?" &nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How has ChatBlackGPT performed since its launch on Juneteenth? </strong></h2><p>It's done great. We have our beta on Open AI's Customizable store, and we've gone from 1,000 users to 5,000 since the launch. We have a 4.6 rating, which I think is great for having no customizable proprietary data within. Our standalone app is also doing well &mdash; we have about 2,000 people who have access to the tool, and we are currently developing it with proprietary information, working with historians and other experts to make sure that it reflects correctly in our society today and in a useful way.</p><h2><strong>What are the benefits of having a personalized AI experience, or at least one more specific to one's culture?</strong></h2><p>When people learn about a culture, it's really important that it's not diluted and told from the perspective of a fragile mindset or the erasure of the realities of true history in any culture. It's so important to respect that history lives on in how our systems play out, in how people are treated in society, and [shows] why things are the way that they are. Things like critical race theory exist for a reason. </p><p>So you can imagine that having an AI that acknowledges the state of today in relation with culture and history is really important. A lot of the feedback that I get is that people had in the past prompted AI over and over and over again to get a response that actually fit what they were looking for. Even if they were just generating content for diverse audiences, like diversity doesn't just mean LGBTQ, and deaf [people], or something like that. It also just means that when I'm looking to create advertising on this hair product, it understands porosities and curl patterns, and all of that relevant [information] being automatically built into an AI creates psychological safety within the technology.</p><h2><strong>How is ChatBlackGPT different from other culturally sensitive or aware AI products?</strong></h2><p>Firstly, there aren't very many out there. But what makes us different is that we're not just focused on the history being told. We're also capturing the current-day, modern, Black history so that we aren't leaving it up to God knows who to write a book and rewrite history. However, we're looking to solidify history now with our voices to influence policy, influence risk, mitigation and the degradation of Black and brown people in AI. </p><p>We also want to ensure that it represents the community [with a] true, inclusive design. We don't just have a bunch of people working in the background that you never meet, and you never see unless they're stealthy. But we actually invite people to contribute, and they can see themselves reflected in what we're doing.</p><h2><strong>Why did you choose to name your product ChatBlackGPT?</strong></h2><p>It's like chatting with a group of black people instead of the Eurocentric, typical GPT that you run into most commonly. It's obvious what it is, and nobody gets confused.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>When did the idea for ChatBlackGPT come about and how has it evolved since launch?</strong></h2><p>The idea came about after I got laid off; I was looking to take charge of my relationship with technology. I really wanted not to let whether or not I had a job at a big fancy tech company determine whether or not I was a Black woman in tech. So, I reclaimed my identity by studying AI and placing myself around some of the best people who are experts in it.&nbsp;</p><p>But before that<strong> </strong>I had just done my regular research and noticed a lot of articles popping up about AI erasing Black history. Then I delved into the fact that AI has been in a lot of products and producing and creating a lot of harm for the Black community for a long time, and that was so saddening for me. And then the third part that got me into it was Black people, realizing how bad it's been, and how bad it is. So I wrote a really strong algorithm that reflects and is able to produce answers with the relevant context for our community.</p><h2><strong>Why did you think it was important to focus solely on the Black community versus, more broadly, communities of color?</strong></h2><p>Because I'm a subject matter expert. That's the only lived experience that I can personally validate, and in order to test a product, I think you need experts dedicated to doing that. So for me, that is what I felt most confident I could make the most impact doing. We are expanding to other cultures and looking to involve different communities and culture consensus committees to build that representation out for as many cultures as possible. </p><h2><strong>How do you train this AI for ChatBlackGPT?</strong></h2><p>You can't claim to represent a community you don't talk to.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Do you have any partnerships for ChatBlackGPT?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>We partner with anybody willing to learn more about why this work is important. For example, 11 Labs is sponsoring our AI voiceover content. I am a responsible AI lecturer at the University of Washington, as well as Emerson. </p><h2><strong>Why is it important to partner with HBCUs? And what do those partnerships consist of?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>I'm currently scheduled to speak at the White House National HBCU conference. And we're looking to get interns who are hopefully sponsored to come in and help us develop this product. I would love for them to produce a white paper just on the experience, and how they can use it on their resume is endless. They can use it to get into jobs or work in AI. But [I want] to give people a chance to contribute to something that they can't easily get their hands on but can see the effects of their contribution immediately. </p><h2><strong>What are some of the next steps for ChatBlackGPT? </strong></h2><p>We're continuing to have in-person activations where we can listen to the community and make sure that our voices are heard. We'll continue showing up at different conferences and spreading the word as well as working to make sure the product can stay in the hands of people that need it.</p><h2><strong>Is there anything else you want to add?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>People should try it! ChatBlackGPT beta is available on the Open AI customizable store, you just search GPTs and then our tool is <a href="http://ChatBlackGPT.ai" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">ChatBlackGPT.ai</a>. So you can use both, but the point is that it's made for us &mdash; and it's by us. I want them to use it to their advantage and enjoy it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

It's part of the scientists' aim to track bone loss in <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nasa-astronaut-moon-training-artemis" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">astronauts</a> &mdash; particularly in future deep space journeys &mdash; and to monitor whether a space traveler is at risk for developing kidney stones.

<p>Buckey and Lan want to prove that the "first morning void" &mdash; the first pee in the morning and usually the most concentrated one of the day &mdash; can reliably track bone loss and show if astronauts are at a higher risk for developing kidney stones. (Kidney stones are created when substances like calcium become too concentrated in urine.) If this were to happen in en route to, say <a href="https://mashable.com/article/mars-nasa-image-spacecraft" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Mars</a>, an alerted astronaut could start drinking plenty more water, or if needed, take medication. No one wants to pass a kidney stone ever; particularly in a tiny space capsule.</p><q>
    "If you remove gravity, the bone starts to break down."
    </q>
<p>The SpaceX passengers will use the device similar to the one shown below, held by Lan, to collect their concentrated first morning urine. In outer space, urinary calcium goes up briskly, so the researchers suspect that just one a.m. void on this condensed mission will be enough to show they can reliably capture a usable sample. For this experiment, the samples won't be analyzed in space, but will be taken to a lab on Earth. (For comparison, the SpaceX passengers provided urine samples before launch.)</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

Yes, they're an investment &mdash; for what it's worth, they're still a good deal less than the AirPods Max on sale &mdash; so they might not be for everyone, but for those who wear their headphones more often than not, it could very well be worth it.</p><p>And if you need more convincing, we also named these Bose headphones our top pick for the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-noise-cancelling-headphones-for-flying" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">best noise-cancelling headphones for flying</a>.</p><h3><strong>Why we picked this:</strong> </h3><p>Due to our prior experience with the QuietComfort line, we weren't at all surprised that these QuietComfort headphones delivered all-day wear without issue. What we were impressed with was that they were noticeably even more comfortable than past QuietComfort headphones, never squeezing our ears from the sides, or weighing down on the top of our head even after hours of use. Even with glasses on, they never felt too tight or heavy, despite being over-ear headphones with earcups that sealed out sound. Speaking of sound, it always came out well-rounded and functioned well with the immersive audio (which, by the way, is a new feature for the QuietComfort line). Mashable Shopping Reporter Sam Mangino deemed the Ultras "the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn" in her <a href="https://mashable.com/review/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">review</a>. </p><p>They don't have adjustable ANC like the discontinued Bose-700s, but the one ANC level definitely sits at the higher end of what's available on the market, though it will shine the most with lower-pitched tones (for higher tones, a bit of music or a podcast will go a long way in assisting the built-in noise cancellation). Mangino did find that the slightly looser fit of these headphones means there's less of a tight seal on the earcups &mdash; that helps with comfort, but it sacrifices some noise-cancelling efficacy. As for the major downsides, these headphones are expensive at $429 (though you can find them on sale), so we expected a lot out of them. The pairing can be a little touch and go at times and completely fine at others &mdash; that definitely dampens the premium feel. A small consolation is that this inconsistency is characteristic of other Bose headphones we've tested, but we wish it was a feature they fixed in the Ultras.</p><p>The most baffling flaw of these headphones is the lack of passive playback, meaning you have to turn on the headphones to use the wired connection. Though these are clearly meant to be <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-wireless-headphones" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">wireless headphones</a> first and foremost, this feels like a weird oversight (and a deviation from older models). Still, on balance, we think they justify the investment &mdash; they're <em>really </em>comfortable.</p><p><strong><em>Battery life:</em></strong> <em>24 hours</em> | <strong><em>Colors:</em></strong> <em> White, black, sandstone, lunar blue</em> </p><hr><h2>Best sound-first headphones: Sony WH-1000XM5</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

The <a href="https://zdcs.link/ovqlA?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Sony%20WH-1000XM5%20headphones&object_type=article&object_uuid=04y8XvRckQxzNTUEBcR4nmm&short_url=ovqlA&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones</a> deliver top-notch ANC and audiophile-level sound quality, with a hefty 30-hour battery life. Their design offers a less expensive alternative to the AirPods Max, for those who like their headphones to sound <em>and</em> look good. </p><h3><strong>Why we picked this: </strong></h3><p>Often, people herald Bose as having the superior ANC but Sony as owning the sound space. Our Deputy Shopping and Reviews Editor Miller Kern definitely noticed that these headphones excelled in the latter arena when she tested them out: "[The sound] is full and clear, and feels like surround sound. I&rsquo;m a big fan of power ballads (I&rsquo;m not allowed to pick the music at parties), and Brandi Carlile&rsquo;s '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOpWqWK0q4U" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Right on Time</u></a>' sounded like it was meant to be listened to on these headphones. The vocals and instruments all got to shine, and the headphones made it feel like I was there in the studio. These are probably the best-sounding headphones I&rsquo;ve ever tried." The Sony companion app equalizer also allows plenty of fine-tuning, and guides the less-audio savvy among us to figure out the settings they prefer with the "find your equalizer" feature.</p><p>The active noise cancellation is also still pretty stellar, despite usually falling second in line to Bose. It'll do a great job of significantly reducing the bulk of noises during a workday, like loud typing or chatty coworkers. The touch controls on the right ear cup can be a bit finicky at first, but once you get the hang of it, are easy to use to start and stop music, as well as adjust the volume. Plus, unlike the Bose Ultras, the Bluetooth connection and multipoint pairing work without a hitch.</p><p>We do wish they folded up so they weren't so bulky to take on the go, but it's a relatively small con compared to the pros, especially if you're planning on wearing these headphones all day long. As for buying advice, these headphones do go on sale less often than others on this list like the Bose QC Ultras, but they also cost less at full price than the Ultras.</p><p><strong><em>Battery life:</em></strong> <em>30 hours</em> | <strong><em>Colors:</em></strong> <em>Black, blue, silver</em></p><hr><h2>Best noise-cancelling earbuds: Apple AirPods Pro</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

It's not uncommon for earbuds to have active noise cancellation, but the AirPods Pro deliver an impressive performance. Plus they're versatile &mdash; whether you like to wear your headphones around the house, on a run, or as you're falling asleep at night, the AirPods Pro fit the bill. For obvious reasons, they're also the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-headphones-for-iphone" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">best headphones for iPhone users</a>.</p><p>As of September 2024, Apple announced two new features to the AirPod Pros, which include a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/hearing-test-airpods-pro" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">hearing test</a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-airpods-pro-hearing-aid-feature" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">hearing aid</a> feature. Both new additions are part of Apple doubling down on hearing health, which may be appealing to users with or concerned about hearing loss.</p><h3><strong>Why we picked this: </strong></h3><p>Last year, Apple finally gave their AirPods Pro a much-needed upgrade in the form of a USB-C charger. Other than the charging port, they're identical to the second-gen Pros released in 2022, which <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-airpods-pro-2-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Mashable Senior Editor Stan Schroeder described as</a> "the first pair of earbuds I'd actually consider taking on an airplane (instead of my much larger and clunkier over-ear headphones)." He went on to say "In some aspects, the active noise cancellation was even better than on my daily drivers: <a href="https://mashable.com/review/bw-px7-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">B&amp;W's excellent PX7</a> over-ear headphones."</p><p>Despite their size and enhanced ANC, the Pro's battery still lasts for up to six hours on a single charge and 30 hours overall with the case. However, it is worth noting that the battery life will noticeably decline after a few years. </p><p>These earbuds are so frequently on sale that we don't recommend buying them at their full $249 price tag. You can often find them at Amazon (and Walmart) marked down to at least $199. If you want a true sale price, we recommend waiting until they hit $189 or lower.</p><p><strong><em>Battery life:</em></strong> <em>6 hours per charge (30 hours with case)</em> | <strong><em>Colors:</em></strong> <em>White</em></p><hr><h2>Best AirPods alternative: Beats Studio Buds + </h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3><strong>Who it's for:</strong></h3><p>If you're into earbuds with good ANC but less into shelling out $249, you'll find your happy medium in the Beats Studio Buds +. There's a reason we've consistently named them the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-airpods" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">best AirPods alternative</a>.</p><h3><strong>Why we picked this: </strong></h3><p>The AirPods Pro are great, but these <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-wireless-earbuds" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">popular wireless earbuds</a> aren't in everyone's budget. These Beats will run you about $80 less (or more, if you catch them on sale), give you some more leeway with color options, integrate just as well into an Apple ecosystem as AirPods, have the same battery life as AirPods, and still deliver pretty good ANC. If you're into a more bass-heavy sound, you'll definitely be happy with them. We've seen them drop down to $129.95 regularly at Amazon, making them an even more affordable AirPod alternative.</p><p>While we didn't find them to be a one-to-one experience during our testing &mdash; you should expect the AirPods to block out more noise, and we missed wireless charging &mdash; they were still incredibly comfortable. We also found them to fit better than AirPods, so if those Apple earbuds usually slip out of your ears, you'll want to try these buds instead. And for Android users, Google Fast Pair makes these earbuds a much better option than AirPods.</p><p>We do want to mention that if $169.95 is still fairly steep, you can also get ANC through <a href="https://zdcs.link/6qpl3?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Amazon%27s%20Echo%20Buds&object_type=article&object_uuid=04y8XvRckQxzNTUEBcR4nmm&short_url=6qpl3&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Amazon's Echo Buds</a> for just $119.99.

Motivating yourself to get through a set of push-ups is hard enough without an earbud popping out. The Beats Fit Pro earbuds are more than up to the task, and they deliver exceptional battery life, sound quality, and a few extras.</p><h3><strong>Why we picked this: </strong></h3><p>Earbuds designed for exercise typically have some sort of wingtip to help hold them in place, but those wingtips can often squeeze uncomfortably on your ears, especially with longer-term use. The small wingtip of these Beats hits the sweet spot &mdash; they're large enough to provide hold, and small enough to be undetectable. Mashable tech reporter Alex Perry writes that the wingtips "result [in] a pair of earbuds that <em>never</em> feel like they're going to fall out and, more importantly, <em>never</em> intrude on your comfort. I've worn these bad boys for six straight hours without any problems. It's hard to ask for more than that." </p><p>Beyond comfort, these earbuds provide an impressive sound profile, including that deep bass that Beats are known for. And of course, as any <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-headphones-for-running-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">workout earbuds</a> should be, these earbuds are sweat and water-resistant with an IPX4 rating. As an added bonus, the Fit Pros also have great active noise cancellation. Although that's by no means essential for a pair of earbuds you'll be wearing while you exercise, it is nice that they have they have fitness-oriented features while being flexible enough to be a great all-around earbud.</p><p>All of these features do together factor into these earbuds $200 price tag, but if you're looking to pay a little less, we recommend waiting for them to go on sale &mdash; with a little patience, you can grab them at Amazon for $20 or $40 off.</p><p><strong><em>Battery life:</em></strong> <em>6 hours (24 hours with case)</em> | <strong><em>Colors:</em></strong> <em>Black, white, coral, gray, purple, blue, yellow, tan, brown, beige</em></p><hr><h2>Best wired earbuds: Marshall Mode</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3><strong>Who it's for:</strong></h3><p>There are a lot of good reasons to consider wired earbuds. Some people simply don't want the hassle of constantly charging their headphones. Fair enough. Some people want impressive audio quality without shelling out $100 or more, and some <a href="https://mashable.com/article/wired-headphones-instagram-account-tiktok" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">simply aren't buying</a> what Big Bluetooth is selling. For shoppers who fall into any of the above groups, we recommend the affordable <a href="https://zdcs.link/846Ad?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Marshall%20Mode%20earbuds&object_type=article&object_uuid=04y8XvRckQxzNTUEBcR4nmm&short_url=846Ad&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Marshall Mode earbuds</a>.</p><h3><strong>Why we picked this: </strong></h3><p>Though they're only $60 (and usually on sale for less than $40), Marshall Mode earbuds deliver better sound than most wireless earbuds that are triple the price. The bass is clear but not overpowering, and the highs bright but never too thin or tinny-sounding. </p><p>As for how you sound on the headphone's built-in mic, friends we spoke to on the phone said we came through with perfect clarity (the same can't be said for our tester's two-and-a-half year old first-generation AirPods Pro). Lower down on the wire is a separate remote, so you can pause and play your audio or hang up your calls without fiddling around with the mic. If you're sensing a theme, these earbuds are well-designed, and that comes through in how they wear and store. </p><p>During our testing, we had no trouble with the wire tangling, and it never felt too long during everyday wear. The buds themselves come with three ear tip sizes and wear comfortably all day. If you're not a fan of the shape of AirPods, then you're likely to find these a better shape for actually keeping your earbuds situated in your ears. There is one major downside with these wired earbuds, however. Unlike their more expensive wired counterparts, Marshall's don't come with a replaceable wire, so you'll want to take extra care to be as gentle as you can with the wire to extend its lifespan.</p><p><strong><em>Battery life:</em></strong> <em>N/A</em> | <strong><em>Colors:</em></strong> <em>Black</em> </p><hr><h2>How we tested the best headphones</h2><p>Over the years, we've tested out a <em>lot </em>of headphones and wireless earbuds at Mashable. To determine the best of the best, and not just pick what's trendy at the moment, we went back through our reviews from former and current tech reporters, editors, and shopping reporters. From JBL and Sony to Samsung and Anker Soundcore, we did our research to make sure we left no major headphone stone unturned, and the result is this guide &mdash; our favorite vetted and tested headphones of 2024. </p><p>All of the headphones in this guide were hands-on tested. In making our selections, we weighed: </p><ul><li><p><strong>Sound: </strong>Since headphones are first and foremost a way for you to listen to audio, if a pair of headphones didn't sound good, they didn't make the list &mdash; that goes for our budget pick, too. </p></li><li><p><strong>Noise cancellation: </strong>These days, some form of noise cancellation is near-essential for any pair of headphones. We prioritized models that feature solid noise cancellation. </p></li><li><p><strong>Comfort: </strong>What's the point of a great pair of headphones if they're too uncomfortable to wear? </p></li><li><p><strong>Customization: </strong>Whether it be for ANC levels, transparency modes, or touch controls, headphones that allow you to adjust the settings will make them feel like they were made for you. </p></li><li><p><strong>Battery life: </strong>Most wireless headphones on the market rely on Bluetooth connectivity, so having a battery you can rely on for at least a few hours of listening time is key. </p></li><li><p><strong>Special features: </strong>When testing headphones and earbuds, we also take into consideration any other special features they offer. For headphones in the $200-plus price range, we expect at least a few special features.</p></li></ul><p>You might notice that the <a href="https://zdcs.link/8j3rw?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20AirPods%20Max&object_type=article&object_uuid=04y8XvRckQxzNTUEBcR4nmm&short_url=8j3rw&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><strong>Apple AirPods Max</strong></a> are missing from our top picks. It's not that we don't like them &mdash; in fact, we think they sound and look great. But <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-airpods-max-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">when we reviewed them</a>, we found that they didn't have a practical storage option, they never really turn off (thus draining the otherwise long battery life), and are just too expensive to justify a wholehearted recommendation. We understand if you like them regardless, but personally, we think there are better options at lower price points. </p><h3>Recent testing updates</h3><p>As of Feb. 2024, two of our former recommendations, the Skullcandy Sesh Evo earbuds and Sennheiser IE 300 have been discontinued. We're in the process of testing new headphones to take their place, and we chose the Marshall Mode earbuds as our new budget pick for earbuds. We also added in the Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones as an upgrade recommendation in March 2024.</p><p>From April to May 2024, we also tested the <a href="https://zdcs.link/8BpW2?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Marshall%20Major%20V&object_type=article&object_uuid=04y8XvRckQxzNTUEBcR4nmm&short_url=8BpW2&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Marshall Major V</a> headphones and <a href="https://zdcs.link/Y0w2r?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Bowers%20%26%20Wilkins%20Px7%20S2&object_type=article&object_uuid=04y8XvRckQxzNTUEBcR4nmm&short_url=Y0w2r&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Bowers &amp; Wilkins Px7 S2</a> headphones, both of which had excellent sound profiles and easy to navigate custom equalizers on their companion apps. Ultimately, they didn't make the cut on our final list for a couple of reasons. With the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/marshall-major-v-headphones" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Major V headphones</a>, we love that their claim of 100+ hours of battery life held up under our testing, but we found them to get uncomfortable after a couple of hours. We also would have appreciated ANC at their $149 price point. </p><p>For the B&amp;W headphones, we loved their design and premium feel in addition to their truly impressive sound, but we found that their ANC was only so-so. If you're willing to spend $399, you can find a better balance of sound and ANC in the Sony XM5 headphones.</p><p>We've also tested the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/sonos-ace-headphones-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Sonos Ace headphones</a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/review/dyson-ontrac-noise-cancelling-headphones" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Dyson OnTrac headphones</a>. And while we loved them both for sound quality and noise cancellation, they fare in the way of AirPods Max &mdash; left out of our recommendations for their high price points.</p><p>As of June 2024, we've removed the Bose QuietComfort 45 headphones as they're officially discontinued and unavailable online. In Aug. 2024, the Bose 700 headphones met the same fate, so we've removed them as our pick for the best noise-cancelling headphones. In their place, we're recommending the Bose QC Ultra headphones, which were formerly our top pick for best premium noise-cancelling headphones.</p><p>In September 2024, Apple announced the release of the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-airpods-4-airpods-max-preorder-price-release-date" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">AirPods 4</a>. While we've yet to test this new generation of AirPods, we're eager to experience their noise cancellation feature, seeing how they stack up against Apple's AirPods Pro.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>What is Connections?</h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <a class="text-gray-600" href="https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1679674590203723778?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(opens in a new window)">

</blockquote>
<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. Like <em>Wordle, </em>you can share the results with your friends on social media.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

Words can be made from linked letters &mdash; up, down, left, right, or diagonal, but words can also change direction, resulting in quirky shapes and patterns. Every single letter in the grid will be part of an answer. There's always a theme linking every solution, along with the "spangram," a special, word or phrase that sums up that day's theme, and spans the entire grid horizontally or vertically.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

The traditional Chinese practice, which involves using a tool to scrape across the skin to treat various illnesses or pain, has exploded in popularity over the past few years with celebrities, influencers, and skincare fans raving about the beauty benefits. As countless gua sha tools have emerged claiming to deliver incredible results, it can be hard to tell which tools are worth the investment versus those that are jumping on the beauty bandwagon.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

Marketed as a &ldquo;next generation&rdquo; tool, this device pairs the form factor of traditional gua sha with added heat, vibration, and red light therapy, making it the ultimate all-in-one beauty tool for those looking to make the most out of their gua sha practice. But is it actually effective?&nbsp;</p><h2>First impressions of the ProSculpt Gua Sha</h2><p>Straight out of the box, I wasn&rsquo;t super impressed with the ProSculpt Gua Sha. The lightweight device features a plastic casing, with a removable lid over the stainless steel massage tool. With a single button to toggle between four different settings and a covered USB charging port, it&rsquo;s shaped like many of the stone or metal gua sha tools available today, but the light plastic exterior makes it feel a little cheap.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The device itself is easy to use &mdash; just press the power button, and it comes roaring to life in the vibration and red light mode, and it&rsquo;s a simple click to toggle between the other three modes: heat and red light; heat and vibration; and heat, vibration, and red light. I tried each of the different modes, but I mostly stuck with the last one since it was so different from my trusty rose quartz gua sha tool, and I wanted to see if the added features would be worth the upgrade.&nbsp;</p><p>From there, the device works like any other gua sha tool. I followed the brief instructions in the manual, applying my favorite facial oil to my skin before starting the process, and gently scraping the device across my face, neck, and jawline with light to medium pressure.&nbsp;</p><h2>What I liked about it: Heat and battery life</h2><p>First, I was surprised by how much I liked the added heat benefit of the gua sha tool. It took a few seconds to warm up, but it felt amazing on my skin &mdash; especially after a long day. One of my favorite ways to use the tool was to massage the area between my eyebrows, where I tend to carry a lot of facial tension, and the heat made the massage feel even better.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The device also held its charge pretty well, so I didn&rsquo;t need to charge it very often. Plus, I liked having the little plastic lid so I could store it without worrying about getting it dirty. Unfortunately, what I liked about the device pretty much stopped there.</p><h2>What I didn&rsquo;t like: Poor design and questionable benefits</h2><p>There are countless skincare devices on the market claiming to different technologies to boost your skin&rsquo;s health and appearance, and &mdash; while some are effective &mdash; others feel more like gimmicks. And, as much as I liked the added heat provided by the ProSculpt Gua Sha, it fell into the latter category for me.&nbsp;</p><p>The longer I used the tool, the hotter the device got &mdash; uncomfortably so &mdash; until I was worried it might damage my skin. The vibration feature which claims to use 8,000 rpm micro-vibrations to &ldquo;shake up sluggish skin cells&rdquo;, didn&rsquo;t really feel good or bad &mdash; nor did I feel like it was doing anything. And, while red light therapy is certainly a popular skincare technique that boasts potential <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22114-red-light-therapy" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>benefits</u></a> like treating wrinkles, acne, scarring, and more, the built-in red light was incredibly dim. It also sat behind the metal plate, pointing outward more than downward, so the light was further away and didn&rsquo;t really feel like it was penetrating my skin.&nbsp;</p><p>Plus, the device was incredibly hard to keep clean. Because I was using facial oil to help the device glide over my skin, the oil ended up all over the device &mdash; not just the metal massage plate &mdash; and it ended up sticky and covered in grime even after wiping it clean.&nbsp;</p><h2>Is the ProSculpt Gua Sha worth it?&nbsp;</h2><p>Honestly, this device is a hard pass for me. I love gua sha, and I think it&rsquo;s an incredibly effective technique &mdash; in the past, it&rsquo;s helped depuff my face, reduce facial tension, and improve my skin&rsquo;s overall appearance &mdash; but those benefits happened with just a simple rose quartz gua sha. And if I want the benefits of red light therapy, I'll reach for my <a href="https://mashable.com/review/solawave-skincare-wand" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Solawave wand</a> over this tool.</p><p>Yes, technically, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKDlrn?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=ProSculpt%20Gua%20Sha&object_type=review&object_uuid=045V2cfjsQciGsDKUcK6BYo&short_url=QKDlrn&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">ProSculpt Gua Sha</a> &ldquo;worked&rdquo; when it comes to the benefits of gua sha. My face was less puffy, my neck and facial tension were reduced, and it was a great way to relax at the end of the day&hellip;but it didn&rsquo;t feel much different from a traditional gua sha tool. The heat felt nice, but none of the other features felt like they did anything. I didn&rsquo;t notice any improvements that were better than any other gua sha tool, so it didn&rsquo;t feel worth the $45 price tag.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>Though the thrill of being in space is undoubtedly enough for Polaris Dawn's crew, today's spacewalk does have a purpose. Polaris Dawn's spacewalk will be the first outing of SpaceX's Extravehicular Activity (EVA) suit, with the civilian crew putting it to the test.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://x.com/SpaceX/status/1786759044948189202" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Unveiled this May</a>, the EVA suits build on the Intravehicular Activity (IVA) suits previously worn by those aboard Crew Dragon spaceflights. The EVA's 3D-printed helmet includes an updated visor designed to reduce glare, as well as a new heads-up display and camera. This can show wearers information on their suit's pressure, temperature, and relative humidity.</p><p>"Developed with mobility in mind, SpaceX teams incorporated new materials, fabrication processes, and novel joint designs to provide greater flexibility to astronauts in pressurized scenarios while retaining comfort for unpressurized scenarios," <a href="https://www.spacex.com/updates" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">SpaceX wrote in May.</a> "The suit also incorporates enhancements for reliability and redundancy during a spacewalk, adding seals and pressure valves to help ensure the suit remains pressurized and the crew remains safe."</p><p>The EVA's design is also intended to be scalable in order to allow people of different sizes and body types to venture into space.

<p>What follows is certainly not for everyone. Some critics I spoke with at TIFF complained that Oppenheimer's musical is indulgent in its runtime, ugly in its relentless blue-gray palette, and even infuriating in its plotting. Others see the length, the dismal colors, and that frustrating plot to be precisely the point, and embrace it as such. I am in the latter camp, finding this mournful and fanciful musical utterly captivating, jarringly funny, and savagely profound.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>The End </em>is doomsday prepping by way of <em>Downton Abbey.</em></h2><p>Forget what you think you know about bunkers. Deep, deep underground this family &mdash; whose names are never uttered &mdash; has built something not metal and cold but very old-money. Housed within a cavernous salt mine with spiraling walls and noisy ventilation systems lies their home away from apocalypse. It contains crown molding, classic works of art in gilded frames, a wood-paneled library, a grand dining room, a complicated model train set-up, an inexplicably endless food supply, and above all, pristine order down to the paper-flower bouquets arranged in delicate vases.</p><p>Here, a 25-year-old man born in the bunker (George MacKay) has only ever known his doting mother (Tilda Swinton), his chummy father (Michael Shanon), their devoted butler (Tim McInnerny), a cheeky chef (Bronagh Gallagher), and a dour doctor (Lennie James). And despite possibly being the last people on Earth, they seem happy enough, singing songs of gratitude for their circumstances. Well, when they're not conducting dramatic emergency drills, that is. (You can never be too careful.)</p><div id="related-video" class="mx-auto mt-8 mb-12 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans md:mt-12 md:mb-16 text-primary-400">

</div>
<p>The absurdity of their profound privilege is made all the clearer when an above-ground survivor (Moses Ingram) stumbles upon them. Understandably, she is utterly bewildered by all they possess while people on the surface scrape and starve. The political commentary only gets more overt as this young Black woman hears the selective history the white son's been taught, like how the oil industry that made its fortune definitely didn't contribute to the climate crisis that forced the family underground as they left everyone else to burn! With a cocked eyebrow and a patient tone, she not only pushes back on this propaganda but also brings a dry humor to the household.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>The End </em>offers a bleak view with winsome song and dance.</h2><p>While the son is in awe of the stranger, who speaks openly about her own regrets and urges the others to do the same, a raw tension emerges between her and the mother, who would rather the family's skeletons stay neatly tucked away in the closet, thank you very much. Anxieties rise as a romance blooms between the son and the stranger. Happily for us, this leads to a charming duet and a dance number where salt is kicked about the mines, which sit cold and unimpressed by the pair's passion. Such energy surrounded by the towering, uncaring setting echoes <a href="https://mashable.com/article/west-side-story-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>West Side Story</em></a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/west-side-story-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">.</a> But with nowhere to escape but a dying world above, where can this story go?&nbsp;</p><p>Oppenheimer and co-writer Rasmus Heisterberg mire the audience in the push-and-pull between the mother's strategic repression and the stranger's emotional outbursts. Reflecting her character's emotional strain, Swinton sings in a shrill falsetto, as if her mother might crack at any moment. MacKay has a Broadway-bright performance style, while Ingram delivers soulful ballads of loss and hope. Shannon and McInnerny join in with vaguely vaudevillian numbers of tap and banter, but the jocularity of this bit is undercut by the father cruelly reminding his butler buddy of his rank.</p><q>
    'The End' traps us in a ruthless loop, where its core family risks change or growth, only to deny it. 
    </q>
<p>Trapped in this beautiful bunker under unblinking blue light, they are all specimens trapped under glass. Here are the last people on Earth, preserved but without purpose, objects in a museum of their own making. Still, there are moments where it seems these characters might just break out &mdash;&nbsp;not of the bunker but from the pretty molds they've built to survive in the guise of civility. A brutal verbal battle in the parents' bathroom gives Shannon's signature intensity a place to explode. Swinton's eyes, bright and on the brink of tears, show the deep hurt hiding behind this mother's practiced smile. MacKay, with a frantic enthusiasm that trembles into nerve-rattling, seems often on the brink of breaking this cycle of deranged self-mythologizing. But then Oppenheimer will quick-cut to some time later, when the drama has passed and routine has reasserted itself. The tension is bled out, and we bleed with it.</p><p><em>The End </em>traps us in a ruthless loop, where its core family risks change or growth, only to deny it. Both those who liked and loathed the film agree this cycle makes for a very frustrating viewing experience. But this feels intentional. As he did in his two Oscar&ndash;nominated documentaries, <em>The Look of Silence </em>and <em>The Act of Killing</em>, Oppenheimer is itching his way under our skin with incredible artistry to expose the revolting reality of human capabilities &mdash; not just what horrors we can do to each other, but also what we can ignore to maintain even a fragile sense of civility.&nbsp;</p><p>In <em>The End,</em> even as the director presents us with people who have done horrible things, Oppenheimer doesn't lose empathy for them. While their lies are abundant, this incredible cast makes their pain feel real, so even in spite of our vexations or political opinions, you might well ache for the mother who fears she's losing her son. And yet &mdash;&nbsp;as absurd as this sounds &mdash; the most devastating line in the whole movie is about cake. Literal cake.&nbsp;</p><p>Defying expectations of genre, both musical and apocalypse narrative, <em>The End </em>is a challenge thrown down to audiences. The songs and dances are not glistening perfection, but occasionally clunky or tinny. But this works because each instance is a reflection of that character, and where they fall short of their projection of perfection and happiness. The suffocatingly dull colors bleach the rosiness out of flushed cheeks, making everything feel vaguely dead, or maybe even embalmed. The film's plot leads to a place that is well earned and yet hard to bear. Yet it's thrilling to see a musical take so many risks, especially when movie studios seem afraid to even promote that a movie <em>is </em>a musical.

<p>With that in mind, yes, the digital-only PS5 Slim is a money-saver in comparison to the one with a disc drive, but <strong>not </strong>in comparison to the digital-only model that launched three years ago. </p><p>The new price also means that buying a digital model before purchasing the additional disc drive would cost <em>more</em> than just snagging the version with a built-in drive. I don't really have a good explanation for that.</p><p>My only advice is this: If you want a PS5 that only costs $399, you better get one now. This is an important note: <strong>Once the existing stock of both original models sells out, the new slim models will replace them on store shelves. </strong></p><h2><strong>PS5 vs PS5 Slim: size</strong></h2><p>Obviously, size is what many gamers are most concerned about here, so let's get right to it. Looking at Sony's stated dimensions, you can see that the new PS5 is indeed smaller than the original:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Original PS5 (disc version)</strong>: 104mm (height) x 390mm (width) x 260mm (depth)</p></li><li><p><strong>PS5 Slim (disc version):</strong> 96mm (height) x 358mm (width) x 216mm (depth)</p></li></ul><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h2><strong>PS5 vs PS5 Slim: performance and storage</strong></h2><p>Another important aspect of the new PS5 models to get out of the way is that they have the exact same internal capabilities as the originals. This isn't a PS4 vs. PS4 Pro situation. Games will run exactly the same across the spectrum of PS5 consoles.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>One little internal bonus that owners of the new PS5s get, however, comes in the form of expanded storage. For some reason, the original PS5 only had 825GB of onboard storage, with the option to expand via external SSDs. The new ones have a full 1TB of built-in space, so you can install a few extra games depending on how big they are.</p><h2><strong>PS5 vs PS5 Slim: disc drive</strong></h2><p>Just like at the PS5's launch in late 2020, there are two PS5 Slim models. One of them has a built-in disc drive and the other one is digital-only.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>You may be thinking, "If the iPhone 16 Pro Max's display is nearly 7 inches big, will it feel awkward in my hands?" The answer is no.

      <description><![CDATA['Better Man' review: English singer-songwriter Robbie Williams is a chimp for all seasons in new biopic.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/06s8SNImJskQsTCVSQjfLvB/hero-image.jpg" alt="Robbie Williams attends the "Better Man" Canadian Premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 09, 2024."><p>Cheers to Robbie Williams. The English singer-songwriter who made the leap from boy band to tabloid target to record-breaking solo artist has delivered once again. <em>Better Man </em>is a biopic that folds in hits from across his career &mdash;&nbsp;including "Angels," "She's the One," and "Rock DJ" &mdash;&nbsp;to bolster the artist&rsquo;s highs and lows. But Williams &mdash; in collaboration with writer/director Michael Gracey (<em>The Greatest Showman</em>) &mdash;&nbsp;has done something daring in the space of the music biopic, which has too often proved <a href="https://mashable.com/article/bob-marley-one-love-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>achingly clich</u></a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/bob-marley-one-love-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">&eacute;</a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/bob-marley-one-love-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>d</u></a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/back-to-black-amy-winehouse-movie-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>pandering</u></a>, or downright dull. He's turned himself into a literal dancing monkey.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Better Man</em> unfurls a tale of Williams' hardscrabble youth in Stoke-on-Trent, his bad-boy years in the British group Take That, his substance abuse issues, rocky romance with a fellow pop star, celebrity feuds, and family dramas, all while portraying the singer as a CGI chimpanzee in the vein of the <em>Planet of the Apes</em> reboots. At first, it might seem a cheeky gimmick (or cheeky monkey) meant to hook audiences with the sheer oddness of the choice. But Gracey nurtures this concept, weaving together a collaborative performance with actors and the legendary VFX studio W&#275;t&#257; FX to create a uniquely moving portrait of an artist at war with himself.&nbsp;</p><p>While the cadences of Williams' story fall into a familiar pattern, allowing himself to be presented as a literal animal brings a fresh perspective and an enthralling blend of humor and vulnerability. This results in the best music biopic since the rousing splendor of Elton John's <em>Rocketman</em> (which Gracey notably executive produced).&nbsp;</p><h2>Who plays Robbie Williams in <em>Better Man</em>?&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>This is a complicated question. Williams lends his voice to the narration, the words of which were penned by Gracey, Oliver Cole, and Simon Gleeson from interviews with the sensational singer. However, in the flesh, English actor Jonno Davies (<em>Hunters</em>) shoulders the role, blending a physicality that is part hulking chimpanzee and part swaggering sex symbol. While everyone around him on set is in period costume, Davies wore a motion-capture suit with a small camera perched above his face to track his expressions. From there, W&#275;t&#257; built chimp Robbie using Williams' own eyes (and various hairstyles) as inspiration. And the final touch: a voice that mixes Davies' and Williams' performances. All this blends seamlessly into a powerful performance that is one of the most surprising yet riveting of the year.&nbsp;</p><p>In the narration, Williams introduces himself with a smirking tone and a slew of insults that have been lobbed against him. Davies picks up that rough exterior with macho posturing, but complicates it with goofball bravado in churlish outbursts, juvenile gestures, and a self-pleasuring bit that's lewdly hilarious. But more than funny, <em>Better Man </em>is riveting because it embraces a warts-and-all approach that doesn't shy away from Williams' darkest moments.&nbsp;</p><p>You might think that scenes about drug use, infidelity, and self-harm would be undercut by this furry gimmick. But by the end of the first sequence &mdash; in which a young Robert (Jack Sherran) has a rough day at the playground &mdash; the chimp device makes sense. The animation W&#275;t&#257; created is so emotive, the performance behind it so grounded, that it just works, not only in moments of drama, but also in truly epic musical numbers.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Better Man </em>is stuffed with showstopping song and dance.&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>As in <em>Rocketman</em>, Gracey employs songs anachronistically. For instance, Take That's rise to fame is backed by "Rock DJ," which is a hit from Williams' solo career. This is not a glitch but a feature, as both films focus on the feeling of their story over cumbersome facts. This freedom to play Williams' hits as they make sense in the story (versus when they came in his life) allows for electrifying sequences of joy, agony, and romance.&nbsp;</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p><br>In the case of "Rock DJ," the young band celebrates their record deal by dancing together through several locations, from posh shops and double-decker buses to the streets of Piccadilly Circus, collecting more and more revelers along the way until the whole of London appears to share in their reveling. While this is perhaps the most ambitious musical sequence, among the most moving is "She's the One," where chimp Robbie performs a heartfelt duet while dancing a Golden Era ballroom number and dipping his female partner (Raechelle Banno) with eloquence that is utterly swoon-worthy. Yes, even when the leading man is a chimp.&nbsp;</p><p>However, not every song is a celebration. And it's in moments of anxiety that <em>Better Man'</em>s monkey gambit is most impactful.&nbsp;</p><h2>Robbie Williams' self-saboteur is made literal.</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

    </div>
<p>Embracing the visual language of music videos (of which Gracey has directed many), <em>Better Man </em>blends realistic settings with surreal scenarios. So a car crash in the rain results in a nightmare sequence where chimp Robbie is plunged underwater, then swarmed by fans who tear at him for mementos and paparazzi whose blinding cameras make his struggle to the surface all the harder. More traditional moments are in the mix, like a montage of Williams' magazine covers and music videos to chart his rising fame. But what might be a barrage of nostalgic or clich&eacute;d concert scenes is given fresh blood through bringing more chimp Robbies into frame.&nbsp;</p><p>When he looks out into the crowd roaring in appreciation, among them he sees himself, scowling. At first, it's one or two of his own faces staring back at him. But as Robbie's self-doubt grows, his self-saboteur, who hisses he's a failure, a fraud, unlovable, multiplies and becomes legion. The sharp cuts from the dancing chimp with his performative grin to the snarling doppelg&auml;ngers, all reminders of an embarrassment or failure, hit like a gasp. Even when the world seems to be at his feet, Robbie is running from himself. And this builds to an internal war made external through a brilliantly vicious battle scene&nbsp; that gives <em>Planet of the Apes</em> a run for its money.&nbsp;</p><p>This poignant use of CGI animation is also surrounded by a terrific supporting cast. Whether it&rsquo;s Steve Pemberton as Williams&rsquo; conniving deadbeat dad or Alison Steadman as his devoted grandmother, the actors bring a pulsing authenticity that makes this family, broken as it is, feel achingly real. This is all the more impressive considering they were acting opposite an actor wearing all that mo-cap gear. Together, cast and crew build a glorious complex look into the life a world-class entertainer whose arrogance and vulnerability are on balanced display. The result is a film that feels grandiose, outrageous, deeply personal, and joltingly relatable. It&rsquo;s <em>Billy Elliot </em>meets <em>Rocketman</em> meets <em>Planet of the Apes</em>. And it&rsquo;s so much more.&nbsp;</p><p>Rich in vibrant emotion, body-rocking musical numbers, daring performances, and a scorching tenderness, <em>Better Man</em> more than rocks. It rules.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Better Man </em>was reviewed out of its Canadian Premiere at the 2024 Toronto International Film Festival. Paramount has acquired distribution rights; a release plan is TBD.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

Here's what we know so far about iPhone 17.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>A new model?</h2><p>Easily the biggest potential iPhone 17 development that we've heard about so far involves a new addition to the iPhone family. According to multiple sources, including analyst <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/%E9%97%9C%E6%96%BC2h25%E6%96%B0%E6%AC%BEiphone-17%E7%94%A2%E5%93%81%E7%B5%84%E5%90%88%E8%88%87%E8%B6%85%E8%96%84iphone-17%E7%9A%84%E9%A0%90%E6%B8%AC%E8%88%87%E5%88%86%E6%9E%90-predictions-and-analysis-of-the-2h25-new-iphone-17-1528d0772610" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> and <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-plans-a-thinner-iphone-in-2025" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">The Information</a>, Apple plans to get rid of the Plus model and put a new, thinner iPhone in its place. Folks have called it "iPhone 17 Slim" or "iPhone 17 Air," though we don't know what its official name will be just yet. </p><p>This new slim iPhone would reportedly be much thinner than existing iPhones and feature a display somewhere in the neighborhood of 6.5 or 6.6-inches in size. There's not much else to say about it yet, however, as different sources disagree on what this phone actually is. The Information says it will be the most expensive and high-end phone in the new lineup, while Kuo says that won't be the case. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>We'll have to wait for a while to find out more.</p><h2>ProMotion for all</h2><p>One thing Apple typically does when there's a new generation of iPhones is add features that used to be exclusive to the Pro models to the new base models. It seems that ProMotion is next.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/iphone-17-always-on-promotion-displays/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">MacRumors</a>, all four iPhone 17 models will feature 120Hz refresh rates thanks to ProMotion display technology. This is a godsend that is not quite on the same level as Apple finally adding USB-C ports to iPhones, but it's not far off, either. Apple's base-level iPhones have been stuck on 60Hz displays for years, while competitors like <a href="https://mashable.com/review/google-pixel-9" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Google</a> have bumped even their budget handsets up past 90hz or more. </p><p>It's one of the main ways in which base model iPhones have felt outdated for a while, so ideally, Apple will fix this soon.</p><h2>A19 chips</h2><p>There isn't much info about this yet, but Apple <em>always</em> includes newer and faster chips in at least its Pro iPhone models every year. The iPhone 16 Pro models feature an A18 Pro chip, for example, which is new for this year. </p><p>As such, we can reasonably expect to see some kind of A19 chip in the new iPhones. If precedent matters at all, it might only be in the iPhone 17 Pro models, while the regular iPhone 17 gets a slightly older chip. However, Apple does weird things all the time, so who knows what will happen when it comes to chips next year.</p><h2>A better selfie camera</h2><p>While selfies taken on iPhones never look bad, necessarily, they could always be better. Rumors indicate the iPhone 17 will help out with that.</p><p>According to Apple analyst Jeff Pu (via <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/02/iphone-17-24mp-front-camera-rumor/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">MacRumors</a>), all four new iPhone 17s will have a 24MP front-facing camera, up from 12MP on the iPhone 16 models. Who knows yet how much this will actually improve things, but that's a hefty increase. </p><h2>Other camera upgrades</h2><p>In another report by Kuo, the prominent Apple prognosticator said that the iPhone 17 Pro Max (at least) will have a trio of 48MP camera lenses on the rear for the first time. The wide, ultra-wide, and telephoto lenses will all be 48MP next year, in comparison to the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max, both of which only have 12MP telephoto lenses. </p><p>Hopefully, that means even deeper levels of zoom, too.</p>]]></content:encoded>

"><p>Facebook is reportedly taking down important safety information as wildfire season spreads across the western part of the country. </p><p>An investigation by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/09/10/facebook-is-blocking-emergency-warnings-wildfires-roar-through-west/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>The Washington Post</em></a> found dozens of instances of the tech giant flagging and removing posts since June, in areas that saw a total of 20 active fires. Posts often contained links or screenshots from the fire safety app <a href="https://www.watchduty.org/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Watch Duty</a>, for example, a nonprofit resource that provides live alerts of wildfire movements. Daily posts from federal and state agencies, such as Cal Fire, warning residents in fire-prone California towns were also removed &mdash; including those made on dedicated fire update pages. </p><p>Many of these takedowns affect small town community pages, vital resources for live updates and information sharing. According to the publication, volunteer responders, fire and sheriff departments, news stations, and disaster nonprofit workers have also been targeted with takedowns across multiple states.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

        </a>
    </div>
<p>Facebook's automatic explanation for the removals implies the posts have been taken down not for spreading misinformation, but for violating <a href="https://transparency.meta.com/policies/community-standards/spam/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">community spam guidelines</a>: "It looks like you tried to get likes, follows, shares or video views in a misleading way," the reports told users. The <em>Post</em> found that most of the targeted takedown involved external links, even those to official, government sources. Another problem: None of the users were notified that their posts were removed. </p><p>Facebook has long been faced blowback for its role in spreading deceptive information and posts, and now works with third-party experts to combat political and public health misinformation, including spotlighting reputable sources. As the platform's <a href="https://transparency.meta.com/policies/community-standards/misinformation" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">misinformation policy reads</a>: "We remove misinformation where it is likely to directly contribute to the risk of imminent physical harm...We focus on slowing the spread of hoaxes and viral misinformation, and directing users to authoritative information." But its Community Guidelines, under which these posts are removed, are more broad. "We seek to prevent abusive tactics, such as spreading deceptive links to draw unsuspecting users in through misleading functionality or code, or impersonating a trusted domain," the platform writes. "Online spam is a lucrative industry."</p><p>Across the site, posts frequently slip through the platform's moderation gates, or are unfairly taken down and then reinstated, but emergency and fire workers told the <em>Post</em> that the problem has escalated in recent months &mdash; and in this case it could threaten lives. Facebook spokesperson Erin McPike told the publication that the company is "investigating this issue and working quickly to address it.&rdquo;</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>Football season's not a bad time to finally make that TV upgrade you've been fantasizing about, and The Frame is a worthy splurge. Samsung's viral "art when it's off" QLED TV has a matte display that diminishes distracting glares and dual LED backlighting, which offers more balanced color and brightness across the entire screen than traditional edge lighting. All sizes are on sale, but the 75-inch model has the highest discount (at $500 off). If you have an old TV to get rid of, you can save another $50 by letting Samsung pick it up and <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3bkBE?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=recycle%20it%20for%20you&object_type=article&object_uuid=03ft2irXzf1LRTnKdsAd6s2&short_url=z3bkBE&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">recycle it for you</a>.</p><h3>More TVs on sale</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/92bDDY?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%2065-inch%20QN90C%204K%20QLED%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=03ft2irXzf1LRTnKdsAd6s2&short_url=92bDDY&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung 65-inch QN90C 4K QLED TV</a> &mdash;&nbsp;<strong>$1,399.99</strong> <s>$2,799.99</s> (save $1,400)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/a0XNor?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%2065-inch%20S90C%204K%20OLED%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=03ft2irXzf1LRTnKdsAd6s2&short_url=a0XNor&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung 65-inch S90C 4K OLED TV</a> &mdash;&nbsp;<strong>$1,499.99</strong> <s>$2,599.99</s> (save $1,100)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/z6bqnj?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%2065-inch%20The%20Terrace%204K%20QLED%20Full%20Sun%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=03ft2irXzf1LRTnKdsAd6s2&short_url=z6bqnj&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung 65-inch The Terrace 4K QLED Full Sun TV</a> &mdash;&nbsp;<strong>$6,499.99</strong> <s>$9,999.99</s> (save $3,500)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/ak7XPw?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%2077-inch%20S90D%204K%20OLED%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=03ft2irXzf1LRTnKdsAd6s2&short_url=ak7XPw&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung 77-inch S90D 4K OLED TV</a> &mdash;<strong>&nbsp;$2,599.99</strong> <s>$3,699.99</s> (save $1,100)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qdd5YM?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%2086-inch%20QN900D%208K%20OLED%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=03ft2irXzf1LRTnKdsAd6s2&short_url=Qdd5YM&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung 86-inch QN900D 8K OLED TV</a> &mdash; <strong>$6,499.99</strong> <s>$7,999.99</s> (save $1,500)</p></li></ul><h2>Best tablet deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>The super solid Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 was already an easy choice if you're simply in the market for an entry-level Android tablet. That choice is even easier when the version with beefier memory and storage is on sale for less than $800. The model featured here has 12GB RAM and 256GB of storage (versus the $649.99 version with 8GB RAM and 128GB of storage) and is WiFi only.</p><p>"Entry level" doesn't feel so "entry level" when any content you stream or graphic designs you whip up are displayed so vividly on Samsung's Dynamic AMOLED 2X screens. The "2X" refers to the screen's ability to jump from 60Hz to 120Hz during gaming &mdash;&nbsp;a nearly lag-less experience not often had on tablets in this price range. This Galaxy Tab S9 comes the S Pen stylus, Transcript Assist using Galaxy AI, as well as two free months of Adobe Lightroom and Adobe Express (both a $19.98 value each).</p><h3>More tablets on sale</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/znO8wy?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%20Galaxy%20Tab%20A9%2B%20%284GB%20RAM%2C%2064GB%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=03ft2irXzf1LRTnKdsAd6s2&short_url=znO8wy&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ (4GB RAM, 64GB)</a> &mdash;&nbsp;<strong>$169.99</strong> <s>$219.99</s> (save $50)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/9Ydkmx?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%20Galaxy%20Tab%20S9%20FE%20%286GB%20RAM%2C%20128GB%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=03ft2irXzf1LRTnKdsAd6s2&short_url=9Ydkmx&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE (6GB RAM, 128GB)</a> &mdash;&nbsp;<strong>$349.99</strong> <s>$449.99</s> (save $100)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/aepMqX?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%20Galaxy%20Tab%20S9%20FE%2B%20%288GB%20RAM%2C%20128GB%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=03ft2irXzf1LRTnKdsAd6s2&short_url=aepMqX&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ (8GB RAM, 128GB)</a> &mdash;&nbsp;<strong>$469.99</strong> <s>$599.99</s> (save $130)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/QrpO85?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%20Galaxy%20Tab%20S9%2B%20%2812GB%20RAM%2C%20256GB%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=03ft2irXzf1LRTnKdsAd6s2&short_url=QrpO85&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ (12GB RAM, 256GB)</a> &mdash;&nbsp;<strong>$829.99</strong> <s>$999.99</s> (save $170)</p></li></ul><h2>Best laptop deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>If your space doesn't have room for both a TV and a nice desktop setup, opting for a smart streaming monitor from Samsung means you don't have to choose between them. The 43-inch M7 can be operated via mouse and keyboard or remote, eliminating the need for strategically wrangling adapters and dongles. Samsung's smart TV platform and Gaming Hub are built right in, too, so the switchover from work to entertainment is as quick as switching apps.</p><h3>More monitors on sale</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/aDVbPg?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%2027-inch%20ViewFinity%20S8%204K%20Monitor&object_type=article&object_uuid=03ft2irXzf1LRTnKdsAd6s2&short_url=aDVbPg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung 27-inch ViewFinity S8 4K Monitor</a> &mdash;&nbsp;<strong>$279.99</strong> <s>$399.99</s> (save $120)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/9g3e6D?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%2032-inch%20Odyssey%20QHD%20Gaming%20Monitor&object_type=article&object_uuid=03ft2irXzf1LRTnKdsAd6s2&short_url=9g3e6D&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung 32-inch Odyssey QHD Gaming Monitor</a> &mdash;&nbsp;<strong>$299.99</strong> <s>$429.99</s> (save $130)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/a0XYk3?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%2032-inch%20Odyssey%20Neo%20G7%204K%20Curved%20Gaming%20Monitor&object_type=article&object_uuid=03ft2irXzf1LRTnKdsAd6s2&short_url=a0XYk3&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung 32-inch Odyssey Neo G7 4K Curved Gaming Monitor</a> &mdash;<strong> $599.99</strong> <s>$1,099.99</s> (save $500)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/QVDrPN?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%2049-inch%20Odyssey%20G9%20OLED%20Gaming%20Monitor&object_type=article&object_uuid=03ft2irXzf1LRTnKdsAd6s2&short_url=QVDrPN&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung 49-inch Odyssey G9 OLED Gaming Monitor</a> &mdash;&nbsp;<strong>$1,099.99</strong> <s>$1,799.99</s> (save $700) + free 24-inch Odyssey G3 FHD Gaming Monitor</p></li></ul><h2>Best vacuum deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>Samsung's chic cordless stick vacuum comes with a cleaning station that doubles as a charging dock and a place to dump its dustbin with the press of a button. (There aren't any Dyson stick vacuums that come with this kind of accessory, and if there were, they'd definitely cost more than $500.) It can run for up to 60 minutes at a time, and its Jet Dual Brush works on both carpets and hard surfaces &mdash;&nbsp;no need to swap accessories mid-clean. You can get it in a misty white or midnight blue finish.</p><h3>More vacuums on sale</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/zEVoDP?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%20Bespoke%20Jet%20Bot%20Combo%20Robot%20Vacuum%20and%20Mop&object_type=article&object_uuid=03ft2irXzf1LRTnKdsAd6s2&short_url=zEVoDP&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung Bespoke Jet Bot Combo Robot Vacuum and Mop</a> &mdash;<strong> $1,119.99</strong> <s>$1,399.99</s> (save $280)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/avxLw7?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%20Bespoke%20Jet%20Bot%20Combo%20AI%20Robot%20Vacuum%20and%20Mop&object_type=article&object_uuid=03ft2irXzf1LRTnKdsAd6s2&short_url=avxLw7&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung Bespoke Jet Bot Combo AI Robot Vacuum and Mop</a> &mdash; <strong>$1,349.99</strong> <s>$1,699.99</s> (save $350)</p></li></ul><h2>Best smartphone deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

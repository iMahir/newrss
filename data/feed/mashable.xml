Users will interact with the wingman like a chatbot. Currently, a small group of users is testing the feature, Grindr's CEO George Arison said in an interview with <em>WSJ</em>. The group will expand to 1,000 users by the end of 2024 and 10,000 in 2025. The plan is for the chatbot to be available to Grindr's 14 million users by 2027 at the latest, Arison told <em>WSJ</em>.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>The wingman will apparently keep track of users' favorite matches and make suggestions ranging from long-term relationship candidates to date spots. Later on, the wingman may be able to make restaurant reservations and converse with other wingman bots so users have a "robust view" of each other by the time they meet in person, <em>WSJ </em>reported.</p><p>The <em>Wall Street Journal </em>listed some preliminary issues with this idea. For one, Grindr needs to ensure this won't be a privacy and safety risk in areas where it isn't safe to be outwardly gay. Furthermore, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/grindr-user-data-has-been-for-sale-for-years-11651492800" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Grindr sold user location data through ad networks</a> for years, and AI data could pose another privacy risk. </p><p><em>WSJ </em>claims a solution will be an "empathetic AI technology" through AI model company <a href="https://exh.ai/#home" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Ex-human</a>, which Grindr made a deal with last year. The model Ex-human creates will be trained on romantic conversation and made "more gay." It's unclear how these models will solve these potential privacy concerns. Grindr is also in a lawsuit in the UK about <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj7mxnvz42no" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">revealing users' HIV status</a>.</p><p>Besides these possible issues, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/as-grindr-complaints-rise-gay-dating-apps-scruff-jackd-taimi-swoop-in" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Grindr users are currently frustrated with the app</a> due to growing product issues and paywalls. In a statement to Mashable earlier this month concerning this frustration, a Grindr spokesperson said, "Since a major investment in modernizing our chat platform earlier this year, we are aware that our users have experienced technical challenges on Grindr." </p><p>It remains to be seen, then, how the app's infrastructure will contend with the introduction of a chatbot, and also how Grindr users will react to it.

<p>Although the Holiday Deals event is open to all customers, Walmart+ members will get early access and can start shopping 12 hours earlier than non-members.

You can generally expect the mopping technique to get a little more meticulous as price goes up, so the <em>type</em> of mess that your 2-in-1 model will need to conquer becomes a big deciding factor. Are you mostly concerned with wiping up spur-of-the-moment spills, or will you be a stickler about dried-on stains that call for more heavy-duty scrubbing?</p><p>Fortunately, both ends of the pricing spectrum provide way more bang for their buck in 2024 than they did in the early 2020s.

<p>This shift is particularly exemplified in the fleet of new hybrid robot vacs released at <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ces-2024-robot-vacuums" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">CES 2024</a>, where a new standard for the future of mopping robot vacuums was set. The best robot hybrids will also cross post-mopping maintenance off of your list by automatically washing and drying their own mopping pads, turning the self-empty dock into a full self-cleaning station. With one of these self-cleaning models, your robovac will be ready to mop again almost immediately &mdash;&nbsp;a clutch change from older, more basic designs that required you to toss soggy mopping pads in the washing machine after every use.</p><h2>Is Prime Day a good time to buy a robot vacuum?</h2><p>Yep, one of the best times of year to do so. This is particularly true for more premium robot vacuum hybrids (like the full self-cleaning ones I just mentioned above) &mdash;&nbsp;while most 2-in-1 models that wash their own mopping pads usually run you at least $700 (but probably more) any other time, <a href="https://mashable.com/category/prime-day" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Prime Day</a> is prime time to shave a few hundred dollars off to make the investment a little more digestible. </p><p>Aside from one or two straggler models that might be super new or a brand's most premium option, almost every robot vacuum that's worth your time will probably go on sale for <a href="https://mashable.com/article/october-prime-day-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">October Prime Day</a> &mdash;&nbsp;maybe even hit a new record low price compared to Prime Day in July. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/early-october-prime-day-2024-self-emptying-robot-vacuum-deals" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">We're tracking these deals</a> for you, of course.</p><p>I've tested 15+ of the most popular robot vacuum and mop combos on my own personal floors, narrowing down your options to the top five robot vacuums that can also wash your floors.</p>]]></content:encoded>

While the time-saving factor may be a moot point here, it doesn't completely diminish the appeal of using a robot vacuum in a crowded home. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>It's actually totally plausible that spaces with less square footage get dirty faster because virtually every spot is a high-traffic spot. With that logic, a robot vacuum is absolutely worth it in a small space. </p><p>However, it <em>is</em> crucial to not automatically assume that less floor to cover means that the cheapest vacuum you can find will suffice. Cramped furniture arrangements and quick changes between floor types actually call for a vac on the more competent end navigation-wise, or you'll risk arriving home to a bot that got stuck in kitchen chair legs during the first five minutes of cleaning. Before getting into <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-robot-vacuums-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">specific robovac recommendations</a>, let's assess the features that would make this a smart purchase.</p><h2>Do robot vacuums work in small apartments?</h2><p>While some large, heavy-duty robot vacuums would probably be overkill in a tight space, there are several compact, quiet robot vacuums on the market that make a lot of sense in a small space. </p><p>One way to downsize the space a robot vac takes up is to forego the self-empty dock. While forgoing it automatic emptying o save yourself inches on the floor may not be ideal, it'll be a little less damning in a small space, as the vacuum isn't sucking up as much dirt on each cleaning run as it would in a big house. However, finding a super compact auto-empty dock nowadays isn't hard, and many robot vacuums offer the option to buy one separately later. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

        <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-choose-a-robot-vacuum" class="text-secondary-300">
            For small spaces specifically, the robot vacuum's size is considered a little more heavily, both in terms of dimensions of the vacuum itself and how much space the vacuum takes up while it's charging. The shortest robot vacuums are near or slightly under three inches tall while others are upwards of five inches, most of which are able to fit under a couch or a low-hanging bed frame. Most non-self-emptying docks aren't bigger than a shoe and can be squeezed inconspicuously into a tight corner or under furniture to maximize your space (assuming that there's sufficient space out front for the robot vac to return).

This'll save you not only the time it takes to mop manually but also the breath it takes to curse your Swiffer for hogging your scarce closet space. Multiple floor types also make smart mapping and zone labeling a crucial feature, despite the fact that your home may not have many specific rooms to select on a map in the first place.</p><h2>Should I buy a robot vacuum on Prime Day?</h2><p>Absolutely, especially if you're set on <em>not</em> spending a lot of money on a robot vacuum that only has to keep up with a room or two.

<p>This little robot is built to cover every inch of your home with its Matrix Clean navigation. Its suction power is ideal for handling both hard floors and carpets. (Pet owners will appreciate the hair-picking-up power.) And, the sonic mopping function scrubs floors 100 times per minute to lift up and trap dirt and grime.

<p><em>The Franchise </em>transports us to the chaotic set of <em>Tecto</em>, the latest project from not-so-subtle <a href="https://mashable.com/category/marvel" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Marvel</a> stand-in Maximum Studios. While production is already well underway, the shoot is anything but smooth. Director Eric (Daniel Br&uuml;hl) is a pretentious auteur, lead actors Adam (Billy Magnussen) and Peter (Richard E. Grant) are at each other's throats, and producer Anita (Aya Cash) is ready to enact some harsh cost-cutting strategies. Plus, there's the worrying matter that overbearing higher-ups from Maxmium Studios, like exec Pat (Darren Goldstein) and <a href="https://mashable.com/video/deadpool-wolverine-marvel-kevin-feige-reynolds-jackman" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Kevin Feige</a>-esque overlord Shane, who only communicates via proxy Bryson (Isaac Powell), are losing faith in the project. It's up to Daniel and the newly arrived Dag to put out all these (sometimes literal) fires and keep <em>Tecto </em>afloat.</p><p>The promise of <em>The Franchise </em>is most evident in its ambitious opening, a long take that follows Daniel as he shows Dag around set on her first day. He juggles everything from actors worried about their heavy prosthetics to Peter's attempts at a problematic joke, cleverly preempting the latter six seconds ahead of time. It's the perfect portrait of controlled chaos, as well as a solid introduction to the world of blue screens and superhero spandex we'll be inhabiting for eight episodes. But from there, the laughs come in fits and starts. So does the satire, which you'd expect to excel given all the <em>Veep </em>connections behind the scenes.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>The <em>Veep </em>comparison hangs heavy over <em>The Franchise</em>, which attempts some of the same tricks but with far less rewarding results. At first, Eric's dynamic with his too-eager right-hand woman Steph (Jessica Hynes) feels like an attempt at recreating the dynamic between <em>Veep</em>'s Selina Meyer (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) and her bag man, Gary (<a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-decameron-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Tony Hale</a>). But there's no depth or background to their relationship, no layers to Steph's coddling of her charge. Elsewhere, a scene where Steph advises Eric to let out all his swearing before directing elicits memorable results in creative expletives like "cocktangle" and "fuckclump," but even these feel like reheated leftovers of <em>Veep </em>and <em>The Thick of It</em>'s greatest hits.</p><p>In terms of actual satire, <em>The Franchise </em>is haunted by shades of other shows that have parodied the superhero filmmaking industrial complex better in the past. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/barry-season-4-finale-ending-explained" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Barry</em></a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/barry-season-4-finale-ending-explained" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">'</a>s cameo from <a href="https://mashable.com/article/coda-review-oscars" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>CODA</em></a><em> </em>writer/director Sian Heder as a new franchise director was a solid send up of award-winning filmmakers getting looped into comic book movies so the studio can accrue prestige points. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-boys-season-4-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>The Boys</em></a>' many references to comic book movies and shows &mdash; including A-Train's (Jessie T.

<p>Part of what makes <em>The Franchise</em>'s take on comic book movies so ineffective is its clear disdain for them. Many of its critiques &mdash; including Maximum's "woman problem" and its fans' treatment of women involved in the films &mdash; are valid, albeit fairly surface level. And yes, the comic book movie's grip on pop culture is ripe for parody and deserving of closer inspection. But the show is overall devoid of any understanding of <em>why </em>these kinds of franchises may have resonated in the first place, or why they're so much more disappointing now than they were five years ago, during the era of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/avengers-endgame-best-moments" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Avengers: Endgame</em></a>. Since no character is coming at the project from a place of care &mdash; apart from Daniel, who we're told loved the original <em>Tecto </em>comics but whose love has been ground down by years of thankless work in service to show business &mdash; we're trapped in a mire of smug cynicism, that of someone who's always stood outside the world they're making fun of, without bothering to take a closer look.</p><h2><em>The Franchise </em>could have been so much more.</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Thankfully, <em>The Franchise </em>is not without its high points. Grant's performance as a trained theater actor who can't stop being problematic and who considers <em>Tecto</em> beneath him is uproarious. (Doubly so when you remember <a href="https://mashable.com/article/loki-episode-4-mid-credit-scene" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Grant guest-starred in </a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/loki-episode-4-mid-credit-scene" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Loki</em></a> as Classic Loki.) Magnussen's Adam, whose brawn is matched only by his many insecurities, makes an excellent foil for Grant's archness. Br&uuml;hl, himself a veteran of the MCU as <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-episode-3-baron-zemo" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Baron Zemo</a>, is also having a blast; he's part jittery director plagued with imposter syndrome and part diva. It's a shame, then, that the rest of the more-than-capable ensemble, like Patel, Adefope, Cash, and Hynes, are stuck playing varying shades of stress and contempt.</p><p>Another highlight of <em>The Franchise </em>comes as the credits roll, when we catch glimpses of dramatized behind-the-scenes interviews with various cast and crew. Here, the actors like Peter and Adam try especially hard to keep up the facade that all is well, despite being mere inches from cracking. The comedic tension there is infinitely more rewarding than just being shoved into <em>Tecto</em>'s<em> </em>chaos all the time, and you can't help but wonder whether <em>The Franchise </em>might have benefited from a larger behind-the-scenes documentary-style format. The show that we got, in the end, remains less than super.</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/91bXEn?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=The%20Franchise%20premieres%20Oct.%206%20at%2010%20p.m.%20ET%2FPT%20on%20HBO%20and%20Max%2C%20with%20a%20new%20episode%20every%20Sunday.&object_type=article&object_uuid=03w4K074xpoFfj9LFeDQVeY&short_url=91bXEn&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>The Franchise </em>premieres Oct. 6 at 10 p.m. ET/PT on HBO and Max, with a new episode every Sunday.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/02BbSNjLzakOF98diNs3Sad/hero-image.jpg" alt="Girl looks at phone in a seated position. "><p>Teens and parents alike may consider themselves familiar with classic signs of online grooming. For victims, that includes withdrawing from friends and family, becoming secretive about online activity, and sharing explicit images of themselves. </p><p>But predators are so skilled at deceiving their victims that signs of online grooming can actually be subtle and hard to detect, says Lauren Coffren, executive director of the exploited children division at the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children. </p><p>In fact, when grooming takes place over a period of time, the dynamic can look much like any other friendship in the beginning, filled with conversations about mutual interests. </p><p>But another type of grooming, known as <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-talk-to-teens-about-sextortion" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">financial sextortion</a>, can happen within hours and minutes, which prevents victims and their parents from picking up on the traditional or obvious warning signs. In these cases, predators may pose as a peer and send nude or explicit pictures to their victim, which is not uncommon for teens. </p><p>"These bad actors are really good at what they do," Coffren says. "They figured out these tactics of how to trick kids."</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>Signs of grooming you might miss </h2><p><strong>1. The child is receiving a lot of compliments from a new friend.</strong></p><p>Predators often earn a child's trust by complimenting them, says Coffren. They may have taken note of the child's interests or likes and dislikes, as indicated by their social media activity. Then they'll flatter the child by remarking on their good taste. </p><p>Compliments may also be based on the child's personality traits, such as their sense of humor or intelligence. Such remarks are designed to break down a child's defenses, and they may be particularly effective when a child already craves validation. </p><p>Parents might feel thrilled that their child is talking to someone online who appears to genuinely like them, but the new contact may have a predatory motive. It's important that parents have ongoing conversations with their child about the nature and frequency of online interactions that involve compliments and flattery.</p><p><strong>2. The new friend is engaging your child's interests. </strong></p><p>Predators can skillfully talk to children about their hobbies and passions, including gaming, music, sports, and pop culture, Coffren says. They build trust with a victim by being curious about and sharing those interests. </p><p>Again, this dynamic is something that parents typically embrace for their children when it involves trusted friends. But online, that new connection could be anyone, unless that person legitimately belongs to a child's broader in-person social circle. </p><p>If a child is excited by a new online relationship in which shared interests play a key role, parents should remain aware of how that continues to develop. While it could be an authentic peer-to-peer relationship that's fulfilling for both children, predators know how to make it hard for a child to know the difference between that and a bond based on deceit. </p><p><strong>3. Their relationship looks like a friendship&mdash;with some differences. </strong></p><p>Coffren says that traditional online grooming will often look like a typical friendship until the predator's behavior slowly starts to escalate. They might offer the victim gift cards, in-game currency, or other presents to appear generous and supportive. A young recipient will likely consider themselves lucky, not manipulated. </p><p>Escalation can also involve riskier chat topics, such as sexual interests. For a teen who wants to feel mature, or who is curious about their own sexuality, these conversations can feel like a step toward adulthood. Unfortunately, predators will ultimately take advantage of this. </p><p>Coffren says threats toward the child may follow soon after these exchanges. A predator will often threaten to share screenshots of the chats if the victim doesn't continue to talk to them, or if they refuse to share explicit imagery of themselves. </p><p>Coffren urges parents to regularly talk to their kids about what healthy relationships and boundaries look like so that they understand the potential implications of behaviors like gift-giving and riskier chats online. Parents should also discuss what a child can do if they're being targeted by a predator, which can include telling a trusted adult and blocking and reporting that account. </p><p>In general, she warns parents of the dangers related to children talking to any strangers online, given how swiftly exploitation can happen. To learn more about what online grooming looks like, and how to discuss it with children, Coffren recommends <a href="https://www.missingkids.org/netsmartz/topics/onlineenticement" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">NCMEC's comprehensive resources on the topic</a>. </p><p>Most importantly, Coffren advises parents to be unequivocally supportive of a child who shares that they've become a victim of online grooming. </p><p>"We put all of this pressure on children to be able to say, 'Never put yourself in that position,' instead of saying, 'OK, if you find yourself in that position, here's the steps you can do to be able to get out,'" Coffren says.</p><p><em>If you are a child being sexually exploited online, or you know a child who is being sexually exploited online, or you witnessed exploitation of a child occur online, you can report it to the <a href="https://report.cybertip.org/reporting" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">CyberTipline</a></em><em>, which is operated by the <a href="https://www.missingkids.org/home" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">National Center for Missing Exploited &amp; Children</a></em><em>.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Both devices are imminently recognizable as Kindles, with default black colorways giving way to bulky bezels around Amazon's signature Kindle displays. While one doesn't necessarily look cooler or all that different from the other, there are major size differences to consider.</p><p>Here's how the two Kindles stack up in terms of dimensions:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Kindle (2022)</strong>: 6.2-inch x 4.3-inch x 0.32-inch with 6-inch display</p></li><li><p><strong>Kindle Paperwhite (2021)</strong>: 6.9-inch x 4.9-inch x 0.32-inch with 6.8-inch display</p></li></ul><p>The Paperwhite is a good deal larger than the regular Kindle, which is its main selling point. It also has an adjustable front light with 17 LEDs, compared to the four LEDs on the regular Kindle. If you need a bigger and/or brighter display, the Paperwhite is the one to get. It also allows you to use a "warm light" option for a more pleasant reading experience in the dark.</p><p>Just know that you're going to sacrifice some weight along the way. The regular Kindle comes in at 5.56 ounces, while the Paperwhite is a relatively bulky 7.23 ounces. Still, the Paperwhite has more going for it in terms of design, regardless.</p><p><strong>Winner: Kindle Paperwhite (2021)</strong></p><h2>Kindle (2022) vs. Kindle Paperwhite (2021): Features</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>This would've been a much more substantial conversation a few years ago. There was a time when the regular Kindle didn't even have a front light, which made the Paperwhite much more desirable by comparison. However, times have changed.</p><p>These days, the two devices' functionality is very similar. Both can read books (duh), play audiobooks via Bluetooth, and have screens that should look fine in sunlight due to a lack of glare. Unfortunately, both will display advertisements on the lock screen unless you pay an extra $20 for either Kindle.</p><p>Because the two devices' basic functionality is <em>so</em> similar, this one is kind of a wash. You'll be fine either way.</p><p><strong>Winner: Tie</strong></p><h2>Kindle (2022) vs. Kindle Paperwhite (2021): Storage</h2><p>Here is where things get interesting.</p><p>Usually, the more expensive device has higher storage. That's how tech works, right? Not so with these two e-readers. The 2022 Kindle, despite being $40 cheaper before any Prime Day discounts, actually has <em>twice</em> as much storage at 16GB as the 8GB Paperwhite base model. Though, you can upgrade the Paperwhite to 16GB for $149.99 (or $10 extra). There's a substantially more expensive <a href="https://mashable.com/review/kindle-paperwhite-signature-edition" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Paperwhite Signature Edition</a> with 32GB of storage, but that doesn't help us here.</p><p><strong>Winner: Kindle (2022)</strong></p><h2>Kindle (2022) vs. Kindle Paperwhite (2021): Battery life</h2><p>Time to normalize things a little bit. This time, the more expensive device is the better option.</p><p>Amazon rates the 2022 Kindle for six weeks of battery life on a full charge. As for the Paperwhite, the estimated battery life is a whopping 10 weeks. This is <em>arguably</em> splitting hairs because there's not much functional difference between having to plug in the Kindle every six weeks versus every 10 weeks, but 10 is greater than six, so the Paperwhite wins.</p><p><strong>Winner: Kindle Paperwhite (2021)</strong></p><h2>Kindle (2022) vs. Kindle Paperwhite (2021): Water resistance</h2><p>Some people like reading at the pool, at the beach, or in the bathtub. Why not? It's super relaxing. If you're one of those people, there's a clear winner here.</p><p>The 2022 Kindle is not waterproof at all. Don't get it wet. The 2021 Paperwhite, meanwhile, has an IPX8 rating, which, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=18116670011" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">according to Amazon</a>, means it can survive for up to 60 minutes submerged in up to two meters of water. That seems like a fairly unrealistic scenario, so if you accidentally drop the Kindle Paperwhite in the bathtub, you won't need to buy another device.</p><p><strong>Winner: Kindle Paperwhite (2021)</strong></p><div id="related-video" class="mx-auto mt-8 mb-12 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans md:mt-12 md:mb-16 text-primary-400">

<p>To help you pick the right model, Mashable editors and reviewers tested dozens of headphones and earbuds and picked out the best noise-cancelling headphones of 2024. And with Amazon's <a href="https://mashable.com/article/october-prime-day-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Prime Big Deal Days right around the corner</a>, we've also added some buying tips for the sale on each of our picks below.</p><h2>Do noise-cancelling headphones actually work?</h2><p>There's a big difference between outside noise being blocked and music simply being loud enough to drown it out. If you're looking for the maximum amount of noise cancellation, you want to go for headphones that have active noise cancellation.</p><p>Active noise-cancelling headphones electronically cover up the sounds coming from your surroundings by using internal microphones that listen to what's happening in the world around you, then invert the noise and send it to the speakers. The idea is that both the output and the input will cancel out, leaving you with near-silence. Over-ear headphones also create a tight seal around your ears that adds another layer of sound blocking.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>If you've tried a pair of noise-cancelling headphones before and haven't been impressed, don't be discouraged. It's partially about finding the headphones that match your preferences, as not all ANC performs equally. For instance, cheaper ANC headphones may have a more noticeable hissing sound that you'll hear when the noise cancellation is turned on, which can be distracting for some folks.</p><p>Other headphones may be great at blocking at low tones, but more prone to letting high-pitched tones in. Typically, more premium headphones will yield better results, but we have budget picks below that still do a solid job.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

However, if you want to cut down on the bulk, earbuds make for great alternatives.</p><h2>What are the best noise-cancelling headphones to buy?</h2><p>Bose and Sony are both top names when it comes to any type of audio, but especially when it comes to noise cancellation. Both brands feature industry-leading ANC on top of superb sound quality. There are also some other brands and models worth checking out, so if you want to tune out ambient sound, we've laid everything out for you below, from your more premium options to your budget picks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

There's always a theme linking every solution, along with the "spangram," a special, word or phrase that sums up that day's theme, and spans the entire grid horizontally or vertically.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>What is Connections?</h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>
<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. Like <em>Wordle, </em>you can share the results with your friends on social media.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Kitchen-sink realist Mike Leigh, now in his eighties, may have come to the bitter realization that at a certain point, some things (and people) may never change. However, with his latest social drama, he paints an acerbic and empathetic portrait of what hitting your limit looks like. The film, and Jean-Baptiste's rankled performance as a wife and mother who just can't catch a break, seem to exist just beyond an invisible point of no return &mdash; a line that <em>Hard Truths</em> walks with stunning precision.</p><h2><strong>What is <em>Hard Truths</em> about?</strong></h2><p>While her husband is away at his plumbing job, and while her unemployed 22-year-old son Moses (Tuwaine Barrett) is locked away in his bedroom, the dispirited fifty-something Pansy likes to clean &mdash; perhaps a little too much &mdash; if only to create a temporary sanctuary for herself, where she can nap without having to worry about the outside world.</p><p>This paradise never lasts. The real world always comes knocking sooner or later, whether in the form of a stray fox in her yard or the men in her life asking for their next meal. The next inconvenience to her, and her next vicious speech about the state of the world and its selfish people, are always just moments away, and she wants it all to stop.&nbsp;</p><p>There's a quote from the TV series <em>Justified</em> that has since become a common truism: "If you run into an asshole in the morning, you ran into an asshole. If you run into assholes all day, you're the asshole." It is, on the surface, applicable to Pansy and how she navigates the world &mdash; her sharp barbs at innocent strangers in public, while funny, are a sudden and irreverent release valve &mdash; leaving people to walk on eggshells when she's around. But it isn't quite so simple and binary; in reality, everyone is an asshole to some degree. Pansy is ready to snap at a moment's notice, but she wasn't born this way. Something or someone (perhaps multiple somethings and someones) molded her over time, an idea that Leigh slowly unveils and explores over the course of 97 minutes.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>But before there's ever a hint of Pansy's real psychology, the film also presents an upbeat contrast across several scenes, in the form of her hairdresser sister Chantal (Michele Austin) and the parallel life she lives. Chantal, a single mother, lives with her two adult daughters, young professionals Kayla (Ani Nelson) and Aleisha (Sophia Brown), in a cramped apartment filled with love and cheer. Through scenes that follow both sisters across daily interactions, <em>Hard Truths</em> details how people on the same journey can end up in remarkably different destinations, living lives in which they put out into the world that which they receive &mdash; or perceive, or think they deserve.</p><p>As Mother's Day approaches, both women's lives as homemakers shift slowly into focus, but they also plan to visit their mother's grave, a scenario that proves surprisingly emotionally charged. Whatever Pansy's problem with the idea, she first and foremost makes excuses. "I'm a sick woman!" she yells at Chantal, before darting off into an unrelated rant about how she doesn't plan things in advance.</p><p>As the holiday nears, isolated scenes focused on all the aforementioned characters &mdash; Pansy, Curtley, Moses, Chantal, Kayla and Aleisha &mdash; paint a multifaceted family portrait that, eventually, helps unearth the deep anguish that lies beneath Pansy's risible demeanor.</p><h2><strong><em>Hard Truths</em> is about the ins and outs of Black women's lives.</strong></h2><p>What makes Leigh's film such a joyful watch is its vignette-like approach to both families, though it eventually sharpens its focus when digging into difficult emotional territory. Several of these scenes are set at Chantal's hair salon, following daily gossip that sketches out the details of her life, and those of her clients, all of them middle-aged Black women dealing with the daily drudgery of life. However, their sense of community keeps them afloat.</p><p>Leigh, on numerous occasions, cuts from the noisy hustle and bustle of the salon to the eerie silence of Pansy's home, a contrast that lures the viewer into her orbit before she launches into her next series of condemnations &mdash; even against dogs, babies, and so on. She's pissed off with the world at large, doesn't have the tools to deal with it, and ignores any kind of support she's offered.</p><p>The characters' communal instincts are also accompanied by specific cultural details, which speak to the movie's granular nature. These are women who all appear to belong to England's Caribbean diaspora; they might speak with English accents, but on occasion, they code-switch to the occasional Patois or West Indian intonation, which tells its own story too. For Chantal, her clients, and her daughters, this switch usually occurs during laughter, or during the lively recounting of stories. But in Pansy's case, code-switching is a means of tapping into more creative insults, and into furious, lock-jawed responses to the mundane, as the film seats its jet-black humor right next to its notions of people's deep and complicated personal history.</p><p>There also exists a sense of pride in achievement for these characters, and of pushing one's children to be their best selves. Chantal has ostensibly succeeded at this with her well-adjusted daughters, who enjoy varying levels of success (though they still hide their failures from their mum, and from one another). Moses, on the other hand, represents the flip side to this story. He seems aimless, and spends all his time eating, making a mess, playing video games, and reading books about airplanes. Apart from his occasional strolls, he barely leaves the house, and lacks professional prospects. All Pansy does is yell at him in the hopes of motivating him, but deep down, she thinks he may be a lost cause.</p><p>Pansy even describes his behavior to Chantal in dismissive terms &mdash; his fixations, his social awkwardness, and his inability to maintain eye contact in particular &mdash; that hint towards Moses being on the autism spectrum, or having some kind of cognitive disability that his parents cannot or do not recognize. But even Pansy's love as a mother can (and will) only go so far, given the harshness of her own upbringing by a disciplinarian single mother.</p><h2><strong><em>Hard Truths</em> centers on a tremendous lead performance.</strong></h2><p>Teaming with Leigh for the first time since 1996's <em>Secrets &amp; Lies</em> &mdash; a role that won her a Best Supporting Actress nomination at the Oscars, BAFTAs, and Golden Globes &mdash; Jean-Baptiste delivers career-best work in what may be one of the most challenging performances this year. The biggest challenge for both actress and director is maintaining a familiar sense of humanity during even verbose, borderline Shakespearean outbursts about how much Pansy loathes the world &mdash; and by implication, what it has done to her.</p><p>Each and every actor delivers fine-tuned work, as characters swallowed up by Pansy's orbit (and in the case of Curtley and Moses, characters who have contributed to the black hole at her center). But Jean-Baptiste is a magnet for the camera, luring it in with her eyes, and making it watch &mdash; unblinking, unbroken &mdash; as she puts on a clinic of self-loathing turned outward.</p><p>A volatile undercurrent runs just beneath Jean-Baptiste's physical being, leaving Pansy on the verge of either explosion or implosion. Sometimes, she reaches both these difficult places at once, as the camera interrogates her, practically forcing confessions from her about what made her this way. The more Leigh lingers, holding back on any sort of formalist flourish, the more he allows his performances to take charge. The result is mesmerizing to watch, and sure to remind you of the worst flashes you might have seen of friends and loved ones.</p><p>In the process, <em>Hard Truths </em>becomes a complex showreel for humanity at its most bitter and pained, with characters forced to turn inward and at least recognize (if not introspect and improve upon) the worst corners of themselves. Through long, unbroken close-ups and scenes of familial interaction in which tensions subtly build, Leigh's stark naturalism is brought slowly and fiercely to the fore by an accomplished actress<strong>&nbsp;</strong>at the height of her power, and at the height of her vulnerability. Scene by scene, she slowly chips away at Pansy's armor until all that's left is sinew, blood, and bone, leaving her exposed to the world in all its cruelty and kindness and indifference. It&rsquo;s harrowing to watch, but Jean-Baptiste makes it impossible to look away.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Hard Truths </em>will have a qualifying run in New York City on Dec. 6 before opening in limited release Jan. 10, 2025.</p><p class="mx-auto">
   <em><strong>UPDATE: Sep. 25, 2024, 4:33 p.m. EDT </strong>Hard Truths was reviewed on Sept. 9, 2024 out of its World Premiere at the 2024 Toronto International Film Festival. This post has been updated to toast its New York Film Festival premiere. </em>

<p>The tale of a documentary filmmaker on his deathbed who becomes the camera's subject, the film is based on the 2021 novel <em>Foregone</em> by Russell Banks. (Schrader previously adapted Banks' novel <em>Affliction</em> in 1997.) The author would sadly pass away in January 2023, a few months before filming began, and shortly after Schrader himself had a brush with death thanks to COVID-19.</p><p>This proximity to grief, and to the grave, informs <em>Oh Canada</em>'s storytelling, which plays like a recollection of regrets. Its structure and narrative POV shift in beguiling ways, as though the movie's main character &mdash; played by two actors at different ages &mdash; was rushing to absolve himself of sin. Along the way, he confuses and collapses his many confessions into a single, muddled mythology that constantly shifts through elliptical editing, as if to reflect the character&rsquo;s disoriented state of mind. The details may be unreliable, but his story pulses with riveting emotional truths, born from lifelong remorse.&nbsp;</p><h2>What is <em>Oh, Canada</em> about?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>Now confined to hospice care, Canadian filmmaker Leonard Fife (Richard Gere) agrees to an interview conducted by his former film students, Malcolm (Michael Imperioli) and Diana (Victoria Hill), during his final weeks of life. Cancer has ravaged his body, and his treatment has left him tired, but as an artist who has always used his camera to unearth people's truths, he hopes Malcolm and Diana's lens will do the same for him, and help him unburden himself as his wife, Emma (Uma Thurman), looks on.</p><p>Many details of Leonard's life are publicly known, especially his conscientious Vietnam draft-dodging, after which he left the U.S. for the Great White North as a political asylee. However, just as much of his story remains shrouded in mystery, which he now unpacks as last rite. In flashbacks set in the '60s and '70s, Leonard is played by Jacob Elordi (of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/priscilla-movie-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Priscilla</em></a> fame), though on occasion, Gere himself strides through scenes where Elordi ought to be, a swap that occurs either through straightforward cuts, or the occasional <a href="https://kottke.org/21/09/the-texas-switch" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Texas Switch</u></a>.</p><p>The seamlessness with which the older Leonard replaces his younger self has an eerie effect, as though something in the fabric of his story were deeply amiss. As he reveals some particularly shameful and macabre family secrets, Emma remains in denial over his revelations and insists that Leonard must be confused about the details. He is, in a way, given the overlap between events and characters he recalls, but all of these revelations come from a place of deep pain and repression. Whether or not they're logistically true, Gere makes their emotional truth feel undeniable via a towering, career-defining performance as a man both afraid and determined to stare at the camera and be seen by it, as he struggles to purge himself of demons that have long been eating at his soul.</p><h2>Paul Schrader brings a thoughtful filmmaking eye to <em>Oh, Canada</em>.</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Throughout <em>Oh, Canada</em>, Leonard's regret is enhanced by Schrader's interrogative filmmaking, which draws from numerous documentarian techniques. The film for which he provides his personal testimony &mdash; about his own life, and his work as anti-war activist after his illegal border-crossing &mdash; takes the form of a traditional interview talking head, albeit with an aesthetic twist that yields several haunting close-ups.</p><p>In order to pay tribute to Leonard, his students film him with the use of a camera set-up he invented. In reality, this is the<a href="https://nofilmschool.com/2012/09/interrotron-errol-morris-documentary" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"> <u>Interrotron</u></a> developed by <em>The Thin Blue Line</em> director Errol Morris; it&rsquo;s a teleprompter that allows the subject to meet the interviewer's eye (or rather, a reflection of it) while staring directly down the camera's lens. By attributing the tool to the fictitious Leonard, Schrader creates a double-edged sword. The technique has long afforded Leonard the comfort of sitting behind a video monitor, rather than meeting his subjects' gaze directly. But now, as the subject of his own camera, his confession occurs in a darkened, lonely room.</p><p>There are people nearby, like the filmmakers, and Leonard's wife, Emma, whose reflection theoretically appears in the teleprompter, but we only ever glimpse this briefly. For the most part, Schrader locks us into a trio of close-ups of Leonard from three angles (two profiles, and one directly head-on), which appear on side-by-side video screens for Malcolm and Diana, and whose angles Schrader often cuts between. This triptych framing makes the cameras feel incredibly invasive, and by almost never cutting away from Leonard's close-ups, Schrader forces us to view his self-reflections the way the aging documentarian sees them. His interviewers' faces may be visible to him on a screen, but he recognizes his own filmmaking facade, and he knows just how lonely he is, here at the end of his life.</p><p>This loneliness takes stirring form during Leonard's flashbacks, too. In isolated moments, Elordi and Gere's attention occasionally drifts from the characters to whom they're speaking, and their gaze falls upon nothing in particular, as though they know they're trapped in a framing device. People from other points in the story sometimes appear where they shouldn't, and on occasion, a white light consumes the frame, as though hypoxia (or the embrace of death) had threatened to provide Leonard with respite from his confessions.</p><p>The question then remains: Does Leonard want to die without having exposed the worst parts of himself?</p><h2>Schrader's shifting narrative makes <em>Oh, Canada</em> a holistic self-reflection.</h2><p>Like Schrader's most recent works &mdash; especially <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-films-of-2018-so-far" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>First Reformed</em></a>, <em>The Card Counter</em>, and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/master-gardener-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Master Gardener</em></a>, a similarly confessional trilogy &mdash; <em>Oh, Canada</em> makes frequent use of voiceover. But in the aforementioned films, these narrations took the form of diary entries by each protagonist, whereas in the latest, the framing device is not only a camera this time, but one that isn't in Leonard's control.</p><p>Sometimes, the movie's voiceover comprises snippets from Leonard's filmed confession. Other times, it draws from an impassioned inner monologue. And on some occasions, the voiceover is spoken by a different character entirely, revealed to be a person who feels deeply betrayed by Leonard. In a literal sense, this patchwork of perspectives helps unearth Leonard's story from multiple points of view, as Schrader deconstructs both a man and the mythology around him.</p><p>However, this shifting POV also serves a spiritual purpose. In essence, it blends the known and the imagined, and plays as though Leonard were in a desperate grasp at absolutely, slowly stepping outside himself and finding sudden empathy for someone he had deeply &mdash; perhaps knowingly &mdash; wronged.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p><em>Oh, Canada</em> is a work of deep-seated guilt frothing to the surface, and while its story is largely fictional, Schrader's presentation takes strikingly personal form. On one hand, the older Leonard is styled to resemble Banks &mdash; Schrader&rsquo;s friend of many years, who requested the filmmaker to adapt <em>Foregone</em> before he died &mdash; but from many angles, this man with short, graying hair and an unkempt beard also resembles Schrader himself, who made the film when it seemed like the nearly 80-year-old filmmaker might not win his long battle with COVID and pneumonia. (He was hospitalized, and suffered breathing difficulties in the aftermath.)</p><p>But there's another personal element to the movie, too, one made far less apparent on screen. Around the time of Banks' death and Schrader's illness, the director also <a href="https://www.curbed.com/article/paul-schrader-assisted-living-coterie-hudson-yards-nyc.html" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>moved into</u></a> an assisted living facility with his wife, Mary Beth Hurt, whose Alzheimer's had been worsening. <em>Oh, Canada</em> is as much a film about death and elusive truths as it is about memory and its fleeting nature, and it's hard not to read the visual manifestations of Leonard's confusion as Schrader's depiction of his wife's condition.</p><p>Moreover, it depicts a filmmaker whose confessions to his wife &mdash; a woman who knows him better than anyone, but still doesn't know his darkest moments &mdash; don't seem to stick, both because of his illness and his inability to properly articulate them. While Schrader's avatar suffers from distortions of recollection in the film, and is assisted by his wife, the reverse is true in reality. The idea of a man unable to fully give himself over to the woman he loves because of the impermanent nature of memory is the tragic result, regardless. While <em>Oh, Canada</em> talks through (but quickly skips past) many of these central themes &mdash; en route to a conclusion that wraps up too quickly, and too neatly &mdash; it stands as one of Schrader's most personal, most moving, and most impactful films.</p><p><em>Oh, Canada </em>is slated to hit theaters this December.</p><p class="mx-auto">
   <em><strong>UPDATE: Sep. 25, 2024, 4:44 p.m. EDT </strong>Oh, Canada was reviewed on May 30, 2024, out of the Cannes Film Festival. This post has been updated to toast its New York Film Festival premiere. </em>

But this unusual trio was detected because of the group's "strobe lights." The system is almost flat from the telescope's vantage point in <a href="https://mashable.com/category/space" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">space</a>, so that means as the stars cross in front of each other during their orbits, they create eclipses. As the nearer star blocks the farther star's light, it will cause a flicker.&nbsp;</p><p>Amateur astronomers who were looking for interesting cases found the eclipse patterns among TESS data with the help of machine learning. These sleuths originally met as participants in an online citizen science program called Planet Hunters. Later they collaborated again with professional astronomers to form the Visual Survey Group, an ongoing project of more than a decade.

<p>On Oct. 2, NASA shared the view below, which was taken from data gathered by the Galileo mission in 1998. It shows a close-up of Europa's chaotic landscape, which is evidence that something below the moon's thick icy crust &mdash; like an ocean &mdash; is stoking lots of change and deformity. Salty water may escape to the surface along fractures, leaving telltale reddish colors on Europa's ground. And irregular chunks of ice have likely been created by relatively recent surface movement. </p><p>"This region sports ice rafts that look like those at Earth's poles, where large chunks of ice break away and float freely on the ocean," the <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/images/pia26446-conamara-color-closeup/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">agency wrote</a>. "Much of the region bears the reddish/brownish discoloration seen here &mdash; the same as seen along many of Europa's fractures. Scientists believe this material may contain clues about the composition of an ocean beneath the icy surface, if it is proven to exist."</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2>Apple Watch Series 9 vs. SE: Display</h2><p>The first thing I noticed about the Watch SE is that it has thicker bezels, which reduces its screen real estate &mdash; and the display is minimal to begin with.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The Watch Series 9's bezels are a lot less obstructive, but either way, I still found display navigation to be fine on both screens. Thicker bezels, in my opinion, aren't a big deal. </p><p>It's also worth noting that the resolution is different for the watches:</p><p><strong>Watch Series 9 (41mm) - 430 x 352 pixels </strong></p><p><strong>Watch SE (40mm) - 394 x 324 pixels </strong></p><p>Looking at them side by side, the Watch Series 9 definitely delivers sharper, clearer visuals. But if I were looking at the Watch SE independently, I would think that the display quality is sufficient enough. </p><p>Now, let's talk brightness:</p><p><strong>Watch Series 9 (41mm) - up to 2,000 nits</strong></p><p><strong>Watch SE (40mm) - up to 1,000 nits</strong></p><p>The Watch Series 9 is supposedly brighter than Series 9, delivering a max of 2,000 nits over the SE's 1,000-nit screen. However, while comparing both watches in the sun, I could see both of them just fine, even with the rays shining bright on them like a spotlight. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>You can tell the Watch SE is <em>slightly </em>dimmer, but the difference is negligible to the naked eye.</p><p>The main difference between the two screens, however, is the always-on display. I thought I wouldn't care about the Watch SE not having an always-on display (AOD). (For the uninitiated, AOD means that the screen is always feeding you visual information.)</p><p>However, I found myself getting frustrated that I had to keep either touching the Watch SE's screen or flick my wrist toward myself to check the time. Meanwhile, the Watch Series 9, well, <em>stays on</em>. As you can see in the photo below, the Watch SE's screen is completely dark, but the Series 9's display is still "active" (though it is dimmed). </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>I went with the Silver finish for the Watch SE along with the Ocean Blue solo loop &mdash; and I regret it. Oddly, the solo loop collects dirt easily. And unlike the sports band that's featured on the Watch Series 9, the solo loop requires custom sizing. Mine is a size 3, which fits OK, but it could stand to be a smidge tighter.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The sports band has an adjustable strap, allowing me to make it as tight or loose as I need it to be. The solo loop, on the other hand, is just a stretchy bracelet band.

<p>When it comes to texting, the Apple Watch Series 9 features a QWERTY keyboard.

You can still text, but there is no keyboard available.

<p>If you're more fitness-focused, and you don't mind the thicker bezels and lack of always-on display, the Watch SE is a solid choice.</p><p>You, like me, may assume that the Watch Series 9 has better battery life because it's pricier, but in my experience, both held up pretty well in terms of power efficiency (though the Series 9 edged out the Watch SE by an hour or so).</p><p>The only thing I'd warn against is getting the solo loop band for your Apple Watch. It seems to get loose after some time &mdash; and it's not very durable. Instead, get the sports band, allowing you to adjust the Apple Watch to your wrist as you like it.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>If convenience and portability are your top priorities, then the Air will be most suited to you. It's thin and light, and it even comes in a 13-inch option if you'll be lugging it around wherever you go.

While over-the-ear headphones naturally block out noise by wrapping around the ears, earbuds don't block sound as effectively. Instead of covering your ears, wireless earbuds deliver sound directly into the ear canal to drown out other noises. They rely more on active noise cancellation (ANC) to reduce environmental noise.</p><p>ANC is an electronic process within the headphones. Internal microphones listen to your surroundings and then invert the sound, effectively canceling it. Sometimes, with noise-canceling headphones and earbuds, you'll hear a slight buzzing or humming in the background, and that's the ANC at work. The best ANC earbuds shouldn't have this buzzing, however.</p><h2>What are the best noise-cancelling earbuds?</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>While there are plenty of audio brands that provide good sound quality and noise cancellation, audio leaders Bose and Sony are in a league of their own. Not only do they offer phenomenal ANC, but they also make music and podcasts sound better. On a good pair of headphones, "Espresso" by Sabrina Carpenter sounds even catchier with its sickly sweet tune.</p><p>Earbuds usually aren't as comfortable as over-the-ear headphones. I know this well, as I've found many pairs of earbuds that just plain don't fit in my ear. Others are downright uncomfortable. Once again, Bose tends to offer the best comfort.

That's why I set out to test the best the market offers and see what makes a great pair of earbuds.</p><p>Since you probably don't want to go through the process of buying and returning a dozen pairs of noise-cancelling earbuds before finding the right ones, I did that work for you.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The film is told, for the most part, through first-person point of view, a tall ask for audiences accustomed to more traditional filmmaking. However, over the course of its 140 minutes, <em>Nickel Boys</em> unfurls numerous pathways into its unique construction, practically teaching viewers how to watch it, as it builds a tale of personhood that's as intimate in presentation as it is political in implication. In Whitehead's novel, the words on the page are just as meaningful as the blank spaces between them &mdash; an approach Ross recreates not through absence, but through the layered use of archival video and images that blend fiction with reality in both wistful and harrowing ways.</p><p>All the while, Ross avoids the tendency to luxuriate in the visually traumatic; instead, he&nbsp;maneuvers around cinematic exploitation by embodying the bone-deep effects of trauma. The film's non-linear structure occasionally flashes forward several decades, mimicking how profoundly our minds and bodies keep the score. Few narrative feature debuts have felt so poignant and so richly formed that they practically speak their own language, as <em>Nickel Boys</em> does, while also managing to articulate its drama clearly and instinctively. The result is a dynamic work of resilience and self-actualization.&nbsp;</p><h2>What is <em>Nickel Boys</em> about?</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container--2qZ429rUZw"></div>
</div>


<p>The film, like the novel, follows 16-year-old Elwood Curtis (Ethan Herisse), a promising teen from Tallahassee who lives with his grandmother, Hattie (Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor), and navigates the Jim Crow-era South. On his way to a technical college for advanced classes, the high schooler finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time, leading to false charges of theft and internment at the Nickel Academy, an isolated juvenile home on a sprawling estate that presents itself as a place of hard work and reform.</p><p>A young adherent of Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., Elwood's idealism quickly clashes with Nickel's harsh reality of segregation and corporal punishment. However, he also finds guidance and companionship in Turner (Brandon Wilson), a fellow student hailing from Houston whose more upbeat demeanor and slick survival tips exists in close proximity to his own fears of the school's ruthless staff. Should the boys misbehave, they know that the ominous administrator Spencer (Hamish Linklater) will whisk them away in the middle of the night for a severe beating &mdash; or something worse. (The film makes the novel's implications of sexual violence slightly more pronounced.)&nbsp;</p><p>What is perhaps most surprising about <em>Nickel Boys</em> is how casually this information is relayed to Elwood. The fates of several former students who have "mysteriously" disappeared isn't so much rumor and innuendo as it is common knowledge among the boys, keeping them in line as they toil away from dawn to sundown, plowing fields and making local deliveries for what one assumes is little (if any) pay. The film evokes images of American slavery at every turn, between white students overseeing their Black counterparts as they pick crops, to rusty rings that have been embedded in the nearby trees for so long that they're practically part of the foliage, conjuring images of young Black boys chained up in the darkness.</p><p>These evocations exist in the minds of the audience thanks to the prominence of slavery cinema (and television, &agrave; la <em>Roots</em>). Few mainstream films, however, have focused on the kind of institutional violence directly descended from chattel slavery a century later in the way <em>Nickel Boys</em> does. Its echoes don't point to older horrors, but ones that were still alive and well when the film was set, and for many years after. Ross simply threads the needle in ways most viewers might understand, frequently employing footage of the Sidney Poitier-led prisoner drama <em>The Defiant Ones </em>to further make its point in montage.&nbsp;</p><p>"There are four ways out of Nickel," Turner says. There's aging out at 18, being let out for good behavior, and if you're lucky &mdash; as Elwood hopes to be, with his grandma's help &mdash; having family contact lawyers to have your sentence overturned, though this is a long and arduous process. The fourth way out is the most dangerous, so few avail of it: escaping Nickel's grounds, at the risk of being chased and killed. For Turner, the film is about finding ways to adapt and survive. However, the more book-smart Elwood believes in a fifth way: challenging the system itself, given its illegal practices, though this may be even riskier. Ruffle any feathers when inspectors come to visit, and you'll end up being "taken out back."</p><p>With the boys torn between trying to withstand a system and dismantle it from within, the stakes are monumental, even though much of the movie unfolds across gentle scenes of blossoming friendship and mutual understanding. These are told mostly through Elwood's eyes, and on occasion, Turner's. However, <em>Nickel Boys</em> harbors a sense of tragic inevitability. Brief scenes of Elwood in the future &mdash; played by <em>Hamilton</em> original Daveed Diggs &mdash; signal their removal from the '60s through shots of computer screens and contemporary paraphernalia, but remain tethered to the era through Elwood's research into the past, as news stories of the school's mass graves come to light.</p><p>In these moments, the movie's self-imposed visual constraints also become its biggest strengths.</p><h2><em>Nickel Boys</em> takes a powerful aesthetic approach.</h2><p>Ross is hardly the first filmmaker to employ point-of-view shots for lengthy stretches. Temporal experiments like <em>Russian Ark</em> and the video game gimmick of <em>Hardcore Henry</em> come to mind, but <em>Nickel Boys</em> is most like the films of Gaspar No&eacute; in this regard, especially his spiritual, out-of-body POV experience <em>Enter the Void</em>, albeit in a much more grounded manner. From its opening frames, Ross' adaptation, co-written by Joslyn Barnes, feels fully embodied in its mood and motions, as an adolescent Elwood catches glimpses of himself in reflective surfaces, like bus windows and his grandmother's steam iron. It feels worth mentioning that <em>The Nickel Boys</em> is largely written in third person, but the film's astounding narrative shift accentuates the nuances of Whitehead's drama and characterization.</p><p>Between the young child's observations of Hattie's daily life and his viewing of Dr. King Jr.'s speeches on TV screens in store windows &mdash; his own reflection visible all the while &mdash; he begins to come to an awareness of his own place in the world. This is crystalized in a key POV shot of Elwood looking down at his arms and inspecting his own skin, echoing the writings of <a href="https://mashable.com/video/i-am-not-your-negro-trailer" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">James Baldwin</a> on similarly formative realizations of Blackness in his youth.</p><p>It's an inciting incident of sorts, shaping Elwood's understanding of himself while situating the audience firmly in his perspective, though Ross makes certain visual adjustments along the way. While the camera's movements mimic reality, cinematographer Jomo Fray uses soft focus and telephoto lenses to strip away the image's topmost naturalistic layers, especially in moments of extreme close-up. While still captured from a distinct perspective, these highly textured shots zero in on sensory details in ways that make them feel like nostalgic memories. When Hattie's cake knife rattles along a plate, as she cuts Elwood a slice of a homemade, spongy delicacy, you can practically smell the warmth and love with which it was baked.</p><p>This impressionism is complemented by an essayistic use of archival footage, sourced mostly from the<a href="https://www.aahma.org/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"> <u>African American Home Movie Archive</u></a>. (Some of it also comes from NASA; the Space Race, with "<a href="https://genius.com/Gil-scott-heron-whitey-on-the-moon-annotated" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Whitey[s] on the Moon</u></a>," is the grand American antithesis to the reality of Black boys at Nickel.) Old film footage of Black children and families in joyful moments is intercut and contrasted with the boys at the Academy, matching their movements, and transporting us rhythmically from the confines of their harsh surroundings to a wider world outside, albeit briefly. The movie, despite its mimicry of human perspective, employs a narrow 4:3 aspect ratio, creating a sense of tunnel vision that keeps Elwood and Turner practically blinkered. They can't see past their oppressive confines &mdash; and so the film, in a way, imagines the outside world and its liberation for them. The viewer's desire to see them freed becomes all the more pressing.&nbsp;</p><p>However, when the movie's borrowed footage begins incorporating the magnetic flaws of video tape &mdash; a format that wouldn't be popular for decades after the film is set &mdash; it pulls the viewer forward through time, in a way. This takes the form of vignettes of life in Harlem in the '80s, where we also glimpse an adult Elwood, but this isn&rsquo;t the only way the movie signals its cinematic time travel.&nbsp;</p><p>While the use of interspersed archive footage is intentionally scattered, almost random, the way the narrative hops back and forth is much more precise. In a moment when Elwood becomes the victim of his school's corporal punishment, Ross makes a masterful switch with disquieting impact and presents him from the rear, shooting his back as though he had slipped outside himself. This moment of traumatic dissociation carries over into the movie's future scenes, wherein Elwood (Diggs) is shot exclusively with a "<a href="https://www.snorricam.com/home" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Snorricam</u></a>" rig attached to his body from the rear, matching his every moment so that we remain fixed to his point of view &mdash; but so that his perspective is now removed from his sense of physical self, thanks to the violence he endured as a child.</p><p>This is also when the movie begins employing real-world photographs and news footage of the Dozier Academy, the actual school on which Whitehead modeled Nickel, down to the shed reserved for the boys' harshest physical punishments. Although we don't spend much time with the older Elwood, he becomes the center of some of the most emotionally striking scenes. Diggs effectively "operates" the camera through his body language. When Elwood runs into a now-adult schoolmate who recounts his own harrowing tales &mdash; a tremendous one-scene performance by Craig Tate &mdash; his hesitance to chat, and his reluctance to be vulnerable, become heartbreakingly embodied by the minor movements of the frame.</p><p>There's no such aesthetic equivalent for trauma in literature, or in any other medium, but Ross' film deftly captures the silent poetry between Whitehead's words, making it a particularly potent work of adaptation.</p><h2><em>Nickel Boys</em> is a magnificent literary translation.&nbsp;</h2><p>While there are minor plot departures along the way, the biggest difference between <em>Nickel Boys</em> and Whitehead's novel is the way it expands upon (and arguably deepens) the material through sheer aesthetic force. Some of this occurs during fleeting moments &mdash; Alex Somers and Scott Alario's rustling, clanking score captures the academy's foreboding when it first appears &mdash; but much of it comes down to Ross' approach to translating between mediums.</p><p>The director only has one other feature under his belt, the immense and oblique documentary <em>Hale County This Morning, This Evening</em>, but it makes for a perfect B-side to <em>Nickel Boys</em>. The Oscar&ndash;nominated doc uses similar techniques, with close-ups of sensory moments disembodied from time used to illustrate the daily lives of Black residents of Alabama. Whitehead's novel comes with a similar level of detail, with each description of a person, object, or even surface hinting at a deeper history, which Ross subsequently captures through Elwood and Turner's eyes, focusing on each fleeting feature just long enough to conjure thought and feeling.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>However, the film practically outdoes its source material in its conception of both leads. In portraying&nbsp;the world through Elwood and Turner's eyes, Ross confers a constant sense of personhood upon the camera, forcing the viewer to reflect on each moment as an extension of <em>someone's</em> humanity. But in switching between the two boys' points of view, <em>Nickel Boys</em> also takes on a more traditionally cinematic form when they're together, cutting between their close-ups, as though their connection had inadvertently conjured familiar comforts. The film, in this way &mdash; and through its deeply considered performances &mdash; approaches a love story. Whether or not it's remotely queer or romantic, it features a sense of gentleness that must exist by necessity, in order for the two boys to simply survive.</p><p>The film's use of POV also brings to mind the work of Barry Jenkins &mdash; who, as it happens, adapted another Whitehead novel, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-underground-railroad-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>The Underground Railroad</u></em></a>. Jenkins' work makes frequent use of characters looking straight down the lens so we can reflect on their humanity, a technique that was further emphasized in <em>The Gaze</em>, a video exhibit that spun out of <em>Railroad</em>. Ross' approach, however, plays like its equal and opposite. In employing a first-person perspective to this degree, <em>Nickel Boys</em> presents each supporting character &mdash; those who love Elwood, and those who would do him harm &mdash; through similar shots of them staring at the camera, and revealing their most honest selves in the process. However, they act as mirrors too, constructing numerous conceptions of Elwood's humanity as well, just from the way they look at him.&nbsp;</p><p>The result is not just dehumanization at close proximity, but what critic Robert Daniels calls, in<a href="https://www.polygon.com/22419201/the-underground-railroad-review-barry-jenkins" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"> <u>his review</u></a> of <em>The Underground Railroad</em>, a subsequent "re-humanization." In <em>Nickel Boys</em>, the camera constructs a powerful sense of self and personhood through the kind of thoughtful, propulsive artistry the American mainstream has seldom seen, making its opposition to violence and racist oppression wholly self-evident through its visual approach. The film is unlike anything else, but it feels intimately familiar.</p><p><em>Nickel Boys</em> was reviewed out of its New York Film Festival Premiere. <a href="https://zdcs.link/aR800X?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=It%20will%20open%20on%20Dec.%2013%20in%20NYC%20and%20in%20Los%20Angeles%20Dec.%2020.%C2%A0&object_type=article&object_uuid=06rYN6FMyXbzFrY67YVMgvG&short_url=aR800X&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">It will open on Dec. 13 in NYC and in Los Angeles Dec. 20.&nbsp;</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

Given the ease of finding a potential partner on one's phone, apps may be easier than in-person dating for single parents who don't have a lot of time to invest in dating. Plus, single parents can look for other parents using filters, or easily express in their bio that they have kids. There are even dating apps specifically for single parents, like <a href="https://zdcs.link/6gNWd?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3B%3Btemplate=roundup&amp%3B%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3B%3Belement=offer&amp%3B%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3B%3Belement_label=Stir&amp%3B%3Bobject_type=roundup&amp%3B%3Bobject_uuid=03ZWeHhFErV1qFKer84GmAU&amp%3B%3Bshort_url=6gNWd&amp%3B%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Froundup%2Fbest-dating-sites-for-single-parents-2024&amp%3Btemplate=gift_guide&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=Stir&amp%3Bobject_type=roundup&amp%3Bobject_uuid=03ZWeHhFErV1qFKer84GmAU&amp%3Bshort_url=6gNWd&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Froundup%2Fbest-dating-sites-for-single-parents-2024&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Stir&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=03ZWeHhFErV1qFKer84GmAU&short_url=6gNWd&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Stir</u></a>, where you can meet someone who shares your experience.</p><p>Dating apps specifically for single parents "take the pressure off the 'should I disclose?' question," said sexologist and single parent <a href="https://www.kaamnalive.com/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Kaamna Bhojwani</u></a>.

<p>Bhojwani said, however, that single parents should be extremely discerning when deciding which dating apps to get on. "As a single parent myself, I know that time and energy are at a premium and it's important to realize that all apps aren't the same in terms of their value propositions and outcomes. You're better off deciding up front where you are on the casual to serious spectrum and picking your apps accordingly," she said.</p><p>Bhojwani has found like-minded people on more "general" dating apps, where she declares she has kids. Beuerlein also said she and her clients are on general apps as opposed to ones focused on single parents, but there is one on our list that is specifically for single parents.</p><p>Neither of them cautioned against any specific app. Mashable, however, has found that users should avoid Zoosk.

<p>One is the Framework Laptop 13 (13th Gen Intel Core), a lightweight Windows laptop with replaceable, repairable parts.

This is important for outdoorsy types (which is sort of who this device is aimed at), as higher brightness makes it easier to use the watch in direct sunlight. </p><h2>Apple Watch Ultra vs. Apple Watch Ultra 2: Specs</h2><p>The Apple Watch Ultra has an Apple S8, dual-core processor, the first generation of Apple's ultra-wideband chip, with 32GB of storage; the Ultra 2 has the S9, dual-core processor, the second generation ultra-wideband chip, and 64GB of storage. It is a significant upgrade, but we bet a lot of users won't notice the difference. Personally, I jumped from a Series 6 to a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-watch-series-9-vs-watch-se" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Series 9 Apple Watch</a>, which is a far bigger leap in specs, and I did notice it was a little snappier, but it still wasn't a massive upgrade. </p><p>Other specs, such as dust and water resistance, the customizable action button on the side, and a multitude of sensors that track temperature, heart rate, and other metrics, have remained unchanged on the Ultra 2.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

        </a>
    </div>
<p>Bottom line: Yes, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 is fast, but the old model should also be plenty fast for most users. </p><p>One more thing: The Apple Watch Ultra 2 supports <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-watch-series-9-double-tap-launch" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple's Double Tap gesture</a>.

        </div>
    </div>
<p>The story here is again simple: The Ultra and the Ultra 2 have essentially the same health and fitness features. They both track your heart rate and sleep, as well as water depth, and temperature, among other metrics. Also, they both have crash and fall detection. </p><p>Curiously, the old Apple Watch Ultra wins on one count: It has a Blood Oxygen app, which is not present on newer Ultra 2 models in the U.S. due to Apple's <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-watch-blood-oxygen-redesign" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">legal issues</a> with medical tech company Masimo. </p><h2>Apple Watch Ultra vs. Apple Watch Ultra 2: Battery Life</h2><p>The Ultra has a standard battery life of 36 hours, and extended battery life of 60 hours in Low Power mode. The Ultra 2 improves on this slightly; it has the same standard battery life of 36 hours, but the extended battery life in Low Power mode is 72 hours. It's not much, but it is something to consider if you often take the watch for multi-day hikes or very long races. </p><h2>Apple Watch Ultra vs. Apple Watch Ultra 2: Should you upgrade?</h2><p>The Apple Watch Ultra 2 costs $799, and it's a good price, considering that sports watches from the likes of Garmin and Suunto often cost north of $1,000 (although these typically feature much higher battery life). Technically, the Apple Watch Ultra isn't for sale new anymore, but we still think it's worth trying to find a refurbished or a pre-owned unit since the original Ultra is pretty darn similar to the Ultra 2. </p>]]></content:encoded>

But for a robot vacuum to work on carpet, more suction power and concentrated airflow are required to uproot the debris embedded in those fibers.</p><h2>Do robot vacuums work on carpet?</h2><p>Yes, several robot vacuum cleaners do a pretty phenomenal job on carpets and rugs. In fact, the best robot vacuum brands such as iRobot, Roborock, Eufy, and Shark have been mastering the art for several years, particularly honing in on pet hair pickup and hair tangling in the roller brush. </p><p>For homes with varying floor types and a notable amount of foot traffic, buying the cheapest robot vacuum will likely create <em>more</em> hassle. Every time that bot gets stuck on a rug corner or welcomes you home to pet hair still visibly clinging to the living room carpet, you'll be tempted to do the job yourself &mdash;&nbsp;but rest assured that that's not an inevitable experience with every robovac.  </p><p>The best robot vacuums for carpet have powerful suction, of course, aided by brush roll systems designed to dig into low- and high-pile carpet to pinch hair and large chunks while simultaneously inhaling fine debris that a weaker robot vac would pass right over. The <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-choose-a-robot-vacuum" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">most common way</a> to measure suction power is in Pascals (though top contenders like iRobot and Shark just <em>have </em>to be different by not adhering to that method). When suction power in Pa is advertised, look for at least 5,000 Pa, and under no circumstances entertain anything lower than 4,000 Pa. For reference, robot vacuums at the premium end of the spectrum clock between 10,000 and 12,000 Pa.</p><p>Our top picks use automatic suction adjustment to customize cleaning based on floor type, leading to stronger cyclonic force on soft floors. All our picks also come with a self-emptying dock (or at least offer the option) to mitigate the frequency of trips to the trash bin, which would be a lot if the robovac is deep cleaning the amount of gunk from your carpets that it should be.</p><h2>Do robot vacuums go on sale for Prime Day?</h2><p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/early-october-prime-day-2024-robot-vacuum-deals" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Robot vacuums</a> are a huge category for <a href="https://mashable.com/article/october-prime-day-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Prime Day</a>. Buying a robot vacuum during the upcoming October sale is particularly strategic if carpet cleaning is your main priority.

Prime Day is your chance to score one of those premium high-powered vacs for a few hundred dollars less than usual.</p><p>Automatic emptying is also a crucial feature for homes with lots of carpet. While self-emptying has become much more affordable over the past few years, the vacuums with the best self-cleaning docks (some also <a href="https://%E2%88%9Ahttps://mashable.com/roundup/best-robot-vacuum-and-mop-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">wash and dry their own mopping pads</a>, if you're into that) will push your budget to the limit.

<p>To be more specific, Series 9 starts at $399, while the Ultra 2 has just one available model at $799. There are, of course, some hidden costs with the Series 9 that aren't present with the Ultra 2, which comes with all the possible bells and whistles you could want. With Series 9, adding extra flourishes like a stainless-steel case (the default is aluminum) and cellular LTE coverage can balloon the total cost up to a staggering $749, the same ballpark as the Ultra 2. </p><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/jogML?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20Watch%20Series%209&object_type=article&object_uuid=04S2DFLk3UJ7fWBPQhPuchJ&short_url=jogML&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><strong>Apple Watch Series 9</strong></a> (starting price): $399</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/710Yy?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20Watch%20Series%20Ultra&object_type=article&object_uuid=04S2DFLk3UJ7fWBPQhPuchJ&short_url=710Yy&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><strong>Apple Watch Series Ultra</strong></a><strong>:</strong> $799</p></li></ul><p>At that point, why not just get an Ultra 2, right?

<p>For this category, we'll just stick with the inherent design features of each device because going through every single permutation would take forever.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Ultra 2 is one step ahead. Its titanium case is going to be more durable than the aluminum and stainless steel options on Series 9, though that may not matter if you're not a hiker or athlete. Meanwhile, the Ultra 2's 49mm case is slightly bigger than the 45mm or 41mm varieties of the Series 9. This means the display is also ever-so-slightly larger, offering more screen real estate than the Series 9. </p><p>The real secret weapon in the Ultra 2's arsenal, though, is the programmable action button on the watch's side. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>You can make it activate pretty much any app shortcut you want &mdash; the Series 9 doesn't have this button at all. It's arguably the one feature the Ultra 2 has that is useful to <em>everyone</em>, not just people who enjoy hiking, so it's a bummer that the Series 9 doesn't have it.</p><p><strong>Winner: Ultra 2</strong></p><h2>Apple Watch Series 9 vs. Ultra 2 features</h2><p>A look at Apple's official comparison website for the different Apple Watch models is illuminating.

Health features are also the same across the board, with both watches supporting blood oxygen monitoring, ECG, heart rate notifications, skin temperature sensing, and cycle tracking. </p><p>The differences lie in the margins, and of course, the Ultra wins again by default. It comes with LTE built-in (it's an optional add-on for Series 9) and can sink to a depth of 100m underwater, 50m more than Series 9. It's also got a depth gauge and water temperature sensor, so diving fanatics don't have much of a choice here. Oh, and there's an emergency siren on Ultra 2 for, well, emergencies.

<p>Series 9 has a runtime of up to <strong>18 hours</strong> on a full charge and up to <strong>36 hour</strong>s on low-power mode. </p><p>Ultra 2 is rated for literally twice that much: <strong>36 hours</strong> by default and <strong>72 hours</strong> on low-power mode.

Apple Watch Ultra 2 is bigger, more durable, longer-lasting, and has more features than Series 9. It's also not for everyone.</p><p>Ultra 2 is definitely made with outdoorsy adventuring types in mind. It's for people who might feasibly get lost in the woods or need to measure depth while diving in the ocean. I am certainly not one of those people and I'd venture to guess you might not be either. If that's the case, there's nothing wrong with Apple Watch Series 9; it's cheaper and has almost all of the same software features as Ultra 2. </p><p>But still, this is a competition and someone has to win. Congratulations, Apple.</p><p><strong>Winner: Apple Watch Ultra 2 (but Series 9 is fine for most people, too)</strong></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>We know nothing compares to the feel of a book in your hands as you thumb through page after enticing page. Yet, even if you're a ride-or-die bibliophile whose favorite smell is that of a bookstore (<em>guilty</em>), Kindles have undeniable benefits. You no longer have to pack 10 different books when going on vacation because you never know which book will suit your mood at any given time. You can also read poolside or at the beach without worrying about damaging your precious books.</p><h2>Will Kindles go on sale during October Prime Day?</h2><p>As one of Amazon's flagship devices &mdash;&nbsp;who else is old enough to remember when Amazon was primarily a bookseller? &mdash; you'd think that <a href="https://mashable.com/category/prime-day" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Prime Day</a> would be the best time to buy a Kindle.

Words can be made from linked letters &mdash; up, down, left, right, or diagonal, but words can also change direction, resulting in quirky shapes and patterns. Every single letter in the grid will be part of an answer. There's always a theme linking every solution, along with the "spangram," a special, word or phrase that sums up that day's theme, and spans the entire grid horizontally or vertically.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>By providing an opaque hint and not providing the word list, Strands creates a brain-teasing game that takes a little longer to play than its other games, like <a href="https://mashable.com/category/wordle" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Wordle</a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/category/connections" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Connections</a>.</p><p>If you're feeling stuck or just don't have 10 or more minutes to figure out today's puzzle, we've got all the NYT Strands hints for today's puzzle you need to progress at your preferred pace.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>What is Connections?</h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. Like <em>Wordle, </em>you can share the results with your friends on social media.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

      <description><![CDATA[An EU court says Meta cannot target ads based on a user's perceived sexual orientation.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00WfApbnBHj0Taxh4Oc2kAA/hero-image.jpg" alt="A user scans Facebook on their phone."><p>Meta cannot target a user&rsquo;s sexual orientation in its personalized ads &mdash; even if they are openly queer and make public statements about the subject, the European Union&rsquo;s highest court ruled Friday.</p><p>The case was brought from longtime Meta antagonist Max Schrems, as <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/meta-cant-use-sexual-orientation-to-target-ads-in-the-eu-court-rules/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Wired</em> reports</a>. The Austrian activist, whose separate privacy case recently <a href="https://mashable.com/article/meta-data-eu-record-breaking-fine-billion" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">led to a $1.3 billion fine</a> against the company, claimed in this case that Meta broke EU privacy laws by pulling data on his sexual orientation via website visits, app logins, and other sources outside of Facebook, using all that data to target him with LGBTQ-specific ads. </p><p>Meta denies it engages in this practice. The company says it considers information on sexual orientation sensitive, and doesn&rsquo;t indiscriminately include it in its advertising efforts. </p><p>When Schrems first took his claim to court, an Austrian judge ruled Meta has a right to target Schrems with ads related to his sexual orientation since he previously discussed being gay during a public panel discussion. But the judge also sent Schrems' case up to the EU legal system for its ruling. </p><p>Now the Court of Justice of the European Union has disagreed with the Austrian court, saying public statements aren&rsquo;t a green light for tech companies like Meta to target sensitive ads to users. </p><p>The EU court also backed up Schrems&rsquo; assertion that Meta just doesn't pull data from users&rsquo; activity on their social media services, but also considers their behavior elsewhere on the internet. </p><h2>'Meta's data pool is growing every day'</h2><p>Even if Meta can detect that a user is queer from their online or offline activities, the court said, they cannot take that information and use it to target them with personalized advertising.&nbsp;</p><p>In a statement, Meta said it takes privacy very seriously. The company added that it offers settings for users to control how information about them is used. </p><p>Schrems' lawyer, Katharina Raabe-Stuppnig, said the court&rsquo;s ruling will increase limits and controls on Meta&rsquo;s data-gathering.</p><p>"Meta has basically been building a huge data pool on users for 20 years now, and it is growing every day," Raabe-Stuppnig said in a statement, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/austrian-activist-schrems-wins-privacy-case-meta-personal-114492941#:~:text=Schrems%20had%20complained%20that%20Facebook,was%20during%20a%20panel%20discussion." target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">according to ABC News</a>. "However, EU law requires 'data minimisation' ... following this ruling, only a small part of Meta&rsquo;s data pool will be allowed to be used for advertising &mdash; even when users consent to ads."</p><p>Schrems' claims may seem like small potatoes. But there are enormous safety risks for LGBTQ+ people online if they are outed by targeted ads, especially in countries where homosexuality and bisexuality is illegal, and transgender people are already targeted for violence. </p><p>There may be money to be made by tech companies from deducing someone&rsquo;s sexual orientation &mdash; since that individual may be more prone to buy certain goods and services &mdash; companies cannot put people&rsquo;s lives and livelihoods at risk for that financial advantage, at least in the EU.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/06vOOWOlHYd5riwitwB3QDH/hero-image.jpg" alt="A person holding a cell phone in front of the Meta AI logo displayed on a computer screen, on April 29, 2024, in Edmonton, Canada."><p>Meta just announced a new generative AI model to help users turn simple text into images, videos, and audio clips. </p><p><a href="https://mashable.com/category/meta" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Meta</a> Movie Gen allows users to input text and automatically generate new videos, personalize videos, do video editing, and generate audio, all of which is trained on a "combination of licensed and publicly available datasets." </p><p>If that seems a lot like <a href="https://mashable.com/article/openai-sora-ai-text-to-video-model-announcement" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">OpenAI's Sora</a>, that's because it is quite similar. But Movie Gen builds upon Meta's previous work with AI &mdash; you might remember, or even use, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/meta-connect-2024-llama-ai-updates" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Llama Image</a>, for instance. But Movie Gen is the third wave of its generative AI work, which Meta says combines all of its previous modalities. "Similar to previous generations," <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/movie-gen-media-foundation-models-generative-ai-video/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Meta wrote in a blog post</a>, "we anticipate these models enabling various new products that could accelerate creativity."</p><p>Meta notes that "generative AI isn't a replacement for the work of artists and animators," but says the company "believe[s] in the power of this technology to help people express themselves in new ways and to provide opportunities to people who might not otherwise have them."</p><p>"Our hope is that perhaps one day in the future, everyone will have the opportunity to bring their artistic visions to life and create high-definition videos and audio using Movie Gen," the blog post reads.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>The entire post about this new technology is focused on the future, noting that you can't actually use Movie Gen yet. </p><p>Chris Cox, Meta&rsquo;s chief product officer, <a href="https://www.threads.net/@chriscox/post/DAtB1-EvyY-" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">wrote on Threads</a> that the company isn't "ready to release this as a product anytime soon &mdash; it's still expensive and generation time is too long &mdash; but we wanted to share where we are since the results are getting quite impressive."</p><p>The company said it was looking to tweak the model in the lead-up to it hitting the public.</p><p>"As we continue to improve our models and move toward a potential future release, we'll work closely with filmmakers and creators to integrate their feedback," Meta wrote in the blog post. "By taking a collaborative approach, we want to ensure we're creating tools that help people enhance their inherent creativity in new ways they may have never dreamed would be possible. Imagine animating a 'day in the life' video to share on Reels and editing it using text prompts, or creating a customized animated birthday greeting for a friend and sending it to them on WhatsApp. With creativity and self-expression taking charge, the possibilities are infinite."</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>In these final days before Prime Big Deal Days, the Instant Pot deals aren't all that thrilling. However, it's nice to see the Instant Pot RIO on sale, as it is one of the newer additions to the Instant Pot multi-cooker family. This wide model allows for more area for searing meat &mdash; overcrowding is the enemy of browning (and therefore, flavor), so giving users the ease of cooking while minimizing the need to cook in batches. While it doesn't have an air frying function like the Instant Pot Duo Crisp, it also costs a bit less (at the time of writing, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/zEVyJo?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=six-quart%20Duo%20Crisp&object_type=article&object_uuid=00FSTsG4VURSdaPoBrpPjFb&short_url=zEVyJo&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">six-quart Duo Crisp</a> is $150 on sale). Instant also added a cooking progress display to the RIO, allowing the more impatient among us to check the progress of their dinner with ease.</p><h3>More Instant deals at Amazon</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/z6bXXq?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Instant%20Pot%20Duo%207-in-1%20Mini%20%283-quart%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=00FSTsG4VURSdaPoBrpPjFb&short_url=z6bXXq&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 Mini (3-quart)</a> &mdash; <strong>$69.99</strong> <s>$79.99</s> (save $10)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qm2V26?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Instant%20Vortex%20Plus%20%286-quart%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=00FSTsG4VURSdaPoBrpPjFb&short_url=Qm2V26&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Instant Vortex Plus (6-quart)</a> &mdash; <strong>$99.99</strong> <s>$119.99</s> (save $20)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/QPby7m?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Instant%20Pot%20Duo%20Plus%20%286-quart%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=00FSTsG4VURSdaPoBrpPjFb&short_url=QPby7m&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Instant Pot Duo Plus (6-quart)</a> &mdash; <strong>$99.99</strong> <s>$149.95</s> (save $49.96)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/zjGoP1?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Instant%20Pot%20RIO%20%287.5-quart%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=00FSTsG4VURSdaPoBrpPjFb&short_url=zjGoP1&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Instant Pot RIO (7.5-quart)</a> &mdash; <strong>$119</strong> <s>$129.99</s> (save $10.99)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/a0Xbnw?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Instant%20Pot%20Duo%20Plus%20%288-quart%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=00FSTsG4VURSdaPoBrpPjFb&short_url=a0Xbnw&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Instant Pot Duo Plus (8-quart)</a> &mdash; <strong>$138.95</strong> <s>$169.95</s> (save $31)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/92by4L?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Instant%20Dual%20Pod%20Plus%20Coffee%20Maker&object_type=article&object_uuid=00FSTsG4VURSdaPoBrpPjFb&short_url=92by4L&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Instant Dual Pod Plus Coffee Maker</a> &mdash; <strong>$156.54</strong> <s>$229.99</s> (save $73.45)</p></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The IRS is also enhancing Direct File for the 2025 tax season by adding a chatbot to guide taxpayers through the agency's eligibility checker and covering new tax situations. </p><p>This year, taxpayers could use Direct File if they had simple returns, which excluded those with gig economy or business income, itemized deductions, and credits like the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/help/ita/am-i-eligible-to-claim-the-child-and-dependent-care-credit" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>child and dependent care credit</u></a> or <a href="https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-savings-contributions-savers-credit" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>saver's credit</u></a>. </p><p>In 2025, taxpayers claiming the child and dependent care credit, premium tax credit, credit for the elderly and disabled, and retirement savings contribution credits will be eligible. Additionally, Direct File will expand to support taxpayers with retirement income, 1099s for interest greater than $1,500, the 1099 for the Alaska Permanent Fund dividend, and deductions for health savings accounts will be eligible. </p><p>"Above all, our goal is to improve the experience of tax filing itself and help taxpayers meet their obligations quickly and easily," IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-direct-file-set-to-expand-availability-in-a-dozen-new-states-and-cover-wider-range-of-tax-situations-for-the-2025-tax-filing-season" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">said in a statement</a>.  </p><p>Taxpayers who used Direct File this year largely reported positive experiences, <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p5969.pdf" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">according to an IRS survey</a> of more than 15,000 participants.

They particularly liked that the software was easy to use, trustworthy, and free. </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[Millions of people got invested in the saga of a woman who found a strange rug buried in a hole in her yard. The police even started digging after cadaver dogs seemed to get a hit.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/04XXB7lAdFfzX8o3xDTssiw/hero-image.jpg" alt="three screenshots of tiktoks. left of a hole with a rug in it. center of a woman talking to the camera. right of two cops looking into hole."><p><a href="https://mashable.com/category/tiktok" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">TikTok</a> loves a good true crime mystery. It's not uncommon for folks to go viral over <a href="https://www.indy100.com/tiktok/tiktoker-secret-room-250-year-old-flat" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">somewhat</a> <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2021/03/i-want-the-secret-room-in-the-viral-candyman-tiktok.html" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">creepy</a> stories where viewers can try to guess what happened.  </p><p>The latest viral series involves a buried rug, cadaver dogs, and lots of theories from TikTok. In short, folks online were enthralled by the story of a woman who found a rug buried in her backyard. They wondered if she perhaps had found a body or if there was some much more innocent explanation.</p><p>Friday afternoon, we <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@katiesantry/video/7421979440080620846" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">finally got an answer</a>: there was no body. But there remains a lot to explain about how this situation went <em>so </em>viral. </p><p>We've got the full breakdown. </p><h2>What happened with the buried rug?</h2><p>It all started with then-relatively obscure TikTokker Katie Santry, a woman in Columbus, Ohio, posting a TikTok four days ago. In the video, Santry wondered if her house was haunted, citing her laptop getting shattered and her workspace disturbed overnight, seemingly without explanation. </p><blockquote class="tiktok-embed" data-video-id="7420108701937274155" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;">
    <section></section>
</blockquote>

<p>Toward the end of the video, Santry mentioned that she and her boyfriend also recently discovered a rug buried in their backyard while digging to install a fence. That TikTok got more than 4 million views, which led to a series of followups. The next video, for instance, racked up 10 million views as it showed the actual rug in the ground. </p><blockquote class="tiktok-embed" data-video-id="7420142482689625387" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;">
    <section></section>
</blockquote>

<p>As these things are wont to do, each forthcoming installment added bits of info and racked up tons of views. For instance, a <a href="https://www.plantingtree.com/products/bloodgood-japanese-maple" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Bloodgood</a> tree was planted over where they found the rug, which, of course, people found creepy. After the comment section insisted, Santry tried to dig some more, but the rug was too big and too long for her to dig out. She was going to leave it as it was, but after a while the comment section <em>then</em> convinced her to call the police. </p><h2>What happened with the cops and cadaver dogs? </h2><p>The police came out and apparently told Santry it did seem weird, but there wasn't much to do. Santry kept digging, both literally and figuratively. She enlisted friends to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@katiesantry/video/7421338026972073262" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">help dig</a> in the backyard <em>and </em><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@katiesantry/video/7421170897182002475" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">got in touch</a> with family members of the previous owners of the home. </p><p>But eventually the professionals got involved again. Santry said that the local homicide department got in touch and sent more officers to the property, including cadaver dogs. Santry said both dogs sat by the hole in the ground, indicating they had found something. </p><blockquote class="tiktok-embed" data-video-id="7421703219077713194" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;">
    <section></section>
</blockquote>

<p>That would seemingly indicated something strange was going on in the backyard, which, of course, all of TikTok found disconcerting. Meanwhile, Santry's account ballooned to 1.6 million followers as tons of people anxiously followed along. </p><h2>What has Santry said about it all?</h2><p>The newly famous Ohio woman did an <a href="https://people.com/woman-discovers-rug-buried-in-her-lawn-convinced-dead-body-exclusive-8722309" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">interview with <em>People</em></a> about the situation that published on Thursday.</p><p>"The Internet is about 50/50 on whether it's a dead body or an animal, and maybe 10% think this was just a junkyard," she said. "However, we've dug a lot of posts and fenced in most of our yard at this point, and I can say we haven't come across any other rugs. So, the Internet thinks it&rsquo;s either a junkyard, a dead body, or a dead dog."</p><p>Though Santry said she didn't think it was a body. </p><p>"I truly don't think there's a dead body down there," Santry told <em>People</em>. "The curiosity about why that rug is there definitely haunts me. But my biggest concern is my computer because, at the end of the day, it shattered for no apparent reason. That leaves me with the most question marks. I actually have a psychic who reached out to me and wants to do a reading."</p><h2>So, what's in the rug?</h2><p>Developments in the strange situation continued to roll in through Santry's TikTok account. Friday morning she <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@katiesantry/video/7421911849500675371" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">posted</a> videos saying that a bunch of officers had come over to her house and were prepared to dig. </p><p>Around 11 a.m. ET she posted a video saying the digging had begun. Clearly a bit shaken, Santry seemed to be ready for the whole ordeal to conclude. </p><p>"We don't know anything yet," she said. "My goal is that we can all laugh about it tomorrow. We're all going to say, 'Huh, this was a funny, silly-goose waste of time."</p><blockquote class="tiktok-embed" data-video-id="7421979440080620846" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;">
    <section></section>
</blockquote>

<p>And by about 2 p.m. ET, Santry revealed on TikTok that the cops had found only the rug, some rubber, and nothing else of consequence. It's not clear why the dogs got a hit in the yard, but it doesn't seem to be for any nefarious reason. She still wondered what happened to her laptop, but there was definitely a sense of relief. </p><p>"There's no body. There's no body," she said. "Honestly, let's praise the lord there's no body. I can stay in my house." </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>That said, there's one noteworthy 2-in-1 laptop deal up for grabs there <em>outside</em> of the official Prime Big Deal Days programming (i.e., its not featured on its <a href="https://zdcs.link/aAVdV0?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=event%20page&object_type=article&object_uuid=05I14Zp4JySSpQkYHWfn8TX&short_url=aAVdV0&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">event page</a>), and it's a $105 discount on the Mashable Choice Award-winning <a href="https://zdcs.link/ak7nnY?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Asus%20Zenbook%20Duo&object_type=article&object_uuid=05I14Zp4JySSpQkYHWfn8TX&short_url=ak7nnY&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Asus Zenbook Duo</a>, our favorite <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-windows-laptops-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">dual-screener</a>.</p><p>According to the price-tracking site <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0CRD1QRF4" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">camelcamelcamel.com</a>, this isn't some new deal Amazon just whipped out; the Zenbook Duo has been sitting at the same price since late September.

The EDA Scan app detects electrodermal activity (aka a stress meter). The ECG app, which is only available in certain countries and intended for people who are 22 or older, checks heart rhythm for signs of atrial fibrillation, and the built-in GPS lets you track your runs without your phone. The battery lasts six days on a full charge, and the fast-charge function gives you a full day's worth of use after just 12 minutes of charging (up to 12 hours with GPS mode on). It's since been replaced by the Sense 2, but is still a pretty solid smartwatch &mdash;&nbsp;especially for this price.

<p>The survey looked at how male and female participants differed in their responses. One question asked, "Would it be a dealbreaker for someone you were interested in to use a non-Apple phone?" Thirty-one percent of men said yes; 16 percent of women said the same.</p><h2><strong>Android users felt marginalized, according to survey</strong></h2><p>The survey discovered that 52 percent of Android users were "made fun of at some point" by iPhone users for their mobile device; 36 percent said they were "negatively judged."

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/roundups/06JAMISLVAAmyv3sCo1TNsi/hero-image.png" alt="Items from the brands Bitty Boomers, Furreal, Kindle, National Geographic overlaid on a reddish-orange background"><p>Finding the best gift for a kid requires attention to detail &mdash; and an ear for their reactions to various toy commercials.</p><p>Kids can be <em>particular</em>. The things kids like change not just with age, but also with evolving trends from TV shows and new technology. If parents are lucky enough, their kid will write a long list of the precise items they'd like as a birthday gift or a Christmas gift and put it up on the fridge in pride &mdash; but sometimes, it can be as much of a crapshoot as coming up with a gift idea for someone else's kid.</p><p>Instead of buying yet another random stuffed animal, here are some tips on how to successfully zone in on the best gifts for kids of all ages.</p><h2>What to get for a toddler</h2><p>Everyone is familiar with the "terrible twos" rep that the not-a-baby-but-not-yet-an-independent-kid stage of development gets. At this age, kids are bouncing constantly between the desire to explore on their own and the reliance on parents for most basic needs like eating, getting dressed, or going to the bathroom. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/12/the-myth-of-the-terrible-twos/548282/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">That's a </a><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/12/the-myth-of-the-terrible-twos/548282/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>lot</em></a><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/12/the-myth-of-the-terrible-twos/548282/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"> of frustrating emotions to go through in a day</a>. Kitchen play sets, toys that involve different motor skills, and anything with music are gifts that can let toddlers feel in charge without <em>too</em> much assistance from a parent &mdash;&nbsp;making them ideal for this age category.</p><h2>What to get for elementary and middle school kids</h2><p>Potentially a more daunting phase than the terrible twos: The one where the pressure to be cool is relentless. <a href="https://www.scholastic.com/parents/family-life/social-emotional-learning/development-milestones/emotional-lives-8-10-year-olds.html" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">This is that age</a>. Though "cool" can lend itself to multiple interpretations, gifts that contribute to an older kid's evolving critical thinking skills and sense of independence, responsibility, and style are all smart ideas. These could be anything from STEM toys to beginner's makeup tools to a fitness tracker or a pretend pet that encourages routine-making.

The one thing we don't appreciate, however, is its $100 steeper price tag. This discount ahead of Prime Day certainly helps, though, knocking it down to just $752.38 instead of $799. Just <a href="https://mashable.com/article/made-by-google-2024-what-to-expect-pixel-9-pro-fold-watch-buds" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">released at the end of August</a>, this is its biggest discount to date.</p><h3>More Google Pixel deals</h3><p><em>There are currently no other Pixel phone deals available at Amazon, aside from a few from sketchy third-party sellers. We'll keep an eye out for more to drop as Prime Day nears.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

Amazon happens to be one of them with their <a href="https://mashable.com/review/amazon-echo-buds-2-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">2021 Amazon Echo Buds</a>. They provide excellent noise cancellation and are compatible with any system.</p><p>Normally $139.99, they're already a steal for a pair of earbuds with active noise cancellation.

It has a vintage look with the stylish gold script logo and textured front, but that doesn't distract from its functionality.

It&rsquo;s so small that you can fold it up and pop it into your jacket pocket. The 4K EIS camera (with Sony CMOS sensor) can capture 12mp stills and 30fps HD video. Plus, the ShakeVanish technology makes for a smooth shot even when there&rsquo;s a lot of movement. </p><p>The Potensic Atom SE has four flight modes, including a beginner mode that adjusts the drone&rsquo;s speed and stability for newbies. It can last for up to 62 minutes on a single charge and has an auto-fly back function in case you lose sight of it (or if it loses signal or is about to run out of juice). </p><h2>Best budget pick </h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>You've got a lot of options if you're looking to buy a <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-smartwatches" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">smartwatch</a>. Sure, you might be tempted to go for an Apple Watch, but if you don't use an iPhone you might not be so keen on losing out on many of its features. Samsung has its own lineup of smartwatches to choose from, however, and they're not so shabby themselves. And if you want to lock one in right now, whether for yourself or someone else this holiday season, you'll want to snatch up this deal from Amazon. </p><p>As of Oct. 4, you can get the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qrpdwn?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%20Galaxy%20Watch%207&object_type=article&object_uuid=02TtPP33BSIciMfFRvAOA1c&short_url=Qrpdwn&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7</a> at Amazon for just $262.72. That's $67.27 off its normal price of $329.99 and a discount of 20%. It's also the <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0D1YQ3MML" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">lowest price we've seen</a> this watch go for, though this price currently only applies to the Green colorway and 44mm size. </p><p>This smart watch is rife with plenty of the features you'd want from a wearable, from heart rate tracking to sleep and workout tracking as well as a host of "wellness tips" and a readiness score to help you stay at your best. It can even detect whether you suffer from sleep apnea and help you establish better habits when it comes to getting more sleep. It also uses Galaxy AI to help you improve on your best in terms of your regular runs or bike rides so you can get better over time. </p><p>As far as normal smartwatch functions, you can answer calls, text, and use a host of different apps on the watch as you'd expect. Galaxy AI can help you with suggested text replies, you can stream your favorite songs and podcasts, and keep your day top of mind with a built-in calendar. Grab yours before it goes back up in price. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Not a single one.</p><p>In fact, the retail giant's <a href="https://mashable.com/article/early-october-prime-day-2024-laptop-deals" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">laptop deals</a> are currently scant across the board. A few configurations of the M3-powered Apple <a href="https://mashable.com/article/early-october-prime-day-2024-apple-macbook-deals" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">MacBook</a> Pro have dipped to their previous all-time lows there. But aside from that, the <em>one</em> Windows model that Amazon previously featured in a "limited-time deal" ahead of the event has since returned to its full sticker price.

<p>With that in mind, anyone hunting for a good deal on a Chromebook has two options at present. One, of course, is to simply wait for Prime Big Deal Days to start; Amazon could be reserving some doorbusters for the kickoff. For less patient shoppers, the other option is defecting to another retailer like Best Buy, or to OEMs like Acer, Asus, HP, and Lenovo, where Chromebook deals are more plentiful at the time of writing. </p><p>Keep in mind that these alternatives might also roll out better deals when Prime Big Deal Days goes live, in order to compete with it. (For its part, Best Buy has a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-buy-october-prime-day-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">48-Hour Flash Sale</a> planned for Oct. 8 and 9.) But if time is of the essence, keep reading: We're keeping a running list of the best early October Prime Day Chromebook deals across the web, none of which you'll see on Amazon right now.</p><h2>Best Chromebook deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

(We'll be crossing out events as they wrap up.) </p><ul><li><p><strong><s>Exclusive Member Sale: </s></strong><s>From Sept. 27 to 29, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aAV515?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Best%20Buy%20Plus%20and%20My%20Best%20Total%20members&object_type=article&object_uuid=06IsZgMyce5vMoHZGr5NU3x&short_url=aAV515&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Best Buy Plus and My Best Total members</a></s><s> will get exclusive access to offers on big tech items like laptops and TVs &mdash; huge, because we actually prefer Best Buy's selection (and reliability) of deals on premium <a href="https://mashable.com/article/when-to-buy-a-laptop" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">laptops</a></s><s> and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-time-to-buy-a-tv" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">TVs</a></s><s> to Amazon's.

<p>By the end of October, expect Best Buy to be in full Black Friday mode. The retailer didn't mention this in certain terms, but context clues tell us everything: <a href="https://zdcs.link/ak7v3Y?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Last%20year&object_type=article&object_uuid=06IsZgMyce5vMoHZGr5NU3x&short_url=ak7v3Y&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Last year</a>, Best Buy's Black Friday sale began with early access for paid members on Oct. 27, then opened up to everyone on Oct. 30.</p><p>Though Best Buy's most robust selection of savings this month will certainly happen during its 48-hour Flash Sale on Oct. 8 and 9, the preceding week is still prime time to find some early deals.

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>If you're still riding with Baby's First 4K TV from 2018, you're probably putting up with the laggiest interface ever. Rather than throwing it out the window once and for all, <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/services/recycling/pcmcat149900050025.c?id=pcmcat149900050025" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">recycle it at a Best Buy location</a> and then finally make that upgrade to a nice, new QLED. This 65-inch model from TCL isn't the intimidating investment a lot of us associate with QLED &mdash;&nbsp;it's on sale for far under $500 &mdash;&nbsp;but still provides significantly boosted brightness and color compared to a regular LED TV, plus HDR compatibility. </p><h2>Best Apple deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

Nope. But they do an excellent job with sound quality and noise cancellation, especially considering the affordable sale price. The ear cups are made with a soft memory foam so you'll be comfortable for all-day wear, and they get about 60 hours of playtime before you'll need to recharge. You'll also get a convenient travel pouch with the headphones for easy storage.</p><h2>Best home security deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>The Shark SpeedStyle is compact, includes three attachments, and doesn&rsquo;t skimp on performance. This little thing regulates temperature 1,000 times a second and won&rsquo;t get hotter than 230 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><p>The ionizer technology helps reduce frizz, while the RapidGloss Finisher attachment gives you a smooth, salon-style finish. Press the Cool Shot button to set your style, and you're good to go. As for the lower price tag, you're sacrificing a few bells and whistles compared to the Dyson, but who <em>really </em>needs to pay triple the price for a hair dryer? </p>]]></content:encoded>

<h3>Why we like it </h3><p>When it comes to casual home or dorm room use, most of us want the same, simple thing in a printer: one that's easy to set up, easy to use, and not $200. The HP Envy 6455e is a classic choice, and its massive 40% discount at Amazon brings it below $90. It's a wireless color inkjet printer that can also can, copy, and fax. To save you even more money, this version of the Envy also comes with three months&rsquo; worth of ink through HP+. You just have to activate your subscription to get it; it's pretty easy to do through the app.</p><h2>Best printer deal for business </h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>The Kindle Paperwhite, our <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-kindles" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">top pick for reading outside</a>, is finally back on sale as part of an essentials bundle. It comes with a fabric case and a power adapter all for just $134.97, down from $204.97. That's 34% in savings and less than buying the Kindle device on its own. The Paperwhite features a 6.8-inch glare-free display with adjustable warm light and IPX8 waterproofing.

<p>Our friends at <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/marshall-emberton-ii" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">PCMag</a> (also owned by Ziff Davis) tested the Marshall Emberton II and found it to be "a stylish waterproof Bluetooth speaker that sounds solid." It has a longer battery life than its predecessor and is more durable, but otherwise isn't a major upgrade. It has a tough time at extreme volumes, but mostly delivers a rich audio experience. The PCMag reviewer noted that regular retail price is a bit steep, so this 41% discount definitely makes it a better value. Slash $70 off and pick it up for just under $100 (its lowest price to date) ahead of Prime Day 2.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

The high-speed brushless motor and streamlined airflow offer powerful suction for such a small gadget, making it a breeze to suck up all the crumbs and dog hair plaguing your fabrics. It's regularly $129.99, but you can score it for only $79.99 in the rose gold shade ahead of Prime Big Deal Days.

<h2><strong>X contested the penalty</strong></h2><p>X challenged the fine in Australian court, but the court system upheld the charge. The company's side of the story is that, since Musk made X private in 2022, it's not obligated to abide by Australia's regulations. Australia disagreed &mdash; and now we're here. </p><p>Per NBC, Musk's social network and Australia have feuded in the past. The Aussie government <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/elon-musk-accuses-australia-censorship-court-bans-violent-video-rcna148915" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">ordered a takedown</a> of a violent stabbing video filmed in Australia, which Musk alleged was censorship. The post ultimately stayed up. It should be noted that Musk <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235213/x-brazil-suppression-speech-elon-musk-india-turkey" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">has not actually been that committed to free speech</a> on X since he took over. Specifically, X has historically complied with takedown requests from countries like Turkey and the United Arab Emirates.</p><p>We'll see if Australia's government ever gets that check.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The market for <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-earbuds" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">earbuds</a> has gotten more than competitive over the last couple of decades. You can find plenty of excellent, affordable buds that tick all the boxes you're looking for with a simple glance at Amazon. Bose remains one of the brands that continually pushes out quality audio gear, but you can typically expect to pay a pretty penny for what Bose has on offer. Luckily, there are also usually plenty of sales on Bose products, like this pre-Prime Day deal you're going to want to snatch up before it's out of stock. </p><p>As of Oct. 4, get the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qx7Pwx?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Bose%20Ultra%20Open%20Earbuds&object_type=article&object_uuid=03oVGyVRIHT7hwnOqWwWjlO&short_url=Qx7Pwx&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Bose Ultra Open Earbuds</a> for just $249 at Amazon. That's $50 off their normal price of $299 and a discount of 17%. That's the <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0CPFV77W4" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">lowest price we've seen</a> as well, though the price cut only applies to the Black, Moonstone Blue, and White colorways right now. </p><p>These buds are a bit unorthodox as they have open ear backs. They're flexible so you can wear them by hooking them around the back of your ear so you can hear your music, which might seem a little strange at first, but they do stay put. They're ultra light, and include Bose's immersive spatial audio support so you can get a little closer to your favorite songs. They boast IPX4 water resistance, let you switch seamlessly between multiple Bluetooth connections, and feature on-board controls so you can swap between devices and adjust volume or answer calls without using your phone. </p><p>These buds can be your constant companion as well, with up to 7 hours of play time and 48 hours of standby. Their charging case can net you up to an additional 2.5 full charges as well, so you're covered on the go too. They're an interesting way to experience some of your favorite audio-centric content, especially if you're looking for something a little different in the earbud department. At this price, don't pass them up. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Two-way audio on the camera means you can let the dog know you see what it's up to, should it choose chaos and start chewing on the couch. </p><p>You'll get alerts on your smartphone when motion is detected, or you can customize your notifications or detection zones. Setting up the Blink Mini includes plugging it into a power source and connecting it to your home's WiFi. </p><p>The Blink Mini usually costs $29.99, but thanks to this early October Prime Day deal, you can get the camera for just $17.99.

The OLED display will have a 1,170 x 2,532 pixel resolution, and it will probably be similar in size to the 6.1-inch display on the iPhone 14. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Yes, this also means that the iPhone SE 4 will lose the Home Button and get Face ID biometric recognition. While I personally am a little nostalgic about the Home Button, I do have to admit that Face ID works well and it's better to just get rid of the button and expand the display. </p><p>The iPhone SE 4 will also come with Apple's A18 chip &mdash; the same chip that powers the company's new <a href="https://mashable.com/review/iphone-16-and-iphone-16-plus" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">iPhone 16 and 16 Plus phones</a>. </p><div id="related-video" class="mx-auto mt-8 mb-12 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans md:mt-12 md:mb-16 text-primary-400">

<p>Furthermore &mdash; and this is perhaps the biggest surprise &mdash; the iPhone SE 4 will come with the same 48-megapixel rear camera, and the 12-megapixel front camera as you get on the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-iphone-15-plus-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">iPhone 15 and 15 Plus</a>. You will not, however, get additional cameras on the back; you'll have to make do with just a single rear camera. </p><p>Finally, the iPhone SE 4 will reportedly be the first phone to feature Apple's first 5G modem. This is notable as <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-intel-modems-acquisition-iphone" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple acquired Intel's modem business</a> back in 2019 to built its own modems, but nothing came out of it so far (Apple's iPhones still use Qualcomm modems). This should also have additional benefits to end users, as Apple's modem, which will handle 5G, Bluetooth, and WiFi connectivity, should be better integrated with Apple's hardware, resulting in better battery life. </p><p>While we have heard <a href="https://mashable.com/article/iphone-se-4-oled-display-rumor" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">some of these details before</a>, including Face ID support, and the new OLED display, the part about the cameras and the modem is new. </p><p>If all of this sounds exciting, we've got a bit of a downer for you: The iPhone SE 4 is unlikely to arrive this year. Instead, Apple will probably launch it in spring 2025. </p>]]></content:encoded>

As a large dominant bear, he earns access to the most productive fishing spots, allowing an already large bear to grow huge. </p><p>"By all ursine measures, Chunk has been successful. He's perhaps the largest bear at Brooks River," Mike Fitz, a former Katmai park ranger and currently a resident naturalist for <a href="http://explore.org" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">explore.org</a>, told Mashable. </p><p>Fitz estimates Chunk currently weighs 1,200 pounds.

<p>A single sockeye salmon can pack around 4,000 calories. So a bear like Chunk, who repeatedly catches fish in the Brooks River, eats&nbsp;tens of thousands of calories per day. But on Aug. 26, Chunk outdid himself. </p><p>Avid bear cam observers, who document bear behavior throughout the summer, informed Fitz that Chunk ate a whopping <em>45 salmon</em> in about 10.5 hours of fishing. Fitz has personally seen similar achievements, having <a href="https://mashable.com/article/fat-bear-week-747-biggest-bear" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">watched the giant Katmai bear 747</a> consume 15 salmon in three hours. </p><q>
    "This is direct evidence of his hard work and success in preparation for winter hibernation."
    </q>
<p>The calories in each fish Chunk consumed likely varied this late in the season, as some fish have spawned (releasing eggs into a stream bed), and some haven't. Fitz estimates each fish contained an average of 3,000 calories. </p><p>"That would mean that Chunk consumed 135,000 calories in one day," Fitz marveled. "This is direct evidence of his hard work and success in preparation for winter hibernation."</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>These livestreamed cams capture an unfiltered view of bear behavior. Some of it is endearing, and sometimes it's harsh. </p><p>Chunk is often under the eye of the most watched camera, which is attached to a bear-viewing platform next to the river's waterfall. So his exploits are frequently observed. Earlier this summer, for reasons unknown, he attacked a cub that had fallen off the waterfall and passed near him in the river. In their hypercompetitive world, bears do sometimes <a href="https://mashable.com/article/brown-bear-cam-alaska-dark-side" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">attack each other</a> or younger bears, but the impetus can remain uncertain.</p><p>"We get to see their moments of joy," Fitz said in an online live chat discussing the attack. "However, the webcams are live, the footage is uncensored. We also see bears face hardship, hunger, injury, pain, and even death."</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-_IPCLVU3LlE"></div>
</div>


<p>In the coming month or so, Katmai's already rotund bears will continue to exploit any salmon left in the river. They'll lose up to one-third of their body weight during <a href="https://mashable.com/article/why-bears-hibernate-fat-bear-week" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">hibernation</a>, so the more fat accumulation, the better odds of survival. </p><p>Each year, the park celebrates the success of these animals in their wild realm, an online event called <a href="https://mashable.com/series/fat-bear-week" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Fat Bear Week</a>.

<p>Dyson has a reputation for innovative engineering, and when these shiny new cans first dropped, I asked, "Can Dyson do for headphones what it's done for vacuums and hair dryers?"

<h2>Let's talk about the sound</h2><p>Here's the headline: The sound rocks. I've previously tested the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones</a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/review/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">earbuds</a> for Mashable, and I've personally used Beats, Apple, and Jabra products in the past. <strong>These are the best headphones I've tested yet.</strong></p><p>According to Dyson, &ldquo;Most headphones operate on a frequency range from 20 to 20,000 Hertz. Our technology expands that range, from 6 Hertz at the low end to 21,000 Hertz at the top." The brand says that results in improved bass, treble, and overall audio clarity, and I believe them.</p><p>These headphones sound superb, truly. They're the second-best audio experience I've ever heard. The only sound that beats it? <a href="https://xmems.com/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">xMems</a> ultrasonic audio technology, which isn't yet available to consumers. </p><p>The sound really does sound true to life, and I've been listening on the Bass Boost mode because I have weak hearing on the low end of the spectrum. I can appreciate entirely new details in some of my favorite songs, and I've been listening to more music than I have in years thanks to these headphones.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>If you want to disappear into a bubble of sound and enjoy your music to the fullest, these headphones deliver a powerful experience. The spatial audio isn't as advanced as what you get with the newest Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones, but the overall audio experience is mighty impressive.</p><h2>Noise cancellation: Also very impressive</h2><p>Dyson promises these headphones will deliver 40 decibels of noise cancellation. The over-ear headphones provide plenty of passive noise cancellation, and with active noise cancellation added to the mix, most ambient noises drop away like magic. It's not 100 percent noise cancellation, but it's very good.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

    </div>
<p>The noise cancellation works well on calls, too. During a test call, a friend was able to tell that I was calling on headphones, but they could barely hear the train passing in the near distance. </p><p>And did I mention you can listen to music with ANC engaged for up to 55 hours? Again, I say, holy shit.</p><h2>Comfort is king</h2><p>I won't expand too much on the comfort of these headphones because I don't need too many words to describe it: They're really comfortable. </p><p>Between the design of the headband and the ear cushions, I've had no problems with fatigue, weight distribution, or discomfort while listening to music. You could easily <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-noise-cancelling-headphones-for-flying" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">wear these for a cross-country flight</a> without issue. I found that I could angle the precise position of the ear cups, and the cups would stay firmly in that position, which added to the comfortable fit.</p><p>One drawback &mdash; they're not particularly comfortable around your neck, i.e. when you're <em>not</em> listening to music. So, I don't expect people to wear them as an accessory like you see with the Apple AirPods Max.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2>My biggest gripe: The clunky design</h2><p>For my Dyson OnTrac headphones review, I tried to set aside my feelings about the aesthetics and stay objective. But I have to say it: I hate that these headphones say "Dyson" prominently on the headband. <em>Both </em>sides of the headphones have the brand name above the cups. Unless I'm overpaying for a fancy new Burberry sweater, I <em>hate&nbsp;</em>when products have the brand name written on them.</p><p>Overall, I expect the aesthetics to be divisive, in a love-it or hate-it kind of way. Dyson embraced a chunkier design here, I suspect because of the camouflaged batteries in the headband. This contrasts with the slicker, more minimalist approach of other manufacturers. </p><h2>Controls and connectivity</h2><p>These headphones feature a mini joystick-like toggle that lets you control your music and volume. I found this a lot better than touch controls, and the headphones have proven to be super user-friendly. </p><p>The same goes for setup and the MyDyson app (the app tracks your usage and ambient sound exposure throughout the day). Unfortunately, they do fail in one respect: multipoint Bluetooth pairing.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 max-w-3xl">

But the other day, my shoulder was so sore from carrying around my bag, and my cord was so frayed my phone wouldn&rsquo;t even charge, so I ordered this <a href="https://zdcs.link/6be2q?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=wireless%20iPhone%20charger&object_type=article&object_uuid=03FgxtMhxmpZDlC6yanNhlt&short_url=6be2q&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">wireless iPhone charger</a>.</p><p>If you remember Apple&rsquo;s MagSafe Battery Pack (they discontinued it), it&rsquo;s almost identical to that, except it&rsquo;s way cheaper. You can get one for only $34.97 (reg. $119.95) through September 3 in white, black, or light blue.</p><h2>This gadget keeps my phone alive no matter what</h2><p>Instead of digging through my purse to find my brick of a power bank, I just grab this small battery pack and stick it to the back of my phone. When I&rsquo;m on the subway after work, using my car mount, or sitting at a restaurant, it's so nice not to worry about my ugly, frayed cord getting in the way.</p><p>I have the iPhone 13, but my friends with Androids can also use it as a <a href="https://zdcs.link/6be2q?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=portable%20wireless%20charging%20pad&object_type=article&object_uuid=03FgxtMhxmpZDlC6yanNhlt&short_url=6be2q&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">portable wireless charging pad</a> since it supports Qi-enabled devices. I&rsquo;m everyone&rsquo;s favorite friend when their phone is about to die.</p><p>Something important to note, though, is that if your case isn&rsquo;t MagSafe-compatible, it won&rsquo;t magnetically stick. So, if that&rsquo;s important to you, you&rsquo;ll have to get one, grab one of those sticky magnetic rings to make your case compatible (which is what I did), or pop your case off when you charge.</p><p>While I love this sleek, minimal wireless charger, my old clunker wins in terms of battery capacity. With 5,000mAh on board, I get about one and a half iPhone charges before I have to recharge this battery, but it&rsquo;s so incredibly lightweight that I think it&rsquo;s worth the effort.&nbsp;</p><p>Order your <a href="https://zdcs.link/6be2q?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=magnetic%20iPhone%20charger&object_type=article&object_uuid=03FgxtMhxmpZDlC6yanNhlt&short_url=6be2q&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">magnetic iPhone charger</a> while they&rsquo;re only $34.97 (reg. $119.95) until September 3 at 11:59 p.m. PT.

<p>There's so much wildlife to see after the sun sets. Once you have a pair of night vision binoculars, your hiking and birdwatching (or even Bigfoot hunting) adventures don't have to stop after dark.</p><p>Grab these <a href="https://zdcs.link/PbOpm?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=mini%20digital%20night%20vision%20binoculars&object_type=article&object_uuid=03isDMr3bhAs5lZrKNkYWxb&short_url=PbOpm&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">mini digital night vision binoculars</a> that also record video for just $89.97 (reg. $159.99) through September 3. That&rsquo;s 43% off.</p><h2>Your binoculars, but better (and cooler)</h2><p>Picture this: You&rsquo;re venturing down a new trail, and you hear a twig snap. Is it Bigfoot? A deer? Guess you&rsquo;ll never know &mdash; unless you pull out your new binoculars and take a closer look.

Your 1080p photos or videos are saved to the included 32GB TF card, so you can easily share them online.</p><p>When night rolls around, your view won&rsquo;t be compromised. Since you have night vision, you&rsquo;re basically an owl now. You can use the infrared illuminator during dusk or in complete darkness and see almost as far away as you would in the daylight. Imagine everything you&rsquo;ll spot &mdash; like an owl hunting for prey, scavenging porcupines, or Bigfoot. Okay, probably not that last one, but it's fun to hope.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

I was in a little caf&eacute; in Paris, and a beautiful man came up and introduced himself to me &mdash;&nbsp;in French.&nbsp;</p><p>Thankfully, I had downloaded the language-learning app before my friend's bachelorette trip to Paris. So I understood him. Mostly. The sparks flew instantly. I was so lucky to have stumbled across that <a href="https://zdcs.link/lwjXX?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Babbel%20lifetime%20deal&object_type=article&object_uuid=03PAMRbHrKd4zYz7WwxtrJQ&short_url=lwjXX&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Babbel lifetime deal</a> when I had. It was only $139.97, compared to $599, and I couldn&rsquo;t find a better price anywhere else.</p><h2>How French lessons became a love story</h2><p>After Louis and I met at the caf&eacute;, my friend kept calling Babbel the cupid of <a href="https://zdcs.link/lwjXX?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=language-learning%20apps&object_type=article&object_uuid=03PAMRbHrKd4zYz7WwxtrJQ&short_url=lwjXX&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">language-learning apps</a>. I didn&rsquo;t know how fluent I could become from an app, but with Louis&rsquo;s phone number in my pocket, I was determined to give it a chance.</p><p>I set a goal on Babbel to practice for 20 minutes daily and become as fluent as possible. Babbel has more than just the basic greetings &mdash; I learned to talk about my job, order in a bar, discuss environmental issues, and buy theater tickets.&nbsp;</p><p>But I was more than a little nervous for my date with Louis. What if I couldn&rsquo;t understand him? Or worse, what if <em>he</em> couldn&rsquo;t understand <em>me</em>?

Louis just told me I had an American accent.</p><p>When I got home, Louis and I promised to keep in touch. I took some live lessons through Babbel. While these are an additional cost, you get two free ones with this lifetime deal, which were tremendously helpful in boosting my confidence before Louis visited me in New York.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been using Babbel for about a year now, and when I saw that the lifetime subscription price was back down I had to encourage you to try it for yourself. You never know what doors it could open.</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/lwjXX?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Learn%20a%20new%20language&object_type=article&object_uuid=03PAMRbHrKd4zYz7WwxtrJQ&short_url=lwjXX&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Learn a new language</a> with a Babbel lifetime subscription on sale for $139.97 (reg. $599) through September 3 at 11:59 p.m. PT.

And if you're reading this article, you'll have the whole thing spoiled for you all over again. </p><p>In the first episode of Charlie Covell's Netflix series about the Greek myths, Eurydice (Aurora Perrineau) meets Cassandra (Billie Piper) at a supermarket, exchanging a few words with her in the cereal aisle. Moments later outside, Riddy sees Cassandra being apprehended by a security guard for shoplifting, a situation Riddy deescalates by paying for Cassandra's stolen cat food. But if you listen to what Cassandra says at this moment, she basically spoils the whole show.</p><p>"Everyone steals," she hisses. "Even the gods. <em>Especially </em>the gods. They're stealing our souls."</p><p>Problem is, no one ever listens to Cassandra. It's her whole thing.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>The prophet and Trojan princess of Greek mythology is said to have been pursued by Apollo, the sun god. He granted Cassandra the gift of prophecy, but when she didn't want to go on a date with him (ugh, entitled men), he added a cursed proviso to her talent. Though Cassandra would be able to warn people of what was coming, no one would believe her prophecies. "She shrieked and shouted out through all the city," Homer writes in <em>The Iliad</em> of Cassandra warning the Trojans about the coming sacking of their city.&nbsp;Turns out, the Ancient Greeks already knew the agony of women not being believed.</p><p>In this moment in <em>Kaos</em>, when Cassandra tells Eurydice the gods are stealing human souls, it's absolutely accurate, as the series reveals later. Hades' all-important Frame in the Underworld doesn't generate Renewal (reincarnation) as people on Earth are told it does; instead, their souls are sucked up into Olympus' water supply, to be drunk by the greedy gods for their restorative powers.</p><p>And though it takes the entire series for Riddy and her newfound fav Caeneus (Misia Butler) to figure it out, Cassandra tried to tell us all along. "Nobody wants to know!" she cries. "Why won't anyone listen?"</p><p><strong>How to watch:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/6XlN3?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3Btemplate=article&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=Kaos%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Netflix.&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=03tmQlA5zlmBEdOn0pIUpKe&amp%3Bshort_url=6XlN3&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fhelios-preview.mashable.com%2Farticle%2Fkaos-review-netflix&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Kaos%C2%A0is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Netflix.&object_type=article&object_uuid=073sXz9qvTtdiBpXXQIdsUT&short_url=6XlN3&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Kaos</u></em><u>&nbsp;is now streaming on Netflix.</u></a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The spacecraft is giant. It's "the largest spacecraft NASA has ever developed for a planetary mission," the agency explained.

"On the spacecraft, batteries will store the power to run all of the electronics, a full payload of science instruments, communications equipment, the computer, and an entire propulsion system that includes 24 engines."</p><p>A bevy of cameras, ground-penetrating radar, spectrometers, and beyond will scan the world below for water, eruptions of water, and the composition of Europa's ice. Beneath the ice, for example, there might be evidence that Europa hosts hydrothermal vents on its seafloor.

In the finale, the real villain was unmasked as a very influential caller from inside the house, and an explosion left some of the main characters' fates uncertain. Who survived the blast? And how will Kate figure out who's behind it, especially when she's distracted by the dishy UK foreign secretary, Austin Dennison (David Gyasi), and the arrival of U.S. Vice President Grace Penn (Allison Janney)? <em>&mdash; S.C.&nbsp; </em>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Starring:</strong> Keri Russell, Allison Janney, Rory Kinnear, David Gyasi, Rufus Sewell, Ato Essandoh, Ali Ahn, Nana Mensah, Miguel Sandoval, Michael McKean, Celia Imrie, and T&rsquo;Nia Miller</p><p><strong>How to watch:</strong> <a href="https://zdcs.link/glWg0?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=The%20Diplomat%20Season%202%20premieres%20Oct.%2031%20on%20Netflix.&object_type=article&object_uuid=02VQ2239YaLKhBpfVzj6OVP&short_url=glWg0&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>The Diplomat</u></em><u> Season 2 premieres Oct. 31 on Netflix.</u></a></p><h2><em>The Franchise</em></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The best VPNs for unblocking sites are not free, but most do offer free trials or money-back guarantees. By taking advantage of these offers, you can unblock sites/apps and then recover your investment at a later date. This obviously isn't a long-term solution. If you want to retain permanent access to sites like X from anywhere in the world, you'll need a subscription. Fortunately, the best VPN for bypassing online restrictions is on sale for a limited time.</p><h2>What is the best VPN for porn?</h2><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/xPwbP?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=ExpressVPN&object_type=article&object_uuid=06MFqg82w12gehHRKjEpkcH&short_url=xPwbP&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">ExpressVPN</a> is the top choice when it comes to unblocking X, for a number of reasons:</p><ul><li><p>Servers in 105 countries </p></li><li><p>Easy-to-use app available on all major devices including iPhone, Android, Windows, Mac, and more</p></li><li><p>Strict no-logging policy</p></li><li><p>Fast streaming speeds free from throttling</p></li><li><p>Up to eight simultaneous connections</p></li><li><p>30-day money-back guarantee</p></li></ul><p>A one-year subscription to <a href="https://zdcs.link/xPwbP?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=ExpressVPN&object_type=article&object_uuid=06MFqg82w12gehHRKjEpkcH&short_url=xPwbP&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">ExpressVPN</a> is on sale for $99.95 and includes an extra three months for free &mdash; 49% off for a limited time.

<h2>What is Connections?</h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <a class="text-gray-600" href="https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1679674590203723778?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(opens in a new window)">

<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. Like <em>Wordle, </em>you can share the results with your friends on social media.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/02eHtVfqUkhbNxBJAp7FIUW/hero-image.jpg" alt="Angelina Jolie stars as Maria Callas in Pablo Larraín's "Maria.""><p>Following <a href="https://mashable.com/article/spencer-movie-review-kristen-stewart" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Spencer</u></em></a> and <em>Jackie</em> &mdash; biopic melodramas about Princess Diana and First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy &mdash; Chilean director Pablo Larra&iacute;n rounds out his informal trilogy with <em>Maria</em>, another film about a world-famous woman in close proximity to death. His subject this time is the iconic Greek-American opera soprano Maria Callas, and though the film doesn't come together as neatly (or completely) as either of its predecessors, its most powerful moments stand head and shoulders above them, thanks to towering, transcendent work from Angelina Jolie in the leading role.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Maria</em> is set during the final week of Callas' life, at a time when she lived in isolation, far from the spotlight. As Larra&iacute;n and <em>Spencer</em> screenwriter Steven Knight imagine these pivotal days, the resulting film is, unfortunately, lesser than the sum of its parts. However, each of those elements is so individually exquisite as to yield material that not only proves incredibly moving, but also provides Jolie with a platform to craft what is perhaps the most complex performance of her illustrious career.&nbsp;</p><h2>What is <em>Maria</em> about?</h2><p>Set in 1977, <em>Maria </em>opens on the day of Callas' death from a sudden heart attack, after her body is discovered in her Paris penthouse. It presents this scene from a distinctly ghostly vantage. As Larra&iacute;n's hand-held camera peers in on the scene from an adjoining room, it takes on a spectral presence, framing the rest of the film &mdash; set during the preceding week &mdash; as though it were some kind of desperate letter from Callas sent from beyond the grave.</p><p>To put words in a dead figure's mouth can be risky business, especially when so little is known about her final years. But as with with <em>Spencer</em> and <em>Jackie</em>, Larra&iacute;n's focus is the intersection of private and public lives. His biopics are, therefore, speculative by nature. His last film, the satire<a href="https://www.truthdig.com/articles/pinochet-in-the-shadows/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"> <em><u>El Conde</u></em></a>, re-imagined Augusto Pinochet as a vampire, and while <em>Maria</em> certainly doesn't go that far &mdash; Larra&iacute;n understandably has more respect for Callas than for the Chilean dictator &mdash; it exists in a similar vein: as a stylized examination of 20th-century history.</p><p>In the week preceding her demise, Callas wrestles with trying to regain her voice, which hasn't been at its full power for some time. However, her withdrawal from the public eye has also led her to self-medicate with largely unregulated drug cocktails. The film tips its hands about their effects early on; Callas claims, to her diligent butler Feruccio (Pierfrancesco Favino) and her housemaid Bruna (Alba Rohrwacher) &mdash; her key confidants in the film &mdash; that she has a TV interview scheduled with a journalist named Mandrax (Kodi Smit-McPhee), the same name as one of her sedatives. When he arrives, he's never in the same room (or same shot) as anyone but Callas.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>That Mandrax is a hallucination is hardly a surprise. In fact, Callas is hyper-aware of her increasing break from reality, though it can't help but read as if it may have been intended as a plot twist in some earlier draft. It takes a number of scenes before Callas' interview with the phantom reporter begins yielding any worthwhile material &mdash; which is to say, personal revelations about Callas' past, and ruminations on her fame, which begin to gradually alter the movie's tone and appearance.</p><h2><em>Maria</em> tells its story through shifting textures and timelines.</h2><p>Hollywood biopics &mdash; especially their<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W3zQkGpzC0" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"> <u>oft-parodied</u></a> musical variety &mdash; tend to follow a standard structure, beginning on the precipice of a pivotal, late-career performance before the film unfolds in flashback. <em>Maria</em> upends this trend with distinct narrative purpose, stretching that aforementioned late-in-life moment across the entire film, while condensing Callas' life story to brief flashes of memory.</p><p>While the singer's music is central (and ever-present; her actual voice appears just as much as Jolie's), the specifics of her career, and her rise to fame, are of little interest to Larra&iacute;n. He reduces them to an introductory montage burnt onto grainy celluloid stock, as though these moments from her performances had all been captured in great detail, and therefore didn't need to be the movie's focus. Rather than re-creating public performances, much of the film shifts rhythmically between Callas' past and present, often impulsively, as though it were depicting a haphazard stream of consciousness. This approach certainly has its strengths &mdash; the film is in constant motion, so at the very least, it's never boring &mdash; but it doesn't always move with purpose, and tends to repeat itself without finding new dimensions to its story.</p><p>On the plus side, Ed Lachman's dazzling cinematography makes the movie's present feel wistful. In its 1970s scenes, Maria either reminisces while wandering Paris &mdash; scenes which yield moments of musical splendor, where the real world collides with her imagined, operatic&nbsp; one &mdash; or she visits an opera pianist to help her rehearse and re-capture her lost glory. These are painted with the warm tones of a perpetual sunset. The movie may be anchored by these scenes (its numerous flashbacks emanate from her conversations, both real and otherwise), but they're imbued with a sense of finality, and of time running out, as though Callas were keenly aware that she's nearing the end.</p><p>Her flashbacks tend to take two specific forms. Like the aforementioned, grainy film footage, moments of public performance &mdash; of Callas silhouetted by spotlight &mdash; appear as brief, nostalgic recollections as she attempts to sing once again and recapture her lost glory. However, the movie's more complete flashback scenes play out in pristine black-and-white, as though these moments had been more perfectly preserved. This canvas is reserved for a handful of flashbacks to Callas' tumultuous youth (where she's played by Aggelina Papadopoulou), but their crux is the time she spent with the Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis (Haluk Bilginer), with whom she had a lengthy affair before his marriage to Jackie Kennedy.</p><p>The film presents the aged Onassis as a risible, rankled character, and Bilginer plays him with venomous charisma. However, his frequent presence in Callas' memories never quite feels justified. It's speculated, in dialogue, that they may have been each other's greatest loves, and the film even imagines a wonderful moment of private confession between them, but Onassis only ever feels like an obligatory inclusion, rather than a character whose impact on Callas is deeply felt instead of simply mentioned in passing. However, this and any other flaws the film may have are eventually hand-waved away by its central performances.</p><h2>Angelina Jolie leads a phenomenal cast.</h2><p>A film like <em>Maria</em> doesn't work without its central performances. Apart from Callas, the two characters with the lion's share of the screen time are Bruna and Feruccio, and though their prescribed roles are set in stone, they offer an intimate, loving perspective on the iconic vocalist.</p><p>As Bruna, a woman trained by Callas to be reverential, Rohrwacher allows the character's true feelings (and true concerns) to slip past her fealty. Feruccio, meanwhile, is far more forthcoming about his objections to Callas' drug use, and while he's often rebuked &mdash; sternly, yet calmy &mdash; Favino maintains a heart-wrenching adoration for Callas. The real Feruccio never sold Callas' private stories, even after her death, so while the movie draws on fantastical interpretations of her twilight years, it still does justice to Feruccio's loyalty, especially in moments when real reporters try to cruelly invade her privacy.</p><p>However, all this would be for nought had the role of Callas not been perfectly cast and performed. Larra&iacute;n has tackled real figures before &mdash; his historical-fiction <em>Neruda</em> was about poet and politician Pablo Neruda &mdash; but his triumvirate of Hollywood biopics have all confronted the impact and allure of fame. Kristen Stewart was a fitting vessel for Larra&iacute;n's <em>Spencer</em>, a story about a highly misunderstood woman upon whom aspersions were constantly cast. Jolie is a similarly flawless choice, given the degree to which <em>Maria</em> is about the dueling pain and allure of living in the spotlight.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Not just a famous actress, but arguably one of the world's most famous people in the mid-2000s, Jolie has achieved a level of global stardom of which few can even dream. However, her celebrity has been marked by everything from homewrecking<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060207100110/http:/www.nydailynews.com/front/story/387860p-329048c.html#:~:text=%22To%20be%20intimate%20with%20a%20married%20man%2C%20when%20my%20own%20father%20cheated%20on%20my%20mother%2C%20is%20not%20something%20I%20could%20forgive.%20I%20could%20not%20look%20at%20myself%20in%20the%20morning%20if%20I%20did%20that.%20I%20wouldn%27t%20be%20attracted%20to%20a%20man%20who%20would%20cheat%20on%20his%20wife.%22%20%2D%22Today%22%20show%27s%20Ann%20Curry%20interview%2C%20June%202005" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"> <u>accusations</u></a> to a harrowing public separation involving<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/04/movies/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-lawsuit.html" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"> <u>alleged</u></a> domestic abuse (her<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/14/opinion/my-medical-choice.html" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"> <u>battle with breast cancer</u></a> has also been a tabloid topic, though she first publicized it herself). In a recent press junket for the movie's Venice Film Festival premiere, Jolie was <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/news/festivals/angelina-jolie-talks-maria-venice-film-festival-1235041296/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>asked</u></a> about the degree to which she drew on her personal life for her performance, though she refused to elaborate. However, seeing the degree to which she places her most vulnerable self on screen in <em>Maria</em>, it's clear she doesn't need to. Everything she has to say on the subject is contained within the four corners of the frame.</p><p>Jolie plays Callas at a physical and emotional low point, and she carries herself as though attempting to juggle the grace and poise of an opera legend with the burdened posture of someone who's given up. She is completely sure of herself when she speaks to other people, but lost in a sea of self-doubt behind closed doors &mdash; a duality that Jolie displays not only in different scenes, but within single conversations, as she turns away from and toward her castmates.</p><p>Callas is a mess of paradoxes. She's a woman both plagued by yet constantly in search of adulation. She's haunted by her past, but her past is what fuels her music, and accessing the most agonizing parts of her story is of the utmost importance if she's to find herself again. Jolie's performance feels similarly in tune with the actress' own history. The further Callas reaches into her soul, the more the curtain slips; you can practically see Jolie and her character becoming one, crying out in unison for some kind of respite from simply being themselves, and living at their level of constant visibility, no matter how much they love the spotlight. It's heart-wrenching to witness.</p><p>However, Jolie goes even further in creating this semi-fictional version of Callas, not just as a real woman, but as a figure practically destined &mdash; perhaps even cursed &mdash; to be immortalized on screen. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnrDb5c7BAg" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>The real Callas</u></a> spoke rather conversationally, and with a more distinctly Greek intonation than Jolie does here. But rather than impersonating her, Jolie instead takes on a classically Hollywood, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH2DKZ-2m74&amp;list=PLwmHJF8AUq6C90D4bj6v_F5aMC-Bd6Xyv" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Transatlantic tone</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>This accent is easy enough to access, but Jolie's masterstroke is what she does with her voice. Not just her singing voice &mdash; though she sounds magnificent to this critic's untrained ear &mdash; but her speaking voice, which sounds pitched-up, as though it were emanating at a higher frequency through a microphone from the 1940s or '50s. The film may be set in 1977, but the '40s and '50s were Callas' professional peak; what better way to translate her idealized version of herself in cinematic terms?</p><p>Callas struggles to stand upright in <em>Maria</em>. Not just literally, because of her drug-dulled sense, but spiritually. The film as a whole may feel scattered, and might lose its way in the middle, but all the while, Jolie is locked in a constant battle to hold her head high &mdash; to live (and die) with dignity, while experiencing all the fears and convictions that come with a woman slowly accepting that she may be at the end of her life.</p><p>Usually, Larra&iacute;n loves to show off his production design (with sets this lavish, who wouldn't?), and he loves to make his camera dance, but the smartest thing he does in <em>Maria </em>is get out of Jolie's way at just the right time. During more intimate or subtle scenes, he pulls back on his flourishes so that her performance can dictate the story at its most potent, painful moments. However, on the rare occasions the film's operatic formalism and Jolie's performance align &mdash; moments when Callas inches closer to finding herself during her musical search &mdash; the result is completely shattering.</p><p><em>Maria </em>was reviewed out of its world premiere at the 2024 Venice International Film Festival.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2><strong>Spotify and Apple continue their feud</strong></h2><p>In its update, Spotify makes it clear that Apple is responsible for making things a bit more difficult for its iPhone-owning users.</p><p>"Apple has discontinued the technology that enables Spotify to control volume for connected devices using the volume buttons on the device," Spotify says on its support page for Spotify Connect. "While we work with them on a solution, you can use the Spotify app to easily adjust the volume on your connected device."</p><p>Mashable reached out to Apple for comment and will update this piece when we hear back.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/29/24231516/spotify-apple-physical-iphone-volume-controls" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>The Verge</u></a> points out, Apple's changes have resulted in random volume spikes as well as other bugs for Spotify users, which led to Spotify altering how users can control the volume. The Sonos app made a similar change earlier this year after its users experienced similar problems.</p><p>"We&rsquo;ve made requests to Apple to introduce a similar solution to what they offer users on HomePod and Apple TV for app developers who control non-Apple media devices," the Verge reports Spotify saying. "Apple has told us that they require apps to integrate into HomePod in order to access the technology that controls volume on iPhones."</p><p>While this specific volume control issue between these two industry behemoths may seem minor overall, it's actually just one more issue between Spotify and Apple in a larger ongoing feud.</p><p>Earlier this year, Apple was hit with a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-spotify-app-store-pay-nothing" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>$2 billion fine</u></a> in the EU after Spotify filed a complaint against the iPhone-maker over its policies prohibiting app makers from sending users outside of Apple's official App Store in order to sign up for subscription services.</p><p>In response, Apple published a public statement criticizing Spotify for using all of Apple's tools to run the iPhone app without paying the company.</p><p>In the statement, Apple pointed out that the company works with Spotify to ensure that its app works with "Siri, CarPlay, Apple Watch, AirPlay, Widgets, and more." But it now appears that Spotify volume controls via the iPhone's physical buttons are no longer included on that list.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Apple Sports app will let you follow your favorite teams and conferences. That way, you'll get all the updates you won't, but not the scores of games that don't matter to you. </p><p>Apple also said in a press release that it's planning a new drop-down menu that'll allow users to switch between different teams and leagues to check scores easily. Of course, the app has more than just football in it.</p><p>While <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/02/introducing-apple-sports-a-new-app-for-sports-fans/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">the Apple Sports app</a> has been around since February, this marks its first full football season.

As a sports fan, I used to use Twitter's Sports tab to follow scores and conversations around a game. </p><p>However, since Elon Musk bought the platform, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/twitter-sports-tab-issues-problems" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">that experience has degraded</a>.

We&rsquo;re not seeing this discount anywhere else, and the product isn&rsquo;t available at most retailers. (Note: We&rsquo;re specifically talking about the black/nickel Supersonic Origin.) It comes with a styling concentrator, has three speed settings, four heat settings, and a cool shot button to set your hair after styling.</p><p>According to <a href="https://mashable.com/review/dyson-supersonic-hair-dryer" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Mashable&rsquo;s Bethany Allard</a>, the Dyson Supersonic is a quick and effective option for people who dry their hair often (read: every day) but is expensive at full price. With this discount, though, the Supersonic could be worth considering if you want a high-powered hair dryer that's gentler on your hair than some other models.</p><h2>Best upright vacuum deal </h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>If you're in the market for a new tablet, you can't go wrong with a vanilla <a href="https://zdcs.link/YdYxj?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=iPad&object_type=article&object_uuid=05ad4PEKYLUQ99T2xQLKmay&short_url=YdYxj&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">iPad</a>, especially a 9th generation model. This one is paired with 64GB of storage, and you can get it for less than $200, which is almost unheard of when it comes to iPads. It can handle streaming, gaming, browsing, video calls and just about anything else you might demand of it, all in a fun, slim package. It also includes Touch ID and a powerful A13 Bionic chip, so it can multitask with the best of them. For the price, you're getting a robust tablet that works fantastically with the iOS ecosystem, if you've already got one established at home. </p><h3>More tech deals:</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/JV1Em?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=LG%20Gram%20Laptop&object_type=article&object_uuid=05ad4PEKYLUQ99T2xQLKmay&short_url=JV1Em&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">LG Gram Laptop</a> &mdash; <strong>$2,099.99 </strong><s>$249</s> (save $900)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/q481G?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=HP%20Envy%202-in-1%2014-inch%20Laptop&object_type=article&object_uuid=05ad4PEKYLUQ99T2xQLKmay&short_url=q481G&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">HP Envy 2-in-1 14-inch Laptop</a> &mdash; <strong>$599.99 </strong><s>$1,049.99</s> (save $450)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/JV1Zp?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%20Galaxy%20Tab%20S9%20FE&object_type=article&object_uuid=05ad4PEKYLUQ99T2xQLKmay&short_url=JV1Zp&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE</a> &mdash; <strong>$349.99 </strong><s>$449.99</s> (save $100)</p></li></ul><h2>Best TV deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

Thanks to its over 8 million self-lit pixels, it serves up an eye-popping array of bright whites and deep, darker shades as well as Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, and DTS:X audio support. There's a lot to like about this newly-released model, and that's not even accounting for its massive 77-inch size. It's the perfect option for football season and everything else you want to watch in your living room. </p><h3>More TV deals:</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/p6wql?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%2055-inch%20Class%20S90D%20OLED%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=05ad4PEKYLUQ99T2xQLKmay&short_url=p6wql&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung 55-inch Class S90D OLED TV</a> &mdash; <strong>$1,399.99 </strong><s>$1,899.99</s> (save $900)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/3bYr2?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%2065-inch%20Class%20DU7200%20Series%20Crystal%204K%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=05ad4PEKYLUQ99T2xQLKmay&short_url=3bYr2&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung 65-inch Class DU7200 Series Crystal 4K TV</a> &mdash; <strong>$469.99 </strong><s>$529.99</s> (save $60)</p></li></ul><h2>Best appliance deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

So, what happens when noise-sensitive aliens crash land in the city that never sleeps? Chaos. That's the main premise of the apocalyptic alien prequel.</p><p>The story follows Sam (Nyong'o), a terminally ill hospice patient who reluctantly agrees to take a trip into Manhattan only to find herself stuck in the city when the horrifying extraterrestrials take over. As she navigates the alien apocalypse, Sam and her service cat Frodo attract the attention of a young law student named Eric (Quinn). The odd couple (and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/cat-quiet-place-challenge-tiktok" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">the cat</a>) embark on a journey through the city swarming with aliens and their only hope for survival is to remain absolutely silent. </p><p>Check out the <a href="https://mashable.com/video/a-quiet-place-day-one-trailer-2" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">official trailer</a> for a better idea of what Day One is all about:</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

She appreciated the "captivating screen presence" of Nyong'o and Quinn, but felt that "the love story at its core can't shine amid the required carnage and urban devastation demanded by the prequel's promise." Thus, the film as a whole didn't quite equal the sum of its parts. </p><p>However, with the largely positive critic ratings on Rotten Tomatoes, many others felt that the prequel did hold up. That's the best thing about movies &mdash;&nbsp;everyone can form their own opinion.

<p>If you opt for the annual plan instead of the monthly plan, you can save 17% on your subscription. You'll have to pay more upfront, but it pays off in the grand scheme of your streaming lineup. An annual Paramount+ Essential plan will run you $59.99 per year, which breaks down to only $5 per month as opposed to $5.99 per month. If you want to watch more than just <em>Day One</em> and you don't mind ads, this is your best bet.</p><h3>Best deal for no ads: <a href="https://zdcs.link/G15gq?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Save%2017%25%20on%20a%20Paramount%2B%20with%20Showtime%20annual%20subscription&object_type=article&object_uuid=035zK1thQ63rzbPNsqkdPjK&short_url=G15gq&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Save 17% on a Paramount+ with Showtime annual subscription</a></h3><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

The good news is that beyond just giving you access to ad-free Paramount+ content, the extra cost unlocks access to Showtime originals and movies (like <a href="https://mashable.com/article/yellowjackets-season-2-review-showtime" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Yellowjackets</em></a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-curse-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>The Curse</em></a>), live TV with CBS, and college football.

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>Home Depot's Labor Day sale is one of the best times to score big-ticket items for less - especially grills. While there's no shortage of grills on sale, <a href="https://zdcs.link/ywlb6?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Traeger%20Pro%20575&object_type=article&object_uuid=02bqlIpQbO7szatqDXCYUCF&short_url=ywlb6&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Traeger Pro 575</a> stands out for its versatility. Not only is it a pellet grill, but it doubles as a smoker. If you love real wood-smoked flavor, then there's no better addition to your backyard. Plus, it's WiFi-enabled for more precise temperature control. Normally $799, the Labor Day sale saves you $200. </p><h2>More backyard deals </h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/KD1AB?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Traeger%20Pro%20Series%2034%20Pellet%20Grill&object_type=article&object_uuid=02bqlIpQbO7szatqDXCYUCF&short_url=KD1AB&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Traeger Pro Series 34 Pellet Grill</a> &mdash; <strong>$499 </strong><s>$699.95</s> (save $200.95)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/x7Ojb?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Weber%20Spirit%20II%20E-310%203-Burner%20Liquid%20Propane%20Gas%20Grill&object_type=article&object_uuid=02bqlIpQbO7szatqDXCYUCF&short_url=x7Ojb&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Weber Spirit II E-310 3-Burner Liquid Propane Gas Grill</a> &mdash; <strong>$519 </strong><s>$569</s> (save $50)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/ODqrB?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=LOCO%2026%20in.%202-Burner%20Classic%20SmartTemp%20Propane%20Flat%20Top%20Grill%2FGriddle&object_type=article&object_uuid=02bqlIpQbO7szatqDXCYUCF&short_url=ODqrB&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">LOCO 26 in. 2-Burner Classic SmartTemp Propane Flat Top Grill/Griddle</a> &mdash; <strong>$269 </strong><s>$299.99</s> (save $30.99)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/6beNk?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Nexgrill%20Daytona%204-Burner%20Propane%20Gas%20Grill%2036%20in.%20Flat%20Top%20Griddle&object_type=article&object_uuid=02bqlIpQbO7szatqDXCYUCF&short_url=6beNk&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Nexgrill Daytona 4-Burner Propane Gas Grill 36 in.

<p>Upgrade and extend your workspace with Samsung's ViewFinity S9 Series monitor while it's half price. With 27 inches of 5K resolution, 600 nits of brightness, HDR 600 support, a 4K Slimfit webcam, versatile compatibility, smart TV apps, and a tilt and height-adjustable stand, it not only outshines Apple's Studio Display, but also doubles as a gorgeous mini TV replacement. Usually an eyebrow-raising $1,599.99, you can grab this 5K monitor for only $800.60 as of Aug. 30.

<p>If you're not one to pay full price for the latest iteration of a Galaxy phone, this deal on the Galaxy S23 FE might be more your speed. It's essentially a more basic version of the flagship phone at a more budget-friendly price. Its specs are still pretty solid, including a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen1 chip (the same that powers the Galaxy S22 phones), tri-camera system, 6.4-inch matte aluminum build, and 4,500mAh battery. Our friends at PCMag (which is owned by Mashable's publisher, Ziff Davis) <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s23-fe" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">called it</a> "one of the best midrange Android phones on the market." As of Aug. 30, you can grab the 256GB option for only $499.99 instead of the usual $659.99. That's its lowest price on record.</p><p><em>None of these deals catching your eye?

<p><em>Wired</em>'s report goes into the nitty gritty technical details of how these data scraping bots work, but the main thing to know is that it's similar to how Apple has trained things like Siri over the years, but now with an extra layer of possible copyright infringement that has made companies wary.

<p>Alexa is a very important part of Amazon's ecosystem, given that it powers the vast number of smart devices in Amazon's lineup.

As it turns out, our sounds convey tell-tale information about our well-being.</p><p>According to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-29/google-and-others-are-developing-ai-that-can-hear-signs-of-sickness?ref=biztoc.com" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Bloomberg </em>report</a>, the search-engine giant built an AI model that uses sound signals to "predict early signs of disease." In places where there is difficulty accessing quality healthcare, this technology can step in as an alternative where users need nothing but their smartphone's microphone.</p><h2><strong>How does Google's bioacoustics AI work?</strong></h2><p>Google's bioacoustics-based AI model is called HeAR (Heath Acoustic Representations). It was trained on 300 million, two-second audio samples that include coughs, sniffles, sneezes, and breathing patterns. These audio clips were pulled from non-copyrighted, publicly available content from platforms like YouTube. </p><p>One example of such content is a video that recorded sounds of patients in a Zambia-based hospital where sick individuals came in for tuberculosis screenings. In fact, HeAR has been trained on 100 million cough sounds that help detect tuberculosis.</p><p>According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, bioacoustics can offer "near-imperceptible clues" that can reveal subtle signs of illness that can help health professionals diagnose patients. Plus, the AI model can detect minute differences in patients' cough patterns, allowing it to spot early signs of a sickness' amelioration or deterioration.</p><p>Google is partnering with Salcit Technologies, an AI healthcare startup based in India. Salcit has its own AI model called Swaasa (which means "breath" in Sanskrit) &mdash; and the Indian collaborator is using Swaasa to help HeAR improve its accuracy for tuberculosis and lung health screening.</p><p>Swaasa offers a mobile app that allows users to submit a 10-second cough sample. According to Salcit&rsquo;s co-founder, Manmohan Jain, the app can identify whether an individual has a disease with an accuracy rate of 94 percent</p><p>The auditory-based test costs $2.40. This is much cheaper than a spirometry test, which costs about $35 in an India-based clinic.</p><p>HeAR doesn't come without challenges, though. For example, Google and Salcit are still trying to navigate problems with users submitting audio samples with too much background noise.</p><p>Google's bioacoustics-based AI model is nowhere near the "ready-for-market" stage, but you've got to admit, the concept of using AI in the medical field, combined with sound, is arguably innovative and promising.</p>]]></content:encoded>

And if you watch <a href="https://mashable.com/category/porn" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">porn</a>, you should be even more vigilant.</p><p>We're going to take a wild guess that you'd prefer to be protected from the prying eyes of advertisers, your internet service provider (ISP), and your roommates when you're visiting <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ethical-porn-body-image" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">porn sites</a>. If that is indeed the case, you should consider investing in a VPN. These cybersecurity services provide everything you need to <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/deals/unblock-xnxx-porn-for-free" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">unblock porn sites</a> and stream anonymously. </p><h2>What is a VPN?</h2><p><a href="https://mashable.com/category/vpn" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">VPNs</a> provide powerful protection for your data and identity when you're online. VPNs offer this online privacy and anonymity by creating a private network that hides your real IP address (digital location), making all of your activity untraceable and secure.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>This concept can be difficult to grasp, so it can be helpful to think of VPNs as encrypted tunnels through which all of your online traffic passes through. Nobody can see into the tunnel, and everything inside the tunnel is protected against online threats like viruses, hackers, and malware. It's all about anonymity and <a href="https://mashable.com/category/cybersecurity" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">cybersecurity</a>, and that's particularly important if you're watching porn.</p><h2>Do you need a VPN for porn?</h2><p>There are two key reasons to consider a VPN for porn: <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-for-anonymity-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">anonymity</a> and access. </p><p>The first reason is perhaps the most important. If you're concerned about your ISP, housemates, landlord, or someone totally random accessing your data, you could probably benefit from using a VPN. Any sort of activity on an unsecured WiFi network leaves your private information and browsing habits exposed to the world, unless you're using a VPN. Even porn sites can track your activity if you're unprotected. <a href="https://www.pornhub.com/information/privacy" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Pornhub</u></a> tracks IP addresses for example, which means it has the potential to collect information about your site usage. But with a VPN, your IP address will always remain hidden.</p><p>Remaining private and anonymous is the key argument for using a VPN for porn, but there's another point to consider concerning access to your favourite sites. If you're in a location that has a firewall up to block access to porn sites, you'll need to use a VPN to bypass these restrictions. VPNs hide your real IP address and connect you to a server in another location, meaning you can bypass firewalls to stream on your favourite sites from anywhere in the world.</p><h2>What features should you consider when selecting a VPN?</h2><p>There are a number of things you should consider before selecting a VPN for porn. We have highlighted a selection of the most important <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-deals" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">VPN</a> features to help you make a decision:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Connection speed </strong>&mdash; VPNs generally produce a drop in your connection speed, but you shouldn't accept anything significant. Make sure you opt for a VPN that doesn't negatively impact your connection speed to the point that you can'tstream porn without disruption.</p></li><li><p><strong>Encryption </strong>&mdash; There are different levels of encryption, and whilst it's important to take note of the grade provided by your VPN, the best services will all offer powerful protection for your data. This is obviously vital when navigating porn sites because you need to know that your data is secure.</p></li><li><p><strong>Number of connections </strong>&mdash;<strong> </strong>Leading VPNs let you connect an unlimited number of devices with the same account, whilst others limit you to just a single device. Prioritise services that offer multiple simultaneous connections so you can stay secure on all your devices at the same time. You might stream porn on a number of devices, so it's best to secure everything with the same account.</p></li><li><p><strong>Privacy policy </strong>&mdash; This is something that some users might take for granted, but you need to pay special attention to the data-handling, storage, and usage practices of a VPN. These practices should be clearly laid out in a privacy policy, and if they aren't, you should not subscribe. Most VPNs require access to your IP address, online transactions, and browsing history, plus your personal details when you sign up. Your favourite VPN should not store these details under any circumstances, as that would make the whole anonymity thing redundant.</p></li><li><p><strong>Server network </strong>&mdash; The best VPNs provide access to literally thousands of geographically diverse servers. This is useful because you should always be able to find a stable and speedy connection for streaming porn.</p></li></ul><p>You also need to consider things like price and subscription plans, but these features are a good place to start with your selection process. Once you've picked a favourite option, you can consider the wide range of subscription plans on offer from leading services. There should be something that suits everyone.</p><h2>Should you use free VPNs?</h2><p>The big question when it comes to watching porn securely is whether you need to pay for a VPN. The bad news is that, just as with most things in life, you get what you pay for with these cybersecurity services.</p><p>There are plenty of free versions of <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">popular VPNs</a>, and free trials of VPNs with full access to everything you get with a premium plan. The catch is that free versions usually come with limited data usage, meaning you can't really do any streaming or downloading. Free trials come with everything you get in a paid plan, but they obviously don't last very long. Trials are great for testing out a service before committing, but this isn't a long-term solution.</p><p>Considering all of this, the best option for unblocking porn sites and streaming anonymously is with a paid subscription to a VPN. To gain access to advanced security features without limitations on usage, you will need to cough up the cash.</p><h2>What is the best VPN for porn?</h2><p>There are a lot of services out there offering similar packages, making it difficult to find the best VPN for you. We have tried to make your life a little bit easier by tracking down everything on offer and lining up a selection of the very best VPNs for porn. We have tried to find something for everyone and every budget, and you can find popular services like <a href="https://go.expressvpn.com/c/190434/1462855/16063" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">ExpressVPN</a>, <a href="https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=340&amp;aff_id=682&amp;aff_sub=mashporn" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">NordVPN</a>, and <a href="https://www.cyberghostvpn.com/offer/sdh_qwcvea7?aff_sub=mashporn" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">CyberGhost VPN</a> in this list.</p><p>These are the best VPNs for porn in 2024.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The queen of the gods; goddess of women's sexuality, fertility, and marriage; and Zeus' wife (and sister, as <em>Kaos</em> reminds us). Hera holds a grudge and will often seek brutal vengeance against Zeus' lovers, but she contains multitudes. As Fry writes in <em>Mythos</em>, "It is easy to dismiss Hera as a tyrant and a bore &mdash; jealous and suspicious, storming and ranting like the very picture of a scorned harridan wife (one imagines her hurling china ornaments at feckless minions)&hellip;" Luckily, McTeer gives Hera more to do than throw decorations at staff.</p><p>But what's with the bees? Fry also writes of the Greek myth about how the bee got its sting: At Zeus and Hera's wedding, a competition for "the best and most original wedding dish" saw a small, buzzing, winged attendee, Melissa, present them with honey. For her efforts, Zeus bestowed her with a cruel sting that would kill her if used. Lovely wedding.</p><h2>Poseidon (Cliff Curtis)</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The king and queen of the Underworld. Zeus' brother Hades was assigned to run Hell after the Olympians won a major battle over the Titans (Zeus got the sky, Poseidon the sea, Hades the Underworld). In <em>Classical Myth</em>, Powell writes of Hades: "He commanded legions of demons. A pitiless master, he never willingly allowed any who came to him to return to the land of the living." Persephone, in myth, was kidnapped by Hades and tricked into being trapped there with a tempting offer of six pomegranate seeds &mdash; so she must spend six months of the year in the Underworld, six months on Earth. In <em>Kaos</em>, Covell rewrites this situation as a tale of actual love between Hades and Persephone, and the myth as one of bad PR spread by Hera. "Every kid on Earth, when they learn about the Underworld, they think I'm there against my will," Ayola's Persephone says in <em>Kaos, </em>explaining she's also allergic to pomegranates.</p><h2>Dionysus (Nabhaan Rizwan)</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The party fiend of Olympus, Dionysus is the god of wine, hedonism, pleasure, and madness. The name "Dennis" apparently derives from what you call a follower of Dionysus, and it's notably the name of the kitten the god adopts in <em>Kaos</em>.</p><p>As Prometheus mentions in the series, Dionysus' mother was mortal, a Theban princess named Semele whose fate was pretty awful in Greek myth. Powell writes that she slept with Zeus appearing "in all his glory, burning Semele to a crisp, Hermes saved the fetus and carried it to Zeus, who sewed it into his thigh. Three months later he removed the stitches, and Dionysus was born again." (Stay with me?) In <em>Kaos</em>, Semele was turned into a bee offscreen by Hera (the fate of all Zeus' human mistresses in the show,) but Semele is indeed burned by an angry Zeus in the Season 1 finale.</p><p>In Greek mythology, Dionysus is also the husband of Ariadne &mdash; and in the final episode of <em>Kaos</em>, it becomes clear Dionysus has spotted his future mortal love. We leave him standing outside the palace at Knossos. So, maybe Season 2?&nbsp;</p><h2>Prometheus (Stephen Dillane)</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

He and Zeus made humans out of clay, then he pissed off his stormy pal by giving them fire, so he's doomed to have his liver pecked out by an eagle every day.

<p>Despite appearances, Medusa has a tragic tale in Greek myth. Known as a Gorgon with snake hair, her story is best told by Beard in <em>Women and Power</em>: "There are many ancient variations in Medusa's story. One famous version has her as a beautiful woman raped by Poseidon in a temple of Athena, who promptly transformed her, as punishment for the sacrilege (punishment to <em>her</em>, note), into a monstrous creature with a deadly capacity to turn to stone anyone who looked at her face. It later became the task of the hero Perseus to kill this woman, and he cut her head off using his shiny shield so as to avoid having to look directly at her."</p><p>In <em>Kaos</em>, she's middle management in the Underworld.

<p>Charon is the ferryman to the Underworld, bringing the spirits of the dead across the River Styx (named for "Hate") and Acheron (or "Woe). Fry writes, "There the grim and silent Charon held out his hand to receive his payment for ferrying the souls across the Styx. If the dead had no payment to offer they would have to wait on the bank a hundred years before the disobliging Charon consented to take them." Folks like Eurydice and Caeneus in <em>Kaos</em> haven&rsquo;t money to pay Charon (their loved ones stole the coins they were buried with), so they&rsquo;re sent to the Centre for the Unresolved.</p><p>Charon's crew in <em>Kaos </em>has regular-sized sniffer dog versions of the great three-headed dog of the Underworld, Cerberus. Plus, Charon speaks of the Scylla in the series, a sea creature that chomps on Orpheus' fellow Underworld adventurer. In myth, the Scylla is a beast who was once a sea deity &mdash; but pissed off the sorceress Circe in some renditions of the tale. Also, Charon's parents are Erebus (personification of darkness) and Nyx (goddess of night), so his emo tendencies are hereditary.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Furies (Natalie Klamar, Cathy Tyson, and Donna Banya)</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The trio known as The Furies (also called The Erinyes) exist to punish evildoers. Called Tisiphone, Megaera, and Alecto, they cruise around in <em>Kaos</em> exacting justice, though it might not appear that way. In <em>Mythology</em>, Hamilton writes, "The Greek poets thought of them chiefly as pursuing sinners on the Earth. They were inexorable, but just." <em>Kaos</em> thankfully leaves out The Furies origin story: They're said to have sprung from the blood on the floor after the primordial god of the sky Ouranos was castrated by his own son Cronos.

<p>Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos, the three prophecy-makers of<em> Kaos</em>, are known collectively as The Fates. They're a key trio in Greek mythology, writing prophecies and declaring that "knowing is our whole thing." As Graves writes in <em>The Greek Myths</em>, Clotho is the "spinner," Lachesis (or Lachy in <em>Kaos</em>) is the "measurer," and Atropos is one "who cannot be turned or avoided" &mdash; yeah, they wield the badass scissors of fate. As we see in <em>Kaos</em>, Zeus' relationship with The Fates is tempestuous. Graves writes, "Zeus, who weighs the lives of men and informs the Fates can, it is said, change his mind and intervene to save whom he pleases, when the thread of life, spun on Clotho&rsquo;s spindle, and measured by the rod of Lachesis, is about to be snipped by Atropos&rsquo;s shears." But he also writes that "Zeus himself is subject to the Fates."</p><h2>Polyphemus (Joe McGann)</h2><p>The cyclops Polyphemus comes in the form of an eye-patched bar owner called Poly in Kaos. Polyphemus is the son of Poseidon and the Oceanid Thoosa, and his big role comes in <em>The Odyssey</em>, when he captures Odysseus' crew in his Sicilian cave when they find it full of sheep. In <em>Metamorphoses</em>, Ovid describes him as an "inhuman host, who made his bloody feasts / On mangl&rsquo;d members of his butcher&rsquo;d guests." Yeah, he eats some of them, then falls asleep (but not before blocking the exit with a boulder). Odysseus outwits Polyphemus by getting him pissed and blinding him, and the crew tie themselves to the bellies of the sheep in the cave, who then walk on outta there. None of this happens in <em>Kaos</em>, which is a real shame.</p><h2><strong><u>The humans</u></strong></h2><h2>Eurydice and Orpheus (Aurora Perrineau and Killian Scott)</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Two figures inherently interlinked in Greek mythology, Ariadne and Theseus are most famously associated with the tale of the Minotaur &mdash; the same goes for them in <em>Kaos</em>. The daughter of King (not President) Minos, Ariadne doesn't have a twin in Greek mythology, but her half-brother <em>is</em> the Minotaur &mdash; more on that below. (<em>Kaos</em> names her brother Glaucus, for a sea god.) Theseus, sometimes referred to as the son of Poseidon, is recruited to slay the Minotaur in the labyrinth beneath Minos' palace at Knossos.&nbsp;</p><p>In <em>Kaos</em>, Ariadne has a crush on Theseus, but he's in love with Nax (or Astyanax). In Greek mythology, Theseus abandons Ariadne on an island called Naxos after she helps him slay the Minotaur (rude). In the myth, Ariadne eventually marries Dionysus &mdash; which the show indicates in the final episode is where next season might head.&nbsp;</p><h2>Pasipha&euml; (Shila Ommi)</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Known as Pas in <em>Kaos</em>, the First Lady of Krete is King Minos' wife in myth. Pasipha&euml; is actually the mother of the Minotaur &mdash; something Covell cleverly adapts for <em>Kaos</em>. Hamilton describes the Minotaur as "half bull, half human, the offspring of Minos' wife Pasipha&euml; and a wonderfully beautiful bull. Poseidon had given this bull to Minos in order that he should sacrifice it to him, but Minos could not bear to slay it and had kept it for himself. To punish him, Poseidon had made Pasipha&euml; fall madly in love with it." Bing, bang, boom, you've got a Minotaur &mdash; and a king set to imprison the beast with the help of an inventor&hellip;</p><h2>Daedalus (Mat Fraser)</h2><p>The great inventor, designer, and architect, Daedalus is at the beck and call of King Minos. Hamilton writes about the labyrinth he was commissioned to build to contain the Minotaur as "a place of confinement for him from which escape was impossible." Sadly, when Daedalus and his son Icarus were imprisoned in the labyrinth, Daedalus' escape plan of constructed wings went awry when Icarus flew too close to the sun. This is mentioned in <em>Kaos</em>, but in the show, Daedelus says Icarus built the wings to escape the palace after realising his father's role with helping Minos imprison the Minotaur. In the myth, a group of young Athenians were sacrificed to the Minotaur in the maze on the regular, so Theseus is called in to kill the Minotaur (Ariadne helps him, with Daedalus' assistance). In <em>Kaos</em>, it's Minos who kills the Minotaur, his own son, in an effort to thwart his own prophecy.</p><h2>Hecuba and Andromache (Gilian Cally and Amanda Douge)</h2><p>The two women summoned to President Minos' palace in episode 3 are Hecuba and Andromache. They're the most powerful women of the Trojans, both enslaved after the Trojan War &mdash; in <em>Kaos</em>, they're living in the same abysmal conditions without rights as the rest of the Trojan refugees. Andromache is a Theban princess married to the Trojan prince Hector, who dies by Achilles. Their son, Astyanax, features in <em>Kaos</em> as a Trojan rebel and Theseus' lover. In myth, he's thrown from the walls of Troy as a baby (in <em>Kaos</em>, though he makes it to adulthood, he's executed and hung from the Knossos palace wall). Hecuba is the Queen of Troy, married to King Priam, and Hector's mother.</p><h2>Nax (Daniel Monks)</h2><p>As well as Hecuba and Andromache, there's a lot of Trojans in <em>Kaos</em>, reeling from the events of the Trojan War. They're branded by the line on their nose in the series and viciously persecuted by the Kretians. Astyanax, a Trojan prince and son of Andromache and Hector, is called Nax in the series, forced to live with the Trojans in the crumbling refugee suburb of Krete called "Troytown," with no citizens rights. He's Theseus' lover in<em> Kaos</em> and responsible for the literal shit pile on the gods' statue. He's the leader of the Trojan Seven, as they're called in the series, a vigilante group demonstrating against oppression by the Kretians &mdash; and they're publicly executed by the president. It's a callback to the children thrown from the walls of Troy by the Greek army during the sacking of the city.</p><h2>Cassandra (Billie Piper)</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>A prophet and princess of Troy, Cassandra was given the gift of prophecy by a thirsty Apollo &mdash; including visions of the whole Trojan War and horse deal (Billie Piper's character mentions this in episode 1). Cassandra wouldn't go on a date with the god or something (ugh, entitled men), so Apollo made sure no one would believe her premonitions. "She shrieked and shouted out through all the city," Homer writes in <em>The Iliad</em> of Cassandra warning the Trojans about the coming violence. Turns out the Ancient Greeks already knew the agony of women not being believed.</p><h2>Hippolyta and Crixus (Selina Jones and Slavko Sobin)</h2><p>In <em>Kaos</em>, Ariadne and Theseus attend the Munis, a Mad Max-style cage fight to the death. The fighters are named Carl Crixus of Sparta (named for the gladiator from Gaul) and Hippolyta (named for the Queen of the female warriors known as the Amazons, and daughter of Ares' god of war, who is associated with the story of the 12 Labors of Heracles). In <em>Kaos</em>, Hippolyta's also the one who murdered Caeneus.</p><h2><strong><u>The locations</u></strong></h2><h2>Mount Olympus</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>There's a <em>lot</em> of geography covered in <em>Kaos</em> when it comes to the Underworld. When Eurydice first arrives, she's put on the large ferry across the River Styx (see above on Charon for more about that). Then, the Asphodel port in <em>Kaos</em> is named for the Asphodel Fields, meadows of ghostly flowers in the first area of the Underworld, as Graves describes, &ldquo;where souls of heroes stay without purpose among the throngs of less distinguished dead that twitter like bats."&nbsp;</p><p>Then there's the River Lethe, which also appears in Kaos as the body of water people swim across to get to The Frame. In myth, the Lethe (named for "forgetfulness") is a river in the Underworld in which people can quite literally wipe their memories. Hades and Persephone's palace is another region of the Underworld, and in <em>Kaos</em>, it's a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/mid-century-modern-design-the-beyond-loki" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">mid-century modern</a> testament to middle management.&nbsp;</p><p>One thing <em>Kaos</em> doesn't mention is that the Underworld has a Good Place and a Bad Place: Elysium and Tartarus.

<p>In myth, King Minos' great palace at Knossos on Krete was home to a subterranean labyrinth where a Minotaur roamed &mdash; and it's where most of the action in <em>Kaos</em> is set.

According to Fry, Panopeus could have been the place where Zeus and Prometheus decided to source the clay to build humans: "History does not agree on exactly where Prometheus and Zeus went to find the best clay for realising the plan. Early sources, like the traveller Pausanias in the second century AD, claimed that Panopeus in Phonics was the place."</p><h2>The Cave</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2>What is Connections?</h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

    </a>
</blockquote>
<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. Like <em>Wordle, </em>you can share the results with your friends on social media.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

The energy you produce by moving (your kinetic energy), therefore, could be passed on to something else &mdash; something useful to you &mdash; if only you were able to easily harness it.</p><p>That&rsquo;s where the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Mvd6O?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=LifeSpan%20Ampera%20Bike&object_type=review&object_uuid=03K8ifgdMmBAf4quFyZE1iP&short_url=Mvd6O&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>LifeSpan Ampera Bike</u></a> ($999) comes in. While it looks like an office chair you might find on the set of <em>Star Trek</em>, this under-desk bike uses the power of your pedaling to charge up your devices.</p><h2>Specs and setup</h2><p>The Ampera Bike is an upright, stationary bike designed to be used at your desk. Its standout feature is that it can charge your devices wirelessly or using the included USB-C port. But you don&rsquo;t have to plug it in. In fact, you can&rsquo;t. Your pedaling provides the energy needed to charge your devices (and also to turn on the ring lights around each pedal, which can be set to 12 different colors).</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>The bike also features easy, lever-activated height adjustment and several resistance levels to add a bit more challenge (and calorie burn) to your desk workouts.</p><p>It looks really sleek too, although at first glance it does border on futuristic-looking to the point of being a little bit silly. I love the glacier white color that I received (although it&rsquo;s also available in space gray), and I think the leather-look detail on the handle and the fabric and trim on the seat are nice touches that make the bike look much less clinical.</p><p>My Ampera Bike was professionally assembled, but looking through the owner&rsquo;s manual, the setup appears to be a pretty straightforward process. The installer was in and out in under one hour.</p><h2>Cycling while I work</h2><p>Using this bike could not be more straightforward. You get on, you start pedaling &mdash; just like any old-school workout bike. If you want to use the charger, just plop your phone on the wireless charger or plug it into the USB-C cord and keep on pedaling.</p><p>The pedals were a bit stiff and almost sticky (not to the touch, but they felt a bit resistant to pedaling) at first, but this resolved after just a few minutes of pedaling.</p><p>I found it very easy to focus on work while slowly pedaling away. Although my extremely pregnant belly kept me from being able to bring the bike as close to my desk as I would like, I was able to reach my keyboard easily and type with a very high level of accuracy.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The lowest resistance levels also provided plenty of resistance while working, in my opinion, although I could see increasing the resistance for an added burn if I were streaming video or mindlessly scrolling social media.</p><p>The seat is also comfortable enough that it can double as a permanent office chair for focused work that needs to be done while completely stationary. With no seat back and the firm bike seat below my bum, it kept my posture dialed in even when I wasn&rsquo;t pedaling &mdash; which was a productivity boost in and of itself.</p><p>Overall, I still prefer my <a href="https://mashable.com/review/lifespan-tr1200-glowup-under-desk-treadmill" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">treadmill setup</a>, but I&rsquo;ve never really been a &ldquo;bike&rdquo; person. I know so many people who would salivate at the very idea of this bike, and it&rsquo;s also an excellent option for people who need something that&rsquo;s more low-impact and easy on the joints.</p><h2>Pedaling to charge my devices</h2><p>One of the coolest features of this bike by far is the whole "charge your devices using your own energy" thing, and it works flawlessly. The bike comes equipped with a wireless charger as well as a USB-C port, both of which make it really easy to charge a phone. I prefer using the USB-C port since I have to take my phone out of its case to charge it wirelessly, and my phone desperately needs the protection offered by its case.</p><p>When I plug in my phone, just a few seconds after I start pedaling I hear the &ldquo;ding&rdquo; notifying me that the phone is being charged. I&rsquo;m able to charge it a full percent after just a few seconds of consistent, fast, focused pedaling &mdash; however, it naturally charges more slowly while working because <em>I&rsquo;m</em> pedaling more slowly. According to the LifeSpan website, it can charge a device from zero to 50 percent in just 30 minutes (but you <em>really </em>gotta be pedaling to accomplish this).</p><p>If you wanted to up the stakes and use the bike to charge your work laptop, you&rsquo;d need to have or buy an appropriate USB-C converter for your laptop cable. A bit of a challenge for us Stone Age folks who still aren&rsquo;t using a <a href="https://mashable.com/category/macbook" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Macbook</a> &mdash; but it could definitely be done.</p><p>I also appreciate the slight degree of gamification that the charging option adds. It&rsquo;s motivating to be able to pedal your phone battery up, but not distracting. And you could easily set up some incentives or benchmarks to make it more fun, like taking a coffee break or giving yourself some &ldquo;reading for fun&rdquo; time after charging your phone by an additional 25 percent</p><h2>An OK app that needs improvement</h2><p>To connect to the LifeSpan app, you&rsquo;ll need to be pedaling so that the bike is &ldquo;powered on&rdquo; and therefore able to appear in the list of available devices.</p><p>I was able to connect the bike easily to the app repeatedly, although the app controls are a bit clunky. Still, in order to adjust the resistance and change the color of the lights around the pedals, you&rsquo;ll need to use the app &mdash; so I was glad I didn&rsquo;t experience any connectivity issues.&nbsp;</p><p>The app has very poor reviews, unfortunately, mostly from users who have had repeated issues connecting their LifeSpan devices. However, the entire app experience for the Ampera bike seems like a great improvement over my experience using the app with the other LifeSpan device I tested, the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/lifespan-tr1200-glowup-under-desk-treadmill" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">TR1200-GlowUp under-desk treadmill</a>.

I work alone in a home office and I can&rsquo;t see the lights myself while I&rsquo;m pedaling (which is the only time they are on), so I&rsquo;d really only be doing it for the vibes.</p><h2>Comfortable enough to sit</h2><p>This bike is also surprisingly comfortable to use (and this is coming from someone who&rsquo;s heavily pregnant and has a very low tolerance for any kind of pelvic pressure at the moment). It has a wider seat than the standard bike seat that comes equipped on most exercise bikes, so it&rsquo;s much more supportive and comfortable for longer periods of sitting.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2>Price and specs</h2><p>The TR1200-GlowUp Under Desk Treadmill is a $1,799 treadmill &mdash; comparable in price to many high-end, full-sized treadmills.</p><p>However, this compact treadmill is made to be used with a standing desk so it lacks blazing speeds and resistance options. Still, it&rsquo;s well-built &mdash; featuring a 2.5 HP motor, a 20-inch x 50-inch walking surface, a max speed of 4.0 mph, and a generous weight capacity of 350 pounds.</p><p>It&rsquo;s also fully pre-assembled, making setup a breeze.&nbsp;And it comes with an Omni-Hub Console, a small touchscreen display that sits on your desk and allows you to set and control speeds and view workout metrics.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The high price is definitely an outlier in the under-desk treadmill sphere, and while the treadmill does have higher-quality features than other walking pads, we've still docked its Bang for the Buck score because of its price. And luckily, we've seen the TR1200-GlowUp go on sale.</p><h2>Safety, controls, and performance</h2><p>I have considered buying an under-desk treadmill for a while, but looking online I wasn&rsquo;t impressed with the options. A lot of them were inexpensive, flimsy-looking Amazon models. While the prices were great, they looked underpowered and lightweight, and they had LOTS of mixed reviews.&nbsp; Many of them seemed like they wouldn&rsquo;t last very long or that they wouldn&rsquo;t be very reliable.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>That&rsquo;s why I was SO impressed when I first saw the specs for the TR1200. This treadmill weighs 100 pounds, which is pretty heavy compared to similar under-desk treadmills &mdash; but it also makes for a very sturdy walking surface (it&rsquo;s also easy to maneuver around thanks to the wheels, even for me by myself). It feels extremely secure when I&rsquo;m walking on it &ndash; there&rsquo;s no wobbling or shaking, and the belt doesn&rsquo;t catch. It&rsquo;s also very quiet. These are complaints I saw frequently in reviews for less expensive under-desk treadmills.</p><p>It also has a much more generous maximum weight limit than most under-desk treadmills. It can accommodate people weighing up to 350 pounds, while most other models have an upper weight limit of 220 to 250 pounds. This makes the TR1200 a much more accessible option for people who are larger, or people who simply want a treadmill that&rsquo;s a little more sturdy.</p><p>The controls on the Omni-Hub display are also really easy to use, once you get used to them. I appreciate that it includes three presets (0.4 mph, 1.2 mph, and 3.0 mph) so that I don&rsquo;t have to begin at the bottom speed and use the arrows to scroll up to my desired speed every time I start walking.</p><p>Like most treadmills, it comes with a safety key that stops the treadmill if it gets pulled out of place. Mine is mounted to my desk, although I never remember to clip the other end to myself before I start walking.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, the treadmill automatically powers down if you stop walking on it for 20 seconds.</p><h2>The app is a bust</h2><p>Unfortunately, the Lifespan app leaves a lot to be desired. On the Google Play Store, it has only a 1 out of 5 stars with 18 reviews. I had no trouble connecting my treadmill to it via Bluetooth during the initial setup, but was never able to successfully connect to the app again. This was a common thread in customer reviews. And while I thought the app may be useful for setting my default speed or starting and stopping the treadmill, it actually just tracks metrics. For such a great treadmill, I&rsquo;d love to see improved functionality and more robust features on the app.</p><h2>Activity and productivity</h2><p>Now for the good stuff: How did this treadmill affect my productivity?&nbsp;</p><p>Honestly, I wasn&rsquo;t expecting the massive increase in my productive work time (and my average daily step count) that I experienced using this treadmill.</p><p>I had to start slowly, getting used to working while walking at 1.0 mph (which is essentially standing still) before increasing the speed any further. However, within just a few days I was able to work up to 2.0 mph and still be productive and efficient.</p><p>As a writer, I did experience some issues with typing accuracy while walking &mdash; mostly because I&rsquo;ve been in my third trimester of pregnancy while testing this treadmill. My belly bumps against the desk with every step I take, causing it to wobble and making it difficult to hit keys quickly and correctly. However, I wouldn&rsquo;t expect this to be a huge issue for people who aren&rsquo;t pregnant or who don&rsquo;t have a large belly. Still, it&rsquo;s much easier to walk while completing tasks that don&rsquo;t require a lot of typing.&nbsp;</p><p>Walking while working, even though it was slow, really helped me to stay more focused on the task at hand. It also helped to combat the fatigue I feel in the afternoon or when I&rsquo;m doing something for work that&rsquo;s not particularly mentally stimulating.</p><p>Also, the fitness benefits are great. Although I wouldn&rsquo;t consider slow treadmill walking a substitute for my regular workouts, it really helps boost my daily step count and prevent the soreness and stiffness that come along with sitting for hours at a time. Generally, I&rsquo;m able to clock roughly 800 to 1,000 steps per 10 minutes of walking &mdash; which means I can hit my daily step goal by walking at my desk for just one hour in addition to my standard daily steps.</p><p>For a great setup that allows for sitting and walking easily at an adjustable desk, I&rsquo;d also like to recommend my setup &ndash; I&rsquo;m pretty pleased with it. When I need to sit, I lower my adjustable desk and sit at my weight bench with a balance ball seat placed on top of it. The weight bench is extremely lightweight and easy to maneuver, and the legs provide plenty of clearance for me to leave the treadmill in place without needing to move it each time I want to sit. I&rsquo;ve also seen some people use an exercise ball directly on top of the treadmill as a seat, which also allows them to leave the treadmill in place.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

While I totally understand purchasing a less expensive option, I think it&rsquo;s worth paying a bit more for this one &mdash; especially if you&rsquo;re a larger person and you can&rsquo;t find another under-desk treadmill that will accommodate your weight.</p><p>Not to mention, the productivity boost from using an under-desk treadmill has been so fantastic I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever be able to go back to just sitting at a regular desk.</p><p>Now, the price tag is pretty steep &mdash; especially considering other under-desk treadmills are often available under $500. However, this treadmill offers a more powerful motor, a larger walking deck, a higher max speed, and a more generous weight limit than most others, so it may be worth spending more for. However, for casual desk walkers, consider a cheaper option like the <a href="https://zdcs.link/2eAll?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=WalkingPad%20P1&object_type=review&object_uuid=030kIv2YCD1GC6oIqqJjcs6&short_url=2eAll&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">WalkingPad P1</a> or <a href="https://zdcs.link/OdvPO?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=EgoFit%20Walker%20Plus&object_type=review&object_uuid=030kIv2YCD1GC6oIqqJjcs6&short_url=OdvPO&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">EgoFit Walker Plus</a>, which have both been tested and approved by Mashable writers.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The details on the Pixel 9 Pro XL's photo are more sharp and pronounced. For example, the blades of the grass, the leaves on the trees, the texture of the tree trunks, and the ripples of the bay appear to be more crisp and well-defined. The iPhone 15 Pro Max's shot, on the other hand, has a softer look.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro XL appears to have a brighter look and it's slightly more exposed. </p><p>Finally, the colors in the Pixel 9 Pro XL's shot are slightly more vibrant while the iPhone 15 Pro Max delivers a more natural look. I'm a sucker for an image with sharp, defined details, so the winner here is the Android device.</p><p><strong>Winner: </strong>Google Pixel 9 Pro XL</p><hr><p>Wide camera specs</p><p><strong>Pixel 9 Pro XL: 50MP,<em> f/</em>1.7 aperture, and 1.2&micro;m</strong></p><p><strong>iPhone 15 Pro Max: 48MP, <em>f/</em>1.8 aperture, and 1.22&micro;m</strong></p><hr><h2><strong>Ultrawide lens</strong></h2><h3>Pixel 9 Pro XL</h3><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The iPhone 15 Pro Max produced a significantly more detailed shot with the ultrawide shooter. It captured more details like the reflections on the glass buildings and textures on the billboards. Sharpness is well maintained throughout the image.</p><p>The iOS device also captured more vibrancy and delivered richer colors. Meanwhile, the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL lacks the definition the iPhone 15 Pro Max&rsquo;s ultrawide shooter offers.</p><p>For example, if you look at the sky, the blue hues are more vivid on the iPhone 15 Pro Max&rsquo;s shot. But on the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL, they look more muted &mdash; and even the clouds lack detail.</p><p><strong>Winner: </strong>iPhone 15 Pro Max</p><hr><p>Ultrawide camera specs</p><p><strong>Pixel 9 Pro XL: 48MP, <em>f/</em>1.7, 123 degrees</strong></p><p><strong>iPhone 15 Pro Max: 12MP, <em>f/</em>2.2, 120 degrees</strong></p><hr><h2><strong>Telephoto</strong></h2><h3>Pixel 9 Pro XL</h3><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> On the right of the image, you'll find water shooting out of a nearby fountain. On the iPhone 15 Pro Max's telephoto shot, the water droplets are more defined and sharper compared to the Pixel 9 Pro XL's interpretation of the scene.</p><p>Looking at the tippy-top of the Bryant Park Hotel, the Pixel 9 Pro XL has a warmer look, which is particularly noticeable when you look at the golden decorative finial featured on the building's pinnacle. Details like the brickwork, arches, and other ornamental features appear to be more pronounced on the Pixel 9 Pro XL compared to the iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><p>The iPhone 15 Pro Max produced a darker, cooler image, offering a more dramatic look.

<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> One positive about the Pixel 9 Pro XL is that it offer a greater field of view for selfies, so you can see more of my upper body in the shot. However, my skin tone looks less warm and my reddish hair color and burgundy top look more muted.</p><p>The iPhone 15 Pro Max, on the other hand, captured more details on my top. Plus, my complexion is more true-to-life. Even the leathery texture of my bag appears to be more prominent on the iPhone 15 Pro Max's capture.</p><p><strong>Winner: </strong>iPhone 15 Pro Max</p><hr><p>Selfie camera specs</p><p><strong>Pixel 9 Pro XL: 42MP, <em>f/</em>2.2</strong></p><p><strong>iPhone 15 Pro Max: 12MP, <em>f</em>/1.9</strong></p><hr><h2><strong>Pixel 9 Pro XL vs. iPhone 15 Pro Max camera test winner</strong></h2><p>There isn't a clear winner here. As cliche as it sounds, it depends on your preference. To sum things up, the Pixel 9 Pro XL excels with its wide lens shooter and telephoto sensor. The iPhone 15 Pro Max snaps better selfies and ultrawide shots. </p><p>The Google phone tends to offer brighter images, which may be appealing to those who prefer a highly illuminated look to their photos. The iPhone 15 Pro Max's shots are more balanced and true-to-life, so for consumers who have a preference for natural color accuracy, the Apple device is their best bet.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

Now deathly ill, Isak only has a few hours left to say goodbye to Sunja and his sons Noa (Kang Hoon Kim) and Mozasu (Eunseong Kwon). During that time, he shares some parting wisdom with his family about moving on and forgiving those who have wronged them. In <em>Pachinko</em>'s 1989 timeline, Sunja and Isak's grandson Solomon (Jin Ha) is willing to do neither of those things. As he works to destroy the businessmen who ended his career, he visits the Korean land owner (Hye Jin Park) he sought to do business with in Season 1, where he finds some unexpected leverage for his fight moving forward.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p><strong>Mashable: This episode is full of individual moments between Isak and his family as they're all saying goodbye in different ways. It feels like he's teaching them how to go on without him. Which of these conversations resonated most with you?</strong></p><p><strong>Soo Hugh, showrunner, writer, and executive producer of <em>Pachinko</em>: </strong>My favorite was the scene where Isak is sitting with Noa and Mozasu and he says, "I am your father, and you are my sons." I would just cry every time I heard that, because it's obvious he's speaking on a double level. He know he's not Noa's father, and he has no idea if his son will ever discover the truth, but he's telling Noa in that moment, "I am your father. No matter what you hear or what you learn, I will always be your father."</p><p><strong>We get another interesting scene involving Noa and Isak, when Isak reveals it was Pastor Hu who turned him in. What does that revelation mean to Noa in that moment?</strong></p><p>Can you imagine, if you're that boy and you find out that the person you looked to as a father figure while your father was gone was the person who put your father away, how devastating that must be? </p><q>
    You'll start to see the beginnings of a new Noa.
            <footer>- Soo Hugh</footer>
    </q>
<p>After that, you'll start to see the beginnings of a new Noa, the Noa that's going to start realizing that he will succeed at all costs. Before episode 2, he said he wanted to stay and be a pastor. But after Isak's death, he makes the decision that, "No, I'm going to go to Waseda. I'm going to succeed." That starts to set up Solomon's arc, too. There's a lot of mirroring between Solomon and Noa that we intentionally did. You see the same cycles working themselves in these generations.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p><strong>Tell me about Solomon's storyline this episode, where he returns to the Korean landowner's house and learns about the bones under her land, and how it speaks to Isak's death.</strong></p><p>One of the things that we talk about on <em>Pachinko</em>, and Sunja says it later on, is that you can't ever forget the past. The past is always living with them. In the present day, when Solomon hears about the bones under the landowner's property, those bones are from the period that we're watching in the past storylines. So you feel like history itself is the bones of our show. </p><q>

<p><strong>Speaking of the buried bones, this episode feels like it takes inspiration from some horror elements. I'm thinking about the flashes of the bicycle courier at the very start of the episode.</strong></p><p>I love that you picked up on that. We always said that from the opening shot of this episode with the boys playing war, that this should play like a horror film, and we're watching the boogeyman come back. In some ways, Isak's the boogeyman when he first bursts in, but then we subvert that.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p><strong>The stories in both timelines in this episode take place over a day and a night, so they feel really contained. What does a time constraint like that offer this episode in particular?</strong></p><p>To me, it really makes it feel so intimate, right? In <em>Pachinko</em>, we span so much time and so many different time periods, and we make time jumps. But to be able to say, for this one episode, we're going to use a microscope and really get down into it, it just felt like such a pleasure to be able to change rhythms. But also in an episode that has such a profound, emotional scene like Isak's death, I can't imagine shortchanging that and not giving it its time.</p><p><strong>That final scene between Sunja and Isak is clearly a defining moment for the show. As you and your co-writers Christina Yoon and Melissa Park approached this episode, what were some of the big challenges you anticipated facing?</strong></p><p>That scene is deceptively hard. We know it's going to be a sad scene, right? The question is, "How sad do you want it to be? And when do you want it to be sad?" Because if you start off so heavy in that final goodbye scene, where does the scene go? It was a challenge to write, and then it was a challenge for us to edit in the edit room, because our initial instinct was, "Come on, let's milk it. Let's make this as sad as possible." And it just didn't feel quite right when you did it that way. It didn't feel like our show, so we actually pulled back. If you look, there's actually very few tears that are shed.</p><p><strong>Composition-wise, those last moments between Sunja and Isak mirror a key scene from Season 1, episode 5, when they're first intimate with each other. Why did you choose to echo that scene in particular?</strong></p><p>We knew this scene had to mirror the first time Sunja and Isak made love. It establishes a cycle, right? Our beginning is our ending, which is bringing everything back into closing the loop here. </p><q>
    You realize just how much that love has really, really grown between them over the years.
            <footer>- Soo Hugh</footer>
    </q>
<p>I love that moment in Season 1, when it's the first time they really connect. They're married, and they're strangers. They don't know one another. You just see the terror as they're looking into each other's eyes, and then you see the love, the first glimpse of love start to bloom between them. Then when you cut to this scene in Season 2 with the cameras in the same place and at the same angles, you realize just how much that love has really, really grown between them over the years.</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/ZXA8M?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3B%3B%3Btemplate=article&amp%3B%3B%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3B%3B%3Belement=offer&amp%3B%3B%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3B%3B%3Belement_label=Pachinko%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Apple%20TV%2B.&amp%3B%3B%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3B%3B%3Bobject_uuid=06wlYdEl6F2qXP4vjvTNd0Z&amp%3B%3B%3Bshort_url=ZXA8M&amp%3B%3B%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Fbest-tv-episodes-2022&amp%3B%3Btemplate=video&amp%3B%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3B%3Belement=offer&amp%3B%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3B%3Belement_label=Pachinko%20Season%202%20premieres%20Aug.%2023%20on%20AppleTV%2B%2C%20with%20new%20episodes%20every%20Friday.&amp%3B%3Bobject_type=video&amp%3B%3Bobject_uuid=00J6DXhhpSidQcsueg2AZ3x&amp%3B%3Bshort_url=ZXA8M&amp%3B%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Fvideo%2Fpachinko-season-2-trailer&amp%3Btemplate=article&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=Pachinko%20Season%202%20premieres%20Aug.%2023%20on%20Apple%20TV%2B%2C%20with%20a%20new%20episode%20every%20Friday.&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=04rr8mjfjM2qMoIW0QCIhrJ&amp%3Bshort_url=ZXA8M&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Fpachinko-season-2-review&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Pachinko%20Season%202%20is%20now%20streaming%2C%20with%20a%20new%20episode%20every%20Friday.&object_type=article&object_uuid=027ez2njGKUhO6N12N1HPwa&short_url=ZXA8M&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Pachinko </em>Season 2 is now streaming, with a new episode every Friday.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As a trio of astronauts embarks on an interplanetary mission, they find themselves gripped by paranoia &mdash; at least in theory &mdash; and are unable to trust each other, or their own faculties. The problem, however, is that little-to-none of this conflict is rooted in discernible human drama.</p><p>The appearance of drama certainly exists, both aboard the space vessel and in numerous flashbacks. However, <em>Slingshot</em>'s images feel entirely disconnected from one another, since the film is less concerned with emotional impact, and more focused on indiscriminately tossing out twists and turns. By the end, the film is unable to sustain the weight of its attempted surprises, yielding a head-scratching experience.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What is <em>Slingshot</em> about?</strong></h2><p>Aboard the confines of a pristine spaceship, the Apple Store-like Odyssey One, astronaut John (Casey Affleck) wakes up from his fourth 90-day nap, a drug-induced hibernation that saves on energy and keeps the mission participants young. He's been gone from Earth for more than a year, and for the few days he's spent awake tinkering and taking measurements, his only company has been his comrade Nash (Tomer Capone) and their leader, Captain Franks (Laurence Fishburne). The trio only spends a day or two walking around at any given time, but these precious moments of consciousness are spent in a groggy haze, at least at first.&nbsp;</p><p>Their mission, in the short run, is to fly past Jupiter and use the planet's gravity to slingshot their way to Titan, one of Saturn's moons. They hope to scout the surface and eventually establish a human colony there, but despite the movie laying out these broad strokes, it never really features a sense of a wider objective or wider danger, be it images of a ravaged world left behind or any other existential threats. It's <em>Interstellar</em> without the blight or the sense of cosmic mystery, but it does feature a red-headed woman back home, who our protagonist constantly thinks of.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Emily Beecham plays John's lover, Zoe, a design technician whose work on the space project remains unspecified, but who we meet through the familiar, mawkish framing of a fleeting memory of her under a bedsheet, staring lovingly at John. There's nothing inherently wrong with doing what dozens of movies have done before &mdash; "If it ain't broke," and all that &mdash; but Zoe seldom exists as a real, complete person outside of her adoration for the protagonist, despite appearing in numerous flashbacks.</p><p>What is it that actually threatens the Titan mission? Well, that's not exactly clear. The camera whirls around the ship's halls a few times, as if to embody some invisible creature threatening our characters, but those are the only indications of any noticeable aesthetic flourish &mdash; one that isn't just aping <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>, that is. (For instance, the scene in Kubrick&rsquo;s film in which two astronauts speak in secret to avoid a super-computer&rsquo;s prying ears is re-created here, but without the certainty that anyone else is listening.) This thread of some kind of lurking presence aboard the ship unfortunately doesn't last, so it doesn't really come to represent anything for the characters as they lumber through the movie&rsquo;s plot (or lack thereof), making observations and relaying those observations back to one another.</p><p>John finds parts of the ship damaged, possibly due to external impact, which theoretically endangers their upcoming gravitational slingshot, but the captain disagrees. John sees (or imagines) things going wrong all around him, but the crew can find no evidence of something overtly wrong. This disconnect is a central wedge aimed at creating tension and mystery, but it thrusts the film into a strange narrative limbo where it's hard to know if there are any stakes at all.</p><h2><strong><em>Slingshot</em>'s stellar performances can't save the movie.</strong></h2><p>Upon emerging from his drug-induced sleep, John gradually loses his grip on reality, seeing people on the ship who clearly aren't there. Zoe is among these hallucinations, though curiously, her phantom appearance is rarely used as fuel for the movie&rsquo;s flashbacks. When the trio loses communication with Earth, their sense of uncertainty turns toward one another. John suggests there may be a problem with the vessel; Nash is more certain of this, albeit without any evidence; and Captain Franks dismisses their concerns. This leads to the closest thing the movie has to an interesting theme: a dynamic between the three characters that forces John to mediate between two extremes.&nbsp;</p><p>As John, Affleck harbors a weary exhaustion in every scene, selling the fact that he can't be trusted to make rational decisions, since he has trouble remembering basic details about his life on Earth. His first time trying to recall these details is the only time the movie&rsquo;s many flashbacks feel motivated. The rest appear at random, presenting a patchwork story of a man driven to pilot a space mission (for unspecified reasons) at the cost of his relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>Amid his delirium, John is shouldered with the burden of being the most calm, logical, and centered character, while his coworkers gradually drift toward opposing extremes. Affleck does his level best to connect the dots between these past and present narratives, putting on a stern front in either case and gradually letting cracks appear in his stoic armor. But the film is fatally flawed: Its structure seldom allows for any causality between these timelines &mdash; any ripple effects or regrets, even though John's decision to join the three-man crew is a sticking point for his relationship with Zoe. Their fate as a couple seems to become clearer as the film goes on, though it&rsquo;s eventually muddied in service of unearned surprises that, at the end of the day, do little more than obscure its actors&rsquo; stellar dramatic work. What they draw on emotionally seems to shift at a moment&rsquo;s notice, making it hard to latch on to the leading trio.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Capone, like Affleck, captures his character's unraveling with aplomb, as Nash steps further toward madness and away from reality. He threatens to turn the film truly intense, though his ravings about what might go wrong are short-lived. The film keeps brushing past any sense of immediate danger the moment it arises, and in the process, doesn't allow Capone to access the full extent of Nash's unhinged trajectory, despite the actor hinting toward a mental snap of some kind.</p><p>Captain Franks, on the other hand, has a much icier demeanor, and Fishburne is granted the movie's most complete (and really, only) marriage between story and performance. As John and Nash lose their grip on reality and question their own eyes, Franks is much more certain of what he sees, which makes him all the more terrifying. With dialogue that borders on Shakespearean, Fishburne taps into a sense of misguided human ambition, and gestures toward a thematic layer to the movie that, while ever-present, goes mostly unexplored.</p><h2><strong>No, really, what is <em>Slingshot</em> actually about?</strong></h2><p>The three men aboard the ship take wildly different approaches to the scenario at hand, and in the process, they come to represent the three prongs of human personality through a<a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/psyche.html" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"> <u>Freudian lens</u></a>. Nash, with his erratic moments and instinct-driven concerns, embodies the id. Captain Franks, who places constraints on his comrades and claims a rational high ground, is the superego. And John, who's forced to mediate between them and make moral compromises, is the ego in this scenario.</p><p>The problem, however, is that despite the movie employing this particular framework (one it harps on quite overtly by the end), it doesn't use it to explore the fraught dynamics between the characters in any meaningful way. What they each represent feels set in stone, with little sense of dilemma or evolution. How they behave in any moment is dictated by their respective "types" rather than by the unfolding plot, or even by one&nbsp;another's words or actions. One could, in theory, map out exactly what each of them might do in practically any scenario, which robs the movie of tension at every turn.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>To make matters worse, there aren't even enough interesting scenarios that arise during the film, which might in theory pose dramatic challenges. As <em>Slingshot</em> goes on, any sense of psychological or dramatic framing is superseded by an insistence on surprise at any cost, though these attempted zigzags are mostly delivered in the form of dialogue, rather than anything visual (and thus, emotionally lasting). The film takes full advantage of the characters' unreliable perspectives, perhaps to a baffling degree. Each moment of realization, each discovery that things may not be exactly as they seem, is followed by another, and another, and yet another, with no room for any revelations to breathe or sink in, let alone alter the characters' sense of self.</p><p>Beyond a point, shifting reality becomes <em>Slingshot</em>'s status quo, even though it largely presents these shifts in the form of dialogue. Characters simply explain to each other what may or may not be their version of the truth, until every other line hints at some new twist or surprise with no impact whatsoever, eliciting no more than a shrug.</p><p>With little by way of character psychology to latch onto, and even less by way of actual stakes, the movie's thrills and science-fiction elements are practically null, rendering <em>Slingshot</em> an entirely meaningless sci-fi thriller. Its basic premise would be hard to explain to a friend, because it doesn't even feel like it has one.</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/joRne?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Slingshot%20opens%20exclusively%20in%20theaters%20Aug.%2030.&object_type=article&object_uuid=05JoeNT1rrDiQp3e1NbptEg&short_url=joRne&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Slingshot </em>opens exclusively in theaters Aug. 30.</a> </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ryan Gosling plays Colt Seavers, a stuntman character originated by Lee Majors in the show created by Glen A. Larson. However, where Majors' hero was moonlighting as a bounty hunter when he wasn't on set, Gosling's version is more a hapless nobody who stumbles into a criminal conspiracy. And it's love that keeps him there.&nbsp;</p><p>There's trouble on the set of <em>Metalstorm</em>, a sci-fi epic/romance that stars the obnoxious Tom Ryder (Johnson) as a daring space cowboy. But when the mercurial movie star goes MIA, his old stunt double is called back into action. Not only is Colt tasked with doing intense stunts to keep the movie's production schedule on track, but the high-strung producer Gail Meyer (<a href="https://mashable.com/article/ted-lasso-season-3-ending-explained" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Ted Lasso</u></em></a>'s Hannah Waddingham) asks him to unearth the missing actor.&nbsp;</p><p>It's not just the movie Colt is trying to save. You see, this is the directorial debut of his former flame, Jody Moreno (Emily Blunt). With his heart on his sleeve, this stuntman throws himself into the fray to make her dreams come true, all in hopes of scoring a second chance at romance.&nbsp;</p><h2>Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt are perfectly paired in The Fall Guy.&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Crucial to a good action/rom-com is a dynamic where conflict and chemistry collide. You need the stars to click on screen so the audience is invested in their getting together. But they need to be believably pugnacious with each other so the <em>why</em> of not being together is clear.&nbsp;</p><p>Smartly, Blunt and Gosling gave the world a preview of their chemistry at the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/oscar-winners-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>96th Annual Academy Awards</u></a>, where <a href="https://mashable.com/article/barbenheimer-oscars-ryan-gosling-emily-blunt#:~:text=Emily%20Blunt%20and%20Ryan%20Gosling,Oppenheimer's%20Kitty%20and%20Barbie's%20Ken." target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>they playfully bickered over the Barbenheimer rivalry</u></a>.

<p>There is some suspension of disbelief required, of course, but not in the movie's premise &mdash; it's that Gosling is supposed to look like he's <em>not</em> a movie star, while he still basically looks like <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ryan-gosling-performs-im-just-ken-2024-oscars-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Ken</u></a>, albeit with some scruffy facial hair.

The stunts here are done by a top-notch stunt team,&nbsp;which the movie's promotional tour is keen to celebrate. But&nbsp;Gosling brings to banter scenes and other comedic moments an ego-free display of mugging, an earnest thumbs-up gesture, and even crying to <a href="https://mashable.com/video/fall-guy-interview-taylor-swift-all-too-well-ryan-gosling" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Taylor Swift's "All Too Well"</u></a> that establishes Colt as a goofball as much as a tough guy. When Blunt coolly instructs him to drive her to her car &mdash; parked just feet away from where they idle &mdash; you can see the core sense of humor they have in common.&nbsp;</p><p>After a couple of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/a-quiet-place-part-ii-movie-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Quiet Place </u></em></a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/a-quiet-place-part-ii-movie-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>movies</u></a> and the sternness of <em>Oppenheimer</em>, it's a delight to see Blunt back in comedy. She's got terrific comedic timing that pairs perfectly with her well-placed hard stare. Her Jody isn't made to be an ambitious bitch in the way of broad '80s movie stereotypes, but she has her moments of playing rough. Yet Jody is chiefly defined by trying to maintain her cool under incredibly stressful circumstances, which makes little moments where she breaks down burst with humor &mdash;&nbsp;be it a karaoke jam to Phil Collins or literally grasping at a straw.&nbsp;</p><p>Together, Gosling and Blunt create a could-be couple that's alluring not only for their looks but also their awkwardness. Dumb jokes and fumbling flirtations shrewdly undercut what could be a glossy, unnatural rom-com to make a movie that's endearing and entertaining.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Fall Guy is a winsome showbiz comedy.&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>True to his reputation, Leitch provides plenty of outrageous action scenes once again. Some are for the movie-within-the-movie, including a car roll that broke a Guinness World Record. Some are part of Colt's off-set misadventures, which include swordplay, fire fights, daring escapes, and a speedboat chase.&nbsp;</p><p>As the discourse around including stunts in the Oscars rages on, <em>The Fall Guy </em>will definitely be a major talking point for advocates of the category addition. However, the stunt community representation within the film feels a bit thin, being just Colt and his stunt coordinator, played by a jovial <a href="https://mashable.com/video/winston-duke-breaking-up-apple" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Winston Duke</u></a>.

<p><em>The Fall Guy</em> is about more than stunts, folding in the bonds that form across departments on set, including a horny VFX supervisor (Zara Michales), a too-Method ingenue (Teresa Palmer), and a perturbed personal assistant (<a href="https://mashable.com/video/stephanie-hsu-jimmy-fallon-everything-everywhere-all-at-once" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Everything Everywhere All at Once</u></em></a><a href="https://mashable.com/video/stephanie-hsu-jimmy-fallon-everything-everywhere-all-at-once" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>'s Stephanie Hsu</u></a>). As a whole, this movie delights in giving a peek behind the scenes to reveal the messy human conflicts (which also make for great on-screen drama), as well as the absurdity inherent in playing pretend for a living. What is never mocked is the dream of making movies.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether she's furious at Colt or frustrated by outrageous obstacles, Jody is driven by making the movie that she's dreamed of her whole life. Colt isn't just dedicated to her but also to her vision, as is much of the supporting cast of characters. And in this, there's an enveloping exhilaration, as if we the viewer are part of this collaboration too. This energetic sense of inclusion welcomes us into the twists, fails, and breakthroughs the characters face in an electrifying way. All of that barrels into a finale that is not just exciting but enthralling.&nbsp;</p><p><em>The Fall Guy </em>is action/romantic-comedy done right, a rare gem in the crown of this challenging subgenre.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/V8jXOhttps://www.peacocktv.com/stream-movies/the-fall-guy?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=The%20Fall%20Guy%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Peacock.&object_type=article&object_uuid=00cCPj7amUaQhfJZuHBRHaV&short_url=the-fall-guy&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>The Fall Guy</em> is now streaming on Peacock.</a></p><p class="mx-auto">

It&rsquo;s a motorized desk that allows you to sit or stand with just the press of a button. I was impressed by the quality of the materials, how easy it was to put together, and its moderate price compared to other motorized desks.</p><p>After using only a seated desk for my entire adult career, I&rsquo;ve adopted the FlexiSpot E7 as my full-time workspace for the past month. Here are my honest thoughts.&nbsp;</p><h2>FlexiSpot setup and controls</h2><p>I&rsquo;ll be honest: This desk sat in boxes in my office for far longer than it should have, because I was certain that putting it together would be a major PITA.&nbsp;</p><p>So imagine my surprise when I was all done in an hour and a half, having only called in my husband once to help secure the desktop to the legs with his drill. This desk was ridiculously easy to put together.</p><p>The controls are also really easy to use. There is an up button, a down button, and a memory button. When you press the M (for memory), you can assign a specific height to one of the four presets.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

The standing desk has conveniently allowed me to consolidate a little bit. I currently have presets for walking on my under-desk treadmill and sitting at my weight bench on a balance ball seat. Previously, I had to keep a large office chair in here because my weight bench was too low for my desk.</p><p>Finally, you can also lock the controls by holding down the M button, and unlock it by holding it down again. This feature has been a lifesaver since my kids are constantly running in (and they&rsquo;re always perplexed by whatever new products I&rsquo;m testing), or I brush against the buttons when I&rsquo;m reaching for something on the bookshelf next to my desk.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>During setup, you can choose which side you want to install the control panel on. My only wish is that I had chosen the opposite side of my desk. I could change it, but it&rsquo;s not a huge priority. It just beeps when you press on the control panel while it&rsquo;s locked, so I unintentionally get beeped at quite frequently. Something to consider if you decide to purchase.</p><p>The control panel also has a USB port, which adds a handy place to charge my phone at my workstation without introducing yet another cable to the bird&rsquo;s nest under my desk.&nbsp;</p><h2>My new and improved workspace</h2><p>I was extremely surprised at how much my productivity increased by standing or walking at my desk. Maybe it&rsquo;s the novelty of it, and I&rsquo;ll see my productivity decline over time &mdash; but right now I am basking in better focus and being more resistant to distractions.</p><p>Being deep in my third trimester of pregnancy, I can&rsquo;t walk or stand for too long without feeling enormous pelvic pressure, so the desk makes it a breeze to sit when I&rsquo;m ready.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The motor is extremely quiet and moves very smoothly. It doesn&rsquo;t jerk or shake at all, and I feel perfectly comfortable adjusting the height with a full glass of water sitting on the desktop.&nbsp;</p><p>The E7 also comfortably fit my dual screen setup and external keyboard and mouse (with some note-taking space too!), although I did have to move a few other things off my desk to ensure that there was always clearance for the desk to move up and down. There are some larger and smaller options on the FlexiSpot website too, if you require more or less space for your work.&nbsp;</p><p>The brand also sells some cable management accessories specifically made for FlexiSpot desks, if you want to do a better job of that than I did.&nbsp;</p><h2>Is the FlexiSpot E7 standing desk worth it?</h2><p>If you work from home, then <a href="https://zdcs.link/2eG3D?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=this%20desk&object_type=review&object_uuid=03yY5igdvvwWikbHSC9CPYn&short_url=2eG3D&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">this desk</a> is 100 percent worth the investment. It has only done good things for my productivity, my focus, and my health. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever be able to go back to a regular desk (nor do I plan to).&nbsp;</p><p>It's even better if you can also afford an under-desk treadmill or bike, so that you can add a physical activity component as well.&nbsp;</p><p>I also think the E7 is fairly priced and really great quality, although it would be nice if the desktop was included in the base price. Desktops start at an additional $80, so the lowest all-in price is just under $600. However, FlexiSpot frequently offers sales too, so you&rsquo;re unlikely to pay full price when you&rsquo;re ready to buy. The most comparable motorized option is the Uplift Desk, which also clocks in at just under $600.&nbsp;</p><p>Although I was skeptical, this desk has got me humming REM like the elder millennial I am &mdash; &ldquo;stand in the place where you work.&rdquo;</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

      <description><![CDATA[Ruggable is known for its swappable, washable rugs. I tested the premium medium pile rug in my home for five months.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/reviews/003hT8dVu11TTIuphYYcBfz/hero-image.png" alt="ruggable rug and dog"><p>I&rsquo;m going to start this review with some brutal honesty: I&rsquo;m <em>very</em> picky about rugs. With two large dogs, one of which is a husky, and concrete floors, rugs are a necessity in this household as much as a headache. Between constantly battling dog hair, scrubbing out stains, and yes &mdash; the occasional dog vomit &mdash; I&rsquo;ve learned that some rugs are better than others, and sometimes &ldquo;stain resistant&rdquo; or &ldquo;washable&rdquo; rugs are anything but.&nbsp;</p><p>When I was asked to try out <a href="https://zdcs.link/o5bGv?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Ruggable%E2%80%99s%20premium%20medium%20pile%20rugs&object_type=review&object_uuid=003hT8dVu11TTIuphYYcBfz&short_url=o5bGv&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Ruggable&rsquo;s premium medium pile rugs</a>, however, it felt like a godsend because it happened to be the exact same week that my husky took a lil poo on my all-time favorite rug. My all-time favorite <em>shag</em> rug, which absolutely could not be saved.&nbsp;</p><h2>This wasn&rsquo;t my first time trying out Ruggable</h2><p>Time for my second piece of honesty: I&rsquo;ve tried Ruggable before, and I absolutely hated it. Soon after moving into our downtown condo, my partner and I embarked on a quest to cover our concrete floors with rugs. We&rsquo;d found ones for our bedroom, living room, and office (RIP to my favorite), but our massive open kitchen/dining room was proving to be a challenge &mdash; especially in such a high-traffic, stain-prone area. Because we don&rsquo;t live under a rock, we&rsquo;d heard of Ruggable and decided to give it a try. Surely a washable rug would make the best option for our space?&nbsp;</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Except we were very wrong. Right out of the box, our first Ruggable looked terrible. Instead of a rug, it looked like a cheap piece of fabric with a poorly printed design that barely matched the photo, and aligning the 9 x 12-foot rug on top of the pad was nigh impossible. Immediately after rolling it out and battling with the alignment, we both shook our heads, rolled it back up, and promptly returned it assuming that Ruggable kinda sucked.&nbsp;</p><p>We were wrong.</p><h2>My second experience with Ruggable blew the first out of the water</h2><p>A year after that experience, we visited a friend&rsquo;s new house for the first time. Sitting around her dining room table, my partner mentioned our long-term struggle to find decent rugs that were dog friendly and asked where she&rsquo;d found so many incredible rugs. Her answer? <a href="https://zdcs.link/ODqbY?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Ruggable&object_type=review&object_uuid=003hT8dVu11TTIuphYYcBfz&short_url=ODqbY&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Ruggable</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>We were shocked. They were <em>so</em> much better than our first Ruggable experience, enough so that &mdash; when the chance came to test Ruggable again a few weeks later &mdash; we decided to chalk it up as a blip. Our friend&rsquo;s rugs were stunning, soft, and looked like &ldquo;real&rdquo; rugs, so we eagerly picked out the design we wanted to try and waited for it to arrive.</p><p>Straight away, I was impressed by how much Ruggable&rsquo;s selection had improved in a year. They had so many more designs available &mdash; including more plush, shag, and outdoor options than before &mdash; as well as what we wanted to test: premium, medium pile rugs.&nbsp;</p><p>We did struggle to find a style we both liked, mainly because Ruggable&rsquo;s selection tended to steer toward minimal, muted colors and we were hoping for something a little bit brighter, but we landed on a 6 x 9-foot &#8203;&#8203;Absida Teal Premium Rug that would be perfect for our shared home office. At $479, it was about $100 more than our last rug, but the washability factor alone made it worth it, so we placed our order and were pleased when it arrived eight days later.</p><h2>What I loved about my new Ruggable rug</h2><p>First things first, our second purchase from Ruggable was <em>nothing</em> like the first. The premium 7-millimeter rug cover was plush, well-designed, and actually looked like a high-quality, durable rug. The pattern was exactly what we wanted, and it was much easier to align with the cushioned rug pad than our first experience. It took us about 10 minutes to get the furniture out of the way, lay out the rug pad, and get everything lined up, and &mdash; other than a slight overlap where the rug was a few inches longer on one end than the pad &mdash; we were super pleased with the results.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>A few months later, I can honestly say the same. Not only is our Ruggable just as soft as the other medium pile rugs in our house but it&rsquo;s been super easy to clean and maintain. Whenever dog hair starts to build up, we just give it a quick sweep and it&rsquo;s back to looking crisp and clean as ever.&nbsp;</p><p>I will admit that we (thankfully) haven&rsquo;t needed to put our Ruggable in the washing machine yet, but spot-cleaning it with a damp cloth has been <em>way</em> easier than cleaning our other medium pile rugs &mdash; and worlds better than battling against a super plush shag rug.&nbsp;</p><h2>What I don&rsquo;t love about Ruggable</h2><p>Aside from the lack of super vibrant rugs, my only real complaint with the premium Ruggable is adjusting it. It&rsquo;s not necessarily difficult to get it aligned, but the velcro backing does make it a lot harder than dragging a normal rug over a rug pad. Plus, because the rug cover is a bit bigger than the cushioned rug pad beneath it, getting it matched up can be a challenge &mdash; one we gave up on. Our rug sits a few inches over the rug pad on one end, and it&rsquo;s at least one inch over on all other sides, and it&rsquo;s definitely noticeable. Even though some of our other rugs have slightly smaller rug pads, something about Ruggable&rsquo;s rug covers made the overlap a bit more visible than our other rugs.&nbsp;</p><h2>Is Ruggable worth the price?&nbsp;</h2><p>It depends. If you have <a href="https://mashable.com/series/furtastic" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">pets</a> or kids &mdash; or you need a rug that&rsquo;s easy to keep clean in a high-traffic area &mdash; then absolutely. Ruggable has far exceeded my expectations when it comes to a versatile, durable rug, and it&rsquo;s certainly been easier to clean than any of my &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; rugs.&nbsp;</p><p>If you&rsquo;re looking for something that is going to look and feel impeccably plush and soft, however, I&rsquo;m on the fence. The premium medium pile rugs certainly feel better than I thought they would, but a lot of the thickness comes from the cushioned rug pad &mdash; which is an absolute must-buy. It&rsquo;s not that our Ruggable looks bad by any means, it just&hellip;doesn&rsquo;t quite look or feel quite as good as a stunning, high-quality rug can look.&nbsp;</p><p>And considering the 6 x 9-foot premium rug we got from Ruggable clocks in at $479, that&rsquo;s almost double the price we&rsquo;ve paid for most of our other medium pile rugs of the same size. It is a little easier to clean than some, but the visible overlap is still an annoyance.</p><p>It&rsquo;s also worth noting that while Ruggable touts its rugs as interchangeable &mdash; meaning you can swap out the rug cover for a new one whenever you want to change up the style &mdash; the rug cover we got would be $390 by itself. You can save quite a bit by switching to Ruggable&rsquo;s classic 2-millimeter rug cover over the premium 7-millimeter rug, but the loss of thickness isn&rsquo;t quite worth it in my opinion.&nbsp;</p><p>Obviously, Ruggable&rsquo;s premium medium pile rugs are still cheaper than many other rugs on the market, but whether or not it&rsquo;s the right option for you depends on your situation. If you&rsquo;re looking for something on thickness or appearance alone? It might not be the right option for you. But if you&rsquo;re looking for an attractive, durable and washable rug that will see a lot of action? The price of a Ruggable might be worth it.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

But Microsoft and OpenAI are no longer exclusive. </p><p>At Apple's WWDC event in June, the tech giant announced a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-openai-chatgpt-integration-announced-wwdc-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">partnership</a> with OpenAI, which will integrate ChatGPT features on the iOS 18 update. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/5-apple-intelligence-features-ios-18-1-developer-beta" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple Intelligence</a> features are currently available in beta, but ChatGPT-related features have not yet been released.</p><p>Apple has been cagey about its AI plans, and has mostly sat on the sidelines as other Big Tech companies duked it out for AI dominance. But Apple's partnership in June with OpenAI was its first major play in the AI arena.</p><p>Apple is reportedly <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-google-ai-partnership-report" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">exploring partnerships </a>with Google, Meta, and Anthropic to provide users with their AI model of choice on its devices. But now, Apple's reported investment in OpenAI is a major move in strengthening their ties &mdash; especially since Apple rarely invests in startups. </p><p>The <a href="https://mashable.com/article/iphone-16-event-confirmed" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple event</a> in September typically focuses on hardware.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/05b28CwhnHnmQjlF1zR7Ja3/hero-image.jpg" alt="Yelp sticker on local business door"><p>"Google is a monopolist." Those were the words written by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta earlier this month in his landmark ruling against the search giant in the antitrust case brought to the court by the U.S. Justice Department.</p><p>While that case against Google pertained to its $20 billion deal with Apple regarding Google Search maintaining its default dominance on the iPhone, it seems that the DOJ lawsuit may have just opened the floodgates.</p><p>On Wednesday, local business review platform Yelp <a href="https://trust.yelp.com/yelp-v-google/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>filed an antitrust lawsuit</u></a> against Google regarding the company's dominance over local search and local search advertising. </p><h2><strong>Yelp takes on Google's local search dominance</strong></h2><p>Yelp's case against Google is all about the search giant giving priority to its own local search product.&nbsp;</p><p>"Our case is about Google, the largest information gatekeeper in existence, putting its heavy thumb on the scale to stifle competition and keep consumers within its own walled garden," writes Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman in a public post addressing the lawsuit. "Google has illegally abused its monopoly in general search to dominate the local search and local search advertising markets &mdash; engaging in anticompetitive conduct that has degraded the quality of search results and demoted rivals to grow its market power."</p><p>Type in any local business whether it be a nearby restaurant or plumbing service and Google local search information is unavoidable. Google reviews and star ratings for an establishment, left via Google Maps, as well as contact information, business hours, and more are all readily available right the on Google Search results page. On the web, this information is usually located on the sidebar and doesn't distract from Google's competitors on the search page as much. However, perform a local search on a mobile device and Google's local search information is oftentimes the first &ndash; and only &ndash; thing you see on the page until you scroll down.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>"When a consumer conducts a Google search with local intent, Google manipulates its results to promote its own local search offerings above those of its rivals, regardless of the comparative poorer quality of its own properties, exempting itself from the qualitative ranking system it uses for other sites," Stoppelman says.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the Yelp CEO, Google's anticompetitive practices have impacted the company so much that Yelp has noticed that an increase in the number of Google searches for a term has often resulted in zero additional clicks to links recommended on the page. The reason, according to Yelp, is that Google's local search product just provides all the information on the search page which gives users no reason to click through to a competitor.&nbsp;</p><p>Yelp's public push explaining its lawsuit against Google cites numerous cases against Google over the years as well as fines the company has received for anticompetitive practices. It also includes crucial quotes from Google executives over the years such as one from Google's former VP of search products Marissa Mayer where she claims Google would put their own products first in Google search results because it "seems only fair." Mayer's statement also acknowledges that search ranking results would only be ranked by popularity after Google's own product link at the top of the page.</p><p>Yelp, a regular Google critic, clearly sees an opening after the recent ruling from Judge Mehta. Yelp&rsquo;s General Counsel Aaron Schur said so himself in a statement provided to Mashable.</p><p>"Judge Amit Mehta&rsquo;s recent ruling in the government&rsquo;s antitrust case against Google, finding Google illegally maintained its monopoly in general search, is a watershed moment in antitrust law, and provides a strong foundation for Yelp&rsquo;s case against Google," Schur said. "In addition to injunctive relief, Yelp seeks a remedy that ensures Google can no longer self-preference in local search."</p><p>"The harms caused by Google&rsquo;s self-preferencing are not unique to Yelp, and we look forward to telling our story in court," he continued.</p><p>Mashable has reached out to Google for comment and will update if we hear back. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2><strong>Social Security breach check</strong></h2><p>Pentester, a cybersecurity firm, launched a tool that lets you check if your data was caught up in a recent breach.

While this might seem like a no-brainer, the reality is that many Americans don&rsquo;t scrutinize every line item on their credit and debit card statements, which leaves room for fraudulent charges to slip through unnoticed.</p><p>2. <strong>Credit monitoring - </strong>Set up credit monitoring with one or all of the major credit bureaus, including Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. This way, you&rsquo;ll get alerts for any suspicious activity, like new or existing accounts being opened in your name. </p><p>3. <strong>Consider a credit freeze</strong> <strong>-</strong> Instituting a credit freeze is like hitting a big red button. It stops new credit from being opened in your name without your explicit permission.</p><p>Of course, none of these steps will erase the fact that your Social Security number is now floating around in the cybercrime underworld. But they&rsquo;re practical measures you can take to safeguard your finances and protect yourself from future headaches.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Here are three things it can do:</p><ol><li><p><strong>It uses smart detection, relying on multiple machine-learning models, to identify and isolate objects in your photo.</strong> In other words, the technology that underpins Clean Up tool can precisely determine the edges of objects.</p></li><li><p><strong>After identifying the edges, it removes the object and intelligently fills in the void.</strong> (Clean Up Tool is even designed to handle challenging elements of an object, including shadows and reflections.)</p></li><li><p><strong>Clean Up "knows" whether other subjects, like yourself or friends, overlap the object</strong>. So in theory, Clean Up will not accidentally replace a person you want to be front-and-center of your photo.</p></li></ol><p>Users can use the Clean Up tool in the Photos app. Once you spot an undesirable object in an image, you can tap or circle it, prompting the AI to detect it, so you can remove it. You can also zoom in on photos to finely retouch tiny blemishes.</p><p>One other Apple Intelligence feature the Cupertino-based tech giant added to the new iOS 18.1 update is notification summaries.

What does that mean? As I discovered this morning, when you leave the tab while in a Google Meet, the call will <em>automatically </em>shrink to a smaller size and appear in the bottom-right part of your screen. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>This feature used to be an option you could turn on during a meeting, though some, like myself, likely didn't know it existed. It's quite helpful, especially if you want to look something up while discussing a work project. Now, you're not tied to the Google Meet tab. </p><p>The feature, at least for now, is available only to users on a computer using Google Chrome. </p><p>Wrote Google's Workspace team in&nbsp;<a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/08/picture-in-picture-in-google-meet-will-open-when-switching-tabs.html" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">a blog post</a>: "This simple yet impactful update will help ensure your meeting stays visible and accessible if you need to switch tabs to take notes, view meeting-related documents, and more."</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>I've found the tool helpful thus far. It allows me to attend a meeting and to whatever else I might need to do. </p><p>The feature's gradual rollout started on Monday. It appeared for me on Thursday and could appear for others over the next week or so. For all you multi-taskers out there, welcome to a new world. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2><strong>The environmental cost of supercomputers like xAI</strong></h2><p>According to the letter, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/elon-musk-xai-supercomputer-plans" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">xAI has installed</a> at least 18 gas combustion turbines, which "have the capacity to emit about 130 tons of the ozone-precursor nitrogen oxides (NOx) per year." The groups allege that the xAI data center, which may be contributing to Memphis' existing smog problem, "has not applied for any air permits for these turbines."</p><p>The vast amount of electricity and computing power required to run AI models is an emissions nightmare.

And that's not counting the amount of water required to cool the servers and e-waste. </p><p>With supercomputers using up the same amount of energy as a small country, it's easy to see the global environmental impact, let alone the immediate vicinity of a data center like Memphis. </p><p>The letter, which says xAI's data centers violate Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) smog standards, calls for an investigation by the local county health department. Moreover, the letter requests that the data center cease operations until a permit is obtained.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>Having tested the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/roborock-s8-pro-ultra-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Roborock S8 Pro Ultra robot vacuum</a>, we're intimately familiar with all of the high-tech features it offers. It self-empties and can run room-by-room, even creating no-go zones. While we found that it was rather imprecise in use, it's still a solid hands-free option for both vacuuming and mopping. Our biggest beef with the Roborock S8 Pro Ultra is for how expensive it is, it doesn't live up to our cleaning standards.</p><p>However, during Amazon's Labor Day sale, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/ODq4M?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Roborock%20S8%20Pro%20Ultra%20robot%20vacuum%20and%20mop&object_type=article&object_uuid=07A86ChMrinVKDGljvJZUVm&short_url=ODq4M&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Roborock S8 Pro Ultra robot vacuum and mop</a> is nearly half its price. Currently, the price is down to $1,099.99 but an on-page coupon provides another $200, making it $899.99. That saves $700 for 44% off.</p><h3>More robot vacuum deals</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/DVYRo?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Eufy%2011S%20Max%20Robot%20Vacuum&object_type=article&object_uuid=07A86ChMrinVKDGljvJZUVm&short_url=DVYRo&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Eufy 11S Max Robot Vacuum</a> &mdash;

<p>Sleep is one of life's essentials. We've all had bad nights (or months) where sleep just didn't happen, and we know how painful that can feel the next day. Having a hazy brain, no gusto, and the heaviest of eyelids is not a great experience. If you're not sleeping well, it might be time to consider if your mattress is holding you back.</p><p>Whether it's feeling lumpy, too soft, or it's so old that you can no longer remember when you bought it, it's probably time for an upgrade. But buying a new mattress can feel intimidating since there are actually thousands to choose from and some of them cost quite a bit. You're in luck though if you're shopping for a new mattress this week because Labor Day brings about some incredible deals on beds. </p><p>Here are our top picks for mattress deals:</p><h2>Best overall mattress deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

The One is Casper's latest iteration of the Original, offering support with three layers of foam designed for great pressure relief. Casper included Breathe Flex Foam in the upper layer of the bed, which has an open-cell construction to offer better airflow. Just below this layer, memory foam aims to cradle the curves of the body.</p><p>Casper considers The One to have a medium-firm feel, but if you're not totally sure what firmness level you prefer, you won't have to lose any sleep. Casper offers a 100 night sleep trial with The One, so you can sleep on it in the comfort of your own bedroom for over three months while still being eligible for a return.</p><h2>Best hybrid mattress deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>While it's not the fanciest TV on the market by any means, Amazon's 2-Series Fire TV is a great choice for those seeking a no-frills smart TV on a tight budget. As of Aug. 29, the 40-inch version is down to just $159.99 for Prime members when you use the code 40PRIME at checkout. That's a savings of $90 and just $10 away from its <a href="https://mashable.com/article/may-17-amazon-fire-tv-deal" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">lowest price on record</a>.

It features subtle improvements over the S23 series specs, including a newer Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, a brighter screen, and thinner bezels, plus support for a new suite of Galaxy AI features. The S24+, in particular, offers more screen real estate than the S24 with higher-resolution, as well as a beefier 4,900mAh battery. Regularly $999.99, an unlocked S24+ with 256GB of storage is down to just $799 as of Aug. 29 &mdash; that's its lowest price to date.</p><p><em>None of these deals catching your eye?

<p>The biggest visual difference lies in three black stripes that run horizontally along the device's white exterior.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p> Aside from some stripes, it doesn't seem much has changed visually. It's still white, and sports two USB-C ports and a power button on the front.

<p>After remote work became a lot more common in 2020, some of us have gone fully off-grid. A secluded cabin in the wilderness, a fully-outfitted van, or a sailboat cruising an archipelago are all places some of us call home, but staying connected for work can pose a challenge. Starlink offers a solution, connecting you to satellite internet from secluded areas that aren't typically in coverage zones. Thanks to today's deal at Best Buy, the associate kit to get you set up with Starlink connectivity is much more affordable.</p><p>As of Aug. 29, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/o5b4L?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Starlink%20Standard%20Kit%20AX%20Tri%20Band%20WiFi%20System&object_type=article&object_uuid=05Hfz7imzfOYvOoSDjhZfju&short_url=o5b4L&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Starlink Standard Kit AX Tri Band WiFi System</a> is on sale at Best Buy for just $299.99, discounted from the usual price of $499.99.

<p>Starlink aims to deliver high-speed internet to rural or remote locations that usually don't see a signal to stay connected. Through a network that includes thousands of satellites, Starlink gives broadband internet access that's strong enough to stream shows, join your Zoom meetings, stay in touch with emails, or even spend the weekend online gaming.</p><p>To get access to this network, you'll need to set up a WiFi satellite dish at home &mdash; or on your van, or boat &mdash; which is where the Starlink Standard Kit AX Tri Band WiFi System comes into play. This kit includes all necessary elements to get started with Starlink, including the satellite, WiFi router, cables, and a convenient base. </p><p>The Standard Kit supports WiFi 6 so you'll be able to get faster speeds while connecting to either 2.4GHz or 5.0 frequencies. </p><p>Since the included Starlink satellite sits outside, it's made with weather-resistant materials that can withstand the coldest of cold and hottest of hot temperatures. But keep in mind you should set up the satellite in an area that has a clear view of the sky, making it possible to connect to Starlink's network.</p><p>You can also download the Starlink app to get more information about the best set-up location before you install. </p><p>If you're hoping to stay connected while off grid, Starlink is a great option, and you can currently save $200 on the <a href="https://zdcs.link/o5b4L?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Starlink%20Standard%20Kit%20AX%20Tri%20Band%20WiFi%20System&object_type=article&object_uuid=05Hfz7imzfOYvOoSDjhZfju&short_url=o5b4L&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Starlink Standard Kit AX Tri Band WiFi System</a> that'll keep you connected.

<p>But before the Stranger can worry about the Dark Lord, he'll have to deal with another villainous entity: a Dark Wizard (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds) who's set up shop in Rh&ucirc;n. In <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-rings-of-power-season-2-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Season 2</a>, episode 2, we learn that it was this Dark Wizard who was responsible for sending the white-cloaked Mystics after the Stranger in Season 1. He also seems to be a fan of both moth magic and blood magic, but otherwise, we don't know much about the Dark Wizard &mdash; not even his real name! Just like with the Stranger's identity in Season 1, though, we can definitely make some educated guesses as to who from <a href="https://mashable.com/article/lord-of-the-rings-the-rings-of-power-book-vs-show" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">J.R.R. Tolkien's legendarium</a> the Dark Wizard might be.</p><p>The biggest clue here is the "wizard" of it all, which suggests that the Dark Wizard is an Istar like the Stranger. Appropriately meaning "Wise One" or "Wizard," the Istari are a group of five powerful spirits known as Maiar whom the Valar sent to protect Middle-earth.</p><p>Three of the Istari feature fairly prominently in Tolkien's work: Gandalf the Grey, Saruman the White, and Radagast the Brown. However, <em>The Rings of Power</em>'s Dark Wizard really can't be any of these three. The show has indirectly confirmed time and again that the Stranger is Gandalf, so that's him ruled out. Saruman does eventually fall to the darkness in <a href="https://mashable.com/category/lord-of-the-rings" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>The Lord of the Rings</em></a><em> </em>trilogy, but his turn occurring in the Second Age, when <em>The Rings of Power</em> takes place, would be far too soon. Finally, nature-loving Radagast is probably too busy hanging out with the animals of Middle-earth to even bother raising a cult of moth-wielding Mystics.</p><p>So that leaves us with the last two Istari, and the ones Tolkien tells us the least about: the Blue Wizards, otherwise known as <em>Ithryn Luin</em>, named for the color of the robes they wore upon arrival to Middle-earth.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>Who are the Blue Wizards in Tolkien's work?</h2><p>The Blue Wizards are a big question mark in Tolkien's legendarium, perhaps even to Tolkien himself. In one of his 1958 letters, he wrote, "I really do not know anything clearly about the other two [Istari]." In the <em>Unfinished Tales</em>, there are mentions of them being named Alatar and Pallando. In later works, though, he referred to them as Morinehtar and R&oacute;mest&aacute;mo.</p><p>These later writings clarify a bit of what Tolkien believed to be the purpose of the Blue Wizards, which was to curb Sauron's rise in the East. And you know what's in the East? Rh&ucirc;n, right where the Dark Wizard is hanging out. Based on that alone, it's pretty likely that the Dark Wizard is one of the <em>Ithryn Luin</em>.</p><p>There's even more evidence for that theory, though. In the same letter where Tolkien said he didn't know too much about the Blue Wizards, he theorized that they were "emissaries to distant regions" who "failed, as Saruman did" and fell to darkness. From there, Tolkien "suspect[ed] they were founders or beginners of secret cults and 'magic' traditions that outlasted the fall of Sauron."

<p>In episode 2, Nori does her best to workshop some possible names for the Stranger. Suggestions include Doderic, Andwise, and Fredegar. While the Stranger isn't feeling any of those, the names are fun nods to Hobbits briefly mentioned in J.R.R. Tolkien's <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>: Doderic Brandybuck is a relative of Merry, Andwise Roper is Sam's uncle, and Fredegar Bolger (aka "Fatty" Bolger) is a good friend of Frodo's, and later Merry's brother-in-law.</p><p>However, Nori says something <em>else </em>in episode 2 that's a clearer hint at the Stranger's name &mdash; even if she doesn't realize it at the time.

<p>Now hold on just a minute! A "gand"? As in "Gand"alf? That's it, we've cracked the code!</p><p>But "gand" &mdash; from the Old Norse "gandr," meaning "staff," "wand," or even "magic" &mdash; is so much more than just a word that sounds similar to Gandalf. It's a key part of the etymology of Gandalf's name, and it could be a clue as to what the Stranger's quest in Rh&ucirc;n will entail.</p><h2>Why is a "gand" so important in <em>The Rings of Power</em>?</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Tolkien didn't come up with the name Gandalf on his own. Instead, he tweaked a name from a section of the Norse poem <em>V&ouml;lusp&aacute;</em> titled the "Catalogue of Dwarves." (This is also where most of the dwarves' names from <em>The Hobbit </em>came from.) Name-wise, the inspiration for Gandalf was a dwarf named Gand&aacute;lfr, which combines "gandr" and "&aacute;lfr," meaning elf. Basically, "Gand&aacute;lfr" means "elf with a wand."</p><p>Being the language lover that he was, Tolkien preserved that meaning in his own works. He wrote in his <em>Unfinished Tales </em>that the name Gandalf means "Elf of the Wand," in reference to both Gandalf's staff and Men's misconception that he was an Elf. (Notably, "Gandalf" is just the name Men came to know the wizard by. He has other names, including Ol&oacute;rin, his name in Valinor, and Mithrandir, the name given to him by the Elves.)</p><p>By mentioning the Stranger's need for a gand in episode 2, <em>The Rings of Power </em>positions the search for a staff as a key part of his quest moving forward. Add to that his episode 1 dream of a shapeshifting staff calling to him, and we're officially on staff watch.</p><p>So where is Gandalf going to find a staff in Rh&ucirc;n? Could he fashion one from those gnarled trees all around the desert? Might he receive one as a gift? And perhaps most pressingly, will he understand how a gand relates to his name as soon as he takes up his staff? Or, like in Tolkien's work, will he earn that name from Men he encounters on his journeys?</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/pgOkl?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3Btemplate=article&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=The%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings%3A%20The%20Rings%20of%20Power%20Season%202%20premieres%20Aug.%2029%20on%20Prime%20Video%2C%20with%20a%20new%20episode%20weekly.&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=02yb7E1jLlete1hYMKuCmcX&amp%3Bshort_url=pgOkl&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Fthe-lord-of-the-rings-the-rings-of-power-season-2-review&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=The%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings%3A%20The%20Rings%20of%20Power%20Season%202%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Prime%20Video%2C%20with%20a%20new%20episode%20every%20Thursday.&object_type=article&object_uuid=07DGLJJZ8FjF3aWWoTiuySG&short_url=pgOkl&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power </em>Season 2 is now streaming on Prime Video, with a new episode every Thursday.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Being in Europe, I was excited about this change. Unfortunately, the release notes also state that "Apple Intelligence is not currently available in the EU or China."

<p>There is a way to override this and test Apple Intelligence features in Europe, but it requires the user to set the device region to U.S. (in addition to the settings mentioned above). The real dealbreaker is that you also must set your Apple ID country to the U.S., and to do that, you need to go through a number of (typically painfully annoying) <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/118283" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">steps</a> which include canceling subscriptions that block a country/region change and wait for subscriptions to expire, and re-download all your apps, music, movies, and TV shows. And even if you do all that, it still might not work unless you use a VPN (and even then you could get mixed results). In other words, for the vast majority of users, it's not worth trying. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Pixel 9 Pro XL couldn't get any better &mdash; until I spotted some chit-chat about a new display feature across the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/google-pixel-9" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Pixel 9</a> series.</p><p>Called "Adaptive Touch," Google says that it's a touch sensitivity feature that "will automatically adjust to your environment, activities, and screen protector." The Pixel 9 series, by the way, has a similar touch sensitivity feature called Screen Protector Mode, but it's not new. The novel Adaptive Touch tool is designed to auto-adjust to various conditions, but Screen Protector Mode kicks the sensitivity up a notch to compensate for users' screen protectors.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Google never explicitly said that Adaptive Touch supports wet fingers, but some tech outlets put it to the test and got optimistic results.

<p>Yes, I'm one of those people who brings their phone into the bathroom to play music for a shower <em>soir&eacute;e. </em>(Hey, if I'm going to slip on soap, at least I'll do it to a good beat.) </p><p>I accessed Adaptive Touch by navigating to <strong>Settings &gt; Display &gt; Touch Sensitivity</strong>. As it turned out, Adaptive Touch is toggled on by default for Pixel 9 devices.</p><p>So the question is, after drenching my fingers in water, and getting some droplets on the screen, how did the Pixel 9 Pro XL fare in the shower? Here are my ratings:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Tapping on apps </strong>- Good. The Pixel 9 Pro XL was responsive to all the apps I tapped on via the home screen.</p></li><li><p><strong>Swiping (up and down) </strong>- Terrible. Exiting apps require an upward swipe, but I needed to employ this gesture several times before the screen responded.</p></li><li><p><strong>Swiping (left and right) </strong>- Good. The Pixel 9 Pro XL was responsive as I swiped through my collection of apps.</p></li><li><p><strong>Scrolling - </strong>Terrible. I experienced some glitches and phantom touches.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fingerprint unlock </strong>- Good. No issues while using biometric authentication to unlock the Pixel 9 Pro XL.</p></li></ul><p>To sum it up, I was able to tap on apps and other UI elements without any issues. For example, I was able to skip to the next track on my playlists seamlessly. Swiping through my apps on the home screen was a smooth experience, too. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>However, when it comes to scrolling through long-form content, I experienced "screen jumping" in which I'd try to scroll down to the bottom of the article, but it'd jump back up to the top. Swiping upward to escape apps was the most frustrating; I sometimes found myself repeatedly swiping up to 10 times before I finally got a response.</p><p>Although fingerprint unlock worked well with my wet fingers, as <a href="https://www.extremetech.com/mobile/google-pixel-9-screen-works-when-wet-thanks-to-adaptive-touch" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">ExtremeTech</a> (Mashable's sister site) pointed out, the Pixel 9 series' new ultrasonic in-display sensor likely played a bigger role in my positive experience with it. </p><p>Without getting too technical, the ultrasonic sensor, an upgrade from the Pixel 8 series' optical sensor, is designed to detect your prints even while your fingers are wet. My Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra also has an ultrasonic in-display sensor &mdash; and it, too, can detect my fingerprints while they're wet.</p><p>While the Pixel 9 Pro XL fares well in the shower for <em>some </em>gestures, I wouldn't say that it excels in supporting wet fingers. However, if you ever get caught in the rain, or you just came out of a dip in the pool (or you, like me, enjoy jamming out in the shower), the Pixel 9 Pro XL can handle simple taps without malfunctioning.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdyEDETEzMU" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">OnePlus Ace 2 Pro</a> famously has a "Rain Water Touch" feature that is designed to handle pesky water droplets on a display, so perhaps it's about time that Google, Samsung, and Apple seriously considers wet-finger support.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>Back in the bustling studio, we're appraising the fruits of our labour. And, the finished product is...interesting, to say the least. Together, we've sketched a (very) creative interpretation of the human body. Who said art needed to be realistic, anyway? Glancing over at the handiwork of the group next to us is humbling. Their drawing is objectively great, each body part looking consistent and life-like. There's no time to dwell on our artistic shortcomings, however. We're ushered outside to get some fresh air while the organisers set up easels for the next activity. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 max-w-3xl">

<p>It's a balmy evening &mdash; 28 degrees celsius (82.4F) &mdash; and everyone is looking decidedly sweaty and a tad nervous. But, we're doing what we came here to do: chat to interesting strangers. Mercifully, any shyness was overcome in that group activity and we're all getting stuck in. "So, how did you find out about this event?" appears to be everyone's favourite opening line. The consensus is: <a href="https://mashable.com/category/instagram" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Instagram</a>. We move on to asking people where they live and there's a decent mix of people who live near and far.</p><p>As a millennial in my mid-thirties, I came of age before <a href="https://mashable.com/category/tinder" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Tinder</a> blew up, before dating apps. Offline dating events are having a moment right now amid the dating app fatigue, but let's not forget, it wasn't all that long ago when offline dating was just...dating. If there's a meme response for this last statement, it'd be: "<a href="https://imgflip.com/memegenerator/268054898/Sure-grandma-lets-get-you-to-bed" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Sure grandma let's get you to bed."</u></a></p><p>Our next activity at Draw and Date is about to begin, and each woman has been asked to grab and easel, which is equipped with paper and charcoal. Much like a speed-dating event, the men will rotate through the room easel-by-easel, lending their artistic talents (or lack thereof) until the bell rings and it's time to move on. This way, you get a chance to meet everyone and chat to anyone you might have had your eye on. They're a friendly bunch and the conversation is flowing. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>During this rotation, I meet two gay guys who feel a little outnumbered by the straight folks in the room. The signup sheet didn't ask about sexual orientation for their inaugural event, but in the future, it would be great to have an event aimed solely at gay and bi men, and another for lesbians and bi women.</p><p>Collaboration takes many forms in this activity &mdash; some of my group partners stand and talk while I attempt to capture the model's contorted pose. There are a few attempts by the men to "correct" my work and one even rubs out the face I've drawn, replacing it with his own scribbles. One man critiques the curve I've bestowed on the model's bum in my drawing, suggesting I've given her too much ass. "In an ideal world, yes, the line would come out here, but it doesn't," he says, before redrawing the line. I'll let that anecdote percolate with you. Thank goodness for the bell, eh. </p><p>The final activity requires being paired up with someone you've not spoken to yet and, together, you draw one half of the model's front-facing body. We get two attempts with two different poses. My partner and I work well together, he compliments my technique, and I feel like my drawing style has loosened up over the course of the class. The finished results are...pretty good actually. I'm not as terrible as I thought I was! </p><p>At the end of the two-hour event, the organisers thank us and instruct us to head to the pub next door, should we wish to chat to anyone further, or even swap details. I spy one pairing exchanging numbers (cute!). A few people linger, waiting to see who's heading out to continue the evening.</p><p>It was fun to flirt with lots of strangers, but I didn't feel a connection with anyone in particular. I did, however, make a new friend, which is always lovely. What I appreciated about the event was the hopefulness that everyone seemed to have. We all stepped outside of our comfort zone not knowing what to expect, feeling a little exposed, a little vulnerable. It's a brave thing to have hope and to put yourself out there, physically as well as digitally. So, when I stopped by the pub on my route home for a solo G&amp;T, I commended myself for my bravery. Maybe I'll go along again, perhaps I'll take up life drawing lessons. I had a fun evening and chatted a lot of lovely people while doing something artistic. It certainly beats a night of swiping on my sofa. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Did it seem like it focused on niche products, like the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-watch-ultra-2-announcement-apple-event-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">black Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>, before it got to the main meat ... of what turned out to be relatively minor iPhone hardware updates? </p><p>Then, frankly, you weren't the target audience, even if you're an iPhone user. Your current model is likely doing just fine, and you're probably attached to its color (as with mine, a year-old deep purple iPhone 15 Pro). You're not ready to pony up for a slightly better device, and all the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/which-devices-have-apple-intelligence" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple Intelligence</a> in the world won't make you. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

By then, you might find your phone's declining battery and tiny-seeming screen to be an embarrassment, and the Apple trade-in offer will suddenly make a lot more sense.

As each market that the tech giant has entered matures, it becomes harder to get current customers to upgrade individual devices. The more the iPhone becomes a luxury item, and the more aware consumers become of its environmental cost, the less likely they are to upgrade every year, or even every other year.</p><p>So if you're Tim Cook, and you have a fiduciary duty to keep growing the company, what do you do? </p><p>Sure, you make sure you're in the game when it comes to new technology. Cook has got a firm toe-hold in virtual space now with the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-vision-pro" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple Vision Pro;</a> if VR or AR suddenly look like the future, Apple is ready. He also understands the assignment with AI, which (<a href="https://mashable.com/article/ai-stock-bubble-burst" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">for the moment, at least</a>) is largely a matter of rebranding your machine-learning software so you don't look like you're falling behind: enter Apple Intelligence. </p><p>But most of your job as Apple CEO is to make multiple Apple devices seem more appealing to every user, even in a world of highly fragmented consumer groups. You find more groups served by the possibilities of new hardware-software combos: hearing loss and sleep apnea sufferers are <em>huge</em> and growing health niches, which is why manufacturers of hearing aids took a hit on the stock market in the Apple event's wake. </p><p>If you look at the steadily growing Apple user base for non-iPhone items, then front-loading Apple events with tedious-to-you Watch updates, for one, makes a lot more sense. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Moreover, to update a phrase that has differentiated Apple since its Jobs-Wozniak days, Tim Cook's job is to make sure everything <em>just works </em>... together. Once upon a time, when Windows working well with Macintosh OS was what mattered, the Apple "walled garden" was a millstone around the company's neck. Now, the walled garden may be the company's biggest asset.</p><p>Take, for example, the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-airpods-max-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple AirPods Max</a>: beautifully-designed, massively expensive over-the-ear noise-cancelling headphones saddled with a terrible name. When they were launched, I scoffed: Why would I buy those when I could grab a comparable Bose pair for much less? </p><p>I discovered the answer this year: because the Max cans connect and switch <em>so easily</em> to and between my MacBook, iPad and iPhone &mdash; and most importantly, to my Apple TV &mdash; while providing incredible spatial audio. </p><p>I wasn't in the market for regular AirPods, because I don't like wax-producing earbuds (for exercise I use <a href="https://mashable.com/review/bose-sport-open-earbuds-review-best-running-headphones" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">these Bose open-ear models</a> instead). But the Max turned out to be totally my jam, so much so that here I am, seriously considering trading in my two-month old green headphones for the new USB-C model in purple, to match my iPhone. </p><p>I probably won't &mdash; not this cycle, anyway. My Apple budget for 2024 is entirely spent. But if Apple brings out a purple iPhone 17 next year, then it will almost certainly be time once more to hook up their vacuum cleaner to my wallet &mdash; no matter what new features are hyped up at the 2025 iPhone launch event. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Swift first broke her silence on political issues in 2018 when she endorsed Tennessee U.S. Senate candidate Phil Bredesen, calling his opponent Marsha Blackburn "Trump in a wig." Her decision to talk about politics was a major focus of her 2020 documentary, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/taylor-swift-miss-americana-movie-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Miss Americana</em></a><em>. </em>It shows her, her father, and her team discuss her choice to come out for Bredesen. On the verge of tears she expresses regret that she didn't use her voice against Trump in 2016. "I can't change that...I need to be on the right side of history," she said in the documentary.</p><p>She's since posted several Instagram posts about <a href="https://mashable.com/category/black-lives-matter" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Black Lives Matter</a>, <a href="https://x.com/taylorswift13/status/1540382753677627393" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">tweeted</a> about her terror after the overturning of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/roe-v-wade-overturned" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Roe v.

<h3><strong>Less bezels, more screen real estate</strong></h3><p>The iPhone 16 Pro Max also has ultra-thin bezels. In other words, the frame around the phone has slimmed down, giving you a higher screen-to-body ratio.

<h2>What is Connections?</h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. Like <em>Wordle, </em>you can share the results with your friends on social media.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

Harris later accused the former president of "<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/kamala-harris-donald-trump-presidential-debate/index.html" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">backpedalling</a>" from the scheduled September debate, which will take place as planned this week.</p><p>At the time of publishing, neither side had agreed to a second debate. </p><p>The nation has been eagerly awaiting the matchup &mdash; the first time they've come face-to-face &mdash; which sees two very different kinds of speakers addressing the country's biggest issues. Harris has previously said she is ready and able to "<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/preparation-pitfalls-breaking-fourth-wall-takeaways-decade-kamala-harr-rcna169032" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">prosecute</a>" Trump on the main stage. Ironically, the Manhattan judge presiding over Trump's closely-watched criminal trial decided the former president's sentencing would be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/06/nyregion/trump-sentencing-delay-ruling.html" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">announced after the election</a>, rather than the original Sept. 18 date. That means Harris' litigation of Trump may also be the last voters see before heading to the polls.</p><h2>What time is the presidential debate?</h2><p>Harris and Trump will face off on the debate stage <strong>at 9 p.m. ET on</strong> <strong>Tuesday, Sept. 10. </strong></p><p>The 90-minute long event will take place at Philadelphia's National Constitution Center, hosted by ABC and moderated by ABC World News Tonight host David Muir and anchor Linsey Davis. </p><p>In a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/05/trump-harris-debate-what-to-know-00177554" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">winning virtual coin toss</a> ahead of the event, Trump chose to give the closing statement at the end of the night. Harris chose her place on the screen, which will be to the viewers' right side. </p><h2>What is different about this debate?</h2><p>The previous presidential debate &mdash; a chaotic night widely considered to be a disappointing showing from both President Joe Biden and Trump &mdash; instituted new rules for the debate stage. Candidate mics were muted while their opponent was speaking, barring the ability for each to challenge or interrupt each other, and there was no live studio audience.</p><p>After initially opposing the <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/abc-news-releases-rules-sept-10-debate-harris/story?id=113019909" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">rules</a> and pushing for live mics, the Harris campaign eventually <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/5/trump-harris-agree-on-debate-rules-after-dispute-over-muted-microphones" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">conceded</a>. The night's schedule will not include opening statements. As for speaking time, the candidates get two minute long periods for answers and rebuttals; a one minute period for follow-ups, responses, or clarifications; and a two minute closing statement for each candidate. </p><h2>How can I watch the Harris-Trump debate? </h2><p>The debate will be <strong>aired live on ABC channels</strong> nationwide. It will also be available to stream live on <strong>ABC News Live, Disney+, and Hulu</strong>.</p><p>You don't need a cable or streaming subscription to watch, either, as <a href="http://ABC.com" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><strong>ABC.com</strong></a><strong> will have a livestream</strong> of the debate available on its site.

<h2><strong>Apple Watch Series 10 announced at 2024 Apple event</strong></h2><p>The Apple Watch Series 10, Apple's latest smartwatch model, has the following new features:</p><h3>Largest and most advanced display ever for Apple Watch</h3><p>The Apple Watch Series 10 is now larger with 42mm and 46mm sizes, up from 41mm and 45mm on the Series 9. The display has more rounded corners and a wider aspect ratio, which Apple says makes it appear softer, sleeker, and more streamlined. Plus, it'll have Apple's first ever wide angle OLED display, making it 40 percent brighter than past styles. </p><h3>Thinner and lighter than ever before</h3><p>Series 10 is the thinnest Apple Watch ever, at just 9.7 millimeters, which is almost 10 percent thinner than the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-watch-series-9" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Series 9</a>. The Series 10 also weighs almost 20 percent less than the Series 9 and is made with 95 percent recycled titanium.</p><h3>Faster charge, same battery life</h3><p>Though the new Apple Watch Series 10 charges more quickly than past iterations, a full charge will only get you 18 hours of battery life at a time. A new design incorporates a more efficient charging coil that enables the watch to charge up to 80 percent in 30 minutes.</p><div id="related-video" class="mx-auto mt-8 mb-12 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans md:mt-12 md:mb-16 text-primary-400">

<h2><strong>Crypto scams bigger than ever before</strong></h2><p>The FBI's cryptocurrency scam report is especially interesting since 2023 was the first full year following the crypto boom. The crypto industry was shaken up in 2022 when a number of crypto tokens collapsed following the downfall of large crypto firms like Celsius and Terraform Labs. Then in November 2022, one of the largest crypto exchanges, FTX, went bankrupt. While some crypto tokens and blockchain-based companies have since bounced back, the industry has yet to recover its mainstream appeal.</p><p>Cryptocurrency scams, however, appear to be going stronger than ever before. The FBI's 2023 cryptocurrency report shows that crypto scams grew 45 percent compared to the year before.</p><p>In fact, 2023 losses from cryptocurrency scams now make up more than half of the total number of losses from all online scams from the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/internet-scam-report-2022-fbi-cryptocurrency" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>FBI's 2022 report</u></a>.</p><p>According to the FBI, investment fraud is the biggest of the cryptocurrency scams. The report found that crypto investment scams specifically increased by 53 percent, with $3.96 billion in losses compared to 2022's $2.57 billion.&nbsp;</p><p>Different types of scams affected age demographics differently. For example, those in the 30-39 and 40-49 age groups were most affected by crypto investment scams. However, the most complaints reported and overall loss totals were from those over 60. According to the FBI, more than $1.6 billion in crypto-related scam losses came from the over 60 age group.</p><p>Of course, the likely total of crypto scam losses is much higher than what's in the FBI report as the agency can only include data sent to them by the victims.</p><p>"Scams targeting investors who use cryptocurrency are skyrocketing in severity and complexity,&rdquo; said FBI Director Christopher Wray in the bureau's statement on the report. "The best way to help stop these crimes is for people to report them to <a href="http://ic3.gov" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">ic3.gov</a>, even if they did not suffer a financial loss. The information allows us to stay on top of emerging schemes and criminals&rsquo; use of the latest technologies, so we can keep the American public informed and go after those who commit these crimes."</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Even though dating apps take some effort and time, using the right ones can help streamline the process of meeting someone new. That's why we think they're a solid option for single parents looking for love, fun, and friendship. An algorithm that actually shows you people you're compatible with, rather than anyone with a pulse in a 10-mile radius, is a major bonus. </p><p>Bonnell also told us it's important to be upfront about your time constraints and responsibilities.</p><p>"Dedicating time for communication ('after the kids are down') or setting the children up in an activity while letting them know 'Mom/Dad&rsquo;s going to do a little computer work now,' or 'taking a call' can work, but it&rsquo;s not easy," Bonnell wrote.

<p>The major upgrade with the PS5 Pro is its ability to handle high-fidelity modes at a consistent 60fps, which sounds great on paper. But when you consider that the standard PS5 could already achieve similar results by sacrificing some resolution, it starts to feel less like a game-changer. Many users are already questioning whether slightly improved graphics justify the $700 price tag.</p><p>In fact, for that kind of money, you could easily snag a custom-built PC with an RTX 3070 on Facebook Marketplace &mdash; and that&rsquo;s exactly what some (read: me) are doing instead.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>The PS5 Pro also ditches the disc drive, and to top it off, the vertical stand is sold separately &mdash; a move that&rsquo;s already causing debate among fans.

<p>Hayes is one of many Taylor Swift fans who have joined Swifties for Kamala, a coalition of fans campaigning for presidential hopeful and current Vice President Kamala Harris that operates independently of Swift herself, who still has not offered an endorsement of either candidate in the upcoming election. Born out of a <a href="https://x.com/hushmirrorball/status/1815100268713029981" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">tweet</a>, the organization takes advantage of Swift fans' pre-existing passion and online savvy and aims to use it to turn the presidential election blue.&nbsp;</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Always interested in politics, Hayes never knew how to get involved, but Swifties for Kamala gave her an accessible, unintimidating introduction to the space. "It's talented people that I already know and am comfortable with," she said of the group.&nbsp;</p><p>Behind the constant Swift <a href="https://mashable.com/article/taylor-swift-tortured-poets-department-lyrics" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">lyrical references</a>, glittering 47s on their hands, and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/taylor-swift-eras-tour-outfits" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">friendship bracelets</a> is a legitimate organization helmed by Swifties with professional experience working on campaigns. April Glick Pulito, the coalition's political director, worked on the 2020 presidential election for the Wisconsin State Democratic party and on the Georgia Senate race runoff in 2022. The group's campaign manager, Annie Wu Henry, is a digital and political strategist who was instrumental in Senator John Fetterman's <a href="https://mashable.com/category/tiktok" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">TikTok</a> campaign strategy.</p><p>The Democratic Party immediately embraced Swifties for Kamala. The group's Aug. 27 Zoom rally featured speakers like Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Ed Markey, as well as recording artist Carole King and members of the House of Representatives. Indivisible, the organization that led the run-of-show, back-end, and registration for other affinity groups for Harris, like White Women Answer the Call, AAPI Communities for Harris, and Female Lawyers for Harris, similarly supported Swifties for Kamala.&nbsp;</p><p>Leah Greenberg, the co-executive director of <a href="https://indivisible.org/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Indivisible</a>, thinks Swifties for Kamala has a ton of potential &mdash; organic potential that doesn't come from outside organizations.</p><p>"We've been seeing this big surge of different affinity groups, interest groups, and communities coming together to support Vice President Harris, and we've been trying to be supportive wherever we can," Greenberg told Mashable.&nbsp;</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>The Swifties for Kamala Zoom rally saw an estimated 27,000 participants and raised over $100,000 for the Harris campaign. Those are not insignificant numbers, but when compared to affinity groups politicians already appeal to, like Win With Black Women, Win With Black Men, White Women Answer the Call, and White Dudes for Kamala, which raised $1.5 million, $1.3 million, $2 million, and $4.2 million, respectively, Swifties for Kamala only made a fraction of the impact.</p><h2>Fandom as an affinity group</h2><p>Swifties for Kamala is similar to other Zoom coalition calls in that they bring together large, diverse groups of people with different lived experiences and issues they're voting around, coming together not necessarily over policy but for an individual candidate.&nbsp;</p><p>However, while other coalitions like White Women Answer the Call and White Dudes for Kamala organized in response to their demographic's role in and history of electing conservative and racist leaders, Swifties don't have as clear a lineage in the nation's voting history. Some Swifties say they have organized in defiance of groups of men on the right who belittle them. For others, it's a callback to their idol's past political stance.</p><p>For example, a rallying point among Swifties for Kamala is a tweet from the Republican Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee. After Swift broke her political silence and came out against Republican Tennessee Senator Marsha Blackburn in 2018, Huckabee <a href="https://x.com/GovMikeHuckabee/status/1049280125106343936" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>wrote</u></a>, "So <a href="https://x.com/taylorswift13" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">@taylorswift13</a> has every right to be political but it won't impact election unless we allow 13 yr old girls to vote.

<p>When asked about conservative Swifties, Glick Pulito alluded to their idol's few outspoken moments, saying, "Once you get deep enough into this fandom and have watched <em>Miss Americana</em>&hellip;" &mdash;&nbsp;a reference to Swift's 2020 documentary, implying that conservative fans aren't true fans. Swift's decision to talk about politics was a major focus of the film<em>. </em>It shows her, her father, and her team heatedly discussing her choice to come out in favor of Tennessee U.S. Senate candidate Bredesen. On the verge of tears, she expresses regret over not using her voice against Trump in 2016. "I can't change that...I need to be on the right side of history," she said in the documentary.&nbsp;</p><p>The conversation resulted in her first political endorsement, in which she called on fans to support Bredesen in 2018 and called his opponent, Blackburn, "Trump in a wig." In 2020, a month before the presidential election, she endorsed President Joe Biden and Vice President Harris in a <em>V Magazine </em>article. She also posted a <a href="https://x.com/taylorswift13/status/1313938080290803715" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>photo</u></a> of herself holding Biden-Harris 2020 campaign cookies to social media.&nbsp;</p><p>For fans, her outspokenness was consistent with the larger messaging of her <em>Lover</em> era. The album featured the pro-LGBTQ rainbow anthem "You Need to Calm Down," and her go at a feminist takedown of the male-dominated system, "The Man."</p><p>In the years since she's uploaded several Instagram posts about <a href="https://mashable.com/category/black-lives-matter" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Black Lives Matter</u></a>, <a href="https://x.com/taylorswift13/status/1540382753677627393" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>tweeted</u></a> about her terror after the overturning of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/roe-v-wade-overturned" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Roe v.

Like all of <em>Lover</em>," continued Glick Pulito. "Her art does not lend itself to putting people down or moving backward. Loving this artist who strives to continue to make the world better, who strives to create good art, and who strives to constantly show up for her fans and herself and her family and her community &mdash; I'm not surprised that so many Swifties are committed to building a better future."</p><p>Swifties for Kamala define their eight policy stances as "equality, freedom, and safety," with nods to common sense gun reform, reproductive freedom, and a "permanent ceasefire between Israel and Hamas." Post <em>Lover and Miss Americana</em>, Swift's image aligned fairly well with these vague policy areas.</p><h2>The tension between Swifties for Kamala and Taylor Swift</h2><p>However, in the past couple of years, Swift, with her chart-topping albums, re-recordings, and&nbsp;<a href="https://mashable.com/article/taylor-swift-the-eras-tour-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>The Eras Tour</u></a>, has reached unprecedented levels of stardom, giving her unprecedented reach to millions. But she has yet to endorse Vice President Harris, a major reckoning point among Swifties for Kamala.&nbsp;</p><p>Swifties for Kamala organizes over a personal identity marker, liking Swift, with no inherent political attachments. They are also organizing around Swift, someone who can attach herself to policies and people outside of Swifties for Kamala's goals, further complicating their group. Unlike other interest-based affinity groups, like the public transit-oriented Train Lovers for Kamala, there's no apparent policy the group can immediately agree on, and Swift's recent public actions don't necessarily align with Harris' campaign.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, last October, Swift officially reached billionaire status and came under fire for her use of a private jet and its environmental impact. Meanwhile, Swifties for Kamala lists "climate change is taken seriously" as one of their eight policies. In a recent public outing, Swift was photographed hugging Trump supporter Brittany Mahomes at the U.S. Open, much to the disappointment of many of her fans.&nbsp;</p><q>
    "What would they need to get our vote? They don't need to have a favorite Taylor Swift song, but it certainly helps,"
    </q>
<p>Swift's lifestyle appears increasingly inconsistent with the political change one might expect a digitally active fan to want. But, as Henry reminded Mashable, "Swifties are not a monolith."&nbsp;</p><p>The diversity among fans calls into question the effectiveness of Swifties as a voting coalition, though. None of the organizers had specific ideas when pressed on how a politician might "court" the Swiftie vote as part of their own campaigns. They spoke in vague terms, as believers in Vice President Harris first and foremost. Not even the dissolution of monopolies, which could be used to rally the troops as it was <a href="https://mashable.com/article/swifties-take-down-ticketmaster-eras-tour" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>a central rallying point for Swifties</u></a> due to Ticketmaster's fumbling of selling Eras Tour tickets, was brought up as a core tenant of Swiftie beliefs. Politicians in support of the group were more specific. Senator Warren brought up taking on corporations like Ticketmaster during the Zoom rally, and Senator Markey referenced the climate crisis.&nbsp;</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>"What would they need to get our vote? They don't need to have a favorite Taylor Swift song, but it certainly helps," joked Glick Pulito.&nbsp;</p><p>Across their social media presence, on their website, and at the Zoom rally, Swifties for Kamala repeats, "Not affiliated with Taylor Swift," but she's still their bonding force and inspiration.&nbsp;</p><p>"We're not waiting for any one person anywhere to call people to action," explained Henry. "So much of what the Swiftie community does happened organically and not because they were told you should be doing this thing."</p><p>Hayes pointed to Swift's aptly-titled third album <em>Speak Now </em>as a point of inspiration. "[Swift] is this force in our lives that gives us confidence to be the people that we want to be and to fight for the change we want in the world. It's not about getting her attention, but the community that we built and using that force for good," she said.&nbsp;</p><h2>Is fandom the future of campaigning?</h2><p>Despite the political tension between Swift and her fans, the organization is still a glimpse into the potential future of fandom and politics. "One of the things that keeps [organizers] going is being in community with each other," Greenberg said of her work at Indivisible. "It's only natural that a group of people &mdash; who are brought together by their passion for and excitement around Taylor Swift &mdash; are also sustaining their political work and weaving their political work together with their excitement and passion, as members of an incredibly engaged fan community."</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Similarly, Henry told Mashable, "It's potentially a blueprint for how we can mobilize and invest in other digital communities just as we do in geographical areas. We should be reaching out to online spaces because, for better or worse, people are more online and dependent on online spaces."</p><p>For now, the group hopes to be present at Swift's remaining U.S. tour dates in Florida, Louisiana, and Indiana before the election. Many of those are after the voter registration deadlines, so until then, Swifties for Kamala plans to focus on encouraging people to vote. "We want to remind people that every vote counts, especially since she has an upcoming date in Florida," said Hayes.&nbsp;</p><p>The friendship bracelet coordinator is also set to launch her brainchild in the coming weeks, an effort known as the "You're Not Alone, Kid Campaign." Hayes says, "It's basically a motivation campaign to remind people to get to the polls and to not let motivation wane."&nbsp;</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Hayes hopes to get volunteers in every state to make bracelets and place them around public spaces in the community. Each bracelet will have a QR code that directs the scanner to the Swifties for Kamala website, where voter information is available. On Oct. 13, the group plans to launch the campaign to the public by posting photos of the hidden bracelets to its social media accounts. It will track where the bracelets are found.&nbsp;</p><p>"Getting a beer with a political candidate is a little outdated," Glick Pulito said. Now, it's about memes. It's about viral posts. It's about harnessing the power of the internet, as Swifities for Kamala does so well. "It makes [politics] more accessible, and the more accessible you make it, the more people are gonna engage with it."</p><p>Like it or not, fandoms are a central part of digital natives' lives. Swifties for Kamala are harnessing that power for the election&mdash;friendship bracelets and all. It doesn't matter who Swift endorses; look what she already made them do.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you're a student, you travel often, or you're a voracious reader, you could be a perfect fit for an e-reader. Instead of needing to buy (and store) tons of physical books, these small tablet-like devices allow you to read digital books. Kindle has a long been a leader in the industry, and thanks to today's deal at Amazon, you can save when buying two Kindle Scribes.</p><p>As of Sept. 10, <a href="https://zdcs.link/a0XNDw?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=two%20Kindle%20Scribe%20devices%20with%20basic%20pen&object_type=article&object_uuid=03Jxpj9rW1gT4FW26RvwZO0&short_url=a0XNDw&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">two Kindle Scribe devices with basic pen</a> are on sale at Amazon for $639.98, down from the list price of $679.98 for two. That's a savings of $40.</p><p>The Kindle Scribe can be perfect for those who want an e-reader but also like to take notes in the margin of books, sketch, or jot down their thoughts. In addition to serving as an e-reader the included basic pen means you can mark up a textbook or write a note in a novel to discuss at book club. If you're working on a PDF for work, add notes for co-workers to chat about during your next meeting.</p><p><a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-kindles" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Mashable's analysis of the best Kindle</a> mentions the Scribe is the best option if you like to take notes. </p><p>With a 10.2-inch screen, the Kindle Scribe earns bragging rights as the largest Kindle display &mdash; twice the size of the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/kindle-paperwhite-2021-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Kindle Paperwhite</a>.

The device also comes with an impressive battery, getting weeks of life before it needs to recharge. </p><p>If your handwriting isn't the best, no worries. You'll be able to convert your handwritten notes into text before sending them off to classmates or coworkers.</p><p>Keep in mind the Kindle Scribe isn't waterproof, so it might not be the best option if you spend the summer reading poolside. However, our favorite version, the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/kindle-paperwhite-signature-edition" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition</a>, comes with waterproofing, so look into that option if you'll be near water often. </p><p>Throughout the year, Amazon offers plenty of perks for those who own a Kindle like the recent <a href="https://mashable.com/article/stuff-your-kindle-day" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Stuff Your Kindle Day</a> which offered thousands of titles for free.

This brings the yearly cost of Paramount+ Essential from $59.99 to $29.99 (breaking down to just $2.50/month) and Paramount+ with Showtime from $119.99 to $59.99 (breaking down to just $4.99/month). The promo is available for both new and former subscribers.</p><p>Besides being the streaming hub for NFL on CBS, Paramount+ is also home to UEFA Champions League matches, CBS originals like <em>Ghosts</em>, <em>Survivor</em>, and <em>Big Brother</em>, old Nickelodeon and MTV shows, and Paramount's latest theatrical releases like <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-watch-a-quiet-place-day-one" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>A Quiet Place: Day One</em></a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/bob-marley-one-love-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Bob Marley: One Love</em></a>.

The ruling, upheld by the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) said Google was guilty of anti-competitive practices via its Google Shopping service because it favored its own price-comparison tool over competing shopping tools in search results.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Now that the Google ruling has been upheld, it "validates the Commission's approach to such practices," deemed "self-preferencing," <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/speech_24_4624" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">said</a> EU Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager in her <a href="https://x.com/EU_Commission/status/1833461655167992027" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">remarks</a> about the ruling.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>"This case was symbolic because it demonstrated that even the most powerful tech companies could be held accountable. No one is above the law," Vestager continued. "It inspired regulators and policymakers worldwide to scrutinize the activities of digital giants more closely." </p><p>The judgement comes a little over a month after Google lost a huge <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-antitrust-case-lawsuit-loss" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">antitrust lawsuit</a> against the U.S. Department of Justice. The case said Google was operating as a monopoly by paying Apple $20 billion a year to make Google the default search engine on Safari. </p><h2>Apple lost in the EU courts too</h2><p>Speaking of Apple, that company is also in trouble with the European Commission. On Tuesday, the same day it upheld its ruling against Google, the CJEU handed down a final decision forcing Apple to pay $14.3 billion (13 billion euros) in back taxes, after the Commission said Apple had skirted its tax bill due to loopholes in Irish tax laws. The judgment was the result of a decision upheld from 2016 that Apple has unsuccessfully tried to appeal. "It is a win for the Commission. It is also a win for the level playing field in the Single Market, and for tax justice," said Vestager in the same remarks. </p><p>Recently, Apple was fined $1.9 billion by the EU for an antitrust violation <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-music-fine-eu-commission-spotify" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">against Spotify,</a> and it <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-breach-dma" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">faces another fine</a> for breaching the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) for restricting third-party apps to the Apple App Store.

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>Football season's not a bad time to finally make that TV upgrade you've been fantasizing about. And sports will look great on the dual LED screen of the 2024 QLED TV that Samsung is spotlighting on Sept 10. Dual LED backlighting offers more balanced color (which is already quite punchy with any Samsung QLED) and brightness across the entire screen than traditional edge lighting, and Samsung's is particularly innovative &mdash; it automatically adjusts backlighting based on what you're watching. </p><p>This deal is actually a bundle, which includes the giant 85-inch version of Samsung's QE1D TV, plus a 3.2.1 ch Dolby Atmos soundbar that pairs deliciously with the TV's Q-Symphony audio system for a surround sound experience. The package would typically cost almost $3,500, but it's less than $1,500 during the sale. If you have an old TV to get rid of, you can save another $50 by letting Samsung pick it up and <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3bkBE?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=recycle%20it%20for%20you&object_type=article&object_uuid=03ft2irXzf1LRTnKdsAd6s2&short_url=z3bkBE&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">recycle it for you</a>.</p><h3>More TVs on sale</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/a0XNor?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%2065-inch%20S90C%204K%20OLED%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=03ft2irXzf1LRTnKdsAd6s2&short_url=a0XNor&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung 65-inch S90C 4K OLED TV</a> &mdash;&nbsp;<strong>$1,499.99</strong> <s>$2,599.99</s> (save $1,100)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/z6bqnj?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%2065-inch%20The%20Terrace%204K%20QLED%20Full%20Sun%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=03ft2irXzf1LRTnKdsAd6s2&short_url=z6bqnj&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung 65-inch The Terrace 4K QLED Full Sun TV</a> &mdash;&nbsp;<strong>$6,499.99</strong> <s>$9,999.99</s> (save $1,500)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/QODXWO?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%2075-inch%20QN90C%204K%20QLED%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=03ft2irXzf1LRTnKdsAd6s2&short_url=QODXWO&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung 75-inch QN90C 4K QLED TV</a> &mdash;&nbsp;<strong>$1,799.99</strong> <s>$3,299.99</s> (save $500)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/QODXWO?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%2075-inch%20The%20Frame%204K%20QLED%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=03ft2irXzf1LRTnKdsAd6s2&short_url=QODXWO&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung 75-inch The Frame 4K QLED TV</a> &mdash;&nbsp;<strong>$2,499.99</strong> <s>$2,999.99</s> (save $500)</p></li></ul><h2>Best tablet deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>The super solid Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 was already an easy choice if you're simply in the market for an entry-level Android tablet. That choice is even easier when the version with beefier memory and storage is on sale for less than $800. The model featured here has 12GB RAM and 256GB of storage (versus the $649.99 version with 8GB RAM and 128GB of storage) and is WiFi only.</p><p>"Entry level" doesn't feel so "entry level" when any content you stream or graphic designs you whip up are displayed so vividly on Samsung's Dynamic AMOLED 2X screens. The "2X" refers to the screen's ability to jump from 60 Hz to 120 Hz during gaming &mdash;&nbsp;a nearly lag-less experience not often had on tablets in this price range. This Galaxy Tab S9 comes the S Pen stylus, Transcript Assist using Galaxy AI, as well as two free months of Adobe Lightroom and Adobe Express (both a $19.98 value each).</p><h3>More tablets and other computing devices on sale</h3><p><strong>Tablets</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/znO8wy?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%20Galaxy%20Tab%20A9%2B%20%284GB%20RAM%2C%2064GB%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=03ft2irXzf1LRTnKdsAd6s2&short_url=znO8wy&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ (4GB RAM, 64GB)</a> &mdash;&nbsp;<strong>$169.99</strong> <s>$219.99</s> (save $50)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/9Ydkmx?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%20Galaxy%20Tab%20S9%20FE%20%286GB%20RAM%2C%20128GB%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=03ft2irXzf1LRTnKdsAd6s2&short_url=9Ydkmx&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE (6GB RAM, 128GB)</a> &mdash;&nbsp;<strong>$349.99</strong> <s>$449.99</s> (save $100)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/aepMqX?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%20Galaxy%20Tab%20S9%20FE%2B%20%288GB%20RAM%2C%20128GB%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=03ft2irXzf1LRTnKdsAd6s2&short_url=aepMqX&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ (8GB RAM, 128GB)</a> &mdash;&nbsp;<strong>$469.99</strong> <s>$599.99</s> (save $130)</p></li></ul><p><strong>Laptops</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/z3bkMq?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%20Galaxy%20Book4%20Ultra%20%28Intel%20Core%20Ultra%207%2C%2016GB%20RAM%2C%201TB%20SSD%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=03ft2irXzf1LRTnKdsAd6s2&short_url=z3bkMq&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung Galaxy Book4 Ultra (Intel Core Ultra 7, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD)</a> &mdash;&nbsp;<strong>$2,399.99</strong> <s>$2,574.98.99</s> (save $174.99 plus up to $600 in trade-in credits)</p></li></ul><h3>Best monitor deal</h3><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>If your space doesn't have room for both a TV and a nice desktop setup, opting for a smart streaming monitor from Samsung means you don't have to choose between them. The 43-inch M7 can be operated via mouse and keyboard or remote, eliminating the need for strategically wrangling adapters and dongles. Samsung's smart TV platform and Gaming Hub are built right in, too, so the switchover from work to entertainment is as quick as switching apps.</p><h3>More monitors on sale</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/aDVbPg?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%2027-inch%20ViewFinity%20S8%204K%20Monitor&object_type=article&object_uuid=03ft2irXzf1LRTnKdsAd6s2&short_url=aDVbPg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung 27-inch ViewFinity S8 4K Monitor</a> &mdash;&nbsp;<strong>$279.99</strong> <s>$399.99</s> (save $120)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/9g3e6D?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%2032-inch%20Odyssey%20QHD%20Gaming%20Monitor&object_type=article&object_uuid=03ft2irXzf1LRTnKdsAd6s2&short_url=9g3e6D&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung 32-inch Odyssey QHD Gaming Monitor</a> &mdash;&nbsp;<strong>$299.99</strong> <s>$429.99</s> (save $130)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/QVDrPN?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%2049-inch%20Odyssey%20G9%20OLED%20Gaming%20Monitor&object_type=article&object_uuid=03ft2irXzf1LRTnKdsAd6s2&short_url=QVDrPN&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung 49-inch Odyssey G9 OLED Gaming Monitor</a> &mdash;&nbsp;<strong>$1,099.99</strong> <s>$1,999.98</s> (save $899.00)</p></li></ul><h2>Best phone deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

This was the challenge facing James Watkins, the director behind such eerie English fare as <em>Eden Lake </em>and <em>The Woman in Black, </em>as he remade <em>Speak No Evil, </em><a href="https://mashable.com/article/speak-no-evil-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>a 2022 Danish film</u></a> that had critics cheering &mdash;&nbsp;and screaming.&nbsp;</p><p>A psychological thriller about the dangers of committing to civility, <em>Speak No Evil </em>rattled audiences to their core by playing out the sicko possibilities of "What's the worst that could happen" on a weekend getaway with new friends. Hot off the critical praise of the film, American horror studio Blumhouse Productions snapped up the rights for a remake. Watkins promptly adapted Christian Tafdrup and Mads Tafdrup's original script, much of which was already in English. And within two years from the original's U.S. release, a Hollywood version is hitting theaters, starring such celebrated actors as James McAvoy, Mackenzie Davis, Scoot McNairy, and Aisling Franciosi.&nbsp;</p><p>The talent assembled is promising. The original film is fantastic, both darkly funny and deeply, deeply chilling. So what could go wrong? Well, Blumhouse and Watkins could fuck with the recipe to cater to American expectations, and they've done just that.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Speak No Evil, </em>now with backstory. Lots and lots of backstory.&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Rather than bore you with a breathless comparison between Christian Tafdrup's harrowing original and Watkin's wobbly remake, here are the broad strokes.&nbsp;</p><p>Both films follow an upper-middle-class married couple with a young daughter, who collectively befriend a gruff but lovable family of three while vacationing abroad. Taking the party to a second location &mdash;&nbsp;specifically, the latter family's remote and rustic home in a rural landscape &mdash;&nbsp;the posh and desperately polite family gets increasingly uncomfortable as their personal boundaries are tramped on by their beaming and beguiling hosts. A diabolical snare has been set. Where does politeness cross into compliance? Where does rudeness punch into ruthlessness? Both movies have very different answers despite telling mostly the same story.&nbsp;</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>In Watkins' version, every single character gets backstory, whether or not there's any real need for it. American couple Louise (Davis) and Ben (McNairy) aren't just comfortably wealthy liberals who yearn to seem accepting of all cultural differences. They are also enduring marital strife after a brush with infidelity. Irish Paddy (McAvoy) and Ciara (Franciosi) aren't only a mix of abrasive and enviable &mdash; chiefly for their lack of fucks about society's squeamish demands for politeness. This time, they also have tearful monologues that delve into tragic childhoods, personal loss, and domestic violence. Even the kids &mdash;&nbsp;who are mostly doe-eyed poppets in danger in the original &mdash;&nbsp;are given more, including newfound agency that feels very post-girl boss placating. But sometimes less is more.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps the thought was that we needed to know more about these characters to be invested in their struggle. Or perhaps Watkins was determined to prove his remake was more than a superficial redo. But he's answering questions as relevant to this story as, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/solo-a-star-wars-story-review-spoiler-free" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>"Gee, how did Han Solo get his name?"</u></a> The rough strokes of the original film painted a complete picture.

<p>It's not that McAvoy isn't up to the task of playing a brash yet enchanting baddie. It's actually the opposite. He's done this so effectively in films like <em>Split, Filth, </em>and <em>Glass</em> that his very presence telegraphs the thriller's dark turn. And Blumhouse knows it, as their <em>Speak No Evil</em>'s marketing poster centers squarely on the Scottish actor's mug, smiling menacingly.&nbsp;</p><p>In the original film, a scorching score over mundane moments warned of danger. But Fedja van Hu&ecirc;t, who thrillingly portrayed the predatory Patrick, wasn't immediately alarming. In fact, he often deflated conflict by being willfully silly or jarringly vulnerable, jolting his captive comrade out of fear of violence. McAvoy, who's bulked up in this role with his beefy arms bursting from a snug tank top, isn't able to let off the gas, even when he's following Patrick's path beat-for-beat. In the original, it's uncomfortable yet funny when van Hu&ecirc;t sings female-led pop to defuse a situation. But when McAvoy does it, his intensity makes the bit feel like a dare rather than a tactic. He's just creepy. And this makes it harder to settle into the empathetic terror of "but for the grace of God go I."&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Speak No Evil </em>for Americans means coddling the audience.&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>American horror thrives on convention. Horror fans line up for franchises so they can see <a href="https://mashable.com/article/halloween-ends-interview" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Michael Myers rise again and again</u></a>, logic be damned. We relish the twisted safety we have watching a familiar cliche play out. When the open door is shut and there's a knife-wielding killer behind it, we might jump in fright &mdash;&nbsp;but we also feel comforted by having seen it coming. On some level, these movies that play by convention satisfy us by subtly promising that we'd fare better than the fools being slaughtered on screen.&nbsp;</p><p>The original <em>Speak No Evil </em>didn't play by these rules. There'd be no hint dropped about a good improvised weapon should the need arise. No dialogue hinted that this unassuming couple is secretly prepared to turn Final Girl +1. The new <em>Speak No Evil </em>does play this game, and in doing so pulls the remake away from its psychological thriller roots and firmly into slasher terrain in a final act that is very, very different from its source and the ending that still makes me shiver.&nbsp;</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>It's a damn shame. This <em>Speak No Evil </em>is surprising in all the wrong ways. Yes, it's competently constructed and earnestly performed. But ultimately, Watkins (and Blumhouse) pull the punches of the original, presumably so Americans can maintain a smug pleasure in horror formulas. The filmmakers' assumption about their audiences seems to be that they need motivations and plot points spelled out. So not only are we given increasingly tedious monologues, but also an insert shot, plucked from the original, hammered home by a finger in frame literally pointing to the key detail. <em>"DO YOU GET IT, NOW?!"</em> The shot seems to scream.&nbsp;</p><p>More than this low expectation of audience comprehension, this <em>Speak No Evil </em>suggests American audiences cannot imagine feeling truly powerless &mdash;&nbsp;or perhaps don't want to. (The Saw franchise, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/saw-x-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>now 10 films deep</u></a>, scoffs at this assumption.) That is the ultimate horror of the original <em>Speak No Evil</em>. What if that pivotal life or death moment came, and you couldn't live up to Hollywood's popular fight-back fantasy? Tafdrup chased that fear to a bone-chilling and graphic climax that takes no prisoners. Watkins didn't dare.</p><p>For his version, Watkins has gussied up a convoluted action sequence to coddle American exceptionalism. Ironically, he does this by cutting the original's most horrific scenes and in their place offering underwhelming substitutions, like swapping a rare porterhouse steak for a bit of soggy cardboard. Of course, if you've never savored the blood and bite of a steak, this processed remake will probably serve just fine.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/z3bkew?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Speak%20No%20Evil%20opens%20in%20theaters%20Sept.%2013.&object_type=article&object_uuid=05HOKmMKXFiH48GrLCPlPBR&short_url=z3bkew&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Speak No Evil </em>opens in theaters Sept. 13.</a> <br></p>]]></content:encoded>

Sony finally lifted the curtain off the upgraded mid-gen PS5 console with a short video hosted by PlayStation hardware guru Mark Cerny. Put simply, it's just a more powerful PS5. It will play all of the same games, but some of them will look and run better on it. </p><p>It launches on Nov. 7 for $699 (yes, $699) and does not come with a disc drive or a vertical stand.

<p>Cerny's video was relatively quick and to the point, outlining some of the more nerdy technical details before showing off how some games look on PS5 Pro. It's got a larger GPU, more advanced ray tracing, and AI upscaling capabilities that can bring higher resolutions and frame rates to games. Cerny showed <a href="https://mashable.com/article/last-of-us-part-2-remaster-worth-it-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>The Last of Us Part II Remastered</em></a> running at 60 frames per second on the game's "Graphics Mode" option, which would run at 30FPS on a PS5. </p><p>Cerny seemed to imply that multiple games will be able to boost 30FPS modes up to 60FPS, which would indeed be huge. Having to choose between graphics modes on PS5 games has become increasingly difficult as games become more advanced and the compromises on one end or the other become more extreme. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/black-myth-wukong-ps5-review-in-progress" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em></a>, for example, looks amazing on PS5, but its 30FPS mode is wildly unstable and its 60FPS mode has substantial input delay. If a PS5 Pro could fix that, it may go a long way.</p><p>But $700 for a console with no disc drive will be a tough sell for a lot of people, especially those who thought $500 for the OG PS5 was asking a lot. We'll see how many people choose to take the plunge come November.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but the dark mornings of fall and winter are just a few weeks away. </p><p>If you're looking for something to help with those dreary mornings, Amazon has several Nespresso coffee makers on sale during the week of Sept. 10 that'll save you up to 30%. </p><p>Ordering a pumpkin spice latte every day from your local coffee shop can add up quickly. A Nespresso machine can prove to be an efficient and low-maintenance way to make a pretty great cup of coffee (or cappuccino, latte, mocha, etc.) for a lot less. </p><p>Nespresso machines can come with a steep initial cost, but thanks to this week's sale prices at Amazon, we're seeing some sweet discounts (up at $150 off) that have us perked up. Here are some of our top picks.</p><h2>Best espresso machine deal overall</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

The $99 sale price at Amazon is a 23% discount off the usual price of $129. The smaller design of the machine can be perfect if you're short on countertop space or live in an apartment. </p><p>The Nespresso Vertuo Pop+ has five size coffee cup size options to choose from and a removable 25-ounce water tank that's placed on the side, so it's easier to remove and refill. The machine also comes with a Nespresso coffee capsule tasting pack, so you'll have a few to get started and can choose your favorite. But you'll want to hop on this deal quickly since it's a limited time deal offered by Amazon, which means it could sell out.</p><h2>Best Nespresso machine bundle under $250</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

Last week, OnlyFans parent company Fenix International released its <a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/10354575/filing-history" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">UK regulatory filing</a> for most of 2023 (up until the end of November), where it laid out its financial statements. The report reveals that the number of creator accounts grew 29 percent in 2023, from around 3.2 million to 4.1 million. Number of fan accounts (those who buy content) grew 28 percent as well, from around 239,000 to 305,000 between 2022 and 2023.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Gross payments made on OnlyFans, meanwhile, grew one billion dollars in the same time frame, from $5.6 to 6.6 billion. Gross means it's subject to taxes, refunds, and deferred income, so <em>Variety </em>estimated that creators netted $5.32 billion. Given that there are over four million creators on the platform, that means the average yearly payout is around $1,300 per creator. This includes everyone, from creators who are inactive to <a href="https://www.supercreator.app/guides/top-01-onlyfans?utm_content=sess_1725976226610_6w16px5gs6w" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">creators who make millions every year on the platform</a>.</p><p>As the filing states, creators keep 80 percent of all payments made by fans. The platform keeps $1 out of every $4 a creator makes. From 2022 to 2023, OnlyFans revenue increased by $217 million, from $1.09 billion to $1.3 billion, according to the document. Profit before tax in 2023 was $658 million. Dividends (distribution of profit to shareholders) of $472 million were paid from Fenix to its only shareholder: <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/09/06/onlyfans-owner-leonid-radvinsky-banks-1bn-adult-website/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">OnlyFans owner Leonid Radvinsky</a>, according to <em>The Telegraph</em>. That means that Radvinsky made $472 million last year (at least in disclosed dividends), while the average OF creator made $1,300.</p><p>While non-adult creators can be on OnlyFans, the platform is known for NSFW content. While the filing doesn't say this explicitly, Fenix did report that "The media content on OnlyFans.com can only be shared or accessed by registered users who are over 18 years old and who have successfully completed the Creator or Fan onboarding process."</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Samsung's latest and greatest tablet just got its <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0C4B92LTJ" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">biggest discount to date</a>. As of Sept. 10, the 256GB, WiFi model of the Galaxy Tab S9+ is on sale for only $699.99 instead of $999.99. That's 30% in savings and its lowest price on record. It comes as no surprise, however, as rumors are floating around that the new S10 series is expected to drop next month. The S9 series <a href="https://mashable.com/article/samsung-unpacked-galaxy-tab-s9-preorder-price-availability" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">debuted last August</a> and it's still an impressive purchase. It features the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip, a new Dynamic AMOLED 2X 12.4-inch display, and an IP68 water- and dust-proof rating (a first for the Galaxy Tab S).

<p>A tale as old as time: Apple announces a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-airpods-max-have-usb-c-charging" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">new product</a> and the old one goes on sale. Yesterday, at the brand's "<a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-event-2024-everything-announced-iphone-16-watch-10" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Glowtime</a>" event, a new version of the AirPods Max was announced (they swapped the Lightning port for a USB-C port). Hence, the old ones are back down to just $399 at Amazon.

With this 27% discount, we're more inclined to grab a pair &mdash;&nbsp;although, this price only applies to the pink version as of Sept. 10.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

The Classic model still offers the same suite of features as the Watch 6, including a nuanced breakdown of sleep habits, sleep coaching, personalized heart rate zones, irregular heart rate notifications, and a 20 percent larger display.

But bisexual people <em>do</em> face extra roadblocks in the dating world.</p><p><a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-apps" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Online dating</a> absolutely sucks for everyone, but the fact that there's only a <em>single</em> bisexual dating site that caters specifically to this community (and even then, we're kind of iffy about it) means many folks are frequently swiping on people who don't take bisexuality seriously. In 2024, that shouldn't be the reality.</p><q>
    There's [an] issue of bi people feeling invisible when they're deemed too "straight passing," which can often happen in queer spaces. This kind of invalidation contributes to many bisexual folks' struggles of not feeling queer enough.
    </q>
<p>The "B" in LGBTQ+ makes up 50 percent of the queer community, according to data from the <a href="https://www.hrc.org/resources/bisexual-faq" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Human Rights Campaign</a>, but it's also one of the least-acknowledged letters in the acronym. What makes the bisexual dating landscape &mdash; especially the online one &mdash;&nbsp;so tricky to maneuver?</p><p>Before we get into the best dating apps for bisexuals, let's tackle this question for a sec.</p><h2>Bisexuality is hyper-sexualized on heteronormative apps</h2><p>Something bisexual women are all too familiar with when navigating online dating is the concept &mdash;&nbsp;one as old as time &mdash;&nbsp;of men being straight-up creeps. It's like heterosexual men can't seem to grasp that bisexuality is <em>not</em> a green light to ask a woman how many girls she's been with or if she likes men or women better. Such comments, especially from absolute strangers online, are disconcerting at best and threatening at worst. </p><p>Megan, a 23-year-old woman from Virginia, told us via Facebook that she couldn't even count the number of gross (slash ignorant) messages she'd received from men in reference to writing "bi" in her Tinder bio. "There were times when they would be like, 'Oh, you never seemed gay in high school' or whatever, because gay is obviously a personality trait &#128579;," she said. "Like my sexuality wasn&rsquo;t a real thing, or it was just a fetish to these people."</p><p>On most dating apps, there are a <em>lot</em> of couples only looking for bi women to hook up with. We aren't saying that threesomes are wrong, but let's not assume that every bi person is <em>dreaming </em>of hooking up with you and your beau. You'd think the user base on queer dating apps would be more enlightened than on comparatively heteronormative apps, but that's not always the case.</p><p>Catfishing is also an issue bi folks have to grapple with. Some men have such a rabid obsession with queer women that they'll sign up for a dating site as a woman just to see an all-women swiping field.

Not everyone sees the label as a positive, despite its cheerful-sounding name. It refers to lesbians who have never slept with a man.

<h2>Why you might still want to put "bi" in your dating app bio</h2><p>Adding those two simple letters to your bio may draw unwanted attention, and it's going to be a pain in the ass. But in the long run, it also acts as an <a href="https://bumble.com/en/the-buzz/bisexual-bumble-profile" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">asshole filter</a> to weed out people who try to put sexual orientation into a box. </p><p>Just think about it: Would you want your partner to think that being bisexual is just a pit stop on the road to being a "<a href="https://www.advocate.com/bisexuality/2014/06/24/op-ed-are-you-full-blown-gay-yet" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">full-blown gay</a>"? Of course not. Then there's the old stereotype that bisexuality means you want to bang anything that moves. The easiest way to ensure that you won't be left heartbroken over someone rejecting or questioning your sexuality is to let them know how you identify from the jump. You deserve the very best, which means only those people who accept you as you are.</p><p>With all of this in mind &mdash; and it's <em>a lot </em>to keep in mind &mdash; we wanted to review the best bi dating apps. We can't promise you'll never have a bad experience on these (indeed, mishaps are all but guaranteed when you brave <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-free-dating-sites-apps-hinge-tinder-okcupid" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">dating apps</a>), but we believe these particular apps give bisexual men, women, and non-binary folks the <em>very</em> best shot at finding a compatible partner. </p>]]></content:encoded>

CEO Tim Cook kicked off its September 9 event "<a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-event-2024-livestream-today-iphone-16-announcement" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">It's Glowtime</a>" with the announcement that the new iPhone is built from the ground up to support <a href="https://mashable.com/article/5-apple-intelligence-features-ios-18-1-developer-beta" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple Intelligence</a>. The event centered on the new Apple Watch 10 and AirPods 4, in addition to the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, which come about a year after their predecessors, the iPhone 15 line, were announced.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Leading up to <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-september-event-what-to-expect-2024-iphone-16" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Glowtime</a>, there were rumors flying about the new iPhones from Apple. While the sizes were expected to stay the same, both the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, were meant to have slimmed-down bezels and the addition of the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/iphone-16-action-button-evidence" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Action button,</a> which was previously only available on the iPhone Pro and Pro Max models. Now that Apple has officially announced its new phones, here's what to know about the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus.</p><p>The iPhone 16 is embracing color with this new set of smartphones. Debuting in three new vibrant shades of pink, green, and blue, it's sure to make a statement, but that's just where the design changes begin. It's crafted from aerospace titanium, ceramic shields, and new, tougher glass for a more durable phone.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>All iPhone 16 models now include the multipurpose Action button that sits just above the volume buttons. Previously the Action button was only included on the Pro and Pro Max iPhone models, but now it appears to have expanded to all models. It allows you to customize how you want to use the button whether you want it to turn on the flashlight or start your car with compatible apps like FordPass.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The camera on the iPhone 16 looks different than previous models with two stacked lenses rather than diagonal lenses (the iPhone 16 Pro models still have the three-camera design.) Plus there's a new way to control the camera on your iPhone with Camera Control, a button flush to the side, just below the lock button. Quickly click to snap a photo or use touch controls to preview or zoom in on your shot.</p><p>Inside the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus is the A18 chip, which Apple claims to be 30 percent faster than the iPhone 15. It will run Apple Intelligence features, which are slowly being rolled out, some expected to launch later this month. During the iPhone 16 event, we didn't learn too many new details about Apple Intelligence, instead the company reiterated the new AI features that let you create your own emoji or spruce up your emails and text with better language.</p><p>iOS 18 will power the iPhone 16 and supposedly give it a longer battery life. How much longer? Apple didn't say, so we'll have to test that for ourselves. The iPhone 16 measures in at 6.1 inches while the iPhone 16 Plus is slightly larger at 6.7 inches. If you're tempted to go even bigger, then you'll need to go for the iPhone 16 Pro models.</p><p>The iPhone 16 starts at $799 and the iPhone 16 Plus starts at $899. They will be available to pre-order on Friday, September 13 (spooky) and will arrive on September 20.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

But new products mean discounts on existing models that, let's be clear, are still full of fantastic tech.</p><p>We were watching the deals come in yesterday, and they were perfectly fine, but today, things are really starting to pop-off. Both AirPod Pro and AirPod Max headphones are just short of their lowest price ever, for up to 27% savings. With the new AirPods coming, things are in flux and there's no guarantee that discounts will remain. If you're anxious to get a pair of AirPods and don't want to pay full price, here are the best Apple AirPod deals to shop now.</p><h2>Best AirPod (2nd gen) deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

With a delightfully compact case, they can be tucked into pockets and bags so you always have access on the go. The biggest perk is their seamless connection to iPhones. Unlike other headphones, there's no button you have to press to get a Bluetooth connection. All you have to do is open the case, and they magically connect within seconds. These don't feature noise cancellation, but they're nonetheless fantastic.</p><p>Currently, you can find <a href="https://zdcs.link/zjGMGv?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20AirPods%20%282nd%20gen%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=07JlvddB7KMzByUw8xmCCth&short_url=zjGMGv&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple AirPods (2nd gen)</a> on sale at Amazon for $89, saving a sweet $40.

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>While basic AirPods can certainly get the job done, AirPod Pros kick it up a notch.

However, AirPod Pros also provide resistance against dust, sweat, and water, especially important for commuters or outdoor athletes.</p><p>While AirPod Pros aren't getting a massive upgrade, they are about to receive an update that includes a hearing aid feature, emphasizing Apple's commitment to accessibility. However, that means current AirPods are getting a discount. <a href="https://zdcs.link/QbnmE6?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Find%20Pros&object_type=article&object_uuid=07JlvddB7KMzByUw8xmCCth&short_url=QbnmE6&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Find Pros</a> for just $189.99, saving $59.01 for 24% off.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>More precisely, the 6.4-inch OLED display can turn into a 7.9-inch OLED display if you unfold it once, and if you unfold it fully, it becomes a 10.2-inch tablet with a 2,232 x 3,184 pixel resolution.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>There's really no obvious caveat here. The bezels on this thing are very thin, the display looks crisp, with barely visible folding creases, and even the thickness of the device when fully folded isn't that bad, with the Mate XT being only 12.8 millimeters thick. For comparison, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/iphone-16-pro-max-hands-on" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple's iPhone 16 Pro Max</a> is 8.25 millimeters thick, which is obviously better, but the difference is not that vast as to immediately dismiss the Huawei phone as too fat for real-life use. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The rest of the specs are pretty impressive, too. The phone is powered by a Kirin 9 chipset and has a triple, 50/12/12-megapixel rear camera, an 8-megapixel selfie camera, 16GB of RAM, 256/512/1,024GB of storage, and a massive, 5,600mAh battery. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

    </div>
<p>Obviously, the phone won't be very attractive to most customers outside of China, as it comes without Google services due to the Huawei trade ban in the U.S. It doesn't really matter as it's extremely unlikely that the phone will ever reach the U.S.</p><p>The starting price is 19,999 CNY ($2,810), which isn't cheap, but to be fair, there aren't any other options if you want a tri-folding phone. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>However, we'll have to bring it in for in-house testing to <em>really </em>see how long the iPhone 16 Pro Max lasts on a charge.

<p>When I saw that Gold Titanium case, man, I was salivating. It's arguably the most stunning finish on an Apple Watch Series 10.</p><p>However, I didn't love the Link Bracelet it was paired with. It was unintuitive to unclasp and clip together. (If I purchased this, I'd likely have to ask my partner to help me remove it or put it on.) Plus, it didn't appear to have any micro-adjustment capabilities, so it didn't fit very well.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>But then I saw the Milanese Loop on another Apple Watch Series 10. It captures some of that sophisticated feel of the Link Bracelet, but it's still easy to put on and take off. It's the best of both worlds.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>As such, Gold Titanium Apple Watch Series 10 + Milanese Loop is the winning combo. I'm telling you.</p><h3><strong>New speakers</strong></h3><p>I didn't get to test this unfortunately, but I'm most excited about the Apple Watch Series 10 featuring speakers. In other words, you'll have the ability to listen to podcasts and jam out to tunes directly from your wrist.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>It was as if Apple was listening to me complain about my Apple Watch Series 9. I can't tell you how often I wished that my Apple Watch Series 9 could play some of my favorite jams while going for a jog.</p><p>Chances are high that the speakers will likely sound tinny, but I'm OK with that. The trade-off is worth it for the convenience of playing audio on a wrist-bound wearable.</p><h2><strong>Is Apple Watch Series 10 worth it?</strong></h2><p>The Apple Watch Series 10 also reportedly features fast charging (80% in 30 minutes), brighter display from more angles, and a new sleep apnea monitor. Interestingly, the new sleep apnea sensor will also be available on the previous-gen Apple Watch Series 9 and the current-gen Apple Watch Ultra 2.</p><p>But the one thing I didn't hear from Apple is longer battery life. Similar to the Watch Series 9, the Watch Series 10 will have an 18-hour runtime. As such, I wasn't prompted to upgrade. (One thing I don't love about my Watch Series 9 is the fact that I need to charge it too often.)</p><p>However, that new speaker feature is calling my name. And if you're fashion-focused, I'm telling you that the Gold Titanium-and-Milanese-Loop combo screams old money.</p><p>But if none of these are particularly compelling to you, feel free to wait until Apple Watch Series 11.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>It was, in a nutshell, easy to get lost in this event. But after meticulously going through the specs sheets of the new phones, I can see two very big reasons to upgrade to the new iPhone 16 Pro and the 16 Pro Max. </p><h2>More display, more pixels, less bezel</h2><p>One is display size. The displays on the new Pro models have gone up 0.2 inches each, while their bezels have shrunk. Now, the iPhone 16 Pro has a 6.3-inch display, while the iPhone 16 Pro Max is truly "max" with a 6.9-inch display.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The smaller bezels do make a difference visually, and the added screen real estate is always welcome. Even the resolution on these displays has gone up a little; the iPhone 16 Pro has a 2,622 x 1,206 pixel resolution (up from 2,556 x 1,179 pixels) while the iPhone 16 Pro Max has a 2,868 x 1,320 pixel resolution (up from 2,796 x 1,290 pixels). </p><p>It is worth mentioning that the new models are slightly bigger and just a tad heavier than before, but the difference is small enough that most people won't notice. </p><h2>Big battery boost</h2><p>The other key feature is still, in part, an unknown, but the numbers on paper are looking good. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Yes, I'm talking about battery life, which got a huge boost on these new models. </p><p>Here are Apple's exact figures:</p><ul><li><p>Apple iPhone 16 Pro: Up to 27 hours of video playback, up to 22 hours of streamed video playback, and up to 85 hours of audio playback</p></li><li><p>Apple iPhone 15 Pro: Up to 23 hours of video playback, Up to 20 hours of streamed video playback, and up to 75 hours of audio playback</p></li><li><p>Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max: Up to 33 hours of video playback, up to 29 hours of streamed video playback, and up to 105 hours of audio playback</p></li><li><p>Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max: Up to 29 hours of video playback, up to 25 hours of streamed video playback, and up to 95 hours of audio playback</p></li></ul><p>This is, roughly, a 15 percent increase across the board, which is huge given that the new models have larger displays. </p><div id="related-video" class="mx-auto mt-8 mb-12 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans md:mt-12 md:mb-16 text-primary-400">

<p>Apple says it achieved this with an optimized internal design, which fits bigger batteries, working in tandem with the A18 Pro chip which isn't as power-hungry as its predecessor. </p><p>Of course, official specs are one thing, and actual, real-life usage is another. But if these numbers are close to accurate, then this is a battery boost worthy of the "Pro" moniker. </p><h2>What else?</h2><p>The new Pro models come with a number of other improvements, such as the new A18 Pro chip, the new, 48-megapixel ultra-wide camera, 4K,120fps, Dolby Vision video recording (also in slow-motion), new Desert Titanium color, and a bunch of Apple Intelligence features which will be slowly rolled out over the next months (unless you're in Europe, where they're delayed until an unspecified time in 2025). </p><p>But I reckon that most buyers, when deciding whether they need a new phone, focus on just a couple of big upgrades to justify their purchase. Call me old-fashioned, but for me, it's all about the larger display and the bigger battery. </p><p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-event-2024-everything-announced-iphone-16-watch-10" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>For everything Apple announced at its Sept. 9 event, Mashable's got a full guide.</em></a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"During his 2024 campaign, according to a source with direct knowledge, Trump has raised this topic again, venting about the need to punish late-night comedians for giving 'illegal' campaign contributions to the Democratic Party &mdash; in the form of jokes and on-air satire," reads <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/if-trump-wins-2024-election-1235096091/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">the report</a>.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Colbert and Kimmel &mdash; who along with <a href="https://mashable.com/category/snl" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Saturday Night Live</em></a> are named directly in the article &mdash; had something to say about it.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

<p>"Finally, I made an enemies list! Obviously there's no guarantee I'll be arrested, but it's an honour just to be nominated. No doubt it'll all be decided this weekend in Los Angeles, when whoever wins the Emmy for best talk show will be sent to a camp," Colbert said during his Monday night monologue. "So to my old colleague Jon Stewart, I just want you to know I voted for you. Of course if Jon wins he's only incarcerated on Mondays."</p><p>Kimmel, meanwhile, made a very similar joke about the <em>Daily Show</em> host, who only presents on Monday nights. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

<p>You can press <strong>once </strong>to take a photo. But to capture a video, you must <strong>press and hold</strong> the Camera Control button. My only disappointment is that letting go of the Control Button stops the recording. In other words, I'd love it if I could press and hold, let go, and it'll continue recording until I press and hold it again.

I got the hang of it in less than three minutes. I also love that you can access so many features on the Camera Control button with only a few gestures.</p><p>Keep in mind that the Camera Control button also doubles as a "Visual Intelligence" tool. As a part of iOS 18, Visual Intelligence, via the Camera Control button, lets you quickly learn about anything you see by pointing your camera at it.</p><p>For example, you can point your camera at a restaurant and Visual Intelligence will tell you about the establishment's open hours. You can also point it at a cute dog to figure out its breed. It's basically like Apple's own built-in version of Google Lens.</p><p>There's no exact date, but Visual Intelligence is coming to Camera Control later this year.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>Here's a comprehensive comparison between the Apple Watch Series 10 and 9 to help you decide whether to upgrade.</p><h2>Apple Watch Series 10 vs. 9: Price</h2><p>When investing in a new piece of tech, one of the biggest considerations is the price. The new Apple Watch Series 10 starts at $399, which will snag you the 42-millimetre aluminium option with just GPS. The price jumps up to $699 if you switch to titanium, which comes with both GPS and cellular connectivity, topping out at $749 if you also choose the larger 46-millimetre size.</p><p>In comparison, the Apple Watch Series 9 also started at $399 at launch, however its price has dropped in the year since.

<p>That's a difference of approximately $100 between last year's Apple Watch and this year's equivalent models. Whether it's worth it will depend on your priorities.</p><h2>Apple Watch Series 10 vs. 9: Display</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Both the Apple Watch Series 10 and 9 boast a brightness range from one to 2000 nits, so there aren't any changes there. However, the Series 10's one-millimetre increase across its two size options isn't the only difference to its display.&nbsp;</p><p>The Series 10 upgrades the Series 9's low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) display to <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/explainer/what-is-ltpo-3-4313967" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>LTPO3</u></a>, the latest version of this technology. This should mean an increase to the Series 10's variable refresh rate and power efficiency, offering a smoother display that's less draining on the battery. Even so, exactly how much of a practical, noticeable difference this will make isn't clear, especially as the Series 10 doesn't claim any increase in battery life (more on that below).</p><p>Another change is the Series 10's new wide-angle organic light-emitting diode (OLED), making it the first Apple Watch with this feature. This wide-angle OLED enables pixels to emit more light at a wider angle, with Apple claiming the Series 10 offers a 40 percent increase in brightness when viewed from an angle over the Series 9.</p><p>The company further states that the OLED's improved power efficiency has allowed the Series 10's refresh rate in <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/105074" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>always-on mode</u></a> to increase to once per second, a notable jump from the Series 9's rate of once per minute. As such, some Watch faces will allow wearers to see a ticking seconds hand without having to raise their wrist.</p><h2>Apple Watch Series 10 vs. 9: Design</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Straight off the bat, the Apple Watch Series 10 is slightly larger than the Series 9, offering 46 and 42-millimetre models as compared to last year's 45- and 41-millimetre models. However, it has shaved off some bulk in other areas.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the most prominently spruiked changes to the Apple Watch Series 10's design is that it's slimmer. Apple claims that the Series 10 is almost 10 percent thinner than the Series 9, shaving one millimetre off to take it from 10.7 to 9.7 millimetres thick. That may not seem like much, but every little bit counts when you're measuring in millimetres.</p><p>The Series 10 is also lighter, though the difference here will depend on which models you're comparing. Apple states that the Series 10's aluminium models are up to 10 percent lighter than those in Series 9, while the titanium models are almost 20 percent lighter than last year's stainless steel.</p><p>Judging from the specifications shared by Apple, this seems about right. The lightest Series 10 Watch is the 42-millimetre aluminium model with GPS and cellular, which Apple states weighs 29.3 grams. In comparison, the lightest Series 9 Watch is the 41-millimetre aluminium with GPS only, which comes in at 31.9 grams &mdash; 2.6 grams heavier. The Series 10's titanium also comes out lighter when compared to the Series 9's stainless steel. Its heaviest option is the 46-millimetre titanium model weighing 41.7 grams, which is almost 10 whole grams lighter than the heaviest stainless steel Series 9 at 51.5 grams.</p><p>In addition to these changes, the Series 10's corners are more rounded and it has a wider aspect ratio than Series 9. Apple states that these tweaks to the Watch's form factor enable a notably larger display.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Finally, there's the Apple Watch Series 10's colour options to go through. The colour of a new Apple Watch is arguably even more important <a href="https://mashable.com/article/iphone-16-colors-hot-pink" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">than that of a new iPhone</a>, since you're much more likely to cover the latter with a phone case anyway.</p><p>At launch, the Series 10 comes in six different colours equally distributed between its aluminium and titanium models. The aluminium Series 10 is available in jet black, rose gold, and silver, while the titanium version comes in slate, gold, and natural.&nbsp;</p><p>In comparison, the Series 9 has five colours for its aluminium model alone &mdash; midnight, starlight, silver, pink, and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-watch-world-aids-day-red-partnership" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">(PRODUCT)RED)</a>. Its stainless steel model has three with graphite, silver, and gold, or four if you include the Apple Watch Herm&egrave;s collaboration's space black.</p><h2>Apple Watch Series 10 vs. 9: Health and fitness features</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Apple announced a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-watch-series-10-sleep-apnea-health-monitor-announced" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>new sleep apnea feature</u></a> with the Series 10, which uses the Watch's accelerometer to monitor your sleep and notify you if it detects signs of the <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8718-sleep-apnea" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>sleep disorder</u></a>. However, this feature doesn't separate the Apple Watch Series 10 from the 9, as this Breathing Disturbances metric will be coming to both models and the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-watch-ultra-2-announcement-apple-event-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Ultra 2</a> this month.</p><p>A better way to distinguish the two is via their oceanic capabilities. The Series 10 is more equipped for aquatic adventures than the Series 9, featuring both a water temperature sensor and a depth gauge capable of tracking up to 20 feet (six metres) down. Information gathered by these features is displayed via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/depth/id1635387927" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Apple's Depth app</u></a>, which comes preloaded on the Series 10. The latest Apple Watch is compatible with the Oceanic+ snorkelling app as well, though unlike the Depth app you'll have to head to the Apple App Store to download it.&nbsp;</p><p>The Series 9 doesn't have such functionality, so it's a factor to consider if you're an avid snorkeler and iPhone user who doesn't already have an <a href="https://mashable.com/comparison/apple-watch-ultra-1-vs-2" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Ultra</u></a>.</p><h2>Apple Watch Series 10 vs. 9: Audio</h2><p>Audio is far from the first feature people think of when they think about Apple Watches. Even so, the new Apple Watch Series 10 is improving its audio capabilities by allowing music to be played through its inbuilt speaker.</p><p>While the Series 9 also has a speaker, it's restricted to utilitarian uses such as phone calls, the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/watch/apd246d6eefd/watchos" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Walkie-Talkie function</u></a>, and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/watch/apd72879df4d/watchos" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Voice Feedback</u></a> during your workouts. In contrast, the Series 10 will let you play media such as music, podcasts, and audiobooks, enabling you to irritate everyone around you by blasting tunes directly from your wrist. This will work with Apple apps such as Apple Music, Podcasts, and Books, as well as third-party apps.</p><p>The Apple Watch Series 10 also upgrades its microphone's capabilities by adding voice isolation, using a neural network to reduce background noise during calls.&nbsp;</p><p>Most people aren't searching for audio capability when buying a watch. You'll probably still prefer to use your iPhone or a pair of AirPods for your calls and music, only turning to the Apple Watch when they aren't at hand <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-watch-ultra-australian-man-emergency-rescue-surf" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>or if you're in an emergency</u></a>. Still, it is technically an improvement over the Series 9.</p><h2>Apple Watch Series 10 vs. 9: Battery life</h2><p>Apple doesn't claim any difference in battery life between the Watch Series 10 and 9. Both run on a rechargeable lithium-ion battery, which the tech giant says offers up to 18 hours of juice (or 36 in low power mode). Both are fast charge capable as well.</p><p>However, Apple does state that the Series 10's charging coil is larger and more efficient, allowing you to charge up your Watch's battery from zero to 80 percent full in 30 minutes. That's an improvement over the Series 9, which Apple has said needs<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102454" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u> 45 minutes to get to 80 percent</u></a>. Fifteen minutes doesn't seem like a terribly significant difference though.</p><p>Mashable will be testing Apple's new Watch and provide an update with the results, but for now it looks as though battery life isn't a major factor to agonise over if you're deliberating between the Series 10 and 9.</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/aDVb1o?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Preorders%20for%20the%20new%20Apple%20Watch%20Series%2010%20open%20Sept.%2020.&object_type=article&object_uuid=01eVOa8Kxw97aTvfeGRVjlD&short_url=aDVb1o&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Preorders for the new Apple Watch Series 10 open Sept. 20.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I've tested a ton of automatic vacuums and upright cordless vacuums, assessing from all of those angles along the way. And I have a handful of recommendations for both. But first, let's unpack which kind overall might work better in your living arrangement.</p><h2>Should I get an upright or robot vacuum?</h2><p>I could argue for both sides, considering I think the true dream setup is to have both on hand for different situations. While there are definitely ways to shop strategically and split your budget between one of each, that won't be the most practical choice for every household. If you're only choosing one type of vacuum, consider your main priority when it comes to vacuuming. Is your ideal vacuum cleaner one that automates the most steps to give you as little work as possible, or is it one that does the absolute most meticulous job, even if you still have to do the work?</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

    </div>
<p>Drawbacks of each also have to be considered. Trusting a robot vacuum to do this chore comes with the fine print that the robot vacuum is probably going to piss you off sometimes.

<p>The document was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/11/politics/trump-allies-project-2025/index.html" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>authored by Trump loyalists</u></a>, some of whom worked for his first administration, stoking fears that if Trump gets elected this wishlist will become the law of the land. Some conservative performers aren't buying that idea, but others to their left see Project 2025 as an existential threat to their industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This comes at a time when Vice President Kamala Harris is Trump's opponent. As senator, Harris supported the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-help-sex-trafficking-survivors" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act and Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (FOSTA/SESTA)</u></a>, legislation that was anti-sex trafficking in theory but in practice made it harder for online sex workers to do their jobs safely. Because the stakes are so high for the business, performers haven't been shy about sharing their point of view.&nbsp;</p><h2>Project 2025: Scare tactic or actual threat?</h2><p>As early as the fifth page, Project 2025 calls for the imprisonment of porn performers as well as distributors, and says that telecommunications companies that allow porn to be accessed should be closed:</p><blockquote><p>Pornography should be outlawed. The people who produce and distribute it should be imprisoned. Educators and public librarians who purvey it should be classed as registered sex offenders. And telecommunications and technology firms that facilitate its spread should be shuttered.</p></blockquote><p>Conservatives like Ryan suggest it's representative of the fringe of the party &mdash; not the majority &mdash; and has no chance of becoming actual policy. That's why, in her view, Project 2025 is less of a Republican master plan, and more of a tool that Democrats are using to campaign.</p><p>"I think it's a scare tactic that Democrats are trying to use," Ryan told Mashable.&nbsp;</p><p>The Trump campaign clearly sees the political implications of embracing such far-right talking points. That's in part why the former president has <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/22/g-s1-19202/trump-project-2025-border-immigration" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">distanced himself from it</a> in the past few weeks. To Ryan, that's one of the reasons not to worry.&nbsp;</p><p>"I've been in the adult film industry for 18 years. Scare tactics are something that we fight every single day," Ryan added.&nbsp;</p><p>A slew of policy decisions have put immense pressure on the industry in recent years, ranging from <a href="https://abc7news.com/pornographer-condoms-in-porn-stds-hiv/1584502/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>propositions about condom use</u></a>&nbsp;to state-level laws that would force phonemakers to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/porn-filter-laws-bills-anti-default-florida-texas-rcna73626" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>automatically censor sexual content</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>FOSTA/SESTA, however, which <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/4/13/17172762/fosta-sesta-backpage-230-internet-freedom" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Trump signed into law</u></a> in 2018, has had tangible effects on online sex workers and their income. According to a paper published in the <a href="https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/flr/vol87/iss5/13/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Fordham Law Review</u></em></a>, the wording of the legislation actually does more to harm sex workers than protect victims of sex trafficking. That's echoed by research published in the <a href="https://www.antitraffickingreview.org/index.php/atrjournal/article/view/448/363" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Anti-Trafficking Review</u></em></a> that shows that the closure of classified site Backpage.com and the subsequent laws actually put sex workers in dangerous positions by removing an online space where workers can vet those soliciting their services.&nbsp;</p><p>The research shows ways that the laws have limited workers' ability to share harm reduction resources, like lists of people known to solicit sex workers who have a history of assault.</p><p>Not everyone sees Project 2025 as merely a scare tactic. In fact, most of the performers Mashable spoke to see Trump distancing himself from Project 2025 as a farce. Trump lied <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/01/24/trumps-false-or-misleading-claims-total-30573-over-four-years/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>more than 30,000 times during his presidential term alone</u></a> according to<em> The</em> <em>Washington Post</em>.</p><p>"I think that we need to look at Project 2025 and recognize that this is a clear and present danger for the sex worker community. We have to call it out. We have to take it very seriously and educate people," performer Allie Awesome told Mashable.&nbsp;</p><p>Regardless of Trump's disavowals of Project 2025, he's still mentioned by name hundreds of times in it.

      <description><![CDATA[The best gay dating apps and sites for LGBTQ+ daters, including popular options like Grindr and Tinder.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/roundups/07j10ZzzBF1HFZ6ykBJyyk2/hero-image.jpg" alt="Couple lying on the grass"><p><em>This content originally appeared on Mashable for a US audience and has been adapted for the UK audience.</em></p><p>Most people have at least one horror story about <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-dating-sites-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">online dating</a>. It's a rite of passage that single people love to hate.</p><p>But the horror stories look a little different for members of the LGBTQ community. On top of the classic awkward Hinge date anecdotes and screenshots of a corny bio seeping with secondhand embarrassment, gay singles deal with all sorts of alienating interactions. Baseless questioning of sexual history, harassment, and fetishisation &mdash; some of it coming from cis straight people who shouldn't have popped up in your feed in the first place &mdash;&nbsp;don't exactly result in butterflies.</p><p>Still, dating apps have become crucial means of introduction for gay folks looking to settle down. A <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2019/08/21/online-dating-popular-way-u-s-couples-meet/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">2019 Stanford study</a> and <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/04/09/lesbian-gay-and-bisexual-online-daters-report-positive-experiences-but-also-harassment/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">2020 Pew Research survey</a> found that meeting online has become the most popular way for couples to connect &mdash;&nbsp;especially for gay couples, of which 28 percent met their current partner online (versus 11 percent of straight couples).</p><p>But the Pew survey also dredged up those ugly experiences with harassment. This could be where options that bar heterosexual users, like HER and Grindr, come in. Their perfectly-tailored environments are so well-known in the gay community that they're essentially in a league of their own.</p><h2>Is Grindr the only option for gay dating apps?</h2><p>Though <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-sites-for-men-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Grindr</a> and HER are big players, they're not alone in the queer dating app market. Apps like Zoe, Taimi, and Scruff exist. But their plateauing popularity can be attributed to similar complaints: too many scam profiles and too few legitimate users (ones within a reasonable distance to plan a date, anyway). Chappy was a promising app for gay men that <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/02/17/chappy-app-shut-down-ollie-locke-jack-rogers/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">shut down</a> just as it was gaining serious traction.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>And at the end of the day, "everyone" apps are simply where masses of queer users are. Keeping Tinder on the back burner isn't just a straight people thing, especially for those who live in less-populated areas where Grindr and HER offer slim pickings. Plus, some mainstream apps do deserve credit for the steps they've taken to create a more inclusive atmosphere. Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge now offer lots of sexual orientation and gender identity options. OkCupid gets kudos for making that change years ago, as well as making social justice a core part of compatibility scoring &mdash; which kind of self-curates the type of people on the app.</p><h2>What is the best gay dating app?</h2><p>If you're part of the LGBTQ community and hate leaving your home, you're not alone. These are the apps and sites that'll maximise your opportunities while minimising your human contact. </p><p>These are the best gay dating apps in 2024.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Unfortunately, there is one big problem with this hobby: There is a limited amount of <a href="https://mashable.com/category/streaming" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">content</a> out there to keep you entertained.</p><p>We're a greedy bunch, and regular <a href="https://mashable.com/category/netflix" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">streamers</a> can easily get to a point where it feels like there's nothing left to watch. What are you supposed to do then? Don't panic, because there is a simple solution to this frustrating issue.</p><p>If you've reached this point of streaming shortage, you should consider investing in a <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-vpn-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">VPN</a>. It will likely unlock a lot of shows and movies on services to which you're already subscribed.</p><h2>What is a VPN?</h2><p><a href="https://mashable.com/category/vpn" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">VPNs</a> are security tools that provide protection for your information by creating a private network that hides your real IP address (digital location). All of your activity is untraceable and secure, because all of your online traffic passes through an encrypted tunnel. Nobody can see into the tunnel, and everything inside the tunnel is protected against online threats like hackers, viruses, and malware.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

            30 best movies on Netflix to stream right now

    </div>
<p>The act of hiding your real IP address is what can trick leading streaming sites into thinking you are based in another country.</p><h2>Do you need a VPN?</h2><p>VPNs are used to provide <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-for-anonymity-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">protection for your sensitive </a>information, which is obviously super important. This isn't the only reason VPNs are so popular though, because these tools can be also be used to watch content that is normally blocked in your location.</p><p>By hiding your real IP address and connecting you to a server in another country, you can watch all your favourite content from that location. For example, you could watch all the extra films and shows on American Netflix that are not usually accessible outside of the U.S. There is so much content out there that can be accessed with the help of a VPN.</p><p>Everyone is in need of something that can bypass geo-restrictions to access all of this blocked entertainment, and that something is a VPN. These services are keys to the online world, granting you access to more of the shows and films you love. </p><h2>How to unblock U.S. Netflix</h2><p>If you think accessing American Netflix is going to be difficult with a <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-amazon-prime-video-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">VPN</a>, think again. It's actually a really simple process that absolutely everyone can understand:</p><ol><li><p>Sign up to a streaming-friendly VPN (like <a href="https://go.expressvpn.com/c/190434/1462855/16063" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">ExpressVPN</a>)</p></li><li><p>Download the app to your device of choice (the best VPNs have apps for Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux, and more)</p></li><li><p>Open up the app and connect to a server in the U.S.</p></li><li><p>Visit Netflix to watch movies and shows from the U.S. content library</p></li></ol><p>If you're worried that this whole thing sounds a bit illegal, then maybe we can reassure you. It's currently legal to watch Netflix while using a VPN, although we should point out that Netflix states in its <a href="https://zdcs.link/z31YV?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=terms%20of%20service&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=04qgd80xTaW4kYEBpwViXd7&short_url=z31YV&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>terms of service</u></a> that it may restrict your account without compensation or notice if you are engaged in "improper" use. We're not entirely sure what that means, but consider yourself warned.</p><p>We should make it very clear that you still need to be subscribed to Netflix for this trick to work. A VPN is not going to grant access to the streaming site for free. A VPN provides access to more libraries from around the world, once you're subscribed.</p><h2>Should you use free VPNs?</h2><p>There are plenty of <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-free-vpn-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">free versions</a> and free trials of VPNs, so why would you ever consider paying for a service? As with most things in life, you get what you pay for with VPNs. </p><p>There is always a catch with free versions, and it's normally in the form of limited data usage. These plans will be just fine if you're just an occasional user, but if you're going to be <a href="https://mashable.com/category/streaming" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">streaming</a> or downloading anything, this isn't going to work. Free trials are different as come with everything you get in a paid plan, but obviously they don't tend to last very long. Trials are great for testing out a service before committing, but this isn't a long-term solution.</p><p>To gain access to advanced security features without limitations on usage, you generally need to pay up. That being said, services like ProtonVPN offer an impressive set of features for free. However, you might have trouble streaming Netflix with this free version.</p><h2>What is the best VPN for Netflix?</h2><p>There are a lot of VPN services out there that can effectively unblock American Netflix, but which is the best? There are plenty of strong options for you to consider, but we wouldn't want you wasting your time checking everything out. To save you time, we've handpicked your best options. Each service has a different set of features that will suit some users better than others, and it's all about finding something that works for you.</p><p>ExpressVPN is at the top of this list because it combines essential features with impressive results, but it isn&rsquo;t the only option available to you. We have lined up all the best VPNs for unblocking Netflix, with something for everyone on this list.

You might be surprised by the results.</p><p>Your data is seriously valuable stuff these days, and everyone is looking to get their hands on it. Once you come to understand that the internet is insecure, it's perfectly normal to feel a little concerned about how much of your data is up for grabs. There's no need to panic though, because there is a simple and effective way that you can stay protected.</p><p>To stay safe online and keep all of your data and personal information secure, you really should consider investing in a <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">VPN</a>. </p><h2>What is a VPN?</h2><p><a href="https://mashable.com/category/vpn" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">VPNs</a> provide protection for your data and identity by creating a private network that hides your real IP address (digital location).

How do they do this? It's actually a really simple process, and it can significantly boost your content options. All you need to do is open up your preferred VPN, connect to a server from another country in order to spoof your IP to another address, and then head to your preferred streaming site. This process tricks the site into thinking you are based in another country, meaning you can watch all that great content that is normally blocked.</p><p>VPNs are really useful for cybersecurity and streaming, which means they should be a worthwhile investment for just about everyone.</p><h2>What should you know before subscribing to a VPN?</h2><p>Selecting a VPN that is right for you is not easy, because there are a lot of options all offering similar packages. To make the decision a little simpler, we have highlighted a selection of the most important things to consider before making any sort of purchase:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Connection speed </strong>&mdash; This is absolutely vital whether you're looking to use a VPN for online security or streaming. It's normal for a VPN to result in a drop in your connection speed, but you shouldn't accept anything significant.</p></li><li><p><strong>Encryption </strong>&mdash; We know that a lot of people will be using VPNs for streaming, but these services are primarily designed to provide cybersecurity, so encryption is important. The best VPNs will offer powerful protection for your data, meaning that everything is unreadable and untraceable.</p></li><li><p><strong>Number of connections </strong>&mdash; You should seek out a VPN that offers multiple simultaneous connections, so you can stay protected on all your devices at the same time. This is also beneficial for large families or households with multiple people likely to be online at the same time.</p></li><li><p><strong>Privacy policy </strong>&mdash; The best VPNs should be very clear about how they handle, store, and use your data. These practices should be laid out in a privacy policy, and if they aren't super clear, you should look elsewhere.</p></li><li><p><strong>Server network </strong>&mdash; The best VPNs provide access to thousands of servers located all around the world. This is useful as you should always be able to find a stable and speedy connection for <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-streaming-movies-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>streaming</u></a>, shopping, or browsing.</p></li></ul><p>There are plenty of other things that are worth considering, like bandwidth, apps for certain operating systems, and customer support, but these are probably the most important features to keep in mind.</p><h2>Should you use free VPNs?</h2><p>With free versions of popular VPNs and free trials of VPNs with full access to everything you get with a premium plan, why would you ever pay? As with most things in life, you get what you pay for with VPNs. </p><p>There tends to always be a catch with free versions, and it's normally in the form of limited data usage. If you're just an occasional user, these plans will work fine. But if you're going to be streaming or downloading, this isn't going to work.

<h2>What is Connections?</h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <a class="text-gray-600" href="https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1679674590203723778?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(opens in a new window)">

    </a>
</blockquote>
<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. Like <em>Wordle, </em>you can share the results with your friends on social media.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2><strong>iPhone 16 vs. iPhone 16 Pro: Screen size and display</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>There&rsquo;s always been a difference in display when it comes to the baseline iPhones and their Pro peers, but display sizes have matched. This time, the iPhone 16 Pro will have an edge over the iPhone 16.&nbsp;</p><p>The iPhone 16 brings the same 6.1&#8209;inch (2,556 x 1,179 resolution) OLED display from last year, but the iPhone 16 Pro sports a 6.3&#8209;inch (2,622 x 1,206 resolution) OLED display &mdash; 0.2 inches more than the iPhone 15 Pro. <br><br>That&rsquo;s not all, as both models will come with thinner borders around the display, offering more display real estate. Both models bring a more efficient OLED display, too, with brighter micro-lens technology. <br><br>You can also expect the iPhone 16 Pro to come equipped with a 120Hz refresh rate and Always-On display, which the iPhone 16 (once again) misses out on. </p><p>While both offer 2,000 nits of peak brightness, the iPhone 16 Pro offers 1,200 nits of typical SDR brightness, while the iPhone 16 sticks with its 1,000 nits.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>iPhone 16 vs. iPhone 16 Pro: Design&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Bar the increase in size, the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro look more alike than ever before, until you turn them over to see their rear camera design. The Pro models have the extra telephoto lens as usual, placed in a diagonal design, but the iPhone 16 is now going back to its iPhone 12 roots with a vertical camera layout.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Otherwise, these phones offer the same design traits. The iPhone 16 now comes equipped with an Action Button rather than the typical Ring/Silent switch, just like last year&rsquo;s Pro model. And the iPhone 16 lineup has an all-new Camera Control button. Placed right below the Power button, it acts as a shutter button, can zoom in and out of photos or videos with swiping gestures, and lets you focus on specific subjects.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Of course, the iPhone 16 Pro delivers its titanium finish while the iPhone 16 offers a lighter aerospace aluminum finish with a color-infused cover glass.

<p>The iPhone 16 shows the base iPhone models are catching up to the Pro models fast, but the iPhone 16 Pro is now slightly bigger and still retains its usual camera layout.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>iPhone 16 vs. iPhone 16 Pro: Performance</strong></h2><p>Apple decided to bring the iPhone 16 up to speed by skipping a generation so it could match the iPhone 16 Pro&rsquo;s power, as both will have an A18 Bionic chip under the hood. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">
    <div class="flex justify-center">

<p>To set itself apart, though, the iPhone 16 Pro will get the A18 Pro chip, which comes with a 16-core Neural Engine. This is 15% faster than on the A17 Pro chip. Plus, there's a 6-core GPU, for even greater-looking games and graphics. </p><p>Based on TSMC&rsquo;s enhanced 3nm process, the A18 comes with more Neural Engine core to support Apple Intelligence, meaning it has more processing power to handle new AI features coming to both models. Each year, Apple ups the ante with its A-series chips, so it&rsquo;s clear that the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro will outshine last-gen processors.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, the iPhone 16 Pro comes Wi-Fi 7 connectivity, offering even faster internet speeds. The iPhone 16 will stick with Wi-Fi 6E. <br><br>Either way, despite an extra helping of GPU cores, the iPhone 16 and 16 Pro should offer the lightning-fast performance we&rsquo;ve come to expect with each annual release, with the former getting an even bigger upgrade compared to last year.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>iPhone 16 vs. iPhone 16 Pro: Battery life</strong></h2><p>It&rsquo;s upgrades all around in the battery department, as both the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro come with increased battery capacities and charging speeds. While the Pro model offers slightly more space, it isn&rsquo;t by much.</p><p>The iPhone 16 is set to offer up to 22 hours of battery life, while the iPhone 16 Pro offers up to 27 hours. Generally, they can both last a full day before needing a charge, but the Pro can last a little longer.&nbsp;</p><p>For even more battery, however, you&rsquo;ll have to look to the iPhone 16 Plus and iPhone 16 Pro Max.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>iPhone 16 vs. iPhone 16 Pro: Cameras</strong></h2><p>This is where the iPhone 16 Pro comes into its own. Allow me to list the specs:</p><ul><li><p><strong>48MP wide (upgraded Fusion camera)</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>48MP ultra-wide </strong></p></li><li><p><strong>12MP 5x Telephoto </strong></p></li><li><p><strong>12MP selfie camera</strong></p></li></ul><p>And here's what the iPhone 16 has to offer:</p><ul><li><p><strong>48MP wide (fusion with 12MP 2x Telephoto)</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>12MP ultra-wide</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>No telephoto</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>12MP selfie camera</strong></p></li></ul><p>While the iPhone 16 carries over the impressive 48MP wide camera and will feature a 12MP ultra-wide with autofocus to handle low-light photography better and offers macro photography, the iPhone 16 Pro steps up by bringing an improved 48MP ultra-wide for enhanced image quality.&nbsp;What's more, you can also expect to use Spatial Capture in the iPhone 16, too.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Moreover, the iPhone 16 Pro will take the tetraprism telephoto that was exclusive to the iPhone 15 Pro Max, increasing optical zoom from 3x to 5x and up to 25x digital zoom. As for video, you can expect 4K at 120 frames per second, making Cinematic Mode even better in slow motion with greater details and colors. </p><p>All in all, you can expect ultra-wide shots to take in the scenery with finer detail, an increase in light capture for more natural-looking shots, and less lens flares and ghosting issues thanks to the added anti-reflective coating on the Pro model&rsquo;s cameras.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>iPhone 16 vs. iPhone 16 Pro: Software and AI</strong></h2><p>The biggest feature that the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro have in common is they are both backed by Apple Intelligence. It&rsquo;s the tech giant&rsquo;s own stamp on AI, and it brings new features that are exclusive to the latest lineup of iPhones.</p><p>We&rsquo;ve had a sneak peek at what Apple&rsquo;s AI can do at <a href="https://mashable.com/article/wwdc-2024-everything-apple-announced" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>WWDC 2024</u></a>, including prioritized notifications, which can put the most important notifications at the top of your iPhone&rsquo;s feed and even offer brief summaries of stacked notifications. There&rsquo;s a lot more on offer, such as the ability to rewrite, summarize, and proof blocks of selected text, automatic audio transcriptions, and AI image generation and easy image search by typing a description. </p><p>Plus, there's Private Cloud Compute, protecting your personal information any time you access Apple Intelligence. Basically, your data is never stored. </p><p>All iPhone 16 models will harness the power of Apple Intelligence, including being able to create your own emojis with <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-wwdc-keynote-2024-genmoji" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Genmoji</u></a>.</p><h2><strong>iPhone 16 vs. iPhone 16 Pro: Which is right for you?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>It&rsquo;s hard to tell which iPhone 16 model offers more bang for your buck without real-world use, but it seems the base iPhone 16 has a lot going for it considering its price. It may lose out on the bigger display, A18 Pro chip, and upgraded ultra-wide lens that the iPhone 16 Pro boasts, but this year&rsquo;s &ldquo;regular&rdquo; iPhone is more Pro than ever.&nbsp;</p><p>With the same Action and Camera Control buttons, A18-type chip, upgraded battery life, and perks with Apple Intelligence, the iPhone 16 doesn&rsquo;t look to miss out on much of what the iPhone 16 Pro has to offer.&nbsp;</p><p>It&rsquo;s still early days, so in the meantime, check out everything else announced at the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-september-event-what-to-expect-2024-iphone-16" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Apple September event</u></a>, including a new <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-watch-series-10-sleep-apnea-health-monitor-announced" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple Watch Series 10</a>, AirPods 4, and more.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Mashable's currently on the ground in Cupertino for the&nbsp;<a href="https://mashable.com/article/iphone-16-event-confirmed" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Sept. 9 "Glowtime" Apple event.</a></em><em>&nbsp;Check out our&nbsp;<a href="https://mashable.com/live/apple-event-september-2024-live" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">live blog</a></em><em>&nbsp;to keep track of all things&nbsp;<a href="https://mashable.com/article/iphone-16-rumors" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">iPhone 16</a></em><em>&nbsp;before, during, and after the event.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

Now that <a href="https://mashable.com/category/google" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Google</a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/category/apple" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple</a> have released their flagship phones for 2024, it's time to compare them.</p><p>The iPhone 16 and Pixel 9 are both officially here. Since they're technically competitors, let's have a little competition. Which of these phones is better? Is it the ever-reliable iOS device or the one made by the folks who developed Android? </p><p>Let's find out together.</p><h2><strong>iPhone 16 vs. Pixel 9: Price and specs</strong></h2><p>In terms of basic specs, here's what you get from the $799 Google Pixel 9:</p><ul><li><p><strong>6.3-inch display</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Google Tensor G4 chip</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>12GB RAM</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>128GB/256GB Storage</strong></p></li></ul><p>And here's what you get from the $799 iPhone 16:</p><ul><li><p><strong>6.1-inch display</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Apple A18 Bionic chip</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>128GB/256GB/512GB storage</strong></p></li></ul><p>Both phones have the same price, which makes this part easy. The main differences in this category are display size and storage. The Pixel 9 is 0.2 inches larger, but the iPhone 16 offers an additional 512GB storage option the Pixel 9 doesn't have. Frustratingly, <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-16/specs/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple's spec sheet</a> doesn't specify how much RAM the iPhone 16 has, so it's hard to compare the two phones in that regard.</p><h2><strong>iPhone 16 vs. Pixel 9: Design</strong></h2><p>Design-wise, Google did some work on the Pixel 9 that may or may not work for you. Simply put, Google flattened all the edges so that the phone doesn't have the same natural grip that the Pixel 8 provided with its rounded edges. The camera bar, which used to run horizontally across the entire back of the phone, is now a floating camera box, too. The color choices are solid, though: <a href="https://mashable.com/article/pixel-9-pink-google-pixel-event-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Peony (pink!)</a>, Obsidian, Wintergreen, and Porcelain.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

            Google Pixel 9 review: Officially too much AI

        </a>
    </div>
<p>The iPhone 16 doesn't significantly change from previous models. The camera bar on the back is vertically oriented, and the sides appear to be flat (or flat-ish) like the Pixel 9, which is unfortunate for those of us who prefer curved edges. The most important thing is that Apple finally added a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/iphone-16-colors-hot-pink" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">pink colorway for the iPhone 16</a>, joining black, white, teal, and ultramarine as the available colors. </p><h2><strong>iPhone 16 vs. Pixel 9: Display</strong></h2><p>The Pixel 9 has an excellent display for a phone in its price range. The 6.3-inch screen's refresh rate is adaptive between 60 and 120Hz, giving it a premium level of smoothness. The 2,700 nits of peak brightness also make the Pixel 9 fantastic for use in broad daylight. </p><p>We've already established that the iPhone 16's display is 0.2 inches smaller than the Pixel 9's. It also has a couple of other disadvantages worth noting. For starters, Apple's 2,000 nits of peak brightness pale in comparison to Google's 2,700 nits, so the Pixel 9 <em>should</em> be a better phone to use in direct sunlight. Additionally, the iPhone 16 is still stuck at a 60Hz refresh rate. The Pixel 9, meanwhile, can go all the way up to 120Hz. </p><p>The main benefit to buying an iPhone display-wise is the presence of Dynamic Island, the little oval-shaped guy at the top of the screen that can expand or change shape to serve various needs. Other than that, Google's display has better specs overall.</p><h2><strong>iPhone 16 vs. Pixel 9: Features</strong></h2><p>Listing all of the little feature differences between iOS and Android would take forever; frankly, you might know the main ones anyway. Green text bubbles vs. blue ones, etc. You get it. </p><p>Rather than focusing on OS-level differences, it makes more sense to worry about AI features. Both of these phones are&nbsp;<em>heavy</em>&nbsp;on AI parlor tricks of varying&nbsp;usefulness. The Pixel 9 can summarize emails, generate text messages, create photos from thin air using the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/pixel-studio-google-event-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Pixel Studio</a> app, create group photos that never happened using the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/add-me-google-pixel-event-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Add Me</a> feature, and carry on human-like conversations using <a href="https://mashable.com/article/gemini-live-hands-on" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Gemini Live.</a> </p><p>Apple's suite of AI features is...very similar to Google's. Apple Intelligence allows you to generate images on the fly with Image Playground, summarize and transcribe audio recordings, summarize emails and notifications, and even create new emoji on the fly. Google doesn't let you create custom emoji, but most of those other things are also present on Pixel 9. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

    </div>
<p>The only problem is that Apple isn't rolling them all out at the iPhone 16 launch; many Apple Intelligence features are slowly rolling out in beta form after launch instead.</p><h2><strong>iPhone 16 vs. Pixel 9: Camera</strong></h2><p>As always, the Pixel 9 has a really solid camera setup. Here are the specs:</p><ul><li><p><strong>50MP wide lens</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>48MP ultra-wide lens</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>10.5MP selfie lens</strong></p></li></ul><p>Those specs are bolstered by Google's photographic tricks, some of which rely on years-old software tricks, while others use newer generative AI. You can use the Magic Editor to quickly and easily alter photos, try Add Me to put yourself into a group photo you had to take yourself, and even <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-reimagine-pixel-event-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">turn roads into rivers</a>. The Pixel Screenshots app is legitimately useful, acting as a searchable database of every screenshot on your Pixel phone.</p><p>As usual, the base-level iPhone has two rear cameras and a selfie cam. Here are the specs:</p><ul><li><p><strong>48MP wide lens</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>12MP ultra-wide lens</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>12MP selfie lens</strong></p></li></ul><p>Without testing the iPhone 16 cameras out first, we can't definitively say which set of lenses is better than the other yet. But it's worth noting that iPhone 16 lets you record spatial videos and pictures for <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-vision-pro" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple Vision Pro</a>, and Pixel 9 can't do that.</p><h2><strong>iPhone 16 vs. Pixel 9: Battery</strong></h2><p>Using our standard test (looping a TikTok video on the phone's screen at 50 percent brightness until the battery runs out), the Pixel 9 got 19 hours and 20 minutes of juice. That's incredible and is better than the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-pixel-9-pro-xl-battery-life" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>. </p><p>We don't know how long the iPhone 16 lasts on a single charge yet (and we don't want to give you the manufacturer's claims), so just wait for our in-house testing. We'll update this piece once we get the official battery runtime for the iPhone 16.</p><h2><strong>iPhone 16 vs. Pixel 9: Which is best?</strong></h2><p>Without direct testing, we can't render a verdict here. </p><p>However, as always, you know your own needs better than anyone. Do you have a social circle that would judge you for having green text bubbles? Get the iPhone 16. Do you prefer the openness of Android or generally have problems with the Apple ecosystem? Get the Pixel 9. </p><p><em>Mashable's currently on the ground in Cupertino for the&nbsp;<a href="https://mashable.com/article/iphone-16-event-confirmed" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Sept. 9 "Glowtime" Apple event.</a></em><em>&nbsp;Check out our&nbsp;<a href="https://mashable.com/live/apple-event-september-2024-live" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">live blog</a></em><em>&nbsp;to keep track of all things&nbsp;<a href="https://mashable.com/article/iphone-16-rumors" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">iPhone 16</a></em><em>&nbsp;before, during, and after the event.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Now, here are the iPhone 15's specs:</p><ul><li><p>A16 Bionic chip</p></li><li><p>6.1&#8209;inch, 60Hz,  2,556 x 1,179-pixel, OLED display</p></li><li><p>128G, 256GB, or 512GB storage</p></li><li><p>Up to 20 hours (video playback) battery</p></li><li><p>IP68 rating</p></li></ul><p>Apart from their chips, batteries, and memory, there are too many glaring changes. But that&rsquo;s doing the iPhone 16 an injustice, as the subtle improvements offer more processing power and longer battery life. Moreover, a few more traits are trickling down from the previous Pro models to the iPhone 16 that the iPhone 15 missed out on.</p><h2><strong>iPhone 16 vs. iPhone 15: Display</strong></h2><p>Like the size of the iPhone 15&rsquo;s 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR (2,556 x 1,179 resolution) OLED display? You&rsquo;ll be happy to know the iPhone 16 is sticking with the exact same size, along with a few other specs that many hoped to see improved.<br><br>This includes the 60Hz refresh rate, which is a shame to see since its competitors&rsquo; base flagship smartphones have now upgraded to a 120Hz display. Onscreen visual appeal isn&rsquo;t as smooth, so you&rsquo;ll have to look at the iPhone 16 Pro models for a stutter-free experience.&nbsp;</p><p>There&rsquo;s also the same 2,000 nits of peak brightness and Dynamic Island as per last-gen models.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p><br>Still no always-on display, though, meaning Apple&rsquo;s StandBy feature is still fairly useless unless you have one of the Pro models.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>iPhone 16 vs. iPhone 15: Design</strong></h2><p>Apple already pulled off a minor redesign with its iPhone 15, bringing its <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-iphone-15-dynamic-island-standard" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Dynamic Island</a> over to the &ldquo;regular&rdquo; iPhone models. However, we also saw more rounded edges and aerospace aluminium color-infused glass. This time, the iPhone 16 sticks with this motif, but brings other features from its Pro model siblings and an all-new button. </p><p></p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Instead of the usual Ring/Silent switch, Apple decided to put the Action button in its place. Going forward, we&rsquo;re likely to see the Action button as a staple on all iPhone models, which is ideal news if you enjoy being able to customize any action with one simple press.&nbsp;</p><p>Interestingly, Apple introduced another handy button to mess around with: the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/iphone-16-capture-button-details-apple-event-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Camera Control button</a>. Placed right under the Power button, this focuses on helping to access camera features on the iPhone 16. Not only can it activate the shutter so you can snap away, but it can also zoom in and out of photos or videos with swiping gestures and allows you to focus on subjects. This will come in handy for the snap-happy ones out there.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>You may have noticed the rear cameras are now aligned vertically on the iPhone 16, rather than diagonally as with the iPhone 15. It&rsquo;s <em>almost </em>as if Apple is reintroducing the design of the iPhone 12, with a few modern design traits as previously mentioned.&nbsp;</p><p>As for colors, the iPhone 16 comes in the following: Ultramarine, Teal, Pink, White, and Black. A couple more than the iPhone 15&rsquo;s color options, which include Black, Blue, Green, Yellow, and Pink. </p><h2><strong>iPhone 16 vs. iPhone 15: Performance</strong></h2><p>The iPhone lineup gets more powerful with each annual release, and that&rsquo;s no different with the iPhone 16. Instead of the trickle-down effect of getting last year&rsquo;s iPhone 15 Pro chipset, the iPhone 16 models will get their very own A18 Bionic chip.&nbsp;</p><p>It goes without saying that this is a step up from the iPhone 15&rsquo;s A16 processor, which is already one of the fastest chips on the market. With the A18, there&rsquo;s even more processing power to play around with, and this will come in handy with Apple Intelligence now in play (more of this later).&nbsp;With a 6-core CPU, it is 30% faster than the iPhone 15 and uses 30% less power. There's also a 5-core GPU for 40% faster efficiency. </p><p>To support Apple&rsquo;s AI, the iPhone 16 also supports more cores in its Neural Engine, with the iPhone 15 sporting a 16-core Neural Engine. Suffice it to say, the iPhone 16 will be yet another blazing-fast smartphone that tops its predecessor.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>iPhone 16 vs. iPhone 15: Battery life</strong></h2><p>We&rsquo;re finally getting a notable bump in battery life with the iPhone 16, as it brings a bigger battery capacity and faster charging speeds compared to the iPhone 15. Not that it&rsquo;s exactly needed; the iPhone 15 is rated at 20 hours, so around a full day of use.&nbsp;</p><p>With the iPhone 16, that number is set to go up. It&rsquo;s equipped with a bigger battery, and this boost should bring around 22 hours, which is a nice improvement to see especially compared to the iPhone 15. It&rsquo;s also nearly double the speeds, as the last-gen phone has 27W wired charging and 15W wireless.&nbsp;</p><p>Not a major boost, but enough to eke out an extra couple of hours before needing to be plugged in. And yes, it&rsquo;s still through the universally favored USB-C port.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>iPhone 16 vs. iPhone 15: Cameras</strong></h2><p>Here's a quick look at the iPhone 16's specs</p><ul><li><p>Rear camera: 48MP main (fusion with 12MP 2x Telephoto), 12MP ultra-wide</p></li><li><p>12MP TrueDepth front camera</p></li></ul><p>Now take a look at the iPhone 15's specs:</p><ul><li><p>Rear camera: 48MP main, 12MP ultra-wide</p></li><li><p>12MP TrueDepth front camera</p></li></ul><p>The iPhone 15 models already received a worthwhile camera upgrade, which includes a 48MP with &fnof;/1.6 aperture.</p><p>This iPhone 16 follows this trend, but this time it arrives with a 12MP ultra-wide with &fnof;/2.2 aperture and autofocus for improved low-light photography.&nbsp;This will put the ultra-wide lens to good use, as the iPhone 15&rsquo;s &fnof;/2.4 ultra-wide often blurred pictures, especially in low-light conditions. </p><p>That&rsquo;s not all that&rsquo;s changed; we can also expect macro photography support, giving close-up snaps more detail than the last-gen iPhone.&nbsp;Otherwise, it's the same capable dual-camera system that the iPhone 15 presented, now with some fine-tuning in the iPhone 16. </p><h2><strong>iPhone 16 vs. iPhone 15: Software and AI</strong></h2><p>Arguably the biggest difference between the iPhone 16 and iPhone 15 is being able to utilize Apple Intelligence, the tech giant&rsquo;s very own security-focused generative AI (with the help of ChatGPT). Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s only reserved for the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max</u></a> and later with an <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ios-18-1-clean-up-tool" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">iOS 18 update</a>.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot on offer here, and that&rsquo;s where the iPhone 15 will struggle to keep up. Until they&rsquo;ve been used in the wild for a while, though, there&rsquo;s no telling if these Apple Intelligence features will be a defining reason to upgrade to an iPhone 16.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>iPhone 16 vs. iPhone 15: Worth the upgrade?</strong></h2><p>With the iPhone 16, Apple not only brings a few Pro features to its baseline iPhone models, but it also introduces its own brand of generative AI. Minor hardware differences aside, which now include an Action button, a new Camera Control button, a bigger battery, and vertical rear cameras, the real reason to upgrade to an iPhone 16 is to utilize everything Apple Intelligence brings to the table.&nbsp;</p><p>Sure, it isn&rsquo;t as if you can&rsquo;t use AI features by simply visiting ChatGPT on your browser, but having it fully integrated into the iPhone 16&rsquo;s software can offer new ways to interact with your smartphone. </p><p>Will Apple Intelligence be the next big reason to get the latest iPhone? It&rsquo;s hard to tell, but so far the iPhone 16 looks to impress &mdash; especially since there&rsquo;s no bump in price.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Mashable's currently on the ground in Cupertino for the&nbsp;<a href="https://mashable.com/article/iphone-16-event-confirmed" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Sept. 9 "Glowtime" Apple event.</a></em><em>&nbsp;Check out our&nbsp;<a href="https://mashable.com/live/apple-event-september-2024-live" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">live blog</a></em><em>&nbsp;to keep track of all things&nbsp;<a href="https://mashable.com/article/iphone-16-rumors" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">iPhone 16</a></em><em>&nbsp;(and more) before, during, and after the event.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>We've broken down each end credits Easter egg below (we'll keep updating this story as each new episode drops).</p><h2>Episode 1, "Once Upon a Time in the West"</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">
    <div class="flex justify-center">
                    <img class="border border-gray-100" src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/02rPqrFsaW8cbpvCke14KW6/images-1.fill.size_2000x1126.v1725027429.jpg" alt="Two men and a woman stand in front of a giant movie poster while a photographer takes photos of them." width="2000" height="1126" loading="lazy" srcset="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/02rPqrFsaW8cbpvCke14KW6/images-1.fill.size_800x450.v1725027429.jpg 800w, https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/02rPqrFsaW8cbpvCke14KW6/images-1.fill.size_1400x788.v1725027429.jpg 1400w, https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/02rPqrFsaW8cbpvCke14KW6/images-1.fill.size_2000x1126.v1725027429.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px">

<p>The image on the left, a green box of premium quality "Olde Belgium" lager, is actually a throwback to <a href="https://mashable.com/article/only-murders-in-the-building-season-3-ending-explainer" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">the end of Season 3</a>. This is the case of beer that Sazz (Jane Lynch) brings to Charles (Steve Martin), shortly before she's killed. "I got a cold case for ya," says Sazz, but Charles suggests fetching the 1966 Argentinian Malbec from his apartment instead. If only they'd stuck to lager.</p><p>The second image is a mockup poster of the apparently upcoming <em>Only Murders in the Building</em> movie adaptation, complete with the names of the core cast &mdash; Eugene Levy, Eva Longoria, and Zach Galifianakis &mdash; and a line promising the film will be "only in theaters this Christmas".</p><h2>Episode 2, "Gates of Heaven"</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">
    <div class="flex justify-center">
                    <img class="border border-gray-100" src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/02rPqrFsaW8cbpvCke14KW6/images-2.fill.size_2000x1126.v1725893468.jpg" alt="A man stands in a bathroom, with a miniature pig visible in the bathtub." width="2000" height="1126" loading="lazy" srcset="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/02rPqrFsaW8cbpvCke14KW6/images-2.fill.size_800x450.v1725893468.jpg 800w, https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/02rPqrFsaW8cbpvCke14KW6/images-2.fill.size_1400x788.v1725893468.jpg 1400w, https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/02rPqrFsaW8cbpvCke14KW6/images-2.fill.size_2000x1126.v1725893468.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1408px) 100vw, 1408px">


            </div>

            <span class="normal-case text-gray-1000"></span>

<p>On the left we have the small pig that Oliver (Martin Short) and Mabel (Selena Gomez) discover in the bathroom of the abandoned apartment opposite Charles' &mdash; in the West tower. This appears to have been the place where the killer sniped Sazz from, so we're guessing the pig will surely be significant down the line? We don't know who exactly it belongs to, but it makes a grunting bid for freedom at the end of the episode when it flees through the apartment's open door.</p><p>On the right are some playing cards, presumably representing the game of "Oh Hell" that Oliver and Mabel play with "the sauce family" who live opposite Charles. Could the game itself be some kind of clue? It could also represent the poker game Sazz set up for Charles on set of <em>Brazzos</em> back in the day, described in a moving moment in the episode as the time Sazz "found friends" for the lonely star of the show. </p><h2>Episode 3, "Two for the Road"</h2><p>Of course, the object on the left is a ham radio. These radios play a key roll in episode 3, with Mabel, Oliver, and Charles finally going some way to revealing their mystery right before the end credits. "Howard [Morris, Michael Cyril Creighton's character] was clocking the same song on the radio," says Oliver, after he and Mabel break into an impromptu rendition of the theme tune for 1986 sitcom <em>Perfect Strangers</em>. "Yes, a person came on the line and said, 'Meet me at 445.'"</p><p>The group quickly works out that this is a frequency, but when they tune into it they receive a cold warning. "You shouldn't be on this frequency," says the strange voice that responds. "The last person who came around asking these questions got killed."</p><p>The object on the right is less mysterious. It's a screenshot of a web search for "squatters rights NYC", with the following sentence highlighted: "a squatter can be considered a legal tenant in as little as 30 days." This is a callback to Mabel's plan to stay in the abandoned apartment in the West tower of The Arconia, now that she doesn't have her own place.</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/X12GY?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3B%3Btemplate=video&amp%3B%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3B%3Belement=offer&amp%3B%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3B%3Belement_label=Only%20Murders%20in%20the%20Building%20Season%204%20premieres%20Aug.%2027%20on%20Hulu.&amp%3B%3Bobject_type=video&amp%3B%3Bobject_uuid=01avamREqerlPJZ2DpxAq3o&amp%3B%3Bshort_url=X12GY&amp%3B%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Fvideo%2Fonly-murders-in-the-building-season-4-trailer&amp%3Btemplate=article&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=Only%20Murders%20in%20the%20Building%20Season%204%20premieres%20Aug.%2027%20on%20Hulu%2C%20with%20a%20new%20episode%20every%20Tuesday.&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=03kIH1o8AQRvvRmIks52UVz&amp%3Bshort_url=X12GY&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Fonly-murders-in-the-building-season-4-review&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Only%20Murders%20in%20the%20Building%20Season%204%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Hulu%2C%20with%20a%20new%20episode%20every%20Tuesday.&object_type=article&object_uuid=02rPqrFsaW8cbpvCke14KW6&short_url=X12GY&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Only Murders in the Building </em>Season 4 is now streaming on Hulu, with a new episode every Tuesday.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The iPhone 16 lineup introduces a game-changing Camera Control button, positioned just below the power button on the bottom-right side. It acts like a DSLR shutter and offers haptic feedback for a more tactile shooting experience. A light press activates autofocus, while a harder press snaps a picture. </p><p>The Camera Control button provides responsive haptic feedback, simulating the feel of a camera shutter with each interaction. This tactile response makes shooting more intuitive and precise. A light press also activates a clean, streamlined overlay, giving quick access to essential camera settings without overwhelming the screen &mdash; allowing you to focus on the moment you&rsquo;re capturing.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

Then the woefully overstuffed and underwhelming <em>If</em>, from John Krasinski, had another grieving young heroine coping with her emotions through rescuing abandoned imaginary friends (or IFs).&nbsp;</p><p>All this means <em>Sketch </em>comes into a crowded field. And yet this inventive indie with a similar setup spins a wondrous and wacky story all its own.&nbsp;</p><p>The feature directorial debut of Seth Worley, <em>Sketch </em>centers on the Wyatts, who are struggling to process their pain in the wake of their mother's death. Widowed dad Taylor (<a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-decameron-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>The Decameron</u></em></a>'s Tony Hale) strives to be upbeat, tucking away mementos of the kids' mum as if that'll hide away the agony. Eldest child Jack (Kue Lawrence) follows his father's lead, determined that a good attitude can fix any problem. Meanwhile, 11-year-old Amber (Bianca Belle) is filled with rage, which spills out in a sketchbook where she scribbles vicious monsters in violent scenarios. But when a bit of magic brings these creations to life, the family must face their hurt head-on and team up to save the day from these creative manifestations of mourning.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Bringing together a strong, kid-friendly premise and a deeply crafty sensibility, Worley builds a visual world of imagination and emotion that's a twisted pleasure to visit.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Sketch </em>dazzles with its distinctive design.&nbsp;</h2><p>Forget glorious hand-drawn animation or a cavalcade of balloon-like CGI cartoons. Worley, who has a background as a visual effects artist, uses computer graphics to create a sublimely hand-drawn feel by building Amber's beasts <em>as </em>they are drawn. Think creatures fully fleshed-out but made of scribbles, their limbs wiry and a little bit wrong, their mouths spewing glitter, their tracks leaving splotches of color behind. With textures of waxy crayon, slippery marker streaks, and stippled chalk, these are monsters unlike any we've seen in movies before. They are monsters you'd see in a kid's doodles, complete with googly eyes, glitter flourishes, crooked fangs, and a thirst for blood.&nbsp;</p><p>Unbridled joy bursts forth from even <em>Sketch</em>'s most suspenseful action scenes, because of the delightful absurdity of these designs. They're creepy but not outright scary, making this a sensational movie for kids who are beginning to get into horror but aren't ready to go to sleep with goosebumps. Actually <em>Sketch </em>has a very <em>Goosebumps </em>vibe, from its playful score to its colorfully creepy world and child heroes, who are sharply drawn.&nbsp;</p><p>Behind his can-do attitude, Jack carries a heavy self-imposed burden that makes him fiercely protective of his sister. He's not afraid to call a kid a "b-hole" if he has it coming! Amber wears a furrowed brow, but her eyes glow bright when she's talking about her drawings &mdash; even the grisliest ones. The siblings' reluctant sidekick in this spirited adventure is classmate Bowman (Kalon Cox), a big mouth who is 95 percent bad impulses and 5 percent goofball. Clamoring for creative solutions to the very creative problem of rampaging drawings, they'll grab water guns and other improvisational weapons. But their greatest tool is their chaotic chemistry. When they collide, sparks fly &mdash; as well as juvenile insults &mdash; and it's <em>Goonies-</em>style drama, alive with silliness.&nbsp;</p><h2>Tony Hale and D'Arcy Carden lend stellar support.&nbsp;</h2><p>Hale has been a supreme supporting player on everything from <em>Arrested Development </em>to <em>VEEP, The Decameron, <a href="https://mashable.com/video/inside-out-2-tony-hale-lewis-black" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Inside Out 2</u></a></em><em>, Toy Story 4, </em>and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/hocus-pocus-2-caramel-apple" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Hocus Pocus 2</u></em></a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/hocus-pocus-2-caramel-apple" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>.</u></a> But here, he's far less of a buffoon. Worley, who also scripted <em>Sketch, </em>which Hale produced, gives the celebrated "that guy" a role that's a bit more grounded. With a warm but not comically broad smile, Hale swiftly establishes Taylor as a devoted dad. There'll be moments of frustration and even moments when he's not mad &mdash; say it with me &mdash;&nbsp;he's just <em>disappointed</em>. And these hit home because Hale's performance walks the line between family-friendly broad comedy and tender family drama. When an eager Amber shows off her drawings of vicious birds atop a pile of bodies, Hale's expression is a look of mingled pride and revulsion that deftly establishes this strong but straining father-daughter bond. He marvels at her, even as he's a bit freaked out by her potential.&nbsp;</p><p>Playing Taylor's sister Liz, D'Arcy Carden, the Emmy-winning Janet of <em>The Good Place</em>, gives off major "cool aunt vibes" from the moment she swaggers onto scene, ready to throw her skills as a real estate agent toward helping this family move on (or at least move out of the family home). Alternatively dishing out tough love to her brother (wanted or not) and marveling over her niece's dangerous creativity ("I love her brain!"), Liz provides a path forward for a family so lost in grief they've forgotten how to talk to each other. But as emotional as this movie can be &mdash; with maybe one too many stops in the action to discuss feelings &mdash;&nbsp; it is above all things funny and joyful.&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, there's talk of death, and grief, and deadly monsters, and multiple scenes where children are fleeing for their lives. But laced throughout is a vibrant thread of humor that celebrates the messiness of family, being young, and being hurt, and it exists without mocking its characters. These wonderfully entertaining bits make up for a third act that gets a bit clunky. Comedy comes from the understandably exasperated look of a dad whose last nerve is fraying, from the little girl whose defiant backtalk is vexingly silly, from the squabbling of kids that is as frenzied as it can be outrageous.&nbsp;</p><p>Worley doesn't just keep things light to keep <em>Sketch </em>as appropriate for kids as it is for parents (something Krasinski did <em>not </em>manage). This tone, mixing horrific elements with delightful ones, underscores the very message of the movie: that life <em>is </em>both, and ignoring one won't make it go away&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;quite the opposite, actually!&nbsp;</p><p>In the end, <em>Sketch </em>is a fantastically fun and heartwarming movie with a slathering of weird that makes it a real treat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>Sketch </em>was reviewed out of its World Premiere at the 2024 Toronto International Film Festival.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            Apple Event 2024: Everything announced, including iPhone 16, Apple Watch Series 10
            <svg class="inline-block ml-1 w-4 h-4 font-normal fill-current"><use href="https://mashable.com/images/icons/spritemap.svg#sprite-arrow-right-thin"></use></svg>

<p>Beta testers have been able to try out most of these features for some time now &mdash; but with a public release, you'll finally get them for yourself. Here&rsquo;s what you need to know.</p><h2>iOS 18 release date</h2><p>Apple always releases new versions of iOS alongside its new iPhones &mdash; and outside of the beta testing program, you can download and install <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ios-18-public-beta-5-most-useful-features" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">iOS 18</a> for yourself on Sept. 16, a few days before the new iPhones are released on Sept. 20.</p><p>When you do, though, it won&rsquo;t offer&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;of the features that Apple announced in June. Some smart home features, for example, are reserved for iOS 18.1, which doesn&rsquo;t have an official release date yet, so you&rsquo;ll have to wait a little to try it out. Then, there&rsquo;s Apple Intelligence, which has its own release timeline. </p><h2>What&rsquo;s new in iOS 18?</h2><p>iOS 18 brings with it a series of great new features. Many of these relate to customization, allowing users to personalize their devices.</p><p>Apart from Apple Intelligence, perhaps the headline feature is one that ex-Android users have been asking for&mdash;a more customizable Home Screen. With iOS 18, you&rsquo;ll be able to place apps wherever you want on the screen (within the grid, of course) instead of having them arranged from left to right, top to bottom, at all times. Additionally, you can set new Dark and Tinted Home Screen options, which bring different colors to your Home Screen wallpaper and apps.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

        </a>
    </div>
<p>The Control Center is also becoming more customizable. In iOS 18, you can create and customize multiple pages of the Control Center and more easily place and resize your existing controls. So, you could have a whole page dedicated to smart home controls, or you could place only the controls you care about on one screen in the exact position that works for you.</p><p>Plenty of Apple&rsquo;s first-party apps are getting new features as well. iMessage will let you use any emoji as a Tapback reaction, and you&rsquo;ll be able to format text with underlines and italics &mdash; not to mention RCS support, which brings better cross-platform messaging. The Photos app is getting an all-new single-page design, and you&rsquo;ll now be able to lock apps behind Face ID &mdash; so you can better secure sensitive information. Lastly, passwords are moving out of the Settings app and into their own Passwords app.</p><div id="related-video" class="mx-auto mt-8 mb-12 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans md:mt-12 md:mb-16 text-primary-400">

<h2>Apple Intelligence</h2><p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-intelligence-outside-us" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple Intelligence</a> is perhaps the most important "feature" of iOS 18. It is just the name that Apple calls its bundle of new AI features. Unfortunately, accessing these features isn&rsquo;t&nbsp;<em>quite</em>&nbsp;as simple as&nbsp;downloading iOS 18. The very <em>first</em> Apple Intelligence features won&rsquo;t be available until iOS 18.1, which is expected sometime towards the end of October, based on previous iOS iterations.&nbsp;</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

        </a>
    </div>
<p>Even when iOS 18.1&nbsp;is&nbsp;released, it won&rsquo;t have all of the Apple Intelligence features that Apple announced in June. The currently available beta version of iOS 18.1 has new writing tools that can generate and summarize text, suggested replies in Messages, phone call recording and transcripts, and notification summaries for both the Messages and Mail apps. These features will almost certainly be available in iOS 18.1, unless Apple runs into a hitch and decides to pull them, which is unlikely.</p><p>There are features that no one outside of Apple has tested yet, but these will likely be held until a later iOS 18 release. These features include some headliners, like Image Playground, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-use-genmoji-on-ios-18" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Genmoji</a> for generated emoji, Siri enhancements (with the ChatGPT integration), and on-screen awareness. These are some of the most significant features of Apple Intelligence, but Apple is taking things slow with AI. The company has even said that some features won't be released until 2025, though it did highlight that ChatGPT integration would be available by the end of 2024, so other Siri enhancements will likely be out by then, too. </p><p>Again, though, features could be delayed if Apple wants to hold them longer.</p><h2>Which devices will support iOS 18?</h2><p>iOS 18 will be available on all of the same devices that support iOS 17, which is great news for those with a slightly older phone. However, not all of these models will get Apple Intelligence. Only the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max (along with all iPhone 16 devices) get the new AI features.</p><p>Here's a list of devices that will get iOS 18.</p><ul><li><p>iPhone 15, 15 Plus, 15 Pro, 15 Pro Max</p></li><li><p>iPhone 14, 14 Plus, 14 Pro, 14 Pro Max</p></li><li><p>iPhone 13, 13 Mini, 13 Pro, 13 Pro Max</p></li><li><p>iPhone 12, 12 Mini, 12 Pro, 12 Pro Max</p></li><li><p>iPhone 11, 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max</p></li><li><p>iPhone XS, XS Max</p></li><li><p>iPhone XR</p></li><li><p>iPhone SE (second-generation)&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>iPhone SE (third-generation)</p></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"Hearing health is an essential part of our overall wellbeing, yet it can often be overlooked &mdash; in fact, according to the Apple Hearing Study, a staggering 75 percent of people diagnosed with hearing loss go untreated,&rdquo; wrote Apple&rsquo;s vice president of Health Sumbul Desai.

<p>Mainstream dating apps attract the most users &mdash; including queer users. That means niche lesbian dating apps aren't your only options for finding love. These days, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/hinge-lgbtq-dating-identity-questions" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Hinge</a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/bumble-nonbinary-users-message-first" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Bumble</a>, OkCupid, and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/eharmony-launches-new-features-for-lgbtq-users" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">even eharmony</a> all have clear filters to help you match with people of the same gender (or any gender at all), as well as filters that acknowledge the existence of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/what-is-consensual-non-monogamy" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">non-traditional relationships</a>. Especially if you don't live in a densely populated area, going for the more popular dating apps over lesbian dating sites can often lead to better results. </p><p>With that said, there is one dating app lesbian women should try. HER is an app by and for queer women, and it's grown to have a strong user base.

<p>Despite brighter, slightly more detailed visuals, both displays are virtually the same.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>iPhone 16 vs. iPhone 14: Design&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>You could call the iPhone 16 a "Pro" model compared to the iPhone 14, as it's fitted with all the iPhone Pro features the 14 missed out on &mdash; and then some.&nbsp;</p><p>For one, it comes with <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-iphone-15-dynamic-island-standard" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple's Dynamic Island</a> instead of the obsolete notch, which was reserved for the iPhone 14 Pro models at the time. You'll also find an Action button like on the iPhone 15 Pro models, which allows you to pick and choose a specific action as opposed to the usual Ring/Silent switch. Already, the iPhone 16 has a lot over the iPhone 14.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t stop there.

It acts as a shutter button to quickly snap pictures, can zoom in and out of photos or videos using swiping gestures, and lets you control focusing on objects. It&rsquo;s placed right below the power button on the left side&mdash;and it&rsquo;s a handy feature to have.&nbsp;</p><p>The rear camera layout is a bit different this time. While the iPhone 14 has a diagonal design, the iPhone 16 harkens back to the iPhone 12&rsquo;s vertical rear camera layout. It&rsquo;s a subtle change but hardly a major difference.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The iPhone 14 has an aerospace aluminum finish and a glass back, but the iPhone 16 has a color-infused glass back, which makes it less prone to fingerprints and the colors less profound. </p><p>Speaking of, the iPhone 16 will come in the following color options: Ultramarine, Teal, Pink, White, and Black. The iPhone 14 isn&rsquo;t too different, but they&rsquo;re sharper to look at. It&rsquo;s available in Midnight, Starlight, (Product) Red, Blue, Purple, and Yellow.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>iPhone 16 vs. iPhone 14: Performance</strong></h2><p>Processing power is like night and day between the iPhone 14 and iPhone 16. That&rsquo;s not to say the 14&rsquo;s A15 Bionic chip isn&rsquo;t capable of still offering excellent power, but there&rsquo;s a clear gap compared to the iPhone 16&rsquo;s A18 processor.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, the A15 chip has been around since the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/iphone-13-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>iPhone 13</u></a>, meaning it&rsquo;s already showing its age. That said, Apple&rsquo;s custom silicon chips can handle <em>a lot</em>, so there may not be a huge difference in your average day-to-day performance between the two rivals.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, the iPhone 16&rsquo;s A18 chip offers even more, and it&rsquo;s needed to handle the newly included Apple Intelligence and all of its AI features. This isn&rsquo;t something the iPhone 14 can handle. No surprises here, but the iPhone 16 outranks the iPhone 14 in performance by being one of the fastest mobile chips on the market.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>iPhone 16 vs. iPhone 14: Battery life</strong></h2><p>The iPhone 16 finally upgrades battery life, but only by an extra couple of hours over the iPhone 14. The real difference comes with the increased charging speeds.</p><p>The iPhone 16 is rated at 22 hours of battery life, while the iPhone 14 is stuck at 20 hours. That&rsquo;s around a full day before needing to be plugged in. While it&rsquo;s not by much, it&rsquo;s handy to have the extra juice.&nbsp;</p><p>What&rsquo;s more, the iPhone 16 ditches the Lightning port for a universal USB-C connection, which makes it easier to find a cable that fits into the slot.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2><strong>iPhone 16 vs. iPhone 14: Cameras</strong></h2><p>Here's a quick look at the spec differences between both phones, starting with the iPhone 16:</p><ul><li><p>48MP main (fusion with 12MP 2x Telephoto), 12MP ultra-wide</p></li><li><p>12MP TrueDepth front camera</p></li></ul><p>And the iPhone 14:</p><ul><li><p>12MP main, 12MP ultra-wide</p></li><li><p>12MP TrueDepth front camera</p></li></ul><p>Cameras have come a long way since the iPhone 14, as the iPhone 16 comes with an "advanced dual-camera system." Forget the iPhone 14&rsquo;s 12MP wide lens; the iPhone 16 boasts a 48MP wide camera and a 12MP telephoto lens (via a quad-pixel sensor) &mdash; two features the iPhone 14 can&rsquo;t contend with.&nbsp;</p><p>This isn&rsquo;t anything new, as the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-iphone-15-plus-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>iPhone 15</u></a> also comes equipped with these lenses, but the iPhone 16 now offers a 12MP ultra-wide with &fnof;/2.2 aperture and autofocus for improved low-light photography and macro photography. The iPhone 14&rsquo;s 12MP ultra-wide with a &fnof;/2.4 aperture is fine, but images generally come out slightly blurry and don&rsquo;t do well when there isn&rsquo;t enough light.&nbsp;</p><p>The iPhone 16&rsquo;s main camera can take great shots, and the addition of a telephoto lens enhances zoom capabilities for more detailed images from afar.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>iPhone 16 vs. iPhone 14: Software and AI</strong></h2><p>It&rsquo;s hard for the iPhone 14 to compete in this area. However, it&rsquo;s important to note that it&rsquo;s expected to deliver iOS updates until 2029, meaning it&rsquo;s not even halfway through its life cycle. That&rsquo;s great OS support, but the iPhone 16 is a fresh start, so it will (obviously) last at least two years longer.&nbsp;</p><p>iOS 18 brings Apple Intelligence to the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>iPhone 15 Pro</u></a> models and later, but only the iPhone 16 models will offer exclusive AI features. This takes the iPhone 14 out of the race, even if it gets an iOS 18 update and later.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>What fancy Apple Intelligence features is it missing out on?

What's more, Private Cloud Compute protects your personal information whenever you access Apple Intelligence. Basically, your data is never stored. </p><p>There&rsquo;s also <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-wwdc-keynote-2024-genmoji" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Genmoji</u></a>, which lets you create a custom emoji by simply typing it out via texting.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple Intelligence has many perks, but we won&rsquo;t know how useful they are until we&rsquo;ve had the chance to use them in the wild.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>iPhone 16 vs. iPhone 14: Is it worth upgrading?</strong></h2><p>Unlike other generations, there are significant differences between the iPhone 16 and iPhone 14 &mdash; even if there&rsquo;s only a two-year divide.

<h2>The Lightning cable is dead</h2><p>Apple didn't make big news of it, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-kills-lightning-cable-iphone-16-event" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">but as Mashable's Alex Perry wrote</a>, the Lightning cable is dead. Every device at the event on Monday used a USB-C charging port, completing the process of the company aligning with European Union regulations.

<h2>What's new in the Apple Watch Series 10?</h2><p>The Apple Watch Series 10 isn't a miraculous step up from the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-watch-series-9" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">previous generation</a>, but it's definitely the best place to start if you're new to tech wearables. For starters, the Series 10 is the thinnest Apple Watch yet but has the biggest, most readable display to date. It's nearly edge-to-edge and has about 30 percent more screen area compared to other Apple Watch iterations. The new watch introduces Apple's first-ever wide-angle OLED display, which makes it way easier to read your wrist bling at different angles, especially when you're just picking it up for a quick glance. The display is also more power-efficient, updating once per second when in Always On mode compared to the once-per-minute updates of previous models.</p><p>The watch also comes in some new finishes, including <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-watch-ultra-2-announcement-apple-event-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">jet black</a>, rose gold, and silver aluminum. You can also get it in a new titanium finish for a more formal look &mdash; that model is lighter than the regular Series 10, and one of Apple's newest carbon-neutral products. The Series 10 is the fastest-charging Apple Watch yet, only taking 30 minutes to get to 80 percent battery. The speaker system is also upgraded and allows you to play audio out loud, straight from the device itself.</p><p>The watch also employs the speedy S10 SIP processor and watchOS 11, along with some new software features like crash and fall detection, as well as better background noise impression. Health features are also getting a big update with <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-watch-series-10-sleep-apnea-health-monitor-announced" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">sleep apnea alerts</a>, which use sleep analytics to monitor your breathing over time, taking note of any disturbances and alerting you if you should see a medical professional. Underwater athletes will also benefit from the new depth app, tides app, and water temperature measurements. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Apple only switched to USB-C because of European Union regulations, so the company may not deserve heaps of praise for it, but it does end one of the more irritating tech sagas of our lifetimes. For years, people have had to keep Lightning cables around for the purposes of charging devices made by one company, while almost every other company on Earth switched to USB-C years ago. </p><p>Now, you'll be able to use one cable to charge almost any device you own. RIP Lightning, we won't miss you.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2><strong>Apple introduces AirPods 4</strong></h2><p>As mentioned, the AirPods 4 have arrived. And the rumors were correct &mdash; Apple unveiled not one but two new AirPods 4 models. The new base model replaces the AirPods second generation, which Apple still sold, and a new higher-end AirPods 4 that replaces the third generation AirPods, which Apple is calling AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation.</p><p>With this release, Apple has officially introduced three tiers of wireless earbuds, with the more fully featured AirPods 4 serving as a mid-tier product between the base model and the AirPods Pro.</p><p>Here's everything Apple divulged about the new devices.</p><h2><strong>Features in the new AirPods 4 models</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The new powerful H2 Apple Silicon chip powers both AirPods 4 models. This brings massive audio quality improvements, like personalized spacial audio and voice isolation, which removes background noise, to the AirPods 4. Apple shared that users will notice "richer bass" and "crystal-clear highs."</p><p>The new AirPods 4 also comes with new Siri interactions. The H2 chipset capabilities allow AirPods 4 users to physically nod their heads "yes" or shake their heads "no" to answer questions when interacting with Siri while wearing AirPods 4.</p><p>In addition, users can control the audio playing through their AirPods4 via a sensor on the stem, which they can press to play or pause music, mute calls, and more.</p><p>Speaking of the AirPods stem, Apple has redesigned the AirPods 4 to make it more AirPods Pro-esque in aesthetic. The AirPods 4 has a shorter stem, making it less visible when worn. Apple also says it utilized "advanced modeling tools" and collected millions of data points to redesign the earbuds to fit every ear shape and size and make the AirPods 4 the most comfortable AirPods ever.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2><strong>AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation</strong></h2><p>As previously discussed, the base AirPods now have a higher-end model called AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation. This mid-tier AirPods has more features than the base model of AirPods 4 but isn't quite as powerful (or expensive) as the AirPods Pro. </p><p>Active Noise Cancellation on this higher-end AirPods 4 brings features like transparency mode and active audio to the device. These features reduce noise around the user and adjust the volume based on their surroundings. </p><p>Plus, a new Conversation Awareness feature automatically lowers the volume of the user's earbuds when they start talking. </p><h2><strong>A brand new AirPods 4 charging case</strong></h2><p>The charging case for the AirPods also got a major update with both AirPods 4 models. Like most Apple devices now, Apple traded in the lightning cable for USB-C on the AirPods 4 charging case. Apple says the new case is the smallest, most portable AirPods case yet and comes with 30 hours of battery life.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

But the stakes may feel a little higher if you're in your 40s.</p><p>You may assume that people in your demographic either aren't interested in dating or are already settled into long-term relationships. However, according to a recent <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/06/28/a-record-high-share-of-40-year-olds-in-the-us-have-never-been-married/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Pew Research Center analysis</a> of Census Bureau data, as of 2021, nearly 25 percent of 40-somethings in the U.S. have never been married.

<p>So, have people in their 40s given up on finding love? Not at all. In fact, according to the Pew Research analysis, approximately one in four 40-year-olds who weren't married in 2001 tied the knot by age 60. But unlike people in their 20s and 30s, single people over 40 know what they want and aren't afraid to wait a little longer to find the right person. </p><h2>How to start dating again at 40</h2><p>Now, after that speech and spew of statistics, you're probably wondering what our grand plan is to get you out on the dance floor.

Before you scoff, hear us out.</p><p>Online dating is a great way to meet new people in a low-pressure environment. The best dating sites for people over 40 make it so easy to connect with potential partners. You can filter through profiles and find matches who share your interests and values. Imagine if you could do that when scanning the room at a party &mdash; it would save a lot of time and effort.</p><p>But before you download a bunch of apps, <a href="https://www.foriawellness.com/pages/kiana-reeves" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Kiana Reeves</a>, Somatic Sex Educator, Intimacy Coach, and Chief Education Officer at Foria, recommends taking a moment for self-reflection: "We join dating sites because we&rsquo;re looking for connection, whether in the form of a serious relationship, a casual fling, or something in between. With that in mind, it&rsquo;s important to identify the kind of connection you&rsquo;re looking for before you join any dating sites, apps, etc."</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Next, consider your approach to online dating, Reeves says. "Are you looking for a casual swipe-through site to meet people in a new city? Are you someone who likes to make the first move? Are you looking for someone who is only interested in a serious relationship? Are you looking for someone who shares your same faith? How much time are you planning to devote to making a connection?" </p><p>Once you've clarified your dating goals, Reeves recommends "joining a couple [apps] to start out with, so you can feel out what kind of user experience makes the most sense for you." She adds, "Of course, if you&rsquo;re feeling overwhelmed, it&rsquo;s totally fine to just join one to start."</p><p>Ready to find love after 40?

The scratch-resistant satin black titanium Ultra 2 (as well as a new black Milanese loop band) was <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-event-2024-everything-announced-iphone-16-watch-10" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">announced at the Glowtime event on Sept. 9</a>.

<p>The black version of the Apple Watch Ultra 2 is <a href="https://zdcs.link/avxrA2?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=available%20to%20pre-order%20for%20%24799%20now&object_type=article&object_uuid=04EzBDlaPoYRiV9qHPBW3KV&short_url=avxrA2&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">available to pre-order for $799 now</a>, and will be available officially on Sept. 20. For anyone who already upgraded to the Ultra 2 last year, an upgrade probably sounds comical &mdash;&nbsp;however, this elegant, moody new colorway just might be the push some athletes need to go Ultra over <a href="https://mashable.com/article/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-vs-apple-watch-ultra" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">competing sports watches</a>. </p><p>Since there are no new technical upgrades within the Ultra 2 to analyze, let's at least recap the pros of the Ultra 2 in general: Compared to a regular Apple Watch, the Ultra is more rugged and sporty. Powered by Apple's S9 chip and highly accurate U2 GPS chip, the Ultra 2 tracks just about any workout or activity you could throw at it &mdash;&nbsp;including extreme ones, like scuba diving or surfing thanks to the watchOS 11 update. The watch offers clutch features like automatic running detection or personalized tips on when to push or when to recover. Whether you're a lifelong athlete or are just getting into cycling or surfing after making the Olympics your entire personality, the Ultra Watch 2 is a serious training companion.</p><p>Debuted last year, the Ultra 2 is also armed with double tap. A quick double tap of your thumb and index finger (pinching emoji style) can trigger actions like answering a call or stopping a timer, depending on the activity you're up to.</p><p>The new black Ultra 2 is still made with 95 percent recycled aluminum and, like all new Apple Watch finishes, can be made carbon neutral.</p>]]></content:encoded>

        </div>
    </div>
<p>While the basic specs of the iPhone 16 tell most of the story, some deserve a deeper dive. The big one is the new <a href="https://mashable.com/article/iphone-16-capture-button-details-apple-event-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">camera control</a>, a physical feature that sits flush with the side of the phone but doesn't really qualify as a "button." You can slide your finger across it to zoom in or out with the camera app open. It also supports both firm and light presses, which will do different things; for instance, a light press will bring up a UI overlay in the camera app with various settings to choose from.</p><p>Apple is also leveraging the new A18 Bionic chip (a two-generation jump from the A16 Bionic in <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-iphone-15-plus-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">iPhone 15</a>) for <a href="https://mashable.com/article/5-apple-intelligence-features-ios-18-1-developer-beta" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple Intelligence</a> features. Most of these have already been shown off and discussed ad nauseam, but Apple demonstrated a couple of new ones during <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-event-2024-everything-announced-iphone-16-watch-10" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">the iPhone 16 presentation</a>. For example, you can do visual Google searches from photos you've taken, so if you're not sure of a dog's breed, just snap a shot and ask Google. (You can also just ask the dog's owner.)</p><p>There's also detailed text searching for photos and videos in your library. If you want every photo on your phone of your dog sleeping on the futon, Apple Intelligence can theoretically pull those up for you. </p><p>Speaking of photos and cameras, Apple is fitting a 48MP main lens and 12MP ultra-wide lens on the back of the iPhone 16. There's also 2X telephoto zoom, spatial capture for videos and photos on <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-vision-pro" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple Vision Pro</a>, and macro photography for gettin' up real close and taking photos of bugs or plants. </p><p>So, in summary, the iPhone 16 has upgraded cameras, a new button, a new thing that's kind of a button but not really, and Apple Intelligence. Most importantly, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/iphone-16-colors-hot-pink" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">it comes in pink</a>.</p><p><em>Mashable's currently on the ground in Cupertino for the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/iphone-16-event-confirmed" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Sept. 9 "Glowtime" Apple event.</a></em><em> Check out our <a href="https://mashable.com/live/apple-event-september-2024-live" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">live blog</a></em><em> to keep track of all things <a href="https://mashable.com/article/iphone-16-rumors" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">iPhone 16</a></em><em> before, during, and after the event.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

After every clean, it will return to its base to wash and dry the mopping pad, empty debris into a 60-day-capacity bin, and automatically refill its water tank for up to 30 days. The antimicrobial mopping pads are built to prevent bacteria and mold growth, setting the pad up for your next clean.&nbsp;</p><p>You can also remove some mental maintenance by creating a map of your home with no-go zones and setting a cleaning schedule.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Detailed cleaning with EdgeDetect&nbsp;</h2><p>Robot cleaners have a round shape that doesn&rsquo;t typically play well with edges or corners in a home. Shark solved this dilemma with a genius EdgeDetect system that blasts air to push debris from the edges into the robot&rsquo;s cleaning path. When mopping, the pad is extended for up to an inch to guarantee your floors are clean-clean, not just visibly clean.&nbsp;</p><p>The DirtDetect feature can sense areas that have more debris and boosts vacuuming performance, while StainDetect tracks out strains and takes additional passes to help remove the stain.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

Initially, Apple Intelligence was reserved for the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max</a> models.

As noted during the event, many of the Apple Intelligence features are processed on-device. For those that require cloud computing, Apple has dedicated Apple Intelligence servers called Private Cloud Compute that don't store user data and are used only to process requests.  </p><ul><li><p><strong>Writing Tools</strong>: As Federighi said, Apple Intelligence is available "wherever you type," including third-party apps like Slack and Goodreads. The AI integration helps iPhone 16 users draft, rewrite, and proofread text. </p></li><li><p><strong>Transcription and summaries in Notes</strong>: Apple Intelligence enables Apple users to record, transcribe, and summarize calls and audio recordings in the Notes and Phone apps. </p></li><li><p><strong>Genmoji</strong>: With Apple Intelligence, you can create new emoji by typing a description or create new images with Image Playground.</p></li><li><p><strong>Photos</strong>: In the Photos app, you can find an image you're looking for by typing a description or even a specific moment in a video. Apple also introduced a "Clean Up" tool that uses Apple Intelligence to remove unwanted objects or people that get in the way of your perfect shot.</p></li><li><p><strong>AI-generated summaries</strong>: In Mail and notifications on the home screen, you can get a quick summary of your inbox in the Mail app. Apple Intelligence also provides AI-generated summaries of notifications and prioritizes them based on importance.</p></li><li><p><strong>Behold, the new Siri</strong>: As promised, Siri is more natural, contextually relevant, and more personalized. Aside from voice prompts, you can  type to Siri. The voice assistant also has more expansive knowledge for helping troubleshoot or accomplish something on your iPhone 16. Siri also has more contextual on-screen awareness, so it sees what you see on the screen, or a collection of photos you referenced. </p></li></ul><p>Apple Intelligence on iPhone 16 will be available in beta in October as part of the iOS 18.1 update. It will start in the U.S. in English and then roll out to other countries. </p><h2>What other Apple devices support Apple Intelligence</h2><p>Apple Intelligence is also compatible with the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max, as well as last year's iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max models, with the iOS 18.1 update. It will also be available on iPad with the iPadOS 18.1 update, Mac with the M1 chip, and later on the macOS Sequoia 15.1 update. </p><p>If you were wondering, Apple briefly mentioned ChatGPT as an option for various AI features. But it's not expected to be available with the first Apple Intelligence update in iOS 18.</p><p><em>Mashable is currently in Cupertino for the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/iphone-16-event-confirmed" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Sept. 9 "Glowtime" Apple event.</a></em><em> Check out our <a href="https://mashable.com/live/apple-event-september-2024-live" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">live blog</a></em><em> to keep track of all things <a href="https://mashable.com/article/5-apple-intelligence-features-ios-18-1-developer-beta" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple Intelligence</a></em><em> before, during, and after the event.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

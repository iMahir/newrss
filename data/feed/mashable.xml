<p>News spread on social media on Friday that Musk's companies had paid the $3.3 million fine and, as a result, the Brazilian court had <a href="https://x.com/ReutersLegal/status/1834646291319865820" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>ordered</u></a> that the "blockage" on Starlink and X be lifted. The initial reports caused some confusion among social media users as only Brazil's blockage of Starlink's and X's <em>bank accounts</em> had been lifted. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-13/brazil-garnishes-3-3-billion-from-musk-companies-accounts" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Bloomberg</u></em></a>, the nationwide ban on X the social media platform, remains.</p><p>In addition, Musk's companies did not actively pay the fine. On Wednesday, Brazil's court ordered that these funds be transferred in order to satisfy the demand for fines.</p><p>Last month, Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered that X the platform be banned in the country. This came after Musk refused to remove accounts that Moraes' deemed to be breaking the country's laws. As a result of this request, Musk pulled X representatives out of the country and refused to appoint a new legal representative, one of Moraes' requirements.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/02/02/key-findings-about-online-dating-in-the-u-s/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Pew Research Center</a>, about one-quarter of LGBTQ+ adults say they met their match through online dating.

Not all <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-apps" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">dating apps</a> are created equal, especially for the LGBTQ+ community. </p><h2>What is the best gay dating app right now?</h2><p>We can't talk about the gay dating scene in the 21st century without talking about Grindr, the undisputed king of gay dating mobile apps. However, there are a lot of other options, especially if you want to foster real connections.</p><p>"Grindr is a tried and true app that many queer men gravitate toward to find partners or for relationships that require lesser commitment, so it&rsquo;s easy to point to it as the #1 app," <a href="https://centerformodernrelationships.com/staff-directory/michelle-herzog-lmft-cst" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Michelle Herzog</a>, LMFT, AASECT-certified sex therapist, tells Mashable. "However, like Tinder, it&rsquo;s gained a reputation as a hookup app &mdash; but that doesn&rsquo;t mean there still aren&rsquo;t men looking for long-term commitments, either."</p><p>Other <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-popular-dating-apps-and-sites" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">popular dating apps</a> have a lot to offer, and that's where you'll find the most queer users. Keeping Tinder on the back burner isn't just a straight people thing (especially for guys in less-populated areas where apps like Scruff offer slim pickings). Plus, mainstream apps deserve credit for <em>trying </em>to create a more inclusive atmosphere. OkCupid gets kudos <a href="https://mashable.com/article/okcupid-pronouns-for-all-users" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">for embracing change</a> and making inclusivity a core part of its compatibility scoring.

<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s true that dating apps <em>still </em>get a bad rap as a last resort for the desperate, but for introverts, these nifty little tools provide a much-needed buffer that allows us to slowly and comfortably get to know potential partners.

Its hookup-centric interface and &ldquo;swipe left&rdquo; model are a recipe for disaster for shy singles who prefer to get to know their matches before jumping into bed.

<p>But we also know that society is facing a crisis of care, in which more and more people <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/505745/depression-rates-reach-new-highs.aspx" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">report intense feelings of hopelessness and apathy</a>. Does adding human-less, digital automation into one of the ways we provide care to others exacerbate growing feelings of dissociation? There's a second battle waging too: A crisis of attention, in which the rapidly moving images on screens all around us have become more appealing than the slower, grittier world creating them. Is AI the right answer to the problem of grabbing the public's attention, getting them to care, and maintaining their investment in the cause?</p><p>Nonprofits are looking to AI as a filler for historical gaps &mdash; to aid customer service, ease administrative issues, and get the attention of those with deep pockets. For many leaders in the giving world, the question remains whether those benefits outweigh the drawbacks.</p><h2>Google Search: A window into the problem </h2><p>In May, Google launched <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-isnt-afraid-of-the-ai-overviews-haters" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Search Labs' AI Overviews</u></a>, an AI-summarizing feature you have definitely seen but have certainly forgotten the name of. It was a tentpole addition amid a flurry of sparkling AI features, intended to make searching for information even easier (who wants to scroll through multiple pages anymore?). </p><p>Overviews appear in their own highlighted box under the normal Google Search bar, with a small conical beaker logo meant to indicate to the searcher that the results are still being tested. That's important. The early launch of Overviews wasn't just lackluster; it was worrisome. Results were muddy, often nonsensical, becoming the new carriers of absurd memes and <a href="https://www.snopes.com/news/2024/05/29/google-ai-feeling-depressed/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">fake screenshots</a>; people scrolled right past them. Mashable's <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-ai-overviews-benefit-of-doubt" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>own testing</u></a> found a mix of genuinely helpful answers and glaringly off AI hallucinations. (The feature has yet to fully roll out to all searches.)</p><p>Weeks out, journalists were rallying a movement against the flurry of misinformation and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-ai-overview-search-results-copied-my-original-work/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>misappropriated bylines</u></a> spawned by the still-limited run of AI Overviews. The tool introduced a potential "<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/15/media/google-gemini-ai-search-news-outlet-impact/index.html" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>catastrophe</u></a>" to content visibility and online traffic, some publishers said, screwing with established metrics for appearing, with credit, at the top of news results. Not long after, the feature was rumored to be adding integrated, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-ai-overviews-ads" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>revenue-generating advertisements</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>But it wasn't just the news media that was worried, and it wasn't just about profit. "What you're seeing in the for-profit sector is certainly going to affect the nonprofit sector," said Kevin Scally, chief development officer at nonprofit ratings site <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ways-to-give-donate-charity-navigator" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Charity Navigator</u></a>. Just as journalists and creatives sounded the alarm to ethically dubious results, and users pointed out absurdly unhelpful responses, Scally and his colleagues saw the streamlined search summaries as a potential problem for the less discussed world of charity.&nbsp;</p><p>Such AI tech could potentially hide legitimate nonprofits in favor of ambiguous summaries or outrightly false results, these advocates warned. Its search summary results prompt questions of algorithmic bias, and subsequent ones surrounding funding or visibility &mdash;&nbsp; the same issues already plaguing the sector, but on a synthetically enhanced scale.&nbsp;</p><q>
    If we're getting it wrong, it's not just a matter of a funny screenshot. It could be a matter of the organization's reputation and their funding.

<h2>Finding the right charity amid a slog of information </h2><p>AI isn't new in the sector, but the timeline has sped up. Dave Hollander, data science manager at nonprofit data site Candid, explained that the organization and others have spent time and money building discovery and audience for nonprofits for the past several years, exploring how AI can help underserved populations access resources online. Since resources like Charity Navigator and Candid work primarily with large, complex data sets, collated from federal resources and nonprofits themselves, AI tools are an incredibly useful option to cut down on the administrative heft. Other nonprofits may use AI to fill the gaps of staff, like site customer service bots helping donors find resources and organizations.  </p><p>"The general availability of these AI tools, and the accessibility of it, could potentially help organizations improve their search engine optimization," Hollander explained, "where in the past that would have been an insurmountable task for them. But discoverability through search has long been a problem for a lot of organizations, even before AI. And then AI comes and can also exacerbate that problem."</p><p>A simple illustration: How would an AI-boosted search choose between organizations with confusingly similar names? In 2020, for example, as the global community rallied for the work of racial justice advocates and police abolitionists, millions of dollars in donations were funneled to activist organizations. Bad actors using <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndoh/pr/toledo-man-charged-using-black-lives-matter-greater-atlanta-facebook-page-defraud" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>SEO-gaming names</u></a> that included the phrase "Black Lives Matter" managed to siphon off thousands from good-natured donors.&nbsp;</p><p>Disambiguations like these are already a problem, a natural product of an overloaded internet and not enough names to go around. Other problems arise with the repeated recommendation of the same big-name organizations (say, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation) over smaller, localized nonprofits doing the same work.&nbsp;</p><p>And organizations already vie for the spotlight in a charitable ecosystem moving toward <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/359526/charitable-giving-generosity-crisis-report-americans-young" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">less frequent, reactionary giving</a>. "The risk that runs [with AI Overviews] is, if we're getting it wrong, it's not just a matter of a funny screenshot," Scally warned. "It could be a matter of the organization's reputation and their funding. Then you play that forward. If that's happening at scale, where information about those organizations is getting twisted up, it has real ramifications for the programs they serve."</p><p>Recently, Google announced <a href="https://mashable.com/article/new-google-ai-overview-format-ease-publisher-concerns" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">new updates to AI Overviews</a> to try to curb publishers' worries, including prioritizing direct links to sources &mdash; but they're still being tested. Other information-gathering sites, like TikTok, are facing similar <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@MS4wLjABAAAAtUWuRxxxwoaCb2659sECxjGF0mt6Vga6jMxmhcrSV4SKy7zYBA57_38ipyc7jTUm/video/7412803492462578987" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">misinformation issues</a> with AI-supported searches. </p><p>AI is good at specificity only so far as the prompt it's given, limited by the data it's fed. Search Overviews summarize populated results and prioritize high-ranking links. If a smaller nonprofit isn't active online, and isn't already surfacing in Google results, it has little chance of becoming AI's recommended click.</p><h2>Understanding the true meaning behind a nonprofit's work</h2><p>Within AI, the nuance of nonprofit missions, and exactly how those goals are accomplished, are also sacrificed for the ease of a simplified answer. Google itself pitched the service with: "Google will do the Googling for you." But AI doesn't have a human brain and can't incorporate the nuances involved in the processes of helping our fellow humans. </p><p>There's a lengthening list of media and AI literacy questions to address, first. In an AI-enhanced future, how will individuals learn to properly search, vet, and align their charity on their own, with and without the aid of an AI bot?&nbsp;What do we lose when we stop doing the "hard" work of searching for ourselves? </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>The hypothetical solution is for nonprofits to offer up even more data to the AI tools' developers &mdash; data from nonprofits, data from organizations like Charity Navigator, and personalized behavioral data from donors (read: internet users) that can solve the specificity problem.&nbsp;AI's proponents love personalization. But that would stir up even more problems. </p><p>"I think that there's inherently risks with that. Does technology really know the true me? How comfortable am I having Meta and Google and Microsoft essentially build profiles about me?" Scally said. </p><p>AI's data hunger has worried many privacy advocates and proponents of data autonomy &mdash; a trend also taking over the world of nonprofits. Making such moves with people's personal data belies the values of many of the world's most effective social sector actors, those who avoid overlapping their work with Big Tech, who cannot feasibly gather such data (or choose not to among their communities), and especially those who are trying to decolonize their work from historic power holders.&nbsp;</p><p>As a wave of new perspectives on charitable giving emerge &mdash; including the idea of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-decolonize-donations-charity" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>unrestricted, community-driven funding</u></a> that intentionally eschews traceable nonprofit data &mdash; many nonprofits have already made AI safety commitments that would block deeper personalization. Candid, and its acquired <a href="https://www.guidestar.org/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">GuideStar</a> rating database, doesn't allow its data for training third party models, and only uses a nonprofit's publicly accessible tax data for internal projects.&nbsp;</p><h2>AI could make charity feel like another investment, without the "warm glow of giving" &nbsp;</h2><p>The problem with AI implementation is that it's happening at hyperspeed. This speed, with AI designed by large tech industry leaders in order to streamline people's digital lives and implemented without input, can just as easily strip people of one of the core purposes of charitable giving: human to human connection. </p><p>According to <a href="https://philanthropy.indianapolis.iu.edu/news-events/news/_news/2024/giving-usa-us-charitable-giving-totaled-557.16-billion-in-2023.html" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>recent numbers from Giving USA</u></a>, the U.S.'s charitable giving decreased by 2.1 percent in 2023, following a record high set by social and public health organizing in 2021. What did grow in 2023 were what are known as <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/phoebeliu/2023/11/14/controversial-philanthropy-accounts-known-as-dafs-had-record-inflows-and-outflows-last-year-new-report-finds/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>donor-advised funds</u></a>, a controversially favored way of donating one's money among the wealthy elite. Donor-advised funds are managed and sponsored by public charities and nonprofits, pooling low-taxed investor money into high-value charity payouts.&nbsp;As Scally explained, funds write out what are essentially grants to organizations, but individual givers stay uninvolved and potentially emotionally uninvested. Givers, then, are no longer doing the work.</p><q>
    Compassionate human connection takes work and time, things that AI's efficiency goals are working to make a thing of the past. 
    </q>
<p>Scally sees an obvious connection between these trends and tools like AI Overviews: Humans are becoming more disconnected from the physical act of handing over their money and resources to the people, or causes, most in need, often in favor of others (or even bots) telling them where to turn. This comes in spite of a social shift toward mass community giving and a revived interest in the concept of mutual aid.</p><p>"If you're doing a search, finding the organization through an AI Overview, then making a grant through your donor-advised fund&hellip; What connection do you have to that organization?" asks Scally. "How invested are you to continue to support that organization, when you don't feel that warm glow of giving?"</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-weekend-essay/why-ai-isnt-going-to-make-art" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">recent <em>New Yorker </em>article</a> by speculative fiction author and <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/chatgpt-is-a-blurry-jpeg-of-the-web" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">frequent AI commentator</a> Ted Chiang,&nbsp;growing fear of AI's art takeover is presented as misleading, even as developers try to commandeer creative fields. "The companies promoting generative-AI programs claim that they will unleash creativity. In essence, they are saying that art can be all inspiration and no perspiration &mdash; but these things cannot be easily separated," Chiang writes. What AI rids humans of, the writer argues, is self-confidence, not drudgery. And it's devaluing the effort and importance of human attention in favor of the technology's processing power. </p><p>Art and philanthropy are not so different when it comes to the need for human intention and creativity &mdash; compassionate human connection takes work and time, things that AI's efficiency goals are working to make a thing of the past. As Chiang wrote, "It is a mistake to equate 'large-scale' with 'important' when it comes to the choices made when creating art; the interrelationship between the large scale and the small scale is where the artistry lies." And humanity at the small scale is where charity works best. </p><h2>There's good in AI, if we can use it wisely</h2><p>Individual nonprofits (and even their supporters, like Candid and Charity navigator) aren't turning away from AI completely. In fact, Scally scoffs at in an evil AI takeover. "Instead of a Terminator, or Matrix, or a Robocop scenario, how can we actually use this for good, and have a good balance against it?"</p><p>Candid has been testing AI in their work since Hollander started there in 2015. The organization has continued to explore generative AI as a solution to problems facing smaller nonprofits, including drafting documents like grant proposals and letters of intent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And even with Google's own AI technologies under critique, the company has been putting its money back into AI's social sector benefits. In April, the company announced a $20 million investment into its latest Google "AI for Good" accelerator program. The initiative funneled cash into what they deemed to be "high-impact" nonprofits, like the World Bank, Justicia Lab, and Climate Policy Radar, to accelerate the integration of AI within their work. Google recently <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/google-org/google-ai-tools-social-impact-sector/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">expanded the initiative</a>.</p><p>Charity Navigator received Google backing to explore natural language processing and is internally testing AI-powered assistance for site visitors. They are spurred on by successful integrations among fellow nonprofits, like the Trevor Project's <a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/blog/the-trevor-project-launches-new-ai-tool-to-support-crisis-counselor-training/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Crisis Contact Simulator</u></a> (also backed by Google).&nbsp;</p><div class="content-block-mashable-video mt-8">

</div>
<p>"I don't think it's fair to discount AI and say it will never be able to get the intelligence it needs to really navigate nuanced areas of social good," Scally reflected. "I think things are evolving &mdash; AI six months ago looks very different than it does now." It comes down to more data, casting a wider net, and doing a better job at eliminating bias, Scally said.</p><p>Social sector guardians, then, could form something like a symbiotic relationship with Big Tech's AI investments, enabling the work of these organizations, but keeping things like recommendations to human professionals. You're seeing it already: Rather than inundating search overviews with something like advertising, have AI offer <em>more</em> context, <em>more</em> links, <em>more</em> information. </p><p>Still, questions remain. Can AI actually close equity gaps? Could its pervasiveness make it easier for full participation of all? The answers haven't revealed themselves. But that isn't to say that we can't formulate a more compassionate plan as it advances. While we seek to add "humans in the loop," a sense of humanity has to remain at the forefront.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The camera can now capture spatial photos and videos and 4K video at 120 frames per second. Plus, users can color grade directly from their phone. Four new studio-quality mics on the device also allow for new audio editing with Audio Mix, as well as the ability to record spatial audio.</p></li><li><p><strong>New colorway: </strong>Apple swapped the 15 Pro's blue titanium color for the 16 Pro's desert titanium.</p></li></ul><p><em>This story is developing...</em></p><p><em>Mashable is currently on the ground in Cupertino for the Sept. 9 "Glowtime" Apple event.

Create presentations, take video calls, doodle with an Apple Pencil, or even attach a keyboard to turn it into a mobile workstation.

It's also the best option for kids who might need a simple piece of hardware for school or for gaming on, since it's rife with options for parental controls. </p><h2><strong>More tablet deals:</strong></h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/zjGJZp?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20iPad%2C%209th%20gen%20%28A13%20Bionic%2C%2064GB%2C%20WiFi%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=05XJgeJxod7q6jtjy38CwgK&short_url=zjGJZp&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple iPad, 9th gen (A13 Bionic, 64GB, WiFi)</a> &mdash;

And, to be fair, she is so freaking cute. </p><p>Moo Deng, whose name translates roughly to "bouncy pig," according to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy848292dr4o" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">the BBC</a>, has gotten lots of love online after the zoo began posting pics of her. </p><p>The love comes from her cuteness and the fact that baby hippos are somewhat strange creatures. They're a bit slimy and wet at all times. They're simultaneously cute and a little gross. They're pudgy, waddling, and fantastic. So, of course everyone loves Moo Deng.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>The internet has been obsessed with a baby hippo before.

<p>Activation Lock is an existing anti-theft feature for Apple devices within the Find My app. If you think your iPhone has been stolen, you can prevent it from being used by remotely activating Activation Lock. But this has led to stolen iPhones being taken apart for valuable parts like batteries, cameras, and sensors that are then sold on the black market. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Now, as discovered in the iOS 18 Release Candidate (RC), which is the final build before it's released as a beta update, Activation Lock will work for iPhone parts. According to an Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/04/apple-to-expand-repair-options-with-support-for-used-genuine-parts/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">announcement</a> in April explaining the upcoming feature, here's how it works: "If a device under repair detects that a supported part was obtained from another device with Activation Lock or Lost Mode enabled, calibration capabilities for that part will be restricted." Apple will ask for the user's account information to verify the ownership of the part. </p><p>Some say rendering parts useless will contribute to e-waste. Right to Repair advocates have also pointed out that it might hamper the secondhand and refurbishing market. "Apple trying to kill the second hand parts market. Now no repair shop is going to buy parts because they won't have any way to know if it is 'unlocked,'" said one <a href="https://x.com/EERandomness/status/1834285082162721081" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">X user</a>. "How many people do you think will bother to 'unlock' their battery before trade in or disposal?" </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>But for many, closing a loophole within the iPhone black market is a welcome change. The iOS 18 update will be available on September 16 to those with iPhone XR or later.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>OK, fellas, this one's for you. The Handy is an innovative sex toy company created by a guy who realized there wasn't really a good masturbation device for penises on the market. It&rsquo;s a Norwegian company, and they&rsquo;re way above the shoddy quality of your typical "pocket pussy" type devices. </p><p>Today, you can get the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QrpODN?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Starter%20Collection&object_type=article&object_uuid=05XsfPBVOqaCKis3dskFvx1&short_url=QrpODN&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Starter Collection</a> for $222.30. It includes The Handy masturbator, a TrueGrip Gen 2 Sleeve, and a True Grip PRO Band. Everything you need to get the best automated handjob of your life, <em>probably</em>.</p><p>The Starter Collection is available directly from The Handy's website. You can also shop The Handy on Amazon, where you&rsquo;ll see a 14% discount on the <a href="https://zdcs.link/9ZdDyV?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Dream%20Collection&object_type=article&object_uuid=05XsfPBVOqaCKis3dskFvx1&short_url=9ZdDyV&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Dream Collection</a> and 10% off the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aND7vG?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Mermaid%20Collection&object_type=article&object_uuid=05XsfPBVOqaCKis3dskFvx1&short_url=aND7vG&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Mermaid Collection</a>. </p><p>The Handy is also developing a smart vibrator called the Oh! (They&rsquo;ve already sent me one, so we&rsquo;ll see if it&rsquo;s any good.) It&rsquo;s supposed to sync with music, like your Spotify playlist, and vibrate to the beat. The coolest feature is that you can pair the Oh! with The Handy, so it makes for a cute couple&rsquo;s experience.</p><h2>Zumio </h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>Zumio is an underrated brand that has some super innovative clitoral vibrators. They look <em>a little bit </em>like a dental tool, with a small, round spinning head that provides very focused, powerful stimulation. </p><p>If you&rsquo;re a clit queen and want to feel something that&rsquo;s new and different from your standard bullet vibrator, I highly recommend checking out Zumio. (I own the Zumio Xena, but it&rsquo;s currently sold out.) </p><p>Right now, you can get up to <a href="https://zdcs.link/aepeVl?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=40%25%20off&object_type=article&object_uuid=05XsfPBVOqaCKis3dskFvx1&short_url=aepeVl&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">40% off</a> all Zumio products as a part of its Double Trouble Summer Sale.

<p>Released only two months ago, the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-unpacked-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> just got its first big discount. The super pricey foldable usually starts at $1,899.99, but as of Sept. 13, you can slash 21% off and get the 256GB model for $1,499.99 instead. The Z Fold 6 keeps the same winning formula from the Z Fold 5 when it comes to fundamentals &mdash; cameras, battery capacity, and memory. But it makes a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-vs-galaxy-z-fold-5" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">few tweaks and adds a few extras</a> that make it even better, including a thinner, wider, and brighter display with enhanced resolution, a boost in Snapdragon power, and a boat load of AI-powered tools from the Galaxy AI suite. If you want more storage, the 512GB version is also on sale for 20% off, knocking the price down from $2,019.99 to $1,619.99.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>While it's not the fanciest TV in the Fire lineup, the 50-inch 4-Series Fire TV is a solid pick for most people. It's equipped with 4K Ultra HD entertainment with HDR 10, on-board Alexa, and four HDMI inputs for connectivity. Plus, if you're already using a Fire TV Stick, it'll have your custom-arranged apps waiting for you when you login to your Amazon account. If you're a Prime member, you can slash about 37% off with the code 55PRIME and get it for just $329.99 as of Sept. 13. For non-Prime members, it'll cost you $379.99, which is still a decent deal at 27% off.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>A newer iteration of our <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-bluetooth-speakers" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">favorite sub-$100 Bluetooth speaker</a>, the Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 4 is back on sale for just $79.99. That's 20% in savings. The Wonderboom is quite the powerhouse for a speaker that fits in the palm of your hand. While we haven't tested this model, we have tested its predecessor and found it had "excellent sound for its size and plenty of useful features that come in handy when you're taking it on the go." It's rugged enough to endure drops from up to five feet, can be submerged in water for up to 30 minutes, and has an impressive 14 hours of battery life. Plus, it comes in some fun color varieties.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

They also feature adaptive noise cancellation that can be customized in the app and fast charging that gives you an extra four hours of battery life in just 10 minutes. As of Sept. 13, they're on sale for just $47.99 &mdash; a new record-low. That's 40% in savings.</p><p><em>None of these deals catching your eye?

Debuting in three new vibrant shades of pink, green, and blue, it's sure to make a statement, but that's just where the design changes begin. It's crafted from aerospace titanium, ceramic shields, and new, tougher glass for a more durable phone.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>All iPhone 16 models now include the multipurpose Action button that sits just above the volume buttons. Previously, the Action button was only included on the Pro and Pro Max iPhone models, but now it appears to have expanded to all models. It allows you to customize how you want to use the button whether you want it to turn on the flashlight or start your car with compatible apps like FordPass.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The camera on the iPhone 16 looks different than previous models with two stacked lenses rather than diagonal lenses (the iPhone 16 Pro models still have the three-camera design.) Plus there's a new way to control the camera on your iPhone with Camera Control, a button flush to the side, just below the lock button. Quickly click to snap a photo or use touch controls to preview or zoom in on your shot.</p><p>Inside the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus is the A18 chip, which Apple claims to be 30 percent faster than the iPhone 15. It will run Apple Intelligence features, which are slowly being rolled out, some expected to launch later this month. During the iPhone 16 event, we didn't learn too many new details about Apple Intelligence, instead the company reiterated the new AI features that let you create your own emoji or spruce up your emails and text with better language.</p><p>iOS 18 will power the iPhone 16 and supposedly give it a longer battery life. How much longer? Apple didn't say, so we'll have to test that for ourselves. The iPhone 16 measures in at 6.1 inches while the iPhone 16 Plus is slightly larger at 6.7 inches. If you're tempted to go even bigger, then you'll need to go for the iPhone 16 Pro models.</p><p>The iPhone 16 starts at $799 and the iPhone 16 Plus starts at $899. They are available to pre-order now and will arrive on September 20.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

The telecom giant also said it will charge up to $1.9 billion before taxes in severance pay. As recently as February, Verizon reported it had 105,400 full-time employees, so about 4.5 percent of its headcount will be cut by the end of March.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>This year has been a vicious year for tech layoffs. Big companies like Twitch, Google, Microsoft, Sony, Amazon, and now Verizon have announced cuts in one form or another since January 1.

<p>I was one of those<em> </em>'Is there something wrong with me?'<em> </em>AirPods users who had to purchase ear hooks to supplement my first-generation AirPods Pro because they kept falling out. (It seemed like everyone else had their AirPods Pro secured, but because my ears are an anomaly, I had trouble keeping them in.)</p><p>However, to my surprise, the AirPods 4 fit <em>super </em>snug. Shaking, tilting and bobbling my head, the AirPods didn&rsquo;t move an inch. How could this be? </p><h3><strong>Secure fit</strong></h3><p>Apple said that it analyzed thousands of ear shapes and over 50 million data points using advanced technology to design a more secure and precise fit (for <em>most </em>people) on the AirPods 4. And let me tell you, whatever Apple did during its analysis, it worked &mdash; for me at least. </p><p>I've got a set of unusual ears, and despite their weird, atypical shape, the AirPods 4 had a tight fit in my canal without taking a tumble.</p><h3><strong>Active noise cancellation is surprisingly good</strong></h3><p>Next, I fired up one of my favorite songs of the year: Sabrina Carpenter's "Espresso." There was a white noise simulation in the demo room, similar to the drone of an airplane, and then I turned on active noise cancellation.</p><p>Whoa!</p><p>It was as if the noisy world around me disappeared, allowing Carpenter's sugary sweet vocals to take center stage. Even if you're not in a crowded room nor a noisy street, you don't realize how cacophonous your surroundings are until you turn on ANC. From the tick-tock of a nearby clock and distant traffic to the hum of an air conditioner to the buzz of a refrigerator motor, these environmental sounds negatively affect the immersion of your listening experience.</p><p>"Espresso" already sounds like a warm vanilla brew with a frothy finish, but with ANC on, it felt like Carpenter was serenading me in a cozy soundproof caf&eacute; while I sipped on a pumpkin spice latte.</p><p>Why was I blown away? Well, for starters, it's darn-near unheard of to find ANC in an open-ear design like the entry-level AirPods. The AirPods Pro 2, for example, have silicon tips that create a tight seal in consumers' ears, making it easier to block external sounds alongside ANC technology. </p><p>But open-ear designs like the AirPods 4 are tricky because they don't fully seal your ears, leaving 'em somewhat exposed. However, Apple managed to pull it off, thanks to a m&eacute;lange of upgraded microphones, the H2 processor, and cutting-edge computational audio.</p><p>I'm eager to put the AirPods 4 to the test in more challenging environments, like airports, for example.

It's unlikely that the AirPods 4 will be able to compete with the AirPods Max, but I'm curious to see whether it could be a portable alternative with some trade-offs.</p><p>The AirPods 4 come in two models: one with ANC and one without.

Its two-tank technology separates the clean and dirty water, so you're not redistributing dirt and grime as you clean. Plus, the antimicrobial-treated fresh start filter helps protect it from odors (if you have a pet, this is a nice bonus). </p><h2>Best countertop appliance deal </h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/02puOGvXWIMtajbjoV2MyBf/hero-image.png" alt="Digital Nomad with Shift"><p>Whether you&rsquo;re a seasoned digital nomad with a favorite internet caf&eacute; in every corner of the globe or you&rsquo;re planning your first trip, working while roaming the world is awesome &mdash; and tricky. While your next flight, train, or bus will be late more often than not, your work always has to arrive in your boss&rsquo;s inbox on time.</p><p>Being a successful digital nomad is hard work, and if you want to make enough money to keep traveling, you&rsquo;ll need to buckle down and, well&hellip;work. Let&rsquo;s get to it with these insider tips on how to get your digital workload done while living the lifestyle you&rsquo;ve always wanted. Who knows? You might even get paid to travel the world as <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qm2xNy?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Shift%E2%80%99s%20Chief%20Nomad%20Officer&object_type=article&object_uuid=02puOGvXWIMtajbjoV2MyBf&short_url=Qm2xNy&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Shift&rsquo;s Chief Nomad Officer</u></a>.</p><h2>Navigate your WiFi connections</h2><p>International mobile data plans can be costly. That said, when traveling, your best bet for staying connected with your work team via phone or laptop is almost always a public WiFi connection.&nbsp;</p><p>Before you leave, contact your hotel or coffee shop where you&rsquo;ll be traveling to confirm they have solid WiFi. Asking about the download speed (100 Mbps should be enough for video calls, FYI) is also smart.</p><h2>Keep your devices juiced up</h2><p>Outlets can be hard to find while exploring faraway beaches and jungles, so you&rsquo;ll want to charge your devices between 80 and 100 percent as much as possible. Packing a lightweight, portable power bank as a backup will also save you a few headaches if you&rsquo;re venturing off-grid. One with 20,000mAH capability should charge your phone up to three or so times and your laptop at least once, in a pinch.</p><h2>Use tools that boost productivity </h2><p>Utilizing digital work tools like <a href="https://zdcs.link/a0Xgll?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Shift&object_type=article&object_uuid=02puOGvXWIMtajbjoV2MyBf&short_url=a0Xgll&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Shift</u></a>, a browser designed to streamline your digital to-do list, allows you to spend more time exploring while on the road.

<p>The productivity browser allows you to seamlessly access over 1,500 apps, connect all your emails and accounts, and manage everything you need for work, life, or travel from one centralized window. Shift also syncs all your calendars into one streamlined view, so you&rsquo;ll always know when your next meeting or call from home is across time zones.</p><h2>Protect your devices from the elements</h2><p>Safeguarding your phone and laptop with impact-proof covers is a no-brainer, but if you&rsquo;ll be spending a good chunk of time in a tropical climate, it&rsquo;s also a good idea to bring silica gel packets, the same ones that get packed into many boxed items.

<p>At the core of the film is 16-year-old Mira (Panigrahi), a studious, determined girl whose burgeoning exploration of sexual desire and first love is thrown into confusing, infuriating disarray by her mother Anila (Kusruti), whose own adolescence wasn't as full of such awakenings.</p><p>Set in the 1990s, the film introduces Mari as a model student at her conservative boarding school in the Himalayas. She's head prefect, a stickler for the rules, acing her grades, and pulling up other students on their uniform errors. Teachers even trust her with the school keys. But she's quite a solitary person, favouring studies over friendship. When Mira develops a crush on 17-year-old classmate Sri (Kesav Binoy Kiron), she's resolved to follow her physical impulses &mdash; importantly, on her terms. However, her mother's constant presence frustrates her, impeding her yearning for maturity and experience with Sri (and remember, this is the '90s, so they've got no social media to chat after school on, only parental landlines).</p><p>But it goes further than pure supervision. Anila's strange closeness and (let's be real) flirtation with Sri triggers Mira's jealousy and unease, driving an awkward, loaded wedge between mother and daughter. With Talati's simmering script in the hands of the film's extraordinarily talented leads, director of photography Jih-E Peng uses elegant cinematography to amplify both the tension and tenderness between them.</p><h2>Preeti Panigrahi and Kani Kusruti are magnificent</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p><em>Girls Will Be Girls</em> paints an exquisite portrait of complicated mother-daughter mechanics in the teen years, with exceptional performances from Panigrahi and Kusruti. As Mira, Panigrahi imbues her character with confidence, determination, and an unwavering stare. She privately defies societal expectations of teen girls while operating well within their parameters publicly. Meanwhile, Kusruti conceals a dynamic force of a woman within Anila, one protective of her daughter while seemingly mourning a teen awakening of her own.</p><p>Despite the main narrative concerning Mira's coming-of-age, the constant tension between her and Anila proves the heart of the film. Mira covertly attempts to buy time for sexual experimentation with Sri, frustrated by her lack of freedom. Anila, craving attention within her own marriage to Mira's perpetually absent father, begins to strangely compete with her daughter whenever Sri is around. A subtle and deeply resentful battle of access and maturity is weighed between mother and daughter, in which Anila constantly takes up the space Mira yearns for.</p><p>The thing is, both Mira and Anila know exactly what each other are doing. Every time. They don't directly say what they're thinking about each other, but anyone who's had a mother-daughter relationship will <em>know those looks</em>. Their charged interactions, edited to perfection by Amrita David, radiate with annoyance, loaded comments, and fierce glaring, not directly acknowledging their issues but making their disdain or defiance clear. Panigrahi and Kusruti's performances range from playfulness to suspicion to suppressed rage, all without ever screaming at each other. It's impeccable, and a different kind of anger than explored in <em>Everything Everywhere All At Once </em>but just as palpable.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Girls Will Be Girls</em> gently explores early sexual experiences without judgment</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Amid this tension over space and maturity, <em>Girls Will Be Girls</em> gives Mira ample time to embrace and investigate her sexual awakening, an awkward, relatable journey performed with bold courage by Panigrahi and Kiron, and sensitively handled by Talati, Peng, and David. </p><p>A true academic, Mira is determined to explore her newfound desires with all the scrutiny of an exam to study for. She's both fascinated by all of it and self-conscious of Sri's experience. Captured with handheld, intimate close ups and sound design, Mira's exploration feels non-judgmental. Talati doesn't seek to either glorify or vilify, letting the camera simply sit on minuscule moments of analysis, closeness, forgiveness, and betrayal.</p><p>In a confident, considerate performance from Kiron, Sri channels a maturity beyond his years, unfussed by Anila's concerns and easily assuaging her. And in a world saturated with teen dramas and coming-of-age films where girls are robbed of their agency, Mira's confidence and Sri's respect for her boundaries are incredibly refreshing. </p><h2><em>Girls Will Be Girls</em> demonstrates how boys are protected, girls are blamed</h2><p>Though it's not the main storyline, one of the persistent realities underlining the film is the double standard of how boys and girls' behaviour is considered within the school environment, a place which fosters misogynistic actions when it should be a vital base for unlearning them. Talati contrasts the strict conservatism of the boarding school &mdash; the left-right-left marching orders over the opening credits, wide shots of students standing to attention in perfect order at assembly &mdash; with both the burgeoning sexual tension between teenagers and the rampant harassment girls suffer from their male classmates. </p><p>Male students' abhorrent behaviour is largely allowed to run by the school while female students are blamed &mdash; especially for their skirt length. "Be careful with boys," the girls are instructed by their teacher. "Don't talk to them more than necessary. You're getting older, you need to be careful." Talati wields sound as an important tool here, thanks to sound team Carole Verner, Laure Arto, and Colin Favre-Bulle; boys' whispering is easily audible in the silent classrooms and halls, with only the sound of a camera snapping unmasking the act of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/gina-martin-history-becomes-her" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">upskirting</a>.</p><p>When Mira rejects the advances of her classmate, his vengeance is supported not only by his male peers but the school environment itself. Mira is shamed by her teacher as being "inappropriate" for hanging out with Sri. When Mira endures a terrifying experience, she doesn't call the police or the teachers, she calls Alina. It's through Mira's experiences that <em>Girls Will Be Girls</em> shows how vital education institutions are to fighting these systems of oppression. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/what-can-men-do-male-violence" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>As Rachel Thompson writes for Mashable</u></a>, "Tackling male violence means fighting misogyny on a societal level. That means educating boys and men about masculinity, gender roles, male entitlement, and their behaviour towards women and girls in all contexts, public or private."</p><p>Ultimately, the film isn't a lecture on this, but instead uses showing not telling to make it clear. <em>Girls Will Be Girls</em> manages to gently but authentically explore the complexities of girlhood through excellent performances, a minimalist script that trusts its actors, and superb, close cinematography. It's a tough job, to find unique ways to explore teen sexuality in cinema, but Talati defines a new perspective with a truly mesmerising film.</p><p><em>Girls Will Be Girls</em> hits cinemas in the U.S. Sept. 13 and in the UK and Ireland on Sept. 20.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/06s8SNImJskQsTCVSQjfLvB/hero-image.jpg" alt="Robbie Williams attends the "Better Man" Canadian Premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 09, 2024."><p>Cheers to Robbie Williams. The English singer-songwriter who made the leap from boy band to tabloid target to record-breaking solo artist has delivered once again. <em>Better Man </em>is a biopic that folds in hits from across his career &mdash;&nbsp;including "Angels," "She's the One," and "Rock DJ" &mdash;&nbsp;to bolster the artist&rsquo;s highs and lows. But Williams &mdash; in collaboration with writer/director Michael Gracey (<em>The Greatest Showman</em>) &mdash;&nbsp;has done something daring in the space of the music biopic, which has too often proved <a href="https://mashable.com/article/bob-marley-one-love-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>achingly clich</u></a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/bob-marley-one-love-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">&eacute;</a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/bob-marley-one-love-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>d</u></a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/back-to-black-amy-winehouse-movie-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>pandering</u></a>, or downright dull. He's turned himself into a literal dancing monkey.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Better Man</em> unfurls a tale of Williams' hardscrabble youth in Stoke-on-Trent, his bad-boy years in the British group Take That, his substance abuse issues, rocky romance with a fellow pop star, celebrity feuds, and family dramas, all while portraying the singer as a CGI chimpanzee in the vein of the <em>Planet of the Apes</em> reboots. At first, it might seem a cheeky gimmick (or cheeky monkey) meant to hook audiences with the sheer oddness of the choice. But Gracey nurtures this concept, weaving together a collaborative performance with actors and the legendary VFX studio W&#275;t&#257; FX to create a uniquely moving portrait of an artist at war with himself.&nbsp;</p><p>While the cadences of Williams' story fall into a familiar pattern, allowing himself to be presented as a literal animal brings a fresh perspective and an enthralling blend of humor and vulnerability. This results in the best music biopic since the rousing splendor of Elton John's <em>Rocketman</em> (which Gracey notably executive produced).&nbsp;</p><h2>Who plays Robbie Williams in <em>Better Man</em>?&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>This is a complicated question. Williams lends his voice to the narration, the words of which were penned by Gracey, Oliver Cole, and Simon Gleeson from interviews with the sensational singer. However, in the flesh, English actor Jonno Davies (<em>Hunters</em>) shoulders the role, blending a physicality that is part hulking chimpanzee and part swaggering sex symbol. While everyone around him on set is in period costume, Davies wore a motion-capture suit with a small camera perched above his face to track his expressions. From there, W&#275;t&#257; built chimp Robbie using Williams' own eyes (and various hairstyles) as inspiration. And the final touch: a voice that mixes Davies' and Williams' performances. All this blends seamlessly into a powerful performance that is one of the most surprising yet riveting of the year.&nbsp;</p><p>In the narration, Williams introduces himself with a smirking tone and a slew of insults that have been lobbed against him. Davies picks up that rough exterior with macho posturing, but complicates it with goofball bravado in churlish outbursts, juvenile gestures, and a self-pleasuring bit that's lewdly hilarious. But more than funny, <em>Better Man </em>is riveting because it embraces a warts-and-all approach that doesn't shy away from Williams' darkest moments.&nbsp;</p><p>You might think that scenes about drug use, infidelity, and self-harm would be undercut by this furry gimmick. But by the end of the first sequence &mdash; in which a young Robert (Jack Sherran) has a rough day at the playground &mdash; the chimp device makes sense. The animation W&#275;t&#257; created is so emotive, the performance behind it so grounded, that it just works, not only in moments of drama, but also in truly epic musical numbers.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Better Man </em>is stuffed with showstopping song and dance.&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>As in <em>Rocketman</em>, Gracey employs songs anachronistically. For instance, Take That's rise to fame is backed by "Rock DJ," which is a hit from Williams' solo career. This is not a glitch but a feature, as both films focus on the feeling of their story over cumbersome facts. This freedom to play Williams' hits as they make sense in the story (versus when they came in his life) allows for electrifying sequences of joy, agony, and romance.&nbsp;</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p><br>In the case of "Rock DJ," the young band celebrates their record deal by dancing together through several locations, from posh shops and double-decker buses to the streets of Piccadilly Circus, collecting more and more revelers along the way until the whole of London appears to share in their reveling. While this is perhaps the most ambitious musical sequence, among the most moving is "She's the One," where chimp Robbie performs a heartfelt duet while dancing a Golden Era ballroom number and dipping his female partner (Raechelle Banno) with eloquence that is utterly swoon-worthy. Yes, even when the leading man is a chimp.&nbsp;</p><p>However, not every song is a celebration.

<p>Embracing the visual language of music videos (of which Gracey has directed many), <em>Better Man </em>blends realistic settings with surreal scenarios. So a car crash in the rain results in a nightmare sequence where chimp Robbie is plunged underwater, then swarmed by fans who tear at him for mementos and paparazzi whose blinding cameras make his struggle to the surface all the harder. More traditional moments are in the mix, like a montage of Williams' magazine covers and music videos to chart his rising fame. But what might be a barrage of nostalgic or clich&eacute;d concert scenes is given fresh blood through bringing more chimp Robbies into frame.&nbsp;</p><p>When he looks out into the crowd roaring in appreciation, among them he sees himself, scowling. At first, it's one or two of his own faces staring back at him. But as Robbie's self-doubt grows, his self-saboteur, who hisses he's a failure, a fraud, unlovable, multiplies and becomes legion. The sharp cuts from the dancing chimp with his performative grin to the snarling doppelg&auml;ngers, all reminders of an embarrassment or failure, hit like a gasp. Even when the world seems to be at his feet, Robbie is running from himself. And this builds to an internal war made external through a brilliantly vicious battle scene&nbsp; that gives <em>Planet of the Apes</em> a run for its money.&nbsp;</p><p>This poignant use of CGI animation is also surrounded by a terrific supporting cast. Whether it&rsquo;s Steve Pemberton as Williams&rsquo; conniving deadbeat dad or Alison Steadman as his devoted grandmother, the actors bring a pulsing authenticity that makes this family, broken as it is, feel achingly real. This is all the more impressive considering they were acting opposite an actor wearing all that mo-cap gear. Together, cast and crew build a glorious complex look into the life a world-class entertainer whose arrogance and vulnerability are on balanced display. The result is a film that feels grandiose, outrageous, deeply personal, and joltingly relatable. It&rsquo;s <em>Billy Elliot </em>meets <em>Rocketman</em> meets <em>Planet of the Apes</em>. And it&rsquo;s so much more.&nbsp;</p><p>Rich in vibrant emotion, body-rocking musical numbers, daring performances, and a scorching tenderness, <em>Better Man</em> more than rocks. It rules.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Better Man </em>was reviewed out of its Canadian Premiere at the 2024 Toronto International Film Festival. The film opens in select theatres Dec. 25, 2024 and nationwide on Jan. 17, 2025.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Similar to the painstaking reportage Taddeo undertook to write her book, <em>Three Women</em>'s 10-episode run (each running at roughly an hour) takes a really deep dive into the story, with mixed results.&nbsp;</p><h2>What is <em>Three Women</em> about?&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The series brings to our screens the stories from the near decade Taddeo spent interviewing three American women about their sexual desires, how society has impacted the way they manifest, and how they feel about expressing them.&nbsp;</p><p>The book was released in 2019 during the height of the #MeToo movement. Taddeo's incredibly in-depth study into three real women &ndash; Maggie, Lina, and Sloane &mdash; and their bodily, emotional, and sexual desires aligned perfectly with a wider narrative of women demanding to be heard.&nbsp;</p><h2>Who plays the Three Women?</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Creevy plays Maggie, who reflects on an abusive, coercive relationship between herself and her teacher years prior. The series covers said real-life teacher <a href="https://www.thedickinsonpress.com/news/knodel-and-wife-take-stand-deny-he-had-sexual-relationship-with-student" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Aaron Knodel's trial</u></a>, and the misogyny embedded in the justice system, especially when it comes to crimes of sexual violence. Creevy carries the story with a steely innocence, knowing that what happened to her was wrong but often feeling silenced and bullied in response to her efforts to seek justice.&nbsp;</p><p>Wise is striking as Sloane, a restaurant owner and mother who deviates from her husband Richard's (<a href="https://mashable.com/video/three-women-blair-underwood" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Blair Underwood</u></a>) rules when it comes to their polyamorous relationship; he predominantly chooses her matches. Sloane struggles with feeling limited without choice, especially when she meets Will (Blair Redford) and forges a new connection &mdash; only to be met with slut-shaming comments from different people in her life, including her husband. Wise navigates this performance with warmth, grace, and humour, but balances it with incredibly precise fury when needed &mdash; and boy, is it needed. Though Sloane's story is relatively underserved throughout the series, she delivers of the show's most impactful lines about the stigma, guilt and shame around desire: "If [it] makes me a bad person, even if it makes me the worst person, I still want what I want."&nbsp;</p><div id="related-video" class="mx-auto mt-8 mb-12 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans md:mt-12 md:mb-16 text-primary-400">

<p>The character of Indiana homemaker Lina is brought to life with soft vulnerability by Gilpin. Lina is left wanting due to the lack of intimacy in her marriage, and starts to seek it elsewhere as desire starts to eat at her. Additionally, she harbours intense, complicated feelings for her high school boyfriend, who neglected her after she was raped as a teenager.</p><p>Lina's friendship with writer Gia (a character played by Woodley and based on Taddeo, who is expanded upon considerably in the TV series) is fraught, intense, and dysfunctional &mdash; a source of support but also codependence. Woodley's Gia is compelling, as she navigates grief from losing her parents at a young age, as well as other fertility and health issues while fighting to finish her book before she runs out of money. Her portrayal of these issues is important, and devastating at points, but ultimately detracts from the stories of the three women that Taddeo so carefully and artfully portrayed in her book.</p><h2>How does the <em>Three Women</em> TV adaptation hold up?</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>In the book, Taddeo switches perspectives between chapters to hear from the different women, but in the show, the hour-long episodes make the switching difficult to follow and for the viewer to feel close to each story. Each woman&rsquo;s account requires time and sensitivity, and these jarring roadblocks don't allow time to sit with the complexities of their sex lives. A key issue with <em>Three Women</em> is honouring the dramatisation of these true stories without veering into documentary territory, or stretching out the narrative too much. <em>Three Women</em> is, unfortunately, at times guilty of the latter.</p><p>It makes sense to flesh out more of Taddeo&rsquo;s book in a 10-episode TV series, but it also results in us spending episodes away from each story, meaning narratives as intense as Maggie's disappear from our screen for too long. Maggie's story explores a much darker area of grooming, consent, and abuse. We witness her teacher's use of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/dating-app-terms-glossary" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>love-bombing</u></a> and manipulation in haunting scenes in episode 8 (fittingly named "Twilight"), where the show explores the role of novels like Stephenie Meyer's romanticise abusive power dynamics.</p><p>We also see the appalling ways that survivors are treated when they report such abuse, with Maggie being asked what she wore when she was around Knodel, as well as endless interrogations around her own morality. Like the 2020 TV series <em>A Teacher</em>, which also offered a nuanced portrayal of teacher-student grooming, Maggie's story stands as a poignant example of how feelings of desire can be manipulated.</p><h2><em>Three Women</em> covers myriad aspects of female health issues, sexuality, and desire on screen</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>That being said, while the pacing and characterisation choices might detract from the wider story, and the show is still ultimately limited in whose story gets to be told, <em>Three Women</em> does try to cover more variation on the female sexual experience than shows that precede it.</p><p>Through the series' many, many sex scenes, we see examples of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/rachel-thompson-rough-sexual-violence-book" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>stealthing</u></a> (an act of sexual violence when someone either lies about putting a condom on or removes it without the other person's permission), <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-have-period-sex" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>period sex</u></a>, as well as <a href="https://mashable.com/series/feeling-yourself" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>masturbation</u></a>. It brings into sharp relief the acute, overwhelming nature of desire, causing us to reflect on the ways that society often shames women for these feelings. By seeing these cravings up close, as well as the way women are often violated by men's desire, we are confronted with the realities of the female sexual experience &ndash; both the liberating and the damaging.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When it comes to the duty <em>Three Women</em> pays to the stories told about women's bodies, we also see the debilitating impact of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/endometriosis-sex-lives" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>endometriosis</u></a> pain and the dismissive nature of both Lina's husband and medical professionals about it. We also see Sloane's grappling with an eating disorder as well as the aftermath of a miscarriage.&nbsp;</p><p>So often, the stories told around women&rsquo;s bodies, as well as on-screen portrayals of female desire, feel either sanitised, romanticised, or one-dimensional, leaving out the nuance, messiness, and guilt that come with living in a patriarchal society. <em>Three Women</em> hits back against this norm.</p><h2><em>Three Women</em> is ultimately an empowering watch</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>What's refreshing about <em>Three Women</em> isn't just its close look at so many areas of the sexual and desire spectrums for women, but also its focus on different women's walks of life. While <em>Sex and the City</em> and <em>Girls</em>, for example, portrayed sexual exploration from a specifically metropolitan, New York City-centric, white point of view, Taddeo's characters are based on real-life women from middle parts of America, including North Dakota and Indiana. The result is a more holistic portrayal of women's sex lives &mdash; though it must be pointed out, three of the four lead actors are white women.</p><p>Ultimately, <em>Three Women</em> is about feeling heard and hearing others. All three women express the empowerment they feel at telling their story to someone, and Gia is empowered by hearing them. As Sloane tells Gia, "I'm tired of stories of women not winning."&nbsp;</p><p>It's debatable whether any of the women "win" in a wider sense &ndash; but perhaps their stories being told, and the people the TV series will touch as a result, is a victory in itself.</p><p><strong>How to watch: </strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/QGVo48?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Three%20Women%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Starz.&object_type=article&object_uuid=000hNP8z0N6JMJ6MHGt12My&short_url=QGVo48&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Three Women</em> is now streaming on Starz.</a></p><p><em>If you have experienced sexual abuse, call the free, confidential National Sexual Assault hotline at 1-800-656-HOPE (4673), or access the 24-7 help online by visiting <a href="http://online.rainn.org" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>online.rainn.org</u></a></em><em>.</em></p><p><em>If you feel like you&rsquo;d like to talk to someone about your eating behavior, text "NEDA" to the Crisis Text Line at 741-741 to be connected with a trained volunteer or visit the National Eating Disorder Association <a href="https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>website</u></a></em><em> for more information.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

Unfortunately, this very feature &ndash; called Persona &ndash; could've been used by hackers to steal a Vision Pro user's sensitive data. </p><p>The security flaw was discovered by a group of six computer scientists from the University of Florida's Department of Computer Science, and it was first reported on by <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-vision-pro-persona-eye-tracking-spy-typing/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Wired</a>. </p><p>The <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/gazeploit/home" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">GAZEploit attack</a>, as it was dubbed by the researchers, works by tracking the eye movements of a user's Persona to identify when they're typing something on the Vision Pro's virtual keyboard. The researchers discovered that users tend to direct their gaze onto specific keys that they're about to click, and were able to construct an algorithm that identified what the users were typing. The results were quite accurate; for example, the researchers were able to identify the correct letters of users' passwords 77 percent of the time. When it came to detecting what people were typing in a message, the results were accurate 92 percent of the time. </p><p>The researchers disclosed the vulnerability to Apple back in April, and Apple fixed it in visionOS 1.3, which came out in July. In the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/120915" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">release notes</a>, Apple says that the flaw enabled inputs to the virtual keyboard to be inferred from Persona. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

<p>"The issue was addressed by suspending Persona when the virtual keyboard is active," Apple wrote in the release notes. Vision Pro users who haven't yet updated to the latest version are advised to do so as soon as possible.</p><p>While simply disabling Persona while the user is typing was a pretty simple fix, the flaw does raise the question of just how much info a malicious hacker could infer just by observing a virtual version of you.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>The researchers said that the attack hasn't been used against someone using Personas in the real world. But what makes this attack particularly dangerous is that it only requires a video recording of someone's Persona while the person was typing, meaning an attacker could still use it on an older video. It seems that the only way to mitigate this issue is to erase any publicly available videos where your Persona is visible while typing; we've reached out to Apple for clarification on what can be done to protect your data.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2><strong>Apple Watch Series 9 vs. SE: price and specs</strong></h2><p>I got the cheapest model for both variants.

For example, a stainless steel chassis is an extra $50. A larger case size (i.e., 44mm) is an extra $30. If you want GPS <em>and</em> cellular support, that will set you back $50.</p><p>The Apple Watch Series 9 costs $399 on <a href="https://zdcs.link/noZnj?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%27s%20official%20website&object_type=article&object_uuid=041zHV4nuEy4RO8CDB4dhK0&short_url=noZnj&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Apple's official website</a> (again, this is the cheapest you can get in this model).</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2><strong>Apple Watch Series 9 vs. SE: Display</strong></h2><p>The first thing I noticed about the Watch SE is that it has thicker bezels, which reduces its screen real estate &mdash; and the display is minimal to begin with.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The Watch Series 9's bezels are a lot less obstructive, but either way, I still found display navigation to be fine on both screens. Thicker bezels, in my opinion, aren't a big deal. </p><p>It's also worth nothing that the resolution is different for the watches:</p><p><strong>Watch Series 9 (41mm) - 430 x 352 pixels </strong></p><p><strong>Watch SE (40mm) - 394 x 324 pixels </strong></p><p>Looking at them side by side, the Watch Series 9 definitely delivers a sharper, clearer visuals. But if I were looking at the Watch SE independently, I would think that the display quality is sufficient enough. </p><p>Now, let's talk brightness:</p><p><strong>Watch Series 9 (41mm) - up to 2,000 nits</strong></p><p><strong>Watch SE (40mm) - up to 1,000 nits</strong></p><p>The Watch Series 9 is supposedly brighter than Series 9, delivering a max of 2,000 nits over the SE's 1,000-nit screen. However, while comparing both watches in the sun, I could see both of them just fine, even with the rays shining bright on them like a spotlight. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>You can tell the Watch SE is <em>slightly </em>dimmer, but the difference is negligible to the naked eye.</p><p>The main difference between the two screens, however, is the always-on display. I thought I wouldn't care about the Watch SE not having an always-on display (AOD). (For the uninitiated, AOD means that the screen is always feeding you visual information.)</p><p>However, I found myself getting frustrated that I had to keep either touching the Watch SE's screen or flick my wrist toward myself to check the time. Meanwhile, the Watch Series 9, well, <em>stays on</em>. As you can see in the photo below, the Watch SE's screen is completely dark, but the Series 9's display is still "active" (though it is dimmed). </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>I went with the Silver finish for the Watch SE along with the Ocean Blue solo loop &mdash; and I regret it. Oddly, the solo loop collects dirt easily. And unlike the sports band that's featured on the Watch Series 9, the solo loop requires custom sizing.

<p>The sports band has an adjustable strap, allowing me to make it as tight or loose as I need it to be. The solo loop, on the other hand, is just a stretchy bracelet band.

However, you <em>will </em>find it on the Apple Watch Series 9. It prompts you to hold your finger on the digital crown for 30 seconds. You'll then get a reading that tells you your beats per minute (bpm) &mdash; and whether your heartbeat is "sinus," "AFib," "low heart rate," "high heart rate," or "inconclusive."</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Speaking of the temperature sensor, on the Watch Series 9, you can get temperature readings of your skin by going to <strong>Settings &gt; Health &gt; Health Data &gt; Body Measurements &gt; Wrist Temperature</strong>. Not sure why I need to know that my right wrist is 96 degrees Fahrenheit, but er, it's there in case anyone asks, I guess.</p><p>Interestingly, I also noticed that both watches test for environmental noise using the mics.

(To whet your appetite upon signup, the main landing page flashes a few statistics, including "98,897,765 hot photos" and "3,495,277 connections," but we're not exactly sure what that means.) Most traffic originates from the United States, followed by visitors from the United Kingdom and Canada.

<p>Specifics on the demographic that most people care about &mdash; the gender ratio &mdash;&nbsp;can be hard to track down. Sanders told us that "there's a two to one ratio of single men versus categories like single women, couples, and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/what-is-consensual-non-monogamy" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">groups</a>."

Despite trying to be a sex-positive site with blog posts, groups, a sex academy, and more, its language for the LGBTQ community has historically been anything but inclusive or positive. Previously, the AFF sign-up page listed "TG/TV/TS" as the "trans" gender selection &mdash; we'll let you infer what those stand for. After reaching out to AdultFriendFinder about it, this language has improved some with more gender options that are appropriately labeled &mdash; though "trans" is still a separate selection from "man" or "woman."</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>Should you sign up for AdultFriendFinder?</h2><p>If you're 100 percent over being grilled with relationship questions and the slow-and-steady pace on traditional dating sites like <a href="https://mashable.com/review/eharmony-vs-match" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">eharmony or Match</a>, AdultFriendFinder is your golden ticket to instant communication. Registering takes about 30 seconds &mdash;&nbsp;it requires nothing from you aside from an email address, a username, a password, and an introduction. Your notifications will start pouring in even without adding any juicy info (because people see nothing wrong with hitting up a profile with a gray silhouette as a profile photo, apparently), but it's probably best to add a few photos and a detailed description &mdash; both to up your chances of flirtation or finding someone who shares a super-specific fantasy, and also to signal to other users that you're not a bot.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>After registering, there are a ton of ways to personalize your account (way more than you'd expect for a hookup site, honestly). The more you fill out, the more attractive your profile will be to new viewers. There are the basic physical appearance questions about eye and hair color, and since I identified as a woman, cup size was an option. (If you identify as a man, I'm sure you can guess what question they ask.) </p><p>Many self-proclaimed hookup seekers can probably admit that they'd still like to hook up with someone they'd also like to grab a beer with, especially if they plan to see that person multiple times. Those people will appreciate that AFF gives a compatibility score with each user you come across: a metric that rates how well you might mesh with someone in the bedroom based on how you answered questions about what turns you on, whether you're dominant or submissive, and so on.</p><p>The site also features a personality test and a "My Kinks" form where you can select whether or not you're "curious about, into, or can't live without" a certain kink (e.g., anal, bondage, role play, etc.). It also lets you choose whether you're a voyeur, the giver, or the receiver. </p><p>One weird thing about the Personality Type test is that it asks several questions about whether or not you enjoy shopping at discount stores &mdash; not really sure what that's about. It also asks whether or not "a quiet time for prayer should be allowed in school." You can choose "strongly disagree, somewhat disagree, somewhat agree, or strongly agree."</p><p>Once you finish the personality test (20 questions), you can opt to have your Personality Type show up on your profile or have it hidden.

<h2>Finding a match on AdultFriendFinder</h2><p>Like a traditional dating site, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aeBO5?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=AdultFriendFinder&object_type=review&object_uuid=0584LOJucOI7y32ZFmDy9gV&short_url=aeBO5&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">AdultFriendFinder</a> gives you a collage of potential matches and will let you know who's online or close distance-wise. These will be random right after you sign up, but you can opt to update your preferences to refine your results: Choose your preferred gender(s), age range, location and mile radius, race, sexual orientation, body type, and marital status.</p><p>You <em>barely</em> have to scroll before noticing that there's no shortage of nudity. Depending on whether you set your preferences to men, women, or both, you'll see all of that stuff up close, personal, swinging around, in action. You name it, it'll pop up. </p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/aeBO5?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=AdultFriendFinder&object_type=review&object_uuid=0584LOJucOI7y32ZFmDy9gV&short_url=aeBO5&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">AdultFriendFinder</a> is basically like a <a href="https://mashable.com/category/pornhub" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">PornHub</a> that you can interact with. We probably don't have to say this, but AdultFriendFinder is NSFW and not safe to be on while kids are in the room. If you'd rather not see the site's raunchier side, it offers a "no nudity" option, but I still wouldn't trust this filter enough to be online in a family setting or at work. Some videos will be blurred out and read "Naughty video" until you upgrade to a Gold Membership, but trust me &mdash;&nbsp;you'll get to see a lot, even with the free version.</p><p>The message section is set up similarly to a Gmail account, and you can mark things as read or important just as you would on a real email. You'll receive some crude messages instantly (creeps on Tinder do the same thing), but some will be genuinely friendly.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>AFF is not all bad</h2><p>Once you get past the in-your-face sexplosion of naked profile pictures, horny AIM-era profile names, and explicit videos, there are actually an impressive number of resources to help make your experience as satisfying as possible. Some will cost money even outside of the paid subscription, which is kind of dumb. </p><p>Aside from the NSFW content, the website is relatively straightforward (albeit ugly). Every feature is advertised in big letters, notifications are displayed clearly with labels, and you don't really have to click around to find anything. This makes it super accessible for users of all ages, even those who aren't tech-savvy and can't even figure out Facebook. Buttons are all over the place, but you figure it out after messing around for a few minutes.</p><p>Activities range from direct messaging, sending virtual gifts and tips, watching live videos of people in your feed, joining adult chat rooms that can get <em>very </em>niche, or entering photo contests.</p><q>
    AdultFriendFinder is like a PornHub that you can interact with.

<p>Think of AdultFriendFinder as the dating site version of New York City &mdash; it never sleeps. You'll find people who work the regular 9 to 5, people who work the night shift, and people in other time zones, so it's nearly impossible to log on and not have people to talk to. You know, like that booty call who's always awake when you text them.</p><p>Or at least that <em>used</em> to be the case... 10 years ago. What was once a hot site that a few <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/94sji/i_am_a_gold_member_on_adultfriendfinder_and_an/#bottom-comments" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Reddit users</a> were quick to hype up is now one of the dating sites that Reddit users can't help but diss &mdash; in the few instances that AFF is even being discussed at all. It's notable that, on a site where online dating is such a mammoth topic of discussion, AdultFriendFinder has rarely been mentioned in a positive light since the early 2010s. The Reddit community is diverse and open-minded; if a dating site exists, someone on Reddit has used it and has an opinion. When <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/25ss49/adult_friend_finder_is_it_useful_at_all_dangerous/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">an innocent soul does ask if it's legit</a>, AFF usually gets dragged for sketchy pricing and being riddled with bots.</p><p>However, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineDating/comments/11jk2qj/honest_review_on_adultfriendfinder_needed/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">some Reddit members</a> have praised AFF as a site for men meeting men. Even so, the site's still buggy and isn't exactly great for meeting real people who aren't, as one Reddit user so eloquently put it, "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineDating/comments/11jk2qj/comment/jb3dy13/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">busted and unstable</a>." </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>Paid memberships are where things get... interesting</h2><p>You can do a decent amount of exploring without paying a cent: Limited messaging and emailing, visit and like most profiles, and enter some chat rooms. But just a few clicks on <a href="https://zdcs.link/aeBO5?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=AdultFriendFinder&object_type=review&object_uuid=0584LOJucOI7y32ZFmDy9gV&short_url=aeBO5&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">AdultFriendFinder</a> can send you deep down the rabbit hole, and a lot of that juicier hidden content can only be unlocked with a paid membership (called the Gold membership) or by earning points.</p><p>Points are AdultFriendFinder's non-monetary currency. If you use the free version, you'll have to earn points through on-site activity to unlock stuff that's exclusive to paying members. It's kind of like a game, with points acting like dollar bills at the strip club.</p><p>A Gold membership is pretty much the standard if you're a guy looking for girls. While researching on Reddit, we found a few women who said they wouldn't meet a guy unless he's a Gold member. A Gold membership puts a little bit more credibility behind someone's profile and makes the whole encounter feel a bit safer. It's easier to believe that someone's a real person if they're a paying, active member of the site, and it's nice to know that they're taking it slightly seriously. Plus, if you see a picture or profile that looks like it's 10 years old, it really might be &mdash;&nbsp;there are a ton of non-active, non-paying profiles from old members and escorts still lingering. </p><p>AdultFriendFinder also gives members the option to confirm their identity with ConfirmID. If you do this, the site promises to give you two weeks of Gold for free. The ConfirmID works by entering your legal first and last name, home address, gender, and date of birth and uploading a copy of your driver's license, passport, or other government-issued ID. </p><p>If you spend more quality time on the site than expected, becoming a paid member is definitely something to consider. Once you're paying, you basically become royalty on the site: Your profile will appear way higher in searches, you can use the most advanced searches, unlock profiles with private photo albums, check out video profiles, and message to your heart's content. A general rule is that increased involvement and payment on your end generally equals more success on the website, as your constant activity and heightened searchability make it easier for others to find you.</p><h2>AdultFriendFinder pricing</h2><p>Prices for a Gold membership fluctuate but generally get cheaper the longer your subscription is: Get one month for $27.95, three months for $20.95 per month ($62.82 total), or 12 months for $14.95 per month ($179.40 total). The three-month membership is billed quarterly, while the 12-month membership is billed annually. With a Gold membership, free members cannot contact you, but they can still see your profile. </p><p>In addition to the Gold membership, AdultFriendFinder also offers Voyeur (enhanced profile gallery and hi-res member videos viewing) at $14.99 per month, Interaction (enhanced member-to-member interaction) at $14.99 per month, Chat Plus (enhanced direct member-to-member communication) at $9.99 per month, and Advanced Search and Highlight at $4.99 per month.</p><p>This is the pricing at the time of publishing, but according to AdultFriendFinder, pricing is subject to change.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2>Good for: Very open-minded people looking to blow off steam</h2><p>Stating the obvious, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aeBO5?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=AdultFriendFinder&object_type=review&object_uuid=0584LOJucOI7y32ZFmDy9gV&short_url=aeBO5&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">AdultFriendFinder</a> is a space for people who want to <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-hookup-apps" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">bang with no strings attached</a>, people who are in a sexual rut, people who are tired of porn, and people who find sites like <a href="https://mashable.com/review/eharmony-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">eharmony</a> boring. Getting to know someone for weeks before meeting up can be exhausting, and sometimes, you want to skip the small talk and do the dirty with a random. It's gonna get kinky out there, and that's great for those who are dying to blow off steam and want someone who will respond well to a brusque, sexy message.</p><p>People are so active on this site that it's impossible not to feel desired. You'll probably get a flood of message notifications, and once you come across your first legit suitor, you'll start to loosen up. Even if you're left on read a few times, you'll learn which opening lines and flirty comments work and which don't. But since the site is aimed toward casual sex and encounters and not <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-sites-for-serious-relationships" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">serious relationships</a>, the whole rejection thing isn't nearly as prevalent. </p><p>As with all dating sites, catfishing is a big buzzkill. Your chances of being pursued are way higher if you have a lot of pictures of the same person (AKA you), videos, and a genuine profile that lets people know they're not dealing with something sketchy. Even if you've had bad luck with online dating in the past, AdultFriendFinder is the place to be honest. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>Bad for: People looking for a real relationship and the entire socially conscious community</h2><p>You know those warnings that thrill rides at amusement parks are required to put up that tell people who get dizzy easily or have heart problems to not get on the ride? AdultFriendFinder could use something like that. This site is not for the faint of heart &mdash; if you're a cynic, conservative by any means, get sketched out easily, or aren't a fan of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/cyberflashing-unsolicited-dick-pics-terminology" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">dick pics</a>, you'll probably hate it. Similarly, if you appreciate a well-crafted, aesthetically pleasing website that feels safe &mdash; no matter how badly you want to have sex &mdash; one glance at the landing page likely signals that it's not for you.</p><p>AdultFriendFinder is not the place to be if you're trying to make friends unless "with benefits" is tacked onto the end. Every inch of the site screams "this website is used to have sex," and you should really listen to that.</p><p>As illustrated by the recent flood of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/user-made-educational-instagram-guides" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">artsy activism guides on Instagram</a>, it's clear what content appeals to young people on the internet: Something aesthetically pleasing, sharable, and digestible. The "sharable" part doesn't totally apply to online dating, but apps like Hinge and OkCupid closely follow this design trend by limiting the number of words (and ads) in each tab, steering clear of endless scrolling, and ensuring that important info isn't cluttered with flashing clickbait. </p><p>For instance, <a href="https://zdcs.link/Gp84K?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Pure&object_type=review&object_uuid=0584LOJucOI7y32ZFmDy9gV&short_url=Gp84K&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Pure</a> is a modern, no-strings-attached hookup app that appeals to your horny side with a single, witty statement about sex rather than bombarding you with boobs and "Have sex in NYC now!" claims. Anyone older than a millennial may be totally used to this pop-up-ridden layout, which seemed to be popular in the early 2000s &mdash; but for younger folks, AFF's chaotic approach is way too reminiscent of Omegle.</p><h2>AFF could do so much more to make people take it seriously</h2><p>The entire website looks like an ad about hot MILFs that pops up when you're illegally streaming a movie. Seriously, it's bad. Even though the AFF website is technically legit, the pictures, word choice, and exclamation points everywhere <em>scream</em> "scam." No, AdultFriendFinder, "98,897,765 Hot Photos" is not the way to make potential new users trust you.</p><p>We're not knocking a quick hookup or no-strings-attached relations. This isn't about morals. Genitals are quite literally in your face from the moment you make an account, and that's just not cute. There are chiller ways to go about insinuating that this is a hookup website <em>without</em> feeling like you're trapped in a sex dungeon with strangers.</p><p>I could not get past the fact that the entire site looks like it's about to invite five viruses to your computer. We're talking terrible graphics that look like they were made on Microsoft Paint and pictures of women who look like they're from Pornhub in 2007. (That's when AdultFriendFinder was officially sold and rebranded from its original parent company.) <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Snoo53279/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Reddit user Snoo53279</a> summed it up in a comment from July 2020: "The people on AFF are definitely real, but there is a huge smattering of bots that also get in the way so it can be a bit of a PITA to use." If they're not bots, they could be <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/cnc46f/adultfriendfindera_study_in_all_thats_wrong_with/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">men posing as a couple</a> to seem less threatening.</p><p>The parade of women on the landing page is questionable for two reasons. This shouldn't even need to be clarified, but not everyone is looking for a woman. At the least, the advertising isn't inclusive &mdash; but this crosses into fetishization territory. The cherry on top is that the women in the photos (unsurprisingly) probably aren't even members of the site, according to a disclaimer at the bottom of the landing page.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>AdultFriendFinder's overall outdated vibe goes past an aesthetic annoyance &mdash; it's downright problematic at times. The lack of inclusivity for the LGBTQ+ community is nearly unforgivable, and we'd be scared to see some of the related rhetoric that AFF users feel comfortable spewing. Without even a dash of social awareness, it's hard to see how anyone who's not an out-of-touch straight cis man would feel comfortable on this site.</p><p>Attempting to navigate the shoddy design might be enough to smother your horniness. Three main issues can make the site borderline unusable: It looks shady as hell, an alarming portion of the user base is made up of bots and spam accounts, and the user interface itself is outdated and rife with bugs.</p><p>Other Reddit users mention that the desktop web version won't even load for them at random times &mdash; an especially frustrating roadblock for people who want to end their membership and stop monthly charges. A solution to the laggy web version might be to clear your cache or use the smartphone app, but your experience probably won't improve. <a href="https://zdcs.link/mvG1J?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=AFF%27s%20mobile%20page&object_type=review&object_uuid=0584LOJucOI7y32ZFmDy9gV&short_url=mvG1J&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">AFF's mobile page</a> doesn't even mention an Android app, and the link to the iPhone app brings up a "not available" pop-up in the App Store.

While other hookup sites like AdultFriendFinder have names like FreeSnapMilfs.com, Fuckswipe.com, and Instabang.com, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aeBO5?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=AdultFriendFinder&object_type=review&object_uuid=0584LOJucOI7y32ZFmDy9gV&short_url=aeBO5&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">AdultFriendFinder</a> will be the one you'd hate showing up in your Google search history the least. Most have the same general idea: to find sexual partners, have cybersex, etc., but with names like those, the authenticity is way too questionable. AdultFriendFinder boasts a much larger audience and has built credibility in a Tinder-saturated market where these blunt, friskier competitors may have trouble gaining trust.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>No matter <em>how</em> in the mood you are, your hungry eyes may not be able to look past AFF's heinous interface. We mentioned <a href="https://zdcs.link/emvp1?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Pure&object_type=review&object_uuid=0584LOJucOI7y32ZFmDy9gV&short_url=emvp1&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Pure</a> earlier. The aesthetically pleasing, hella-millennial UX design is simply more palatable than AFF and the blueprint of what a modern hookup app should be. Kind of like a Snapchat for sex; your uploaded selfies, personal info, and conversations will self-destruct every 60 minutes. The app will send the hookup version of an Uber request to anyone close and ready to rumble, and you can choose what information to disclose from there. </p><p>Remember when we said AdultFriendFinder would be a nightmare for gay and bi women? <a href="https://zdcs.link/p8BLv?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Feeld&object_type=review&object_uuid=0584LOJucOI7y32ZFmDy9gV&short_url=p8BLv&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Feeld</a> is our favorite alternative app dedicated to singles and couples looking for threesomes, foursomes, or however many people you want &mdash;&nbsp;<a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-apps-for-bisexual-people" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">minus the unicorn hunting</a> and rampant fetishization that many non-hetero, non-monogamous people face on traditional hookup sites and apps.

Feeld has since told Mashable that locations shared were not users' current exact locations, rather the name of the city, town, or borough.</p><h2>The final verdict: Is AdultFriendFinder worth it?</h2><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/aeBO5?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=AdultFriendFinder&object_type=review&object_uuid=0584LOJucOI7y32ZFmDy9gV&short_url=aeBO5&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">AdultFriendFinder</a> is a low-pressure way to find a friends-with-benefits situation without insulting anyone. Everyone is pretty much there for the same reason &mdash; and though it'll feel pretty unorthodox if you've only ever used Tinder to scope this type of thing out, AFF's blunt advertising at least means you won't have to explain that you're not looking for a relationship. It's niche-friendly, well-populated, and has a ton of interactive outlets to indulge your primal urges.</p><p>But that freedom comes with a price &mdash;&nbsp;the price is feeling like one of those people who fall for the ads that pop up before a free Pornhub video. It's not that a site dedicated to sex and sexting is inherently scammy &mdash;&nbsp;it's that AdultFriendFinder drowns you with explicit photos on profiles that might not even be real people while asking you to pay for a subscription with every click. </p><p>Unfortunately, no matter how in the mood you are, some people aren't cut out for the nothing-left-to-the-imagination approach with grammar mistakes all over the place. It wants to be sex-positive so badly, but the language the site has used in reference to the trans community is the furthest thing from that.</p><p>The functionality and safety of the site and the mobile app aren't where they need to be in 2023. If security measures were tightened, graphics and photos were cleaned up to feel more relevant, and decision-makers behind the scenes were given a lesson in inclusivity and pronouns/identities, AdultFriendFinder could be a handy tool to find attachment-free hookups and connect with a community that's down for anything.</p><p>This isn't a dating or hookup site we would personally use, but if you're feeling brave, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aeBO5?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=you%20can%20register%20for%20AdultFriendFinder%20here&object_type=review&object_uuid=0584LOJucOI7y32ZFmDy9gV&short_url=aeBO5&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">you can register for AdultFriendFinder here</a>.

Previous editions of the Razr caught my attention when they were first announced, but lackluster reviews had me hesitating. Yes, I used (and loved) my Razr V3 back in high school, but a foldable phone in 2024? It seemed more like a gimmick than genuinely useful, but the updated Razr+ had me intrigued, so I decided to try it out for myself.&nbsp;</p><h2>Using a foldable phone for the first time is weird</h2><p>Straight out of the box, the 2023 Motorola Razr+ was a bit bigger than I expected. It&rsquo;s more elongated than other smartphones I&rsquo;ve seen &mdash; it&rsquo;s over an inch longer than my iPhone 11 Pro, despite being nearly identical in width &mdash; which makes it feel slightly awkward in the hand. It&rsquo;s also longer than other foldable phones I&rsquo;ve seen on the market, like the 5.67-inch <a href="https://mashable.com/review/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5</a>, despite having similar widths and identical thicknesses.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Folded, however, the Razr+ is a portable dream. It&rsquo;s a slim 0.59 inches closed, making it easy to slip into any pocket, and I was shocked by how much I liked the form factor from the get-go. Is it weird the first time you fold it? Absolutely. But is it sturdy and durable? Surprisingly, yes.&nbsp;</p><p>The external display is also an immediate win, especially given its upgraded size. The 2023 Razr+ boasts a 3.6-inch pOLED display along with a 6.9-inch FHD+ flexible AMOLED main display, both of which are colorful, bright, and responsive. The device itself runs on Android 13, and &mdash; with 256GB of internal storage and 8GB of RAM &mdash; the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 processor makes this phone fast <em>and</em> fun.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Motorola Razr+ helped me cut down my screen time</h2><p>When I first heard about foldable phones, I had a sneaking suspicion that I would like them. Using the <a href="https://zdcs.link/a0XNr5?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Motorola%20Razr%2B&object_type=review&object_uuid=00t4cDGXt4TIG3OlSx9Grqa&short_url=a0XNr5&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Motorola Razr+</a> proved me right&hellip;and then some. Not only is it incredibly portable and convenient, but the external display changed how I interacted with my phone on a regular basis. While you can customize the apps on the external display, I chose to limit what I placed on that screen, and I basically turned it into a modified &ldquo;dumb phone.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>I could read text messages, make calls, view my calendar, listen to Spotify, and check the weather&hellip;but anything else required opening the phone itself. As a result, my phone usage plummeted. I wasn&rsquo;t scrolling on social media, watching YouTube videos, or playing games as much as I used to, which made the Razr+ a much-appreciated companion to my work-from-home life.&nbsp;</p><h2>The external display has clutch benefits</h2><p>Even for those who aren&rsquo;t trying to cut down on their screen time, the upgraded external display is wicked cool for a few other reasons. Not only is it almost a full inch bigger than the 2022 Razr, but that extra space actually makes sense. You can watch videos, play games, make payments, check email, and more &mdash; and it&rsquo;s easy to customize the external display to your own preferences.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Beyond that, one of my favorite features was the ability to use the external display as an image preview for the back camera. Not only did it make taking selfies a breeze, but &mdash; as someone whose partner isn&rsquo;t the best at taking flattering photos &mdash; I loved being able to pass him the phone, view the photo before he captured it, and adjust accordingly. Add in the ability to bend the phone at a 90-degree angle and place it on any surface without needing a stand or tripod? I can absolutely understand how a foldable phone is worth the hype, especially for content creators on the go.&nbsp;</p><h2>The camera left something to be desired</h2><p>While I loved how the external display changed the game when it came to taking photos or recording video, I found myself disappointed with one major area: the camera quality itself.</p><p>First things first, I&rsquo;m definitely not an expert in this area. I have a background in portrait photography, so I know how to capture a great photo, but camera specs definitely aren&rsquo;t my forte. However, I did some research and found that other users were similarly frustrated with the Razr+. It&rsquo;s not that the camera quality is bad, but it&rsquo;s just&hellip;OK.</p><p>The Motorola Razr+ (2023) comes with two rear cameras &mdash; a 12MP (f/1.5, 1.4&micro;m) primary camera with optical image stabilization, as well as a 13MP ultra-wide (f.2/2, 1.12&micro;m) &mdash; and a 32MP (f/2.4, 0.7 &micro;m) front camera. There&rsquo;s also an overwhelmingly large amount of camera software built in &mdash; including dual capture, live filters, auto night vision, pro mode, Google Lens integration, and more &mdash; but while some of it was fun to play with, none of it really wowed me.&nbsp;</p><p>Are the photos better than my old iPhone 11 Pro? Absolutely. But are they anywhere near as good as other smartphones on the market? Not in my opinion.&nbsp;</p><p>The video quality, in particular, was my biggest gripe. Even in good lighting, none of the cameras did a great job of capturing detail on my face, so my features were ever-so-slightly blurred. I tried switching to 4K &mdash; and snapped a quick selfie in the same lighting, which looked fantastic &mdash; but nothing seemed to work. Did it have great color balance? Yes. Was the sound quality better? Absolutely. However, I still found myself reaching for my iPhone to record video, especially if I was posting on TikTok.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>I&rsquo;m not sure the Razr+ can replace my iPhone</h2><p>Unfortunately, those weren&rsquo;t my only issues with the Razr+. The phone runs a little hot, the built-in speakers aren&rsquo;t great, and the 3800 mAh battery doesn&rsquo;t quite last as long as I&rsquo;d hoped with heavy use. That being said, I did find myself using this phone less than normal &mdash; which was a huge plus in my book &mdash; so I was able to make the battery life stretch simply because I wasn&rsquo;t on my phone as often.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2>Is the Motorola Razr+ worth it?</h2><p>For casual users &mdash; or diehard fans of foldable phones &mdash; it&rsquo;s definitely worth considering. Retailing at $999 (and frequently on sale), it&rsquo;s definitely a better phone than any of its predecessors, enough so that it feels like a worthy opponent to the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip5. The upgraded external display is fantastic, the phone itself is reliable and easy to use, and it comes in super fun colors, like the iconic viva magenta.&nbsp;</p><p>If you&rsquo;re on the fence, or if you&rsquo;re looking for a fantastic camera, then you might want to look elsewhere. It&rsquo;s not that the <a href="https://zdcs.link/a0XNr5?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=2023%20Motorola%20Razr%2B&object_type=review&object_uuid=00t4cDGXt4TIG3OlSx9Grqa&short_url=a0XNr5&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">2023 Motorola Razr+</a> is <em>bad</em>, it&rsquo;s just&hellip;not great, either.

      <description><![CDATA["Flow" is an animated animal adventure unlike anything you've seen before. TIFF review.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/06cOHznU6rjV1xnoIEHlhMs/hero-image.jpg" alt="A scene from "Flow.""><p>There's a deceptive simplicity to <em>Flow. </em>The premise of this animated film seems familiar: A motley band of animals join together to survive a terrible threat. But part of what makes co-writer/director Gints Zilbalodis' outing so sensational is its gentle rejection of American cartoon cliches.&nbsp;</p><p>While the premise of this movie might sound like <em>Madagascar, Ice Age,</em> <em>A Bug's Life, </em>or <em>Zootopia </em>or any number of cutesy, kid-focused animated adventures, <em>Flow </em>refuses to turn its animals into wacky characters, perfectly suited for lunch boxes and plush toys. Zilbalodis' hairy heroes don't have big googly eyes or sport spiffy clothes. They aren't voiced by A-lister actors. They don't speak a human language at all. This gaggle of critters mew or moan or cluck or chitter. And they move not with an anthropomorphic flare, but with a realistic anatomy and act as their real-life cohorts might.&nbsp;</p><p>While Zilbalodis strives for authenticity in the physicality of his creatures, he rejects the photorealism of &mdash;&nbsp;for instance &mdash; <a href="https://mashable.com/video/mufasa-the-lion-king-trailer" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Disney's "live-action" remake of </a><a href="https://mashable.com/video/mufasa-the-lion-king-trailer" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>The Lion King</em></a><em>. </em>Instead, he creates <em>Flow </em>with a digital painting style that leans into the abstract. Every hair or feather or scale will not be dedicatedly rendered to awe the audience with the endeavor. His animals are made up of splotches of color that shift in light and shadow, effectively grounding them in an uncertain world that is wondrous, dangerous, and all theirs.&nbsp;</p><p>A breathtakingly beautiful to behold film, <em>Flow</em> tells a story that might well enchant children with its cuddly heroes, but it will rattle grown-ups who can understand the cause for their deadly dilemma.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Flow </em>is a wordless tale of climate crisis.&nbsp;</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

<p>This gorgeous film, which has been selected as Latvia's submission for the Best International Feature Oscar<em>,<strong> </strong></em>begins following a little black cat as it putters around a forest looking for food. Little clues suggest this has not always been an outdoor cat, like the cozy cabin surrounded by lovingly carved wooden statues of the feline's likeness. But like the discarded tools and empty bed, the cat has been abandoned by whatever human once lived here. And in this regard, he's not alone.&nbsp;</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>A pack of dogs made up of a mix of breeds frolic around the forest, learning how to clumsily catch fish in a nearby stream. It's as if a dog park party went stray. But as <em>Flow </em>progresses and its animals come upon more and more handcrafted trinkets and architecture in ruins, it becomes clear this beguiling film is set in post-human times. Another major hint to this setting is the massive wall of water that forces the animals of the forest to flee to higher ground, and eventually onto deserted boats.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Flow </em>is a parable of reluctant teamwork.&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The little cat scrambles onto a battered sailboat, where it is riled to discover a resting <a href="https://mashable.com/video/capybaras-explained" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">capybara</a>. Reluctantly, the cat realizes this big but gentle rodent is no threat, and a motley crew of sailors begins to come together. A yammering lemur, whose tendency toward gathering baubles can be a risky compulsion, joins up. A majestic crane takes hold of the rudder. A tongue-wagging Golden Retriever hops aboard, eager to make new friends.&nbsp;</p><p>There's an elegant pleasure in watching these unlikely animal friends grow close, and it's impossible to overlook Zilbalodis' dedication in keeping true to their natures. He doesn't cheat these moments of growth; there's pleasantly predictable bickering as the animals collide with each other's quirks. For instance, the lemur lovingly lays out his loot on the boat's seat, which attracts the cat, who naturally&nbsp;swats a treasure to the ground, much to the lemur's annoyance. But as moments of crisis &mdash; be it a predator on the horizon or an obstacle in their path &mdash;&nbsp;arise, these animals snap to attention and slowly but surely learn to trust each other.&nbsp;</p><p>Visually, it's richly rewarding, as Zilbalodis paints a pretty world destroyed and yet alive with hope and hard-won harmony. It's heart-warming, as we witness these creatures (who are in some cases natural enemies)&nbsp;band together not just for a common goal, but ultimately a common bond. And because Zilbalodis rejects so many expectations of animated animals &mdash; from their appearance to their movements and their noises &mdash;&nbsp;<em>Flow </em>has an exciting spontaneity, as if truly anything could happen. And what ultimately does is epic and emotional.&nbsp;</p><p>Refusing to pander to its audience, <em>Flow </em>is an animated adventure that is poignant, unique, absolutely gorgeous, and a must-see. While it should safely snag that Best International Feature spot, the American studios should be more worried about its chances in Best Animated Feature.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Flow </em>was reviewed out of the 2024 Toronto International Film Festival. <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7bYKP?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=The%20movie%20will%20open%20in%20theaters%20in%20the%20U.S.%20on%20Nov.%2022.&object_type=article&object_uuid=06cOHznU6rjV1xnoIEHlhMs&short_url=z7bYKP&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">The movie will open in theaters in the U.S. on Nov. 22.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

Her ex Alex (Jocko Sims) chooses that very day to send out his wedding invites. And on top of all of that, Mel straight-up <em>dies</em>. Just for three minutes, but it's enough to make an impression.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Mel's death and its circumstances &mdash; alone, crushed under furniture, and choking on a crab rangoon &mdash; prompt some serious soul-searching. As Mel sees it, her love life is nonexistent, her family doesn't believe in her, and in some kind of cruel cosmic joke, she's an airport employee who's too scared to fly. Is this really the life she wants to flash before her eyes when she dies for real? No, no, it's not.</p><p>Created by Rothwell, <em>How to Die Alone </em>takes Mel down a winding road of self-discovery, one full of hard truths, awkward romantic encounters, and <em>just </em>enough hope to keep her pushing for the life she deserves. The ensuing journey is hilarious, yes, but also a deeply candid portrait of a woman in the never-ending process of figuring it all out.</p><h2>What's <em>How to Die Alone </em>about?</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Following her near-death experience, Mel decides to embrace her inner "boss-ass bitch." At her job as a cart driver at New York's JFK airport, that means trying to get into a management program &mdash; and quelling any feelings she may still have for Alex, who is also her boss. (If you think that sounds messy, just you wait.)</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p><em>How to Die Alone</em>'s airport setting creates several opportunities for elaborate hijinks in the vein of workplace comedies like <a href="https://mashable.com/category/the-office" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>The Office</em></a><em> </em>or <a href="https://mashable.com/article/superstore-robots" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Superstore</em></a>. A hunt for confiscated painkillers leads Mel and Rory deep into the bowels of JFK. Elsewhere, a terminal-wide lockdown forces Mel and Alex's fianc&eacute;e Julie (Chantel Riley) on an awkward side quest. However, as fun as these moments may be, <em>How to Die Alone</em>'s workplace comedy side isn't the show's primary focus. It can occasionally chafe against the show's more grounded core of Mel's personal growth instead of complementing it. Thankfully, <em>How to Die Alone </em>figures out a balance between the two as its first season picks up steam, giving Rothwell space to deliver not just some great physical comedy but some seriously vulnerable work as well.</p><h2>Natasha Rothwell is delightful and vulnerable in <em>How to Die Alone</em>.</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Rothwell has always shined in supporting roles, from <a href="https://mashable.com/article/insecure-prentice-penny" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Insecure</em></a><em> </em>to <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-white-lotus-season-3-cast" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>The White Lotus</em></a>. But in <em>How to Die Alone</em>, she gets to take center stage <em>and </em>creative control, helming the series alongside co-showrunner Vera Santamaria (<a href="https://mashable.com/article/pen15-season-2-part-2-review-immigrant-moms" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Pen15</em></a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/bojack-horseman-season-6-finale-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>BoJack Horseman</em></a>). The result is a performance that isn't afraid to get messy or vulnerable, whether Mel is bemoaning her dating life &mdash; "Because of societal standards, I'm like human cilantro," she tells her friends &mdash; or self-sabotaging in order to avoid being hurt down the line.</p><p>While Rothwell shines consistently throughout <em>How to Die Alone</em>, there are still some standout moments where she and her co-stars go above and beyond. Mel and Rory's painful unpacking of their friendship in one episode is an absolutely devastating blowout. A tense Thanksgiving conversation between Mel and her brother Brian (Bashir Salahuddin) cuts deep and provides a much-needed opportunity for both characters to vent their frustrations. These are the kind of scenes that can only happen thanks to layered, complicated relationships between characters, and luckily, Rothwell and Santamaria keep Mel wrapped in an intricate web of connections that accrues more and more meaning as the show<em> </em>progresses.</p><p>Among these connections is a love triangle that slowly creeps to the forefront in <em>How to Die Alone</em>'s final episodes. Our candidates are Alex, who still supports Mel even though she rejected him two years ago, and JFK ground crew member Terrance (KeiLyn Durrel Jones), Mel's go-to conversational partner on her smoke breaks. In my mind, there's a clear answer on who Mel should go with, but trust <em>How to Die Alone </em>to keep you guessing. Even when it's playing up some classic rom-com tropes, the series may just turn around and hit you (and Mel) with a heartbreaking gut punch.</p><p>As juicy as Mel's romantic endeavors can be, it's her quest for personal happiness &mdash; whether that involves a man or not &mdash; that proves the most rewarding. She learns some fairly valuable life lessons throughout <em>How to Die Alone</em>, sprinkled amid quality one-liners and her many, <em>many </em>poor decisions, and it's a treat to watch her find her footing alongside the series. Mel may not be ready to get on a plane yet, but Rothwell and <em>How to Die Alone </em>are ready to soar.</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/ZR2pn?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3Btemplate=article&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=How%20to%20Die%20Alone%20premieres%20Sept.%2013%20on%20Hulu.&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=02VQ2239YaLKhBpfVzj6OVP&amp%3Bshort_url=ZR2pn&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Ffall-tv-preview-2024&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=How%20to%20Die%20Alone%20premieres%20Sept.%2013%20on%20Hulu%2C%20with%20new%20episodes%20every%20Friday.&object_type=article&object_uuid=01V2HZBniVrwv53ZxqkbNcC&short_url=ZR2pn&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>How to Die Alone</u></em><u> premieres Sept. 13 on Hulu, with new episodes every Friday.</u></a></p>]]></content:encoded>

No worries; we've rounded up the best ways to watch the Emmys without cable below. The show is also set to stream the next day on Hulu, if you don't mind missing out on the live shenanigans (and can avoid spoilers).</p><h2>Who are this year's Emmy nominees?</h2><p>FX shows are dominating this year's Emmy nominations, with <em>Sh&#333;gun</em> picking up 25 nominations and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/forks-fishes-the-bear-best-ep" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>The Bear</em></a> picking up 23.

There are simply too many different services. Networks like NBC and CBS have their own streaming apps, but ABC doesn't. So what can cord cutters do?</p><p>Live TV streaming services are cable alternatives, giving you live access to a well-rounded channel selection via your internet connection (rather than a cable connection). Unlike cable, these services are contract-free, so you can cancel whenever you wish. And as a bonus, many of them offer free trials &mdash; that means you could very well watch the Emmys live for free, then cancel before you're charged. But we'll leave that up to you. </p><p>You can also use a digital TV antenna, a one-time purchase that will unlock all the local networks &mdash;&nbsp;ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC &mdash;&nbsp;within range.</p><p>Below, we've rounded up your best options (and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-streaming-deals" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">streaming deals</a>) for watching the <a href="https://mashable.com/category/emmys" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Emmys</a> without cable.</p><h3>Best way to watch the Emmys for free: <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVDrLO?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=YouTube%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=07MWtZrgnOk7azE8HBRZWS0&short_url=QVDrLO&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">YouTube TV</a></h3><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

However, it's a bit pricier at $76.99 per month. But we still recommend it for two reasons. First, you get three days for free to test the waters, and second, your subscription comes bundled with Hulu with ads, Disney+ with ads, and ESPN+ with ads (a $14.99 per month value). That's three premium streaming libraries on top of nearly 100 live channels&nbsp;all for just $76.99 per month. </p><p>Stream the Emmys for free during your three-day trial, then decide whether you want to stick it out for a whole month or cancel before you're charged.</p><h3>Most affordable overall: <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qx7p3j?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Sling%20TV&object_type=article&object_uuid=07MWtZrgnOk7azE8HBRZWS0&short_url=Qx7p3j&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Sling TV</a> (only for select areas)</h3><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>While we love Sling TV for its <em>a la carte</em> setup and affordable pricing, we're hesitant to call it our favorite since some markets cannot access local networks. In order to watch the Emmys live, you'll need access to ABC, which is included in <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qx7p3j?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Sling%27s%20Blue%20base%20package&object_type=article&object_uuid=07MWtZrgnOk7azE8HBRZWS0&short_url=Qx7p3j&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Sling's Blue base package</a>.

<p>If you're able to avoid spoilers and don't mind waiting a day to watch the ceremony, a regular Hulu with ads subscription will give you access to the Emmys on Sept. 16, the day after the live show. It's definitely the cheapest option: you can sign up for free for 30 days, then it'll cost you just $7.99 per month. You won't get the excitement of watching live, but if you don't mind that, this is a solid bet.</p><h3>Honorable mention: <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7bYXD?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=FuboTV&object_type=article&object_uuid=07MWtZrgnOk7azE8HBRZWS0&short_url=z7bYXD&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">FuboTV</a></h3><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>Another live TV streaming service option is Fubo. Though it's more geared toward sports fans, with over 200 live channels, it does include access to your local ABC network. You can test it out for seven days, then get $30 off your first month, knocking it down to just $49.99. After that, you'll have to pay $79.99 per month for the Pro plan, making it one of the more expensive options on the list.</p><h3>Another option for watching live: Get a digital antenna</h3><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>As, unfortunately, not everyone's hometown has a gayborhood, Grindr hopes to bring a "<a href="https://zdcs.link/zjGMx2?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=global%20gayborhood&object_type=article&object_uuid=03H5z5ygOpvtxfmHM7uksvg&short_url=zjGMx2&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">global gayborhood</a>" &mdash; a digital space within the app that connects and provides resources for the worldwide LGBTQ community &mdash; to life. In tandem with the show, the app is developing an interactive map to help users find LGBTQ-friendly hotspots and events.  (This feature isn't fully rolled out yet, but you might see it before the year's end.) Additionally, the company is testing a new <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3bk42?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=%22Roam%22%20feature&object_type=article&object_uuid=03H5z5ygOpvtxfmHM7uksvg&short_url=z3bk42&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">"Roam" feature</a>, which will let users temporarily set their profile location to anywhere in the world so they can chat and connect with locals ahead of their trip.

However, at a recent presentation at Grindr HQ (which I attended in person), company leaders revealed that approximately 3.5 million people already use the app to make traveling in new cities easier &mdash; from finding LGBTQ-friendly accommodations to connecting with locals for recommendations and events.</p><p>We're excited to see what other travel-focused features Grindr has planned, and will keep you updated as more details are shared in the coming months. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Time-travel movies mostly fall into three categories, all of them fixated on change for better or worse. There's the <em>Groundhog Day</em> time-loop, where a hero repeats a cycle over and over until they get this one pivotal day right. There's the <em>Back to the Future </em>model, where a fun-seeking dip in the past could irreparably change your future, even erasing you from existence. (See also: much of <a href="https://mashable.com/category/doctor-who" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Doctor Who</em></a><em>.</em>) Then there are the many, many movies &mdash; be they <em>Terminator</em> or <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-greatest-hits-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>The Greatest Hits</em></a> &mdash;&nbsp;that take the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/quantum-leap-reboot-comparison" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Quantum Leap</em></a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/quantum-leap-reboot-comparison" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"> </a>approach: traveling back in time to set right what once went wrong! <em>My Old Ass </em>isn't really any of these. And that's wildly refreshing.&nbsp;</p><p>This very different spin on time travel begins with the casting of Aubrey Plaza, who between <em>Parks and Recreation, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, </em>and her <a href="https://mashable.com/video/aubrey-plaza-drew-barrymore-be-my-mommy" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">chic yet surly interview persona</a>, encapsulates a distinctive brand of elder millennial over-it. So the moment she shows up next to a bubbly, blonde Maisy Stella &mdash; 18-year-old Elliott, a small-town girl on the brink of booking it to the big city &mdash; you know this isn't going to be your standard "save the future" adventure. Not that Plaza's elder Elliott doesn't try.&nbsp;</p><p>While younger Elliott is out in the woods, celebrating her birthday with <a href="https://mashable.com/feature/paul-stamets-magic-mushrooms-psilocybin" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">a shroom trip</a> among friends, 39-year-old Elliott party crashes with some advice that is as admittedly cliched as it is true: Be nicer to your mom. Beyond this, "My Old Ass" (as she labels herself in teen Elliott's cellphone contacts) refuses to speak much about the future, fearing this unplanned meeting could have massive consequences. She occasionally alludes to some major disasters to come, but her only warning is comically simple: Avoid Chad at all costs!&nbsp;</p><p>Naturally, what follows is younger Elliott skinny-dipping into a meet-cute with a sweet boy named Chad (<a href="https://mashable.com/article/wednesday-season-2-questions" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Wednesday</em></a>'s Percy Hynes White), with whom she shares an undeniable chemistry no matter how much she tries to ignore it. </p><h2>Maisy Stella outshines Aubrey Plaza in <em>My Old Ass.&nbsp;</em></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Where Plaza is here to be the cynical sage, Stella is radiant as the free-spirited goofball. Whether she's partying with friends, hooking up with her hot girlfriend, or grousing at her family, Elliott's charm is intoxicating &mdash; not because she's exceptional, but because she's not. Rather than setting her protagonist up as some noble savior of the future, Park allows Elliott to be a pretty average small-town girl desperate to move out and on to a life of her own. As such, Elliott is exuberant, horny, and reckless, colliding into awkward situations and unexpected vulnerabilities as if she's driving a bumper car full speed down the winding road of this formative summer. Park captures the joy of carefree youth without romanticizing it, and she offers the same determined empathy for Elliott's older half.&nbsp;</p><p>With Plaza's beleaguered eye rolls, Park swiftly dispels these fantasies that as we get older, we'll have it all figured out. Instead, <em>My Old Ass </em>challenges juvenile notions that with age comes a coveted completeness, the sense that we're not just settled but have life all figured out. The movie suggest such a hope is as absurd as our youthful ambitions to be a marine biologist <em>and </em>a professional dancer <em>and </em>President of the United States. So this story becomes less about a mission to change the past to impact the present, and more about coming to terms with our choices and who we were and are.&nbsp;</p><p>While thematically, Park's script is moving and spirited &mdash;&nbsp;just as <em>The Fallout </em>before it was &mdash;&nbsp;Plaza struggles to nail this balance. While she's shown range in series like <em>Legion </em>and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-white-lotus-season-2-cameron-hbo" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>White Lotus</em></a>, here she wobbles when playing anything but irritated. In scenes of bonding between the two, there's an buzzing edge to Plaza's tone even as she smiles at her character's younger self. When the third act calls for softness, Plaza's vulnerability feels performed instead of organic. Here's where <em>My Old Ass </em>undercuts its sharp self-awareness and sincerity and slips into saccharine.&nbsp;</p><p><em>My Old Ass </em>rebuffs time-travel standards, like looking into the future to see how Elliott's life changes. It treats the mission, and even the sci-fi premise, as little more than a launchpad for its heroine's summer of reflection. If anything, the movie is more a teen coming-of-age comedy about that leap from high school to whatever comes next than a Quantum Leap at all. </p><p>Yet where those two subgenres collide is in a shared sentimentality over the past, and that veers into schmaltzy, for better or worse. Still, aside from this trip into treacle, <em>My Old Ass </em>is a spirited comedy about growing up and moving on that's a true joy &mdash;&nbsp;just as Stella is a star on the rise to watch.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/BdWRN?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=My%20Old%20Ass%20opens%20in%20theaters%20Sept.%2013.&object_type=article&object_uuid=07HJfqyMSIZA4j4A74TbsCv&short_url=BdWRN&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>My Old Ass </em>opens in theaters Sept. 13. </a></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[In "Kneecap,"  the music-fueled biopic named for the Irish hip-hop trio on which it centers, Móglaí Bap, Mo Chara, and DJ Próvaí play themselves.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03lFiSiwEbSF79OoV5mtLj2/hero-image.jpg" alt="Naoise Ó Cairealláin as Móglaí Bap or Naoise, JJ Ó Dochartaigh as DJ Próvaí or JJ, Liam Óg Ó Hannaidh as Mo Chara or Liam Óg in "Kneecap.""><p>Don't let the truth get in the way of a good story. <em>Kneecap, </em>the music-fueled biopic named for the Irish hip-hop trio on which it centers, spins a tale that is at times so outrageous you might suspect poetic liberties have been taken. But the film itself embraces the blurring of fact and feeling to deliver a propulsive and political romp that rejects the austere approach of so many indulgent Oscar-chasing biopics. And thank God and all the saints for that!&nbsp;</p><p>Too often, larger-than-life rock stars or pop divas or legendary musicians are reduced by a color-by-numbers approach that fails to capture exactly why they were so enthralling to begin with. (For recent examples, see <a href="https://mashable.com/article/elvis-movie-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Elvis</em></a><em>,</em> <a href="https://mashable.com/article/back-to-black-amy-winehouse-movie-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Back to Black</em></a><em>, and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/bob-marley-one-love-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">One Love</a></em> &mdash;&nbsp;or don't.) However, <em>Kneecap</em> embraces the raw and reckless energy of Naoise &Oacute; Caireall&aacute;in, Liam &Oacute;g &Oacute; Hannaidh, and JJ &Oacute; Dochartaigh, who perform under the stage names M&oacute;gla&iacute; Bap, Mo Chara, and DJ Pr&oacute;va&iacute;. So, early on, a sprawling club scene with flashing lights and hard drug-taking spills into a dark, forbidding forest &mdash;&nbsp;not nearby, but connected &mdash;&nbsp;as the police (or "peelers," as the boys call them) chase them down.&nbsp;</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>By collapsing the set of a nightclub into a forest that seems plucked out of nightmarish fantasy, director/writer Richard Peppiatt swiftly establishes that <em>Kneecap </em>won't play by the rules. Hand-drawn graphics burst onto the screen, emphasizing motions and odd analogies. Claymation will be employed to illustrate the mind-bending effects of an ill-timed ketamine trip. And alongside the band, who play themselves in the film, two-time Academy Award nominee Michael Fassbender strides onscreen to bring a bit of surreal grit.&nbsp;</p><p>Combined with a soundtrack flushed with Kneecap's high-octane hip-hop, the result is a rush to the head that's hard to shake. But why would you want to?</p><h2><em>Kneecap</em> is a fuck-you to boring biopics and tedious vanity projects.&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The premise of <em>Kneecap </em>might sound a bit dry if you're new to the group's music. A few years back, a debate brewed over the proposed Irish Language Act, which would formally recognize the native tongue alongside English. While advocates and academics rallied for the dying language, an unlikely resurgence came to it through fast-growing interest in a band from Belfast, who rap in Irish about drugs, sex, and rebelling against British authority &mdash;&nbsp;including the police.&nbsp;</p><p>Smartly, <em>Kneecap </em>interweaves this larger political story into the playful personal stories of its three members. Liam &Oacute;g serves as the cheeky narrator, providing voiceover to all parts, including his Romeo-and-Juliet romance with a British party girl (Jessica Reynolds), who likes a kinky night in. However, the story begins with Naoise's baptism, which was raided by a police force suspicious of his father, a Catholic radical Republican named Arl&oacute; (Fassbender), who had a habit of planting bombs in the name of rebellion. Raised under the shadow of his dad's politics, Naoise is stuck between a rock and a hard place, pressured by Arl&oacute;'s admirers to follow in his dad's footsteps and the snarl of a police force that expects him to.&nbsp;As the Irish language was previously banned by the imperialist English authorities, Naoise's embrace of it does follow in his father's edict that "Every word of Irish spoken is a bullet fired for Irish freedom" &mdash;&nbsp;though perhaps not as Arl&oacute; intended.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>While these "Ceasefire babies" are painted as altar boys corrupted by the bad streets of West Belfast &mdash;&nbsp;and not troubled about that or The Troubles &mdash;&nbsp;JJ is introduced as a middle-aged music teacher on the brink of dying of boredom. A chance encounter over a police interrogation table changes everything, when JJ becomes inspired by Liam's in-your-face lyrics and proudly Fenian posturing. Just like that, a band is born. But their rise will be rife with violence, huge mistakes, and lots of drugged-up shenanigans.

<p><em>Kneecap </em>throws up a brazen middle finger to another "North of Ireland" set biopic, Kenneth Branagh's <em>Belfast</em>. Where the world-renowned actor/director made a prestige pic out of his childhood, Mo Chara, M&oacute;gla&iacute; Bap, and DJ Pr&oacute;va&iacute; reject the opportunity to gloss up their images. Instead, they gamely present themselves as fun-loving fuckups, never shying away the havoc that lies in the wake of their road to stardom.&nbsp;</p><p>They welcome us to witness them stumbling on stage, too high to function after a dime bag mix-up. They invite us to laugh at sexual proclivities that thrust into political orgasms. They show their asses, literally and metaphorically, which proves crudely inspiring. These three didn't set out to change their nation. They set out to sing (or rap) a song for themselves, and in doing so, connected to an undercurrent of cultural pride and resilience that connected them to others.&nbsp;</p><p>But what first unites us to them is their rough-hewn charisma. Playing themselves on-screen could have spelled disaster, as plenty of musicians have fumbled at acting. But they excel, managing to play scenes of clownish absurdity and more tender moments with stirring screen presence. DJ Pr&oacute;va&iacute; proves the strongest &mdash; to the point where I wondered if his signature onstage attire of an Irish flag balaclava allowed them to cast an established actor for the role. But the whole crew thrives on-screen as they do onstage, exploding in a frenzy of humor, music, and attitude that is wicked fun.&nbsp;</p><p>In the end, Peppiatt has done a superb job of not only shaking off the oh-so-serious shackles that are musician biopic conventions, but also enthusiastically embracing the hip-hop energy of his subjects, allowing them to be both the stars and fuel of their story, propelling them to a climax that deserves its rowdy encore across the credits.&nbsp;</p><p>Simply put, <em>Kneecap </em>is sensational, silly, sharp, and ultimately sublime.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/weopy?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Kneecap%20opened%20in%20theaters%20Aug.%202.&object_type=article&object_uuid=03lFiSiwEbSF79OoV5mtLj2&short_url=weopy&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Kneecap </em>opened in theaters Aug. 2.</a>&nbsp;It is <a href="https://zdcs.link/ao5LEL?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=returning%20to%20select%20theaters%20Sept.%2013&object_type=article&object_uuid=03lFiSiwEbSF79OoV5mtLj2&short_url=ao5LEL&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">returning to select theaters Sept. 13</a>, and was just announced as Ireland's Oscar submission.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>What is Connections?</h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <a class="text-gray-600" href="https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1679674590203723778?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(opens in a new window)">

<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>
<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. Like <em>Wordle, </em>you can share the results with your friends on social media.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

Words can be made from linked letters &mdash; up, down, left, right, or diagonal, but words can also change direction, resulting in quirky shapes and patterns. Every single letter in the grid will be part of an answer. There's always a theme linking every solution, along with the "spangram," a special, word or phrase that sums up that day's theme, and spans the entire grid horizontally or vertically.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>The verdict? The Anker 535 PowerHouse did effectively charge and power up multiple of my devices simultaneously. At $500, I can say that it is worth the investment for somebody who needs to be prepared for inclement weather (like myself living in Florida) or spends lots of time in remote areas and may not have access to outlets such as campers or those on a road trip. However, for a person looking to charge their phone or power devices regularly, it is a bit pricey and heavy for day-to-day use.&nbsp;(Though we have seen the power station's price dip below $350.)</p><h2>The Anker PowerHouse is easy to use even for beginners</h2><p>When I opened the box, I immediately saw the user manual which was filled with helpful diagrams showing how to recharge the power device and the various ports (four AC, one USB-C, and three USB-A ports). I was able to easily unwrap the car port charger and power adapter and plug it in for charging.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>I also liked that it came with a light. Although I did not need to use it, I still tried turning it on and off which could be easily done with the push of a button.&nbsp;</p><p>However, it is important to note that any Lightning or other cables that may be required to charge a laptop, phone, etc. are not included with the Anker 535 PowerHouse. Although I wish they were included (considering the $500 price tag), I luckily had them at my apartment, so I could get right to testing without having to order any additional cables.&nbsp;</p><h2>How long does the Anker 535 PowerHouse battery take to charge?</h2><p>Since it was my first time using the device, the instruction manual advised that I fully charge it first. The box advertised that the device could be fully recharged using the in-box adapter in four-and-a-half hours and I wanted to see if I would experience that quick charge time. When I initially plugged in the power adapter charger to the outlet in my apartment, the device was already at 27 percent (I had assumed it would be at zero percent considering the instructions read to fully charge it before use). It took three-and-a-half hours to reach 100 percent (from 27 percent) which I thought was in line with the box&rsquo;s claim and extremely quick considering the battery&rsquo;s capacity of 512Wh.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2>The Anker 535 PowerHouse can charge and power up multiple devices fairly quickly</h2><p>To test the portable generator&rsquo;s charging capabilities, I charged my MacBook Air, iPhone, Bluetooth headphones, and Nintendo Switch simultaneously.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>It took two hours and 20 minutes for my phone to charge from zero percent to 100 percent.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>It took two hours and 10 minutes for my laptop to charge from zero percent to 100 percent.</p></li><li><p>It took two hours and 50 minutes for the Nintendo Switch to charge.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>Considering all of the devices were charging at the same time, I thought that under three hours to fully charge all three devices was fast.&nbsp;</p><p>I found it helpful that the LCD display showed how many Watts of power were being used as the devices were being charged as well as the remaining battery hours. This makes it easier for one to prepare.&nbsp;</p><p>I tested the AC port by plugging in the lamp by my desk and it turned on easily with no issues.&nbsp;</p><p>Even with all of the charging that was being done, the battery only lowered to 74 percent, which was impressive considering it was charging four devices for three and a half hours.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Anker 535 PowerHouse was unable to accept three-prong AC power cords</h2><p>I wanted to fully power my <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/home-office-starter-kit" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">home office</a> using the Anker 535 PowerHouse, but unfortunately, I was unable to plug in my monitor as it was equipped with a three-prong AC power cord. The machine is only able to accept two-prong AC power cords. This was slightly disappointing and is something to make a note of in case you want to use this power station to connect an appliance that is equipped with a three-pronged cord.&nbsp;</p><p>However, I was able to plug in some of the electronics in my office, including my lamp.</p><h2>Is the Anker 535 PowerHouse worth it?&nbsp;</h2><p>Do I think the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aB1m18?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Anker%20535%20PowerHouse&object_type=review&object_uuid=07CumuSBCbqAv6RyNxhJZhw&short_url=aB1m18&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Anker 535 PowerHouse</u></a> is worth the value? I think it depends on who you&rsquo;re asking or what one plans on using it for. As someone who lives in Florida, I think the Anker 535 PowerHouse is definitely worth the price, especially during hurricane season. Although it can efficiently charge and power multiple devices at once with its nine ports, the battery is fairly heavy and would be kind of a pain to transport.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're solely looking to use the Anker 535 PowerHouse for day-to-day use to charge your phones, laptops, etc., then it is not worth the price as there are other smaller, more portable, and cheaper chargers on the market.

The game became a massive hit in early 2014 on both iOS and Android, and quickly brought its creator, Vietnam-based Dong Nguyen, fame and fortune. <em>Flappy Bird</em> at one point was reportedly bringing in tens of thousands of dollars in ad revenue per day.</p><p>By February 2014, however, Nguyen had completely removed the game from all mobile app stores. Others have attempted to clone the game over the years, but were never able to replicate the success of the original.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Now, more than ten years later, a group called the Flappy Bird Foundation is <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/10-years-after-it-was-pulled-offline-viral-mobile-game-flappy-bird-is-coming-back?utm_source=threads,twitter" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>re-launching</u></a> the game.

<p>It is called <em>Flappy Bird</em>. The original yellow bird character is back. Players still tap on the screen to flap their wings and move up and down to avoid hitting pipes.&nbsp;</p><p>However, there's much more to the new <a href="https://flappybird.org/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Flappy Bird</u></em></a> now too according to the game's new website.</p><p>There are additional playable characters as well as different levels. The trailer shows a world map which suggests there will be a storyline mode. There's also other gameplay modes which involve guiding your <em>Flappy Bird</em> character through basketball hoops. It appears there will be an online mode called Flappy Bird Rivals too where players can take on 99 other competitors.</p><p>The new <em>Flappy Bird</em> is set to release in October on the web and other platforms with dedicated iOS and Android apps coming in 2025.</p><h2><strong>The return of <em>Flappy Bird</em>? Sort of.</strong></h2><p><em>Flappy Bird</em>'s "return" is odd as its creator Dong Nguyen is not involved. In fact, Nguyen apparently has nothing to do with <em>Flappy Bird</em>'s comeback whatsoever, and reportedly didn't sell the rights to it.</p><p>Nguyen said he was unhappy with the attention <em>Flappy Bird</em> brought, and has previously said that he did not want <em>Flappy Bird</em> to exist at all.</p><p>"Flappy Bird was designed to play in a few minutes when you are relaxed," Nguyen told <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lananhnguyen/2014/02/11/exclusive-flappy-bird-creator-dong-nguyen-says-app-gone-forever-because-it-was-an-addictive-product/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Forbes</u></em></a> in an interview in February 2014 shortly after taking the game off of the app stores. "But it happened to become an addictive product. I think it has become a problem. To solve that problem, it's best to take down <em>Flappy Bird</em>. It's gone forever."</p><p>So, how is the Flappy Bird Foundation reviving the game?</p><p>In its post announcing "I AM BACK!!" the<em> Flappy Bird</em> account on X shared that "the decade-long mission" to revive the game "involved acquiring legal rights and even working with my predecessor to uncage me and re-hatch the official <em>Flappy Bird</em>&reg; game!"</p><p>But the Flappy Bird Foundation acquired the rights from Gametech Holdings LLC., not Nguyen. According to <a href="https://www.law360.com/ttab_cases/651c133ff1aa5d012d8ff9cc" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>court documents</u></a>, Gametech Holdings LLC acquired the <em>Flappy Bird</em> rights by filing to take over the abandoned trademark rights from Nguyen. As <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/flappy-bird-returns-ios-android-microtransactions-trademark" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Inverse</u></a> points out, Gametech Holdings LLC used Nguyen's own public statements about abandoning Flappy Bird in order to successfully take over the trademark in September 2023.</p><p>While Nguyen's lack of involvement in every step here may leave a bad taste in some fans' mouths, the Flappy Bird Foundation does have a member with ties to the original <em>Flappy Bird</em>.</p><div class="reddit">

<p>The apparently anonymous creator of the game Piou Piou vs. Cactus is <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/flappy-bird-returns-ios-android-microtransactions-trademark" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">reportedly</a> part of The Flappy Bird Foundation. Back when Nguyen found success with <em>Flappy Bird</em>, he was criticized for allegedly "borrowing" elements of Piou Piou vs. Cactus, such as the design of the infamous yellow <em>Flappy Bird </em>character. Some have even <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1xfb9x/flappy_bird_vs_piou_piou/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>speculated</u></a> that Nguyen really shut down <em>Flappy Bird</em> in order to avoid legal issues with the creator of Piou Piou vs. Cactus.</p><p>So, Flappy Bird is back, albeit with a murky new backstory.

<p>Initially dubbed "Project Strawberry," the model was released to the public as "o1" on Thursday. As expected, o1 is able to "think" (process) before answering a prompt, which differs from previous large language models that use predictive text to form their responses. "We've developed a new series of AI models designed to spend more time thinking before they respond," said OpenAI in the <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">announcement</a>.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>In a demo shared on the OpenAI site, the video shows a user asking o1 in ChatGPT to "write a grammatictlly [sic] correct sentence without using any letters more than once." The model then uses its new reasoning skills to weigh options and evaluate the sentence. According to the demo, after 39 seconds, o1's cheeky response to the query is "go fix my bed." </p><p>Another video features Research Lead Jerry Tworek asking o1 to solve a logic puzzle about the ages of a prince and princess. The model is shown decoding the problem, by understanding the different variables and determining which equations are needed to solve the problem, and goes step by step answering the age equation. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-Jh2NdbPDVrQ&amp;ab_channel=OpenAI"></div>
</div>


<p>As demonstrated from the demos, o1 works best for solving complex math problems in the realm of science, physics, and coding. "o1 can be used by healthcare researchers to annotate cell sequencing data, by physicists to generate complicated mathematical formulas needed for quantum optics, and by developers in all fields to build and execute multi-step workflows," said the announcement. </p><p>That also means the o1 preview comes with certain limitations. It can't browse the web or take in uploaded files and images. For tasks like those, OpenAI says, GPT-4o is still the best model to use. </p><p>In a section about safety, OpenAI said the U.S. and UK Safety Institutes were granted early access to testing o1, per the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/openai-anthropic-agree-models-tested-before-making-them-public" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">previous mandates</a> from President Biden's AI <a href="https://mashable.com/article/white-house-drops-ai-regulation-bombshell" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">executive order</a>. </p><p>OpenAI's o1 model is available through the developer AI and ChatGPT Plus users in preview.

<p>Apple announced the Hearing Aid mode on Sept. 10, noting the company anticipated federal approval to come "soon," but the FDA moved quicker than expected. </p><p>"Today&rsquo;s marketing authorization of an over-the-counter hearing aid software on a widely used consumer audio product is another step that advances the availability, accessibility and acceptability of hearing support for adults with perceived mild to moderate hearing loss," wrote Michelle Tarver, FDA director of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health. </p><p>The FDA's approval also provided more information on the feature's clinical testing. Apple's HAF was evaluated in a study featuring "118 subjects with perceived mild to moderate hearing loss, at multiple U.S. sites," the FDA explained. "The results demonstrated that subjects who used the HAF self-fitting strategy achieved similar perceived benefit as subjects who received professional fitting of the same device. Results also showed comparable performance for tests measuring levels of amplification in the ear canal, as well as a measure of speech understanding in noise. No adverse events related to the device were observed in this study."</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

Neither has produced evidence proving their claim, and <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/09/10/jd-vance-haitian-migrant-crime-remarks/75161067007/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">local officials say it's untrue</a>.

<p>In this case, researchers tested whether conversations with a chatbot powered by generative <a href="https://mashable.com/category/artificial-intelligence" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">artificial intelligence</a> could successfully engage with people who believed popular conspiracy theories, like that the Sept. 11 attacks were orchestrated by the American government and that the COVID-19 virus was a man-made attempt by "global elites" to "control the masses."&nbsp;</p><p>The study's 2,190 participants had tailored back-and-forth conversations about a single conspiracy theory of their choice with OpenAI's GPT-4 Turbo. The model had been trained on a large amount of data from the internet and licensed sources.</p><p>After the participants' discussions, the researchers found a 20 percent reduction in conspiracy belief. Put another way, a quarter of participants had stopped adhering to the conspiracy theory they'd discussed. That decrease persisted two months after their interaction with the chatbot.&nbsp;</p><p>David Rand, a co-author of the study, said the findings indicate people's minds can be changed with facts, despite pessimism about that prospect.</p><q>

<p>"Evidence isn't dead," Rand told Mashable. "Facts and evidence do matter to a substantial degree to a lot of people."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Rand, who is a professor of management science and brain and cognitive sciences at MIT, and his co-authors didn't test whether the study participants were more likely to change their minds after talking to a chatbot versus someone they know in real life, like a best friend or sibling. But they suspect the chatbot's success has to do with how quickly it can marshal accurate facts and evidence in response.&nbsp;</p><p>In a sample conversation included in the study, a participant who thinks that the Sept. 11 attacks were staged receives an exhaustive scientific explanation from the chatbot about how the Twin Towers collapsed without the aid of explosive detonations, among other popular related conspiracy claims. At the outset, the participant felt 100 percent confident in the conspiracy theory; by the end, their confidence dropped to 40 percent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For anyone who's ever tried to discuss a conspiracy theory with someone who believes it, they may have experienced rapid-fire exchanges filled with what Rand described as "weird esoteric facts and links" that are incredibly difficult to disprove. A generative AI chatbot, however, doesn't have that problem, because it can instantaneously respond with fact-based information.</p><p>Nor is an AI chatbot hampered by personal relationship dynamics, such as whether a long-running sibling rivalry or dysfunctional friendship shapes how a conspiracy theorist views the person offering counter information. In general, the chatbot was trained to be polite to participants, building a rapport with them by validating their curiosity or confusion.&nbsp;</p><p>The researchers also asked participants about their trust in artificial intelligence. They found that the more a participant trusted AI, the more likely they were to suspend their conspiracy theory belief in response to the conversation. But even those skeptical of AI were capable of changing their minds.&nbsp;</p><p>Importantly, the researchers hired a professional fact-checker to evaluate the claims made by the chatbot, to ensure it wasn't sharing false information, or making things up. The fact-checker rated nearly all of them as true and none of them as false.&nbsp;</p><p>For now, people who are curious about the researchers' work can try it out for themselves by using their <a href="https://www.debunkbot.com/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>DebunkBot</u></a>, which allows users to test their beliefs against an AI.&nbsp;</p><p>Rand and his co-authors imagine a future in which a chatbot might be connected to social media accounts as a way to counter conspiracy theories circulating on a platform. Or people might find a chatbot when they search online for information about viral rumors or hoaxes thanks to keyword ads tied to certain conspiracy search terms.</p><p>Rand said the study's success, which he and his co-authors have replicated, offers an example of how AI can be used for good.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, he's not naive about the potential for bad actors to use the technology to build a chatbot that confirms certain conspiracy theories. Imagine, for example, a chatbot that's been trained on social media posts that contain false claims.</p><p>"It remains to be seen, essentially, how all of this shakes out," Rand said. "If people are mostly using these foundation models from companies that are putting a lot of effort into really trying to make them accurate, we have a reasonable shot at this becoming a tool that's widely useful and trusted."</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Christopher Sewell, director of DETR, told <em>Gizmodo</em> that humans will still be be heavily involved in unemployment decision making. "There&rsquo;s no AI [written decisions] that are going out without having human interaction and that human review. We can get decisions out quicker so that it actually helps the claimant," said Sewell. </p><p>But Nevada legal groups and scholars have argued that any time saved by gen AI would be cancelled out by the time it would take to conduct a thorough human review of the claim decision. Many have also noted concerns about the possibility of private, personal information (including tax information and social security numbers) leaking through Google's Vertex AI studio, even with safeguards. Some have hesitancies surrounding the type of AI itself, known as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which has been found to produce incomplete or misleading answers to prompts. </p><p>Across the country, AI-based tools have been quietly rolled out or tested across various social services agencies, with gen AI integrating itself further into the administrative ecosystem. In February, the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ai-cant-be-used-to-determine-health-insurance-coverage" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">ruled against using AI</a> (including generative AI or algorithms) as a decision maker in determining patient care or coverage. This followed a lawsuit from two patients who alleged their insurance provider used a "fraudulent" and "harmful" AI model (known as nH Predict) that overrode physician recommendations. </p><p>Axon, a police technology and weapons manufacturer, introduced its first-of-its-kind Draft One &mdash; a generative large language model (LLM) that assists law enforcement in writing "faster, higher quality" reports &mdash; earlier this year. Still in a trial period, the technology has already <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/05/what-can-go-wrong-when-police-use-ai-write-reports" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">sounded alarms</a>, prompting concerns about the AI's ability to parse the nuance of tense police interactions and potentially adding to a lack of transparency in policing. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Unveiled in April 2023, the Roborock S8 Pro Ultra &mdash;&nbsp;on paper &mdash; is one of the fanciest robot vacuum and mop combos you can buy. It features self-washing and self-drying mopping pads, above average suction power, reactive 3D obstacle avoidance, floor type customization, and liftable brushes and mop that adapt to different tasks. Former Mashable intern Stacia Datskovska <a href="https://mashable.com/review/roborock-s8-pro-ultra-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">tested it ou</a>t and found that while it may be loaded with perks, they don't justify the outrageous price of $1,599.99. Fortunately, though, it regularly goes on sale. As of Sept. 12, it's down to just $949.99 &mdash; that's 41% in savings and its lowest price on record.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>Though they're a few years old, the Beats Fit Pro still stand up to the latest earbuds on the market. Mashable's Alex Perry reviewed them and <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-beats-fit-pro-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">noted</a> they "offer excellent active noise cancellation, magnificent audio output, elite comfort, and a <em>long-lasting</em> battery," putting them lightyears ahead of the third-generation AirPods. Typically just under $200, you can pick up a pair on sale for just $159 as of Sept. 12. That's 95 cents cheaper than the sale price they've been chilling at for months&nbsp;&mdash; a 20% savings overall.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>Small, yet mighty, the Anker Soundcore 2 Bluetooth speaker is tough to beat in terms of value. It offers impressive stereo sound, a durable design with IPX7 protection against rain, dust, spills, and more, and a 24-hour battery life to keep your tunes coming all day and night. For those specs, the price tag is pretty insane at just $27.99 on sale. That's 30% off its usual price as of Sept. 12.</p><p><em>None of these deals catching your eye?

<p>The big lesson here is to just pay the $29 (or whatever your repair fee happens to cost) if there's any kind of imperfection with your iPhone before trading it in for an <a href="https://mashable.com/article/should-i-upgrade-to-iphone-16" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">iPhone 16</a>. It's not ideal, but perhaps Apple is banking on people not wanting to go through the effort. Don't let Apple win. </p><p>Until you give the company several hundred dollars for a new phone, anyway.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>When it comes to buying a new <a href="https://mashable.com/category/smartwatches" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">smartwatch</a>, there are tons to choose from, including the newly-announced Apple Watch Series 10. But if you don't want to overspend, or you're an Android user, that upgrade may not be on the table for you. If that's the case, you can save big on an excellent watch right now with a host of great features that can go toe-to-toe with what Apple is offering. Best of all, you can get it for just under $200, which you can't say for most of Apple's product lineup. </p><p>As of Sept. 12, you can get the <a href="https://zdcs.link/98bpxd?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Samsung%20Galaxy%20Watch%206%20Classic%20%2847%20mm%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=04M1BiYxLTXoIoyOFJHMrMm&short_url=98bpxd&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic (47 mm)</a> for just $199.99, down from its usual price of $479.99. That's a discount of $280, or 58% off. This sale only applies to the Silver colorway right now, so if you want something else, you'll have to pony up a bit more cash. This is the <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0CG7PYYS1" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">lowest price</a> we've seen for this particular model &mdash; a full $70 lower. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>This smartwatch doesn't take cues from the rest of the competition that tries a little too hard to be techy. Instead, it looks much more like a regular timepiece with smart features. It offers heart rate, heart rhythm, sleep, and fitness tracking as well as sync options with other Samsung Galaxy devices you may already have. It looks slick on the wrist, it's sturdy, and it has plenty of customization options so you can make it your own. </p><p>For anyone using the Android ecosystem, it's well worth investing in, especially at this price. You won't want to pass it up for $199.99, but it'll likely go quickly while it's on sale. The holidays are just around the corner, so lock it in while you can. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The boys were six or seven and had happily been swept up in the burgeoning cultural phenomenon dubbed "Pok&eacute;mania." My mother, perplexed by the whole affair, read a book in the back row as the boys gaped at fantastical creatures on screen, their legs not yet long enough to reach the floor.</p><p>Less than a year before, the Pok&eacute;mon franchise had cracked open the gaping maw of the United States gaming market by feeding it the same properties that were already enormously successful in its native Japan. Like many other kids his age, my brother collected Pok&eacute;mon cards and captured the creatures on his Game Boy. We watched the Pok&eacute;mon TV series together and tossed a life-sized Pok&eacute;ball around the house.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Today, new generations are discovering the franchise as older ones embrace its nostalgia. Nowhere was that clearer than this summer's Pok&eacute;mon GO Fest, a three-day in-person event celebrating the franchise's mobile game in New York City. There, families in matching outfits bent over their phones together as if saying grace at the dining room table. Babes in strollers clutched stuffed Pok&eacute;mon toys as their parents discussed capturing new creatures.</p><p>Offline, the Pokemon trading card game &mdash; which littered early-aughts pavements at recess and became such a distraction that it was <a href="https://www.marquette.edu/cgi-bin/cuap/db.cgi?uid=default&amp;ID=4714&amp;view=Search&amp;mh=1" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>banned</u></a> in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemoncards/comments/18mgky6/when_schools_were_banning_pok%C3%A9mon_cards_in_1999/?share_id=j_AKcl51Bus65-MBA8ct2&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>some schools</u></a> &mdash; has seen a resurgence.

<p>Over the past two years, Pok&eacute;mon cards have also evolved into a top collecting category for adults. <a href="https://www.psacard.com/" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Leading authenticator PSA</u></a>, which has graded more than 70 million items since 1991, says baseball cards were the most popular item until early 2022, when Pok&eacute;mon cards became its biggest category by volume. Between 2022 and 2023, PSA saw a 50 percent growth in authentication and grading submissions of Pok&eacute;mon cards, compared to just a 16 percent increase in baseball cards over the same period.&nbsp;</p><p>"We've seen a major surge in the collectibles industry, specifically Pok&eacute;mon, due to the rising trend of nostalgia-driven primarily by Millennials and Gen Z," Ryan Hoge, president of PSA, told Mashable. "As the first generation of Pok&eacute;mon collectors have grown up and had kids, they&rsquo;ve gravitated back to the nostalgic pieces of their childhood and have resurrected the demand for Pok&eacute;mon trading cards."</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>PSA has graded only three subjects more than one million times: Michael Jordan and Pok&eacute;mon characters Charizard and Pikachu. "Charizard and Pikachu have now had 30-year careers spanning multiple generations," a spokesperson for the company noted.</p><p>The same nostalgia fueling Pok&eacute;mon card collecting is also enlivening a dedicated faction of players of the franchise's Pok&eacute;mon GO mobile game. </p><p>The game became a sensation virtually overnight when it was first released in the U.S. in 2016, capturing the hearts of fans and non-fans alike.&nbsp;It used augmented reality to overlay Pok&eacute;mon in real-world environments, transforming the player into a Pok&eacute;mon trainer tasked with collecting as many creatures as possible. A key element of the game was that it required the player to walk outside to find new Pok&eacute;mon in the wild.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

The craze's metaphorical death knell clanged at a 2016 Virginia rally for then-Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton where, in an attempt to connect with young voters, she told the crowd to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6riM2aDLk" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>"<em>Pok&eacute;mon GO</em></u><u> to the polls."</u></a> The phrase was swiftly memed and mocked, most notably by then-Republican nominee Donald Trump who posted a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=10157309144940725" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Facebook video</u></a> of a Pok&eacute;mon GO parody game titled "Crook&eacute;d Hillary NO."&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Many saw their journey to GO Fest as a kind of pilgrimage.&nbsp;For Rossdinelly Figueroa, 36, GO Fest has become a family tradition. She has traveled from Puerto Rico to attend Pok&eacute;mon GO Fests in Seattle, London, and Las Vegas with her husband, parents, and two children. The family's youngest member, 7-year-old Jade, is dressed as Pok&eacute;mon trainer Misty and was not yet born when her mother began playing Pok&eacute;mon GO in 2016.</p><p>About a 10-minute walk away, on a large lawn, an Illinois man who goes by "Uncle Bob" stands on an oval of astroturf across from a teen named Theo. They stare at their phones, battling each other digitally in the app. Uncle Bob has attended every GO Fest since the first iteration of the event was held in Chicago in 2017. Theo is far from home and reveling in a thrilling change of pace. "There are not as many players in my hometown [of Wiener Neustadt, Austria]," he tells <em>Mashable</em>. Back in Austria, he usually has to pay to join group gaming activities called "remote raids" in cities with more players.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>A couple nearby, Amy, 37, and Gary, 38, use the game to stay connected in their long-distance relationship. "He lives about four hours away from me," Amy says, dressed in a blue body suit, cosplaying as Vaporean, her favorite evolution of the Pok&eacute;mon Eevee. "And there's a feature in the game where you can send each other postcards. So I have a lot of fun sending him postcards when we're away from each other."&nbsp;</p><p>Pok&eacute;mon GO appears to be a popular pillar of romantic relationships. Niantic, the app's developer, helped organize five marriage proposals during this year's GO Fest. One of the couples, Alex, 32, and Courtney, 31, began dating in 2020 and play Pok&eacute;mon GO together while walking their dogs. They came down from New Hampshire to attend Pok&eacute;mon GO Fest last year, even though Courtney was recovering from foot surgery in a walking boot. "We look back at it like, 'That was so much fun.'" says Courtney. "We were showing [people] pictures of it from last year, and we got some of our friends at work to start playing it as well."</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Another member of the group, Braden, 29, notes how much the franchise has expanded since establishing its reputation as a children's game of the early aughts. "My mom is like level whatever; she is intense," he says. "She's better at it than I am." He points at his friends standing nearby. "They'll be like, 'Oh yeah, I raided with your mom.'"</p><p>Canadian sisters Tania, 49, and Shelley, 53, are two of the oldest attendees Mashable interviewed at the event. When Pok&eacute;mon GO first dropped in 2016, Shelley says she "didn't want to be one of those old people that just assume that because I don't understand it, it's not cool." So she asked a young person she worked with to explain it to her. "I don't know anything about Pok&eacute;mon. I didn't play the game. I didn't grow up with it," says Shelley. "But I downloaded it and was like, 'This is fucking fun.'" Two weeks later, on a family vacation, she got Tania hooked on the game, too.</p><p>It seems that the core of Pok&eacute;mon brand's legacy &mdash; what has made it the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_media_franchises" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>highest-grossing media franchise</u></a> on earth and an enduring cultural phenomenon for 25 years &mdash; is its ability to bring people together to have a good time.</p><p>The sisters point to their bright yellow paper Pikachu hats, which organizers distributed for free to attendees earlier in the day. "We had to get the hat. We were asking little kids, 'Where'd you get your visor?'" Tania laughs. "It's ridiculous, and we love it. You've gotta lean into the fun."</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Another striking perk that hit the iPhone 15 line last year? The new "tetraprism" telephoto feature, which is just marketing mumbo jumbo for a new 5X optical zoom capability (up from 3X). This feature was reserved for the iPhone 15 Pro Max, so the iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, <em>and </em>iPhone 15 Pro were left out of the party.</p><p>This time around, with the launch of the iPhone 16, Apple is a little less stingy.

<p>Surprisingly, Camera Control isn&rsquo;t a Pro-only feature &mdash; it&rsquo;s available across the <em>entire</em> lineup. I hope Apple isn&rsquo;t reading this (because I don&rsquo;t want them getting any ideas), but as someone who always snaps up the pricier Pro Max, Ultra, or XL models for that "crown jewel" feature, I have to admit &mdash; for the first time in years &mdash; I don&rsquo;t feel the need to with the new iPhone 16.</p><p>I suspect I'd be "complete" with the iPhone 16, which is a rare feeling when it comes to entry-level smartphones these days. </p><p>Sure, I'll lose out on the iPhone 16 Pro Max's new features like 4K video capture at 120Hz, studio-quality mics, a spacious 6.9-inch display, audio track layering in Voice Memos, and more, but I could live without those. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

Luckily, Disney+ has a deal to help you avoid that price hike for a few months.</p><p>For a limited time, enjoy <a href="https://zdcs.link/aB1mBJ?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Disney%2B%20with%20ads&object_type=article&object_uuid=01rCWTfBlXJSOujpJt4W7YH&short_url=aB1mBJ&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Disney+ with ads</a> for $1.99 a month for three months.

<p>Kemen was a somewhat minor presence throughout <em>The Rings of Power </em>Season 1, albeit an unmistakably slimy one. As a rising politician, he worked with his father Ar-Pharaz&ocirc;n (Trystan Gravelle) behind the scenes to turn the people of N&uacute;menor against Queen Tar-M&iacute;riel (Cynthia Addai-Robinson). He even tried his hand at some sneaky arson in order to stop the N&uacute;menorean forces going to Middle-earth.</p><p>But now that Pharaz&ocirc;n is king, Kemen is able to operate in the open, with all the authority of N&uacute;menor behind him. That kind of unchecked power leads to some seriously nasty, entitled behavior. In<em> </em>just the fifth episode of Season 2, Kemen goes on quite the evil tear, cementing himself as one of the biggest threats to Middle-earth &mdash; and the most punchable character in the series.</p><p>Kemen's reign of terror begins with a task from his father: Strip the members of the Sea Guard of their ranks. That includes Captain Elendil (Lloyd Owen), whose loyalty to M&iacute;riel and faithfulness to the Valar constitute as treason in Kemen's eyes. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Kemen only gets worse as the episode goes on, waltzing into the oldest shrine to the Valar in N&uacute;menor and breaking up a memorial service for the soldiers who died in Middle-earth. Hey, wasn't one of the biggest reasons people hated M&iacute;riel because she let soldiers go to Middle-earth in the first place? The hypocrisy is off the charts! The least you could do is let people grieve these losses in peace before you start condemning their shrines.</p><p>But Kemen isn't into doing the least evil. He's here to do the absolute <em>most</em>, whether that's pettily smashing a Valar relic, poking at Elendil's strained relationship with E&auml;rien, or smirking like there's no tomorrow. Serious props to Wadham for selling Kemen's infuriating self-satisfaction so hard. He somehow manages to make a seemingly innocuous statement like "It's in the way of the new aqueduct" the most enraging line in the entire show.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Thankfully, Elendil must have heard my pleas for someone to haul back and punch Kemen in the face, because the legend smacks the living daylights out of him. Remember when Tyrion slapped Joffrey in <a href="https://mashable.com/category/game-of-thrones" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>Game of Thrones</em></a>? Yeah, I felt the exact same levels of hype here.</p><p>The ensuing brawl doesn't end well for Elendil's men, but I'd be lying if I said it didn't rock to see Kemen get absolutely bodied by former Sea Guard member Valandil (Alex Tarrant), though he's ultimately too honorable to finish Kemen off. But you know who doesn't have any problem being dishonorable? That's right, Kemen. N&uacute;menor's biggest twerp stabs Valandil in the back, and just like that, I need him to get decked in the face again. Too bad Elendil's being thrown in jail; otherwise I <em>know </em>he'd follow through.</p><p>Kemen's rage-inducing behavior throughout this episode is not only proof of him being an all-around bad guy &mdash; it's also proof of the corruption of N&uacute;menor, and the Men who live there. No wonder this episode also focuses on <a href="https://mashable.com/video/lord-of-the-rings-of-power-season-2-interviews" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Sauron's (Charlie Vickers)</a> efforts to convince Celebrimbor (Charles Edwards) to make Rings of Power for Men. He knows that people like Kemen exist, and that they'd do anything for power. </p><p>Truly, if Kemen ever comes to Middle-earth, he's a prime candidate for one of the nine rings for Men. <em>Lord of the Rings </em>fans know how that would turn out: with ultimate corruption, and transformation into a Ringwraith. According to Pharaz&ocirc;n, Kemen's late mother <em>did</em> prophesy that he would come to an "ill end," and I'd say becoming a Nazg&ucirc;l falls under that umbrella. (Getting punched again would also qualify, and it would be more than welcome!)</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/zEVoby?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=The%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings%3A%20The%20Rings%20of%20Power%20Season%202%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Prime%20Video%2C%20with%20a%20new%20episode%20every%20Thursday.&object_type=article&object_uuid=00lxP43nQJfL9brctE3veQi&short_url=zEVoby&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em>The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power </em>Season 2 is now streaming on Prime Video, with a new episode every Thursday.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>What the spec sheet doesn't say is that last year's models could charge at a maximum of 30W, while the new ones can peak at 45W, theoretically enabling even faster charging. </p><p>For the end users, this means that they should be able to get their iPhone 16 devices to charge faster than ever if they use a compatible 45W charger.

There&rsquo;s a little something for everyone, whether you&rsquo;re looking to explore your kinky fantasies, make a <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-sites-for-serious-relationships-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>lasting romantic connection</u></a>, search for <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-sites-for-seniors-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>senior love</u></a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-hookup-apps-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>hook up</u></a>, or want to keep things safely socially distanced and just chat.</p><p>And if free videos with easy-to-search categories like Pornhub offers are what do it for you, there&rsquo;s options out there for you. While these sites are by no means perfect and some of them are pretty raunchy, here's the scoop on what you're getting yourself into. </p><h2>What do you need to know about dating on NSFW sites?</h2><p>Keep in mind that &ldquo;dating&rdquo; on NSFW sites like Grindr and GetItOn is about as subtle as the names of the platforms: Users are there to find a connection for a night, a threesome, or an ongoing sex buddy situation &mdash; not a <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-free-dating-sites-for-serious-relationships-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">long-term partner</a>.</p><p>Also, sites like this don&rsquo;t operate without mutual consent and boundary-setting (and respecting). When you&rsquo;re building out your profile, be specific and honest about what you&rsquo;re looking for and wanting so you can find people who genuinely match up with you and your interests or fetishes.</p><h2>Should you use a NSFW site for dating?</h2><p>If you&rsquo;re looking for no-strings-attached sex, or just a sexting or Skype-sexing buddy for the evening, NSFW sites can be ideal for getting your needs met and getting straight to the point. &ldquo;Dating&rdquo; here is a very loose term &mdash; think of these as sites and apps for hooking up.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Users on these apps tend to be fairly direct &mdash; don&rsquo;t expect a dinner invitation before you get asked over to their flat. If that&rsquo;s not your cup of tea and you need a little more of the getting-to-know-someone before jumping into bed with them, these might not be the right sites for you.</p><h2>What precautions should you take when using a NSFW dating site?</h2><p>If you&rsquo;re on a site where you need to share personal information or choose a username, be careful about the information you&rsquo;re giving out &mdash; and about what kind of information it is. Things like credit card numbers are vulnerable to hackers, and using your real name on platforms like these can compromise your safety if you happen to stumble upon the wrong sort of people on the sites.</p><p>Always choose a username that doesn&rsquo;t have a relationship to your first name, and be careful about the personal information you share (like where you live, etc.).</p><h2>What else is important to know when using a NSFW dating site?</h2><p>Besides not giving away any personal information, especially for things like anonymous encounters on cam or sexting sites, know the risks when it comes to sending nude or partially nude photos containing identifying details like your face or tattoos. While it&rsquo;s against the law in many places to circulate private sexual images, that doesn&rsquo;t stop people from doing it.</p><h2>What is the best NSFW dating site?</h2><p>There are plenty of raunchy dating sites out there that should suit just about everyone, but we get that you probably don't want to spend all day perusing the options (or maybe you do). To help you find the best NSFW dating site for you, we have lined up a standout selection.</p><p>We've tried to find something for every type of dater, with popular sites like <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/fcny?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=AdultFriendFinder&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=06UTlKxWKbparvI2r89U3Lw&short_url=fcny&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">AdultFriendFinder</a> and <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/fco0?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=GetItOn&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=06UTlKxWKbparvI2r89U3Lw&short_url=fco0&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">GetItOn</a> making the cut.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/roundups/05RuzISfTYCPalBzradvTnG/hero-image.jpg" alt="Person using laptop"><p>Prime Video is the seriously popular on-demand streaming service that hosts literally thousands of movies, shows, and award-winning Prime Originals. <a href="https://zdcs.link/Albr5?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Amazon%20Prime&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=05RuzISfTYCPalBzradvTnG&short_url=Albr5&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Amazon Prime</a> offers one-day delivery, unlimited music, and includes this impressive streaming service. </p><p>Amazon Prime Video works out at a similar rate to other streaming video services like Netflix. However, you don't get a delivery service, music streaming, and access to the Kindle library with <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-netflix" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Netflix</a>. It's for this reason that so many people continue to sign up to Amazon's video <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-for-streaming-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">streaming service</a>. Amazon Prime Video is available to stream on all the Kindle Fire tablets and more than 600 other devices, including pretty much every computer, smartphone, console, and smart TV you can imagine. </p><p>This all sounds great, but imagine for a moment that not everything is perfect. Imagine that everything is not well with the world, because you have signed up to Amazon Prime Video to specifically watch one programme, and it's only shown on the U.S. version of the service. It's a troubling thought and it seems to happen fairly regularly. </p><p>Fortunately, there is something you can do to avoid this annoying issue. You can use a VPN to gain access to all of the best American content from the UK.</p><h2>What is a VPN?</h2><p><a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Virtual Private Networks</a> (VPNs) provide online privacy and anonymity by creating a private network from a public internet connection. VPNs hide your real IP address so all of your online activity is untraceable and secure. </p><p>Does this make sense? We understand that this sort of technology can be confusing, so it can help to think of a VPN as a tunnel through which all of your online traffic passes. This tunnel is encrypted, meaning that nobody can see into it, and everything inside is protected against online threats like hackers, viruses, and malware.</p><h2>What are the benefits of using a VPN?</h2><p>VPNs are used to provide <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-for-anonymity-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>protection for your sensitive information</u></a>, and this is obviously important. These services are vital for improving you cybersecurity, there is another reason that VPNs are so popular. </p><p>These tools can also be used to watch content that is normally blocked in your location by hiding your real IP address and connecting you to a server in another country. This simple process tricks leading streaming sites into thinking you are based in another country, meaning you can watch all of the extra content from global libraries.</p><p>VPNs are keys to the online world, granting you access to more of the shows and films you love by bypassing geo-restrictions. </p><h2>How do you unblock U.S. Prime Video with a VPN?</h2><p>The process of accessing the American version of Prime Video with a VPN is actually really simple. All you need to do is open up your preferred VPN, select an American server in order to spoof your IP to a U.S. address, and then head to Prime Video. </p><p>There is a bit of a cat and mouse situation with streaming sites and VPNs, as sites like Prime Video and Netflix look to detect VPN usage and block servers. This is why you should always try and pick a VPN with a large and diverse network of servers, so you always have plenty of options to bypass restrictions.</p><p>You will still need to be subscribed to Prime Video for this trick to work. A VPN is not going to grant access to the streaming site for free. Instead, a VPN provides access to more libraries from around the world, once you're subscribed.</p><h2>What is the best VPN for Prime Video?</h2><p>There are plenty of VPNs out there that can bypass online restrictions to unblock Prime Video, which is good and bad. It's great to have options, but with so many VPNs to consider, it can be tough to pick the best option for you. This is where we come in.</p><p>We have outlined the best VPNs for the job. If you're looking to unlock more content from anywhere in the world, we recommend checking out <a href="https://go.expressvpn.com/c/190434/1462855/16063" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">ExpressVPN</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aepMy5?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=PureVPN&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=05RuzISfTYCPalBzradvTnG&short_url=aepMy5&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">PureVPN</a>, <a href="https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=340&amp;aff_id=682" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">NordVPN</a>, and the other names in this list. There should be something for everyone and every budget. You just need to weigh up each VPN against your own set of preferences, and pick a favourite. </p><p>These are the best VPNs for Prime Video in 2024.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/roundups/06Yjajrhg96H0Qhq9PlnJCx/hero-image.jpg" alt="Hand on keyboard"><p>You've probably come across VPNs. These security services protect your data and identity when you're navigating the online world. They are increasingly important in today's world, as the fight against <a href="https://mashable.com/category/cybersecurity" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">cyberthreats</a> becomes more serious every day. Of course, not everyone uses these services for boosting cybersecurity. </p><p>A lot of subscribers sign up to unlock more content from around the world or give themselves an advantage when gaming.</p><h2>What is a VPN?</h2><p>A Virtual Private Network, or VPN, is an essential service that secures your internet connection, giving you greater control over how your online activity can be tracked, and providing a combination of security (keeping your computer and data protected) and privacy (keeping your identity protected). </p><p>So how does a <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-netflix" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">VPN</a> accomplish this? By creating an encrypted connection between your computer and a server operated by the VPN service, that&rsquo;s how. When you&rsquo;re connected to the VPN server, all of your network traffic passes through a safe, protected tunnel that no one else should be able to monitor. That's the theory anyway.</p><p>Even the very <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-deals" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">best VPNs</a> will likely have an impact on your connectivity, though, sometimes to the point where lag gets in the way of your gaming &mdash; which is unacceptable, particularly if you&rsquo;re a first-person shooter fan. </p><h2>Do you need a VPN for gaming?</h2><p>First and foremost, VPNs should be used to protect your personal information when you're online, and that doesn't change if you're gaming. It's important to remain anonymous as hackers and other online threats can still access your personal details when you're playing your favourite titles. The best way to ensure that you're data is private is with a VPN.</p><p>There is an argument that using VPNs can also increase your chances of success when gaming. With games that use skill-based matchmaking, VPNs can help you find easier lobbies. By connecting to a VPN, you can hide your real IP address and connect to a secure server in another location. This simple process tricks the game into thinking you are based elsewhere. Why is this useful when it comes to games like <em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em>? You can connect to a country with fewer gamers, or connect to a country at a less busy time of the day. This reduces your chances of meeting skilled players.</p><h2>What is the best VPN for gaming?</h2><p>So how do you select a VPN when both security and gaming are priorities. You need a <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/cheapest-best-vpn-deals" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">VPN</a> that ticks three boxes &mdash; speed, ping, and protection &mdash; so that when you&rsquo;re in a virtual life and death situation, lag doesn&rsquo;t deliver the killer blow.</p><p>These are the best VPNs for gaming in 2024.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/roundups/01znTPixp2LSOKjC1eYezLJ/hero-image.jpg" alt="Couple holding hands"><p>The chilly period between the beginning of autumn and the start of spring, in which anyone not coupled up finds themselves seeking to be tied down by a serious relationship, is known as <a href="https://mashable.com/archive/awesome-headline" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">cuffing season</a>.&nbsp;It's that time once again.</p><p>We might like to think that we are all deeply complex individuals, but we're actually pretty simple creatures. In the summer, when the sun is shining and temperatures soar, we are more content to remain single. We socialise more, meet <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-hookup-apps-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">new people</a>, and enjoy the feeling of being untethered. However, as we enter the colder months, we yearn for companionship. It&rsquo;s a fact. It&rsquo;s science. It&rsquo;s instinct. </p><p>Much like the bear, we naturally want to bunker down and protect ourselves against the oncoming freeze. That means <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-netflix" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">movie marathons</a>, duvet days, and ideally someone to hold. As the cold weather bites, you owe it to yourself to find that special someone, even if what you are really searching for is a human-sized hot water bottle. Either is fine.</p><h2>Do you actually need to use a dating site?</h2><p><a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-dating-sites-women-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Dating sites and apps</a> can make finding a compatible potential partner easier, but it's still dating. Not everyone is going to be a match. While apps like Bumble let you display what kind of relationship you're looking for, others don't, so you might end up going out with someone only to realise you're not looking for the same thing.</p><p>Having said that, there will be people on dating sites who are looking for the same thing as you. And using a dating app to find them is a lot easier than going up to strangers on the street or in bars and asking if they're looking for a relationship. Apps and dating websites expand your dating pool and allow you to meet people with similar interests you might not run into naturally in your everyday life.</p><h2>Should you use free dating apps?</h2><p>There are a lot of free dating sites and apps out there, and the likes of Tinder and Hinge are seriously popular options with massive networks of users. Plus, most of the biggest and best dating sites have free versions with limitations on certain features. So yes, you can easily enter the online dating game without spending anything. There are levels to this game though, and sometimes free apps just don't cut it.</p><p>This won't be a surprise to hear, but you get what you pay for with dating sites and apps. For the best experience with the greatest possibility of finding exactly what you're looking for, you are going to have to cough up the cash. We're sorry to break it to you, but the best dating sites don't come cheap.</p><p>Why should you consider upgrading to a paid site when there are free services? It all comes down to access to advanced and premium features. You can still find a hookup with a free app, but if you're looking for compatibility tests, chat rooms, videos, and a greater level of control, we recommend upgrading.</p><h2>What is the best dating site for cuffing season?</h2><p>We have compared the best dating sites and apps to help you in your journey, so you can make the most of cuffing season this year. We have lined up a selection of your best options for cuffing season, including popular sites like <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wG7JA?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=AdultFriendFinder&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=01znTPixp2LSOKjC1eYezLJ&short_url=9wG7JA&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">AdultFriendFinder</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qx7NYp?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Match&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=01znTPixp2LSOKjC1eYezLJ&short_url=Qx7NYp&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Match</a>, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGVb2x?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=eharmony&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=01znTPixp2LSOKjC1eYezLJ&short_url=QGVb2x&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">eharmony</a>.

<p>This means not deleting and re-downloading Tinder after every breakup or every time you ghost (or get ghosted by) your current entanglement.&nbsp;Tinder can truly be a great place to meet genuine people who are open to getting serious, to find a reliable friend with benefits, or to get a good-old-fashioned confidence boost from a mutual right swipe. But if you're frustrated with horny users disguising themselves as relationship seekers or relationship seekers who can't handle it when you say you're just looking for a hookup, opting for a dating site more finely-tuned to what you're looking for means you'll spend less time dealing with people who aren't looking for the same thing.&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe you can't stand starting every conversation from scratch. Maybe your biggest fear is ending up on a date with someone who doesn't care about cats. Instead of a lazy bio, dating apps that delve into someone's hobbies, favourite movies, career goals, or political views before even talking to them opens up a wealth of clever ice breakers, and ensures that you aren't going into things blindly.&nbsp;</p><h2>What are dating apps doing to make dating safer?</h2><p>Meeting someone from the internet in person for the first time is nerve-wracking for anyone. But for women, it can dredge up the same fear that occurs when walking alone past a big group of men.&nbsp;</p><p>Match Group is making strides toward a safer dating experience: Tinder was the first to unveil new features coming out of its partnership with <a href="https://mashable.com/article/tinder-noonlight-safety-features-photo-verification" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>Noonlight</u></a>, a safety app that tracks the location of users and notifies authorities if there are concerns. Before heading out on a date, Tinder users can log info about where they're going and who they're meeting, as well as hit a panic button to alert authorities if there's an emergency. </p><p>Match Group plans to roll out the same features for its other apps, like Hinge and OkCupid, later. In March 2021, Tinder announced plans to let users run a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/tinder-background-check-garbo" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>background check</u></a> on their matches.</p><h2>Should you use free dating apps?</h2><p>There are plenty of free dating sites and apps out there, and the likes of Tinder and Hinge are popular options with massive networks of users. You can easily enter the online dating game without spending anything, but you get what you pay for with dating sites and apps. </p><p>For the best experience with the greatest possibility of finding exactly what you're looking for, you are probably going to need to cough up some cash. The best dating sites don't come cheap, and whilst you can still find a hookup with a free app, you should upgrade is you're looking for compatibility tests, chat rooms, videos, and a greater level of control. </p><h2>What are the best dating sites for women?</h2><p>Whether you're looking for a <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-hookup-apps-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">fun time</a> or your next <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-dating-sites-for-serious-relationships-uk" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">long-term relationship</a>, we have picked out a wide range of apps and sites for different types of daters.

<p>Design plays a massive role in the Acer Aspire Vero 16, as it's the heart of the laptop's sustainability. The build is a departure from classic metal frames, instead built from PCR (post-consumer recycled) plastics. Plus, the exterior is VOC- and paint-free to further its sustainability, with a touchpad made from ocean-bound plastics.</p><p>The exterior instead feels like thick, smooth plastic that reminds me of other recycled plastic materials with its speckled gray color. It is meant to be cement-inspired, which... yeah, that's what it's giving. With the plastic structure, it's highly durable with a MIL-STD-810H military-grade rating. It's a rugged laptop designed to withstand shock from drops or temperatures. So, while it is technically plastic, this isn't a crumbling, cheap <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-chromebooks" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Chromebook</a>.</p><p>While one might expect the Aspire Vero 16 to weigh less being made from plastic, it's heavier than its metal counterparts. It weighs 3.97 pounds compared to the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/m3-macbook-air-15-inch" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">15-inch MacBook Air</a>'s 3.3 pounds. Even though the difference is slight, it still feels substantial. I felt that weight when carrying it with one hand like I would my 15-inch MacBook Air. The Acer Aspire Vero 16 was far more difficult to carry with a top-heavy, unbalanced feel.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The biggest design drawback is the recycled plastic touchpad. It was consistently unresponsive as I guided the mouse around the screen. Clicking right and left takes so much pressure that I often felt like I had to slam my hand down to get a response. After my first hour with the laptop, I gave up and plugged in a USB mouse to feel like I could actually use it successfully.</p><p>Luckily, the laptop has an abundance of ports. Maybe it's because I'm usually a MacBook user, but I felt spoiled to have access to multiple USB-A and USB-C ports and an HDMI. When I first saw the plethora, I took a sigh of relief, knowing I wouldn't need the usual adaptors.</p><h2>Acer Aspire Vero 16 performance and battery</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Using the Acer Aspire Vero 16 wasn't the most thrilling experience. It's a solid performer that lives up to daily tasks; however, it never blew me away. Initially, I thought it was a slow mover, taking a while and several clicks to open apps and windows. However, most of that problem was a result of the touchpad. Once I moved over to using a USB mouse, things went faster, sparking the realization that the computer isn't a slow processor; the touchpad is just poorly designed.</p><p>It balances multiple tasks well; I was able to move between various programs while working, juggling word processing, email, Slack, and Spotify. Streaming was mostly seamless. The graphics were disappointing while I was watching YouTube videos or streaming episodes of <em>Survivor</em>. I found the video to look grainier and more pixelated compared to the stellar resolution I'm used to with my MacBook. However, if I weren't so picky, I'd think it looks fine, just a little dull.</p><p>Running <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ipad-pro-2024-m4-benchmarks" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Geekbench 6</a>, its multi-core test came in at <strong>6,274</strong>, middling in range, which I felt occasionally in its performance. After streaming for several hours, I could feel the laptop working harder as it would stall between apps, needing some buffering time to load windows.</p><p>Despite the lackluster graphics, I was surprised at the webcam's resolution. When I tuned into a regular video call, I was pleased with how clear my picture was. However, I was alarmed by how orange I looked, finding quite a bit of color distortion. So, while the 1440p QHD webcam will have your picture sharp, you lose color accuracy.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>On the sound front, both the mic and speakers worked as expected. I could listen to music clearly without a busted, tinny sound.</p><p>The Acer Aspire Vero 16 struggles the most with its performance in terms of battery life. With daily use, I didn't notice how short the battery life was, as I was primarily using it at my desk with close access to the charger. Since it was so bulky, I didn't really want to haul it around.</p><p>I ran a video run-down test to assess the battery, playing <em>Tears of Steel</em> at 1080p on a loop until the battery ran out. The battery life came in at <strong>5 hours 52 minutes</strong>, which is outrun by many other laptops we've tested. It won't get you through an entire workday, but that might not be an issue. Its size and heft make it a reasonably stationary laptop, so you may always be close to your charger anyway.</p><h2>Is the Acer Aspire Vero 16 worth it?</h2><p>Answering if the <a href="https://zdcs.link/znOZE3?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Acer%20Aspire%20Vero%2016&object_type=review&object_uuid=03pN36CLedWwCHPNmmo1V44&short_url=znOZE3&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Acer Aspire Vero 16</a> is worth it is a game of priorities.

Plus, at $749.99 with 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD, it's a decent value for the specs.</p><p>However, if you're just looking for a good, budget-friendly, solid-performing Windows laptop, I would look elsewhere. The Acer Aspire Vero 16 is weak in processing, scoring just 6,274 on the Geekbench 6, and lacks battery life, lasting just under six hours.

<p>Glossing over the low points of Williams' journey earned the film mixed reviews out of its debut at Telluride Film Festival. But the more I mulled over what this movie does offer, the more I was won over by its playful, glossy approach.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Piece By Piece </em>turns America's biggest hip-hop stars into mini-figs.&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>To find the arc of Williams' story, Neville interviewed the multi-hyphenate star, his wife Helen Lasichanh, and a dazzling array of collaborators and colleagues, including Snoop Dogg, Missy Elliott, Jay-Z, The Neptunes' Chad Hugo, Gwen Stefani, and many more. In an interview with Mashable, Williams revealed many of these interviewees had no idea their contribution would be filtered through a Lego lens, and only discovered they'd been transformed into mini-figs when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDlnwQCkiSA" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><u>the first trailer hit.&nbsp;</u></a></p><p>Neville's visual translation of these interviews includes amusing flourishes, like turning Snoop Dog into a Lego Doberman, and making metaphors about bakeries literal, with Lego Pharrell selling sweet treats the way he sold hit beats. In one instance, the idea of blowing one's mind with a sick bit of music is illustrated by having a smiling mini-fig&rsquo;s head pop right off its base in amazement. These choices bring a playfulness into the film that not only is sure to delight fans of <em>The Lego Movie </em>and <em>The Lego Batman Movie</em>, but also reflects the tone of Williams' hits, like "Happy" and "Get Lucky."&nbsp;</p><p>More than this however, by turning himself into a plaything, <em>Piece By Piece </em>gives Williams a creative distance to reflect on his own life as if it is one of his many media projects. Through warm narration, he opens up about his childhood in the Atlantis Apartments in Virginia Beach, Virginia. The colorful blocks not only reconstruct his humble home but also a more fantastical version of Atlantis, where an Afro-wearing baby Pharrell swims about with a giant goldfish as Poseidon looks on. This charming spectacle showcases Pharrell's imagination manifesting big, surreal scenarios, which becomes a recurring theme &mdash;&nbsp;down to dreaming up a Lego music biopic.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Piece By Piece </em>is a <em>Little Engine That Could</em> tale that kids will relish.</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>After this whimsical dip into brick-made oceans, Williams admits he was considered an oddball by others, confessing, "It broke my spirit." But weird kids out there (or the weird adults they became) might find solace as little Pharrell finds his crew, each of whom also revels in making music. From there, <em>Piece By Piece </em>becomes a story of succeeding by staying true to yourself and putting in the work to build your dream, brick by brick. Along the way, Neville laces various hits that Pharrell has contributed to, from "Hot in Herre" and "Shake Ya Ass" to "Hollaback Girl" and "Blurred Lines." (Parents, don't fret. Some of the racier lyrics have been delicately plucked out.)&nbsp;</p><p>While it's initially fun to indulge in the nostalgia as Neville recreates iconic music videos with mini-figs, this device begins to get old as the story of his rise makes for a lot of name- and track-dropping. Pardon the pun, but things get a bit one-note. Then when it comes to a low point &mdash;&nbsp;a necessity for any biopic or story for that matter &mdash;&nbsp;Williams pulls back.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Piece By Piece</em> can't commit to its big swing.&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Rosy memories of childhood troubles is one thing, but sharing why his career took a dip is a Lego bridge too far. Instead of probing questions, Neville paves a path with platitudes about how his subject's greatest weakness is he has too many ideas. Colleagues speak vaguely about some business missteps or shameless yes-men who gave Williams bad advice, and these unnamed negative influences are imagined as a trio of gray-skinned ghouls wearing smiles and business suits.&nbsp;</p><p>Here the film suffers. Even with the mask of the mini-fig, Williams can't let his audience into the dark moments. (On the other hand, this is where <a href="https://mashable.com/article/better-man-review-robbie-williams" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>Better Man</u></em></a> positively thrives.) Swiftly, Williams has reconnected with his pure inspiration, and the third act becomes a rousing celebration of song, dance, and Lego bits humorous and heartfelt. But this fumbled beat undercuts the movie's message. Being true to yourself isn't a one-time battle; it's ongoing. But with a community &mdash;&nbsp;like the mini-fig friends and family in <em>Piece By Piece</em> &mdash;&nbsp;one might get their block knocked off and still rebuild.&nbsp;</p><p>Even with help from an on-screen avatar, can Williams not admit the ugly truths of his own story? Or did he and Neville fear self-doubt in anything but the briefest mention might bring down the joy of their movie? To that, I'd point to the other Lego movies, where the Lego universe and Lego Gotham are brought to the brink of utter destruction without us losing faith in their mini-fig heroes. Heck, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/lego-movie-2-the-second-part-movie-review" target="_self" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body"><em><u>The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part</u></em></a><em> </em>even made the dark side of its happy hero the mini-fig villain!&nbsp;</p><p>This wobble aside, <em>Piece By Piece </em>is a winsome reinvention of the music biopic. Animation is enthusiastically employed to bring the audience into the experience of being Pharrell Williams. The colorful blocks not only allow the construction of musical beats to become a physical act rather than an abstract idea, but also give a <em>Ratatouille-</em>like understanding of how this art form affects its hero. His synesthesia is showcased in waves of color as the beat bounces.&nbsp;</p><p>While this colorful concept means <em>Piece By Piece </em>can be a hit with kids, it's easy to wish the movie dared to delve a bit more into the problems of being a grown-up. But all in all, <em>Piece By Piece </em>is a delight that could well have audiences dancing in the aisles.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Piece By Piece </em>was reviewed out of its International Premiere at the 2024 Toronto International Film Festival. <a href="https://zdcs.link/aXd7DO?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=The%20movie%20will%20hit%20theaters%20Oct.%2011.&object_type=article&object_uuid=05CiYKZQBNgWR1QnQltQ1kH&short_url=aXd7DO&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">The movie will hit theaters Oct. 11.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

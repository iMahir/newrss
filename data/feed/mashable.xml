The game is all about finding the "common threads between words." And just like <em>Wordle</em>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-20-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> resets after midnight and each new set of words gets trickier and trickier&mdash;so we've served up some hints and tips to get you over the hurdle.</p><p>If you just want to be told today's puzzle, you can jump to the end of this article for August 11's <em>Connections</em> solution. But if you'd rather solve it yourself, keep reading for some clues, tips, and strategies to assist you.</p><h2>What is Connections?</h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

    </a>
</blockquote>
<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>
<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. Like <em>Wordle, </em>you can share the results with your friends on social media.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

How do you one up that announcement? With lots and lots of new ones.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Day one of the weekend event saw the return of several Disney classics like The Incredibles, Toy Story, and Frozen. And between Disney Animation Studios, Pixar, Marvel, and Star Wars, there was something for everyone. That's why we rounded up every announcement, trailer, teaser, remake, and more so you don't have to miss a thing.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2><a href="https://mashable.com/video/moana-2-trailer-disney-expands-on-lore-of-original" target="_self"><em>Moana 2</em></a></h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-hDZ7y8RP5HE"></div>
</div>


<p>Kicking off the entertainment showcase was the official trailer for <em>Moana 2</em>. Set three years later, Moana and demigod trickster Maui team up once again to face a new threat to Oceania.</p><p>It seems Disney has plans for Moana to be its new flagship Disney Princess, because, on top of the sequel, we're also getting a live-action remake. That has already started production and can be expected in 2026. However, you can catch <em>Moana 2 </em>on November 27, 2024.</p><h2><a href="https://mashable.com/video/disney-snow-white-teaser-trailer-rachel-zegler-gal-gadot" target="_self"><em>Snow White</em></a></h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-TbiPcMCz0Ek"></div>
</div>


<p>This one has been in production hell and subject to some intense controversy since filming wrapped up in 2022. However, the release of the live-action remake of Disney's 1937 classic is finally on the horizon.</p><p>The teaser trailer gives us our first looks at Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot as Snow White and the Evil Queen respectively, along with its heavily-CGI'd world. This one hits theaters on March 21, 2025.</p><h2>First look at Stitch in the live-action remake of <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em></h2><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p><em>Lilo &amp; Stitch </em>is another classic Disney film that no one really asked for a live-action remake of, but we're getting one anyway. Given Disney's visual effects track record when it comes to anthropomorphic animals, our first look at Stitch is exactly what one would expect, which boils down to "yep, that's him alright."</p><p>Beyond that initial teaser at D23, it was also announced that this adaptation of the 2002 cult classic will get a Summer 2025 release.</p><h2><em>Incredibles 3</em> announcement</h2><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>With <em>Fantastic 4</em> getting some love as of late, it makes sense that the family film franchise inspired by Marvel's First Family is announced to be making its return. Helmed by long-time writer and director of the series Brad Bird, <em>Incredibles 3 </em>was announced as in production at Pixar.</p><p>No further details have been provided outside the announcement. It should be noted that <em>Incredibles 2</em> was the highest-grossing animated film of all time until <em>Inside Out 2</em> took the throne.</p><h2><em>Toy Story 5</em> teaser</h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-F8N0-ViM254"></div>
</div>


<p>Speaking of beloved animated Pixar movies that ... maybe should've ended two films ago, fans at D23 got a small teaser for <em>Toy Story 5</em>. According to director Andrew Stanton, Woody, Buzz, and the gang will be fighting to stop their new child from becoming an iPad kid.</p><p>&ldquo;This time around, it&rsquo;s toy meets tech," Stanton said at D23. "It&rsquo;s going to be fun, and we can&rsquo;t wait for you all to see it in the summer of 2026."</p><h2><em>Frozen 3</em></h2><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Oscar-winning film <em>Frozen</em> is set to get its third movie in the franchise sometime in 2027, according to its creator Britney Lee. There was also a small teaser shown to guests at D23 that showed Elsa and Anna riding a white horse and a brown stag.</p><p>Beyond that, it was also announced that after the release of <em>Frozen 3</em>, there are plans for a <em>Frozen 4</em>.</p><h2><em>Zootopia 2</em></h2><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Oh, look, another sequel. This time, it's for the hit Disney film <em>Zootopia</em>, which saw bunny cop Judy Hopps blackmail fox con artist Nick into helping her solve a crime. </p><p>The duo is back again with <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ke-huy-quan-wins-best-supporting-actor-oscars-2023" target="_self">Oscar-winner Ke Huy Quan</a> as a snake named Gary. The casting of Quan was the big news regarding this announcement, but fans of the series can expect this to hit theaters around Thanksgiving of next year.</p><h2><em>Star Wars: Skeleton Crew</em></h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-a6voXgBlmpk"></div>
</div>


<p><em>Skeleton Crew </em>is set during the New Republic era, the years after <em>Return of the Jedi</em>, and based on its plot synopsis, will be about four kids lost in the galaxy trying to make their way home. Jude Law is also set to make his debut in the galaxy far, far away, this time as a force user named Jod Na Nawood. </p><p>We also got a first look at what the suburbs look like in the Star Wars universe. Based on the trailer shown at D23, this show is heavily inspired by classic Steven Spielberg films like <em>E.T. </em>and <em>Hook</em>.</p><p><em>Star Wars: Skeleton Crew</em> premieres on Disney+ on Dec. 3.</p><h2><em>Agatha All Along</em></h2><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-R9pXbNz6Vbw"></div>
</div>


<p>A new trailer for the <em>WandaVision </em>sequel series <a href="https://mashable.com/video/agatha-all-along-trailer" target="_self"><em>Agatha All Along</em></a> hit the stage at D23, along with a performance of an original song, "The Ballad of the Witches Road."</p><p>Kathryn Hahn will reprise her role as the witch Agatha Harkness and is joined in the show by costars Joe Locke, Patti LuPone, Aubrey Plaza, Sasheer Zamata, Ali Ahn, and Debra Jo Rupp. </p><p>The show will follow Hahn in the aftermath of <em>WandaVision</em> having to face a "magical gauntlet of trials" along the Witches Road as she seeks to gain her powers back.</p><p>The first two episodes of <em>Agatha All Along </em>will premiere on Disney+ on September 18.</p><h2><em>The Fantastic Four: First Steps</em> snippet</h2><p>Fans at D23 got an exclusive sneak peek at the initial teaser trailer for Marvel's <em>The Fantastic Four: First Steps </em>starring Pedro Pascal (Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic), Vanessa Kirby (Sue Storm/The Invisible Woman), Joseph Quinn (Johnny Storm/The Human Torch), and Ebon Moss-Bachrach (Ben Grimm/The Thing). This didn't stop fans from recording it and posting it across social media though, and it can easily be found by searching. </p><p>The trailer is the same one shown at SDCC last month and is made from lots of test footage and conceptual previsualization reels. Still, what Marvel has on hand now with filming still ongoing is pretty impressive.</p><p>Alongside the all-star cast as Marvel's First Family, the film will also star Julia Garner (<a href="https://mashable.com/article/women-of-ozark-season-2" target="_self"><em>Ozark</em></a>) as the Silver Surfer's lover Shalla-Bal, and Ralph Ineson (<a href="https://mashable.com/article/what-happened-in-the-witch" target="_self"><em>The Witch</em></a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-first-omen-review" target="_self"><em>The First Omen</em></a>) as the world-devouring entity Galactus. Paul Walter Hauser, Natasha Lyonne, and John Malkovich will also co-star in undisclosed roles.</p><p><em>The Fantastic Four: First Steps</em> is set to release on July 25, 2025.</p><h2><em>Daredevil: Born Again</em> snippet</h2><p>Alongside <em>Fantastic Four, </em>Marvel's <em>Daredevil: Born Again </em>sequel series also had its exclusive trailer leaked on the internet by phone-happy fans. Feel free to search, because we won't be embedding the trailer for this one here either.</p><p>Serving as a continuation of the beloved Netflix <em>Daredevil, </em>Charlie Cox and his co-stars Vincent D'Onofrio (Kingpin), Deborah Ann Woll (Karen Page), and Elden Henson (Foggy Nelson) all return to make their official debuts into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. </p><p>The trailer shown at D23 was jam-packed with surprises such as the return of Jon Bernthal's Punisher and Wilson Bethel's Bullseye. Alongside them was our first look at the costumed vigilante White Tiger.</p><p>There's no official trailer yet, but the show is set to release on Disney+ on March 1, 2025.</p><h2>Avatar 3 is now <em>Avatar: Fire and Ash</em></h2><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>After the smash success of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/avatar-2-the-way-of-water-review" target="_self"><em>Avatar: The Way of Water</em></a>, it makes sense that its planned follow-up film will be all about fire. Director James Cameron and stars Sam Worthington and Zoe Salda&ntilde;a took took the stage to reveal the official title to the next film in the franchise, <em>Avatar: Fire and Ash</em>.</p><p>While no official details of the sequel were revealed, Cameron did show attendees concept art from the film showing the Ash People of the Na'vi and their otherworldly masks &mdash; taking clear inspiration from traditional Native American ghost dances.</p><p>The planned release date for <em>Fire and Ash </em>is December 19, 2025, but if you can't wait and want some Na'vi lore to fill the gap, check out Massive Entertainment's <a href="https://mashable.com/review/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-review-mashable-playstation-5" target="_self"><em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora </em></a><a href="https://mashable.com/review/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-review-mashable-playstation-5" target="_self">video game</a>.</p><h2>Freaky Friday 2 is now <em>Freakier Friday</em></h2><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>While there aren't a lot of details about this film, stars Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee-Curtis appeared on stage to announce that Freaky Friday 2, the sequel to the 2003 film, will officially be titled <em>Freakier Friday</em>.</p><p><a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/freaky-friday-sequel-jamie-lee-curtis-lindsay-lohan/" target="_blank">According to a Disney press release</a>, the sequel sees the return of mother-daughter duo Tess and Anna Coleman (Curtis and Lohan respectively) as Anna and her daughter prepare to marry into a new family.</p><p>Also returning in <em>Freakier Friday</em> from the original cast are Mark Harmon, Chad Michael Murray, Christina Vidal Mitchell, Haley Hudson, Lucille Soong, Stephen Tobolowsky, and Rosalind Chao.</p><p><em>Freakier Friday </em>is set to release sometime in 2025.</p><h2><em>Tron: Ares</em></h2><p>Finally to cap off this round-up of D23's entertainment showcase was the reveal and first look at the third film in the Tron franchise, <em>Tron: Ares</em>.</p><p>Jeff Bridges once again returns to the series set in the world inside a computer mainframe. Co-starring alongside Bridges are Evan Peters, Greta Lee, and Jared Leto as the titular Ares, a highly sophisticated AI sent to the real world for an undisclosed mission.

However, we won't complain about getting more.</p><p><em>Tron: Ares </em>is set to release on October 10, 2025.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Unfortunately, it can also <a href="https://mashable.com/article/mapping-lgbtq-history-pride" target="_self">involve having your space</a> invaded by straight people, or seeing your ex-girlfriends (and your ex-girlfriends' ex-girlfriends) show up in your feed over and over.</p><p>Back in 2020, the heteronormative weirdness on the apps got so alienating that many <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/style/lesbian-tiktok-dating.html" target="_blank"><u>lesbians turned to TikTok</u></a> as a means of meeting other single lesbians (<a href="https://mashable.com/article/lgbtq-youth-of-color-online-safety-report-trevor-project" target="_self">and it worked</a>). Unfortunately, it's just not realistic to expect a social media app to work like a <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-apps" target="_self">dating app</a> for everyone. Lesbians who have exhausted their local romantic options are still going to want to meet new women in time for cuffing season.</p><p>And while it's still all too common to match with a woman just to be hit with the classic, "My boyfriend and I are looking for a threesome," dating apps have been making strides against unicorn hunting. Our favorite apps now give queer women an actually safe space to meet and date other women and non-binary folks.</p><p>So, what are the best dating apps for lesbians? We tested the most popular dating sites and apps and got some insight from our <a href="https://mashable.com/category/dating-relationships" target="_self">Dating &amp; Relationships</a> writers to find out.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>How to find the best dating apps for lesbians</h2><p>Mainstream dating apps attract the most users &mdash; including queer users. That means niche lesbian dating apps aren't your only options for finding love. These days, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/hinge-lgbtq-dating-identity-questions" target="_self">Hinge</a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/bumble-nonbinary-users-message-first" target="_self">Bumble</a>, OkCupid, and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/eharmony-launches-new-features-for-lgbtq-users" target="_self">even eharmony</a> all have clear filters to help you match with people of the same gender (or any gender at all), as well as filters that acknowledge the existence of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/what-is-consensual-non-monogamy" target="_self">non-traditional relationships</a>. Especially if you don't live in a densely populated area, going for the more popular dating apps over lesbian dating sites can often lead to better results. </p><p>With that said, there is one dating app lesbian women should try. HER is an app by and for queer women, and it's grown to have a strong user base. According to <a href="https://zdcs.link/1Gyqb?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=their%20website&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=05OeYFtDK5qi44fkvKr0KKO&short_url=1Gyqb&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">their website</a>, the app has <em>more than 15 million registered users</em> worldwide. The app also emphasizes finding community and making friends in addition to dating, giving you plenty of ways to find a connection with other queer women and non-binary users.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Although black holes themselves don't emit light, the blazing hot material around them does. Most stuff in a black hole's orbit gets shredded apart and spins rapidly around the black hole, forming a <a href="https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/13326" target="_blank">super-hot, donut-like "accretion disk."</a> As this cosmic dust and gas relentlessly spins around, it shoots light and energy into <a href="https://mashable.com/category/space" target="_self">space</a>. Importantly, some of this cosmic material can also rapidly plummet down <em>into the black hole</em>, where it travels at extreme speeds, heating up and producing glowing light.</p><p>That's the vivid glow you see at the center of the spiral galaxy below. And amid the light, you can see innumerable little pinpoints of light, each a distant star.</p><p>Clearly, this supermassive black hole is ingesting lots of cosmic cuisine. But once this glowing material passes the final boundary between space and the black hole, called the "<a href="https://mashable.com/article/black-hole-picture-scientists-explain" target="_self">event horizon</a>," no more light is emitted. It's passed the point of no return. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Also clearly visible in the galaxy, an object also known as "Messier 106," are two sprawling green outflows, which are made of hot gas. "They are likely caused by outflowing material produced by the violent churning of gas around the black hole, creating a phenomenon analogous to a wave crashing up out of the ocean when it hits a rock near the shore," the <a href="https://esawebb.org/images/potm2407a/" target="_blank">space agency explained</a>.</p><p>The spiraling reddish-orange regions are similar to the dust and star-filled spirals of our own Milky Way galaxy.

But it's also peering at <a href="https://mashable.com/article/james-webb-space-telescope-exoplanet-discovery-1" target="_self">intriguing planets</a> in our galaxy, along with the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/james-webb-space-telescope-uranus-polar-cap" target="_self">planets and moons in our solar system</a>.</p><p>Here's how Webb is achieving unparalleled feats, and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/james-webb-space-telescope-meteoroid-damage-nasa" target="_self">likely will for decades to come</a>:</p><p><strong>- Giant mirror: </strong>Webb's mirror, which captures light, is over 21 feet across. That's over two-and-a-half times larger than the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/space-hubble-most-distant-star" target="_self">Hubble Space Telescope's</a> mirror. Capturing more light allows Webb to see more distant, ancient objects. As described above, the telescope is peering at stars and galaxies that formed over 13 billion years ago, just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang. "We're going to see the very first stars and galaxies that ever formed," Jean Creighton, an astronomer and the director of the Manfred Olson Planetarium at the University of Wisconsin&ndash;Milwaukee, told Mashable in 2021.</p><p><strong>- Infrared view: </strong>Unlike Hubble, which largely views light that's visible to us, Webb is primarily an infrared telescope, meaning it views light in the infrared spectrum. This allows us to see far more of the universe. Infrared has longer <a href="https://scied.ucar.edu/learning-zone/atmosphere/wavelength" target="_blank">wavelengths</a> than visible light, so the light waves more efficiently slip through <a href="https://mashable.com/article/carina-nebula-james-webb-space-telescope" target="_self">cosmic clouds</a>; the light doesn't as often collide with and get scattered by these densely packed particles. Ultimately, Webb's infrared eyesight can penetrate places Hubble can't.</p><p>"It lifts the veil," said Creighton.</p><p><strong>- Peering into distant exoplanets: </strong>The Webb telescope <a href="https://webbtelescope.org/news/webb-science-writers-guide/webbs-scientific-instruments" target="_blank"><u>carries specialized equipment called spectrographs</u></a> that will revolutionize our understanding of these far-off worlds. The instruments can decipher what molecules (such as water, carbon dioxide, and methane) exist in the atmospheres of distant exoplanets &mdash; be they gas giants or smaller rocky worlds. Webb looks at <a href="https://mashable.com/article/james-webb-space-telescope-exoplanet-direct-image" target="_self">exoplanets</a> in the Milky Way galaxy. Who knows what we'll find?</p><p>"We might learn things we never thought about," Mercedes L&oacute;pez-Morales, an exoplanet researcher and astrophysicist at the <a href="https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Center for Astrophysics-Harvard &amp; Smithsonian</a>, told Mashable in 2021.</p><p>Already, astronomers have successfully found intriguing chemical reactions on a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/james-webb-space-telescope-exoplanet-discovery" target="_self">planet 700 light-years away</a>, and have started looking at one of the most anticipated places in the cosmos: the rocky, Earth-sized planets of the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/james-webb-space-telescope-trappist-planet" target="_self">TRAPPIST solar system</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Not only are they the most populous stars, but their planets are easier to study from a practical standpoint. Current atmosphere-detecting methods work best when planets orbit fairly close to their stars in <a href="https://mashable.com/category/space" target="_self"><u>space</u></a>.&nbsp;Red dwarf stars' relatively cooler temperatures present an opportunity for worlds to be closer without getting fried.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite red dwarfs' potential, no one knows for sure whether their worlds can have atmospheres, or what chemicals could be within their air.&nbsp;</p><p>Scientists will soon begin to answer those questions with the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/webb-space-telescope-first-image-targets" target="_self"><u>James Webb Space Telescope</u></a>, a partnership of <a href="https://mashable.com/category/nasa" target="_self"><u>NASA</u></a> and its European and Canadian counterparts. A new large-scale program will budget about 500 hours for observing rocky exoplanets orbiting small red stars, specifically to search for atmospheres.&nbsp;</p><p>Though the survey is designated for Webb's fourth research cycle, which starts next July, observations may begin sooner, said N&eacute;stor Espinoza, an astronomer heading the program's implementation team.&nbsp;</p><p>"This is one of those high-risk, high-reward programs," he told Mashable. "Imagine that for all of the targets, we detect atmospheres. Then you answer the question, 'Yes, atmospheres are very common around these stars. That means maybe life can emerge.' On the other hand, if you found out that none of them have atmospheres, that would be pretty sad, but also pretty interesting. It would mean that our planetary system is actually really, really special."</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Most astronomers agree that <a href="https://mashable.com/article/james-webb-space-telescope-exoplanets" target="_self">detecting atmospheres</a> is crucial in the quest for habitable worlds. NASA has playfully called Earth's own atmosphere its "security blanket": Without it, the type of life flourishing here wouldn't exist. This cocoon holds oxygen in the air and filters out harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun, all while keeping our world warm. Furthermore, it creates pressure that allows liquid water to pool on the surface.</p><p>Scientists have found signs of atmospheres surrounding many of the <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/exoplanets/discoveries-dashboard/" target="_blank"><u>5,700</u></a> exoplanets discovered so far, but all of them have been around <a href="https://webb.nasa.gov/content/science/origins.html" target="_blank"><u>gas giant planets</u></a>, like <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nasa-jupiter-moon-images-juno" target="_self"><u>Jupiter</u></a>, with air mostly made of hydrogen. The hunt for a more terrestrial world swaddled in a protective atmosphere has so far eluded astronomers, though Webb has recently helped scientists find some reasonable bets, such as <a href="https://mashable.com/article/james-webb-space-telescope-rocky-exoplanet-atmosphere" target="_self"><u>55 Cancri e</u></a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/james-webb-space-telescope-rocky-exoplanet-water" target="_self"><u>GJ 486 b</u></a>, and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/james-webb-space-telescope-exoplanet-air" target="_self"><u>LHS 1140 b</u></a>.</p><p>Jennifer Lotz, who directs Webb and Hubble's operations at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, <a href="https://www.stsci.edu/contents/news/jwst/2024/stsci-initiates-a-concerted-search-for-atmospheres-around-m-dwarf-exoplanets.html" target="_blank"><u>recently decided to initiate</u></a> the rocky exoplanet survey using the director's discretionary time, in the same way revolutionary science campaigns like the <a href="https://hubblesite.org/contents/articles/hubble-deep-fields" target="_blank"><u>Hubble deep field images</u></a> came to fruition.

<h2><strong>Secondary eclipse technique</strong></h2><p>Since Webb opened for business, researchers have frequently used a technique called <a href="https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/resources/58/isolating-a-planets-spectrum/" target="_blank"><u>transmission spectroscopy</u></a> to study exoplanets. When these worlds cross in front of their host star, starlight gets filtered through their atmospheres. Molecules within the atmosphere absorb certain light wavelengths, or colors, so by splitting the light into its basic parts &mdash; like a rainbow &mdash; astronomers can detect what light segments are missing to discern the molecular makeup of an atmosphere.</p><p>But that method has had its drawbacks. If the starlight were completely uniform, that would be one thing, but red dwarf stars, also known as M dwarfs, can get <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nasa-sun-sunspots-images" target="_self"><u>stellar spots</u></a> just like the sun, causing variability in the signals. This problem, called stellar contamination, has recently led Webb scientists to embrace another technique, known as secondary eclipse observations.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>With <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/resource/wasp-18-b-animation-of-an-exoplanet-eclipse/" target="_blank"><u>secondary eclipses</u></a>, it's a game of hide-and-seek. Scientists measure the signals of the red dwarf and planet when the planet is at the star's side. Then, when the planet's orbit takes the world behind the star, scientists collect the star's light signal alone. By subtracting the star from the total, the researchers can then isolate the light coming from just the planet. Teams will use a particular wavelength filter that can detect carbon dioxide, thought to be a likely atmospheric ingredient.</p><p>Scientists will also take thermal measurements to get an early sense of whether an atmosphere could be present. If the temperature is lower than expected, it's a strong indication that a thick atmosphere is distributing energy from the planet's dayside &mdash; the hemisphere facing the star &mdash; to the nightside.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Webb's Survey of Rocky Worlds</strong></h2><p>The new campaign will allow scientists to survey <a href="https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/HPR/Strategic+Exoplanet+Initiatives+with+HST+and+JWST?preview=/173148156/246972530/Exoplanet_WG_Final_Report.pdf" target="_blank"><u>10 to 20 rocky worlds</u></a>, with an emphasis on planets between 200 and 450 Kelvin. For comparison, Earth is 288 Kelvin, or an average 59 degrees Fahrenheit. Most of the targets will be less than twice the size of Earth. The Space Telescope Science Institute will put out a call for advisers to help determine the target list.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>For Kevin Stevenson, an astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, the wishlist would include GJ 486 b, a world he has previously studied, and <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/exoplanet-catalog/ltt-1445-a-b/" target="_blank"><u>LTT 1445 A b</u></a>, one of the nearest strong cases for having air. He believes the Webb campaign will advance humans' understanding of rocky worlds by a decade.&nbsp;</p><p>"This survey program will be the next major step towards answering the question, 'Are we alone?'"

As scientists increasingly peer at other rocky, Earth-like worlds, they evaluated whether it's possible to pick up signs of widespread solar farms on such distant planets. After all, an extraterrestrial society will need power, and a sun-like star provides nearly inexhaustible energy for billions of years. Human civilization, for example, has advanced from largely burning wood to using coal, and now increasingly uses modernized energy sources like solar power.</p><p>"We propose it's a natural technological evolution that an advanced civilization could make," Ravi Kopparapu, a NASA planetary scientist who led the research published in the <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad43d7" target="_blank"><em>Astrophysical Journal</em></a>, told Mashable.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Solar panels &mdash; made from silicon, which is abundant in the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/james-webb-space-telescope-oldest-starlight-early-universe" target="_self">universe</a> &mdash; are highly reflective. This makes vast solar arrays a potentially attractive target for NASA, which seeks to identify if life, whether microbial or complex, might exist on planets beyond our <a href="https://mashable.com/article/mars-asteroid-jupiter-moons-space" target="_self">solar system</a> (called <a href="https://mashable.com/article/planets-exoplanets-discovery-2024" target="_self">exoplanets</a>). </p><p>The researchers asked whether a large space telescope, like the developing Habitable Worlds Observatory, would be able to detect such solar farms on a world as far as some 30 light-years away (which is many trillions of miles but still relatively close-by &mdash; the Milky Way is around 100,000 light-years across). Dubbed the "super-Hubble," the Habitable Worlds Observatory would pack a mirror some six meters (nearly 20 feet) across; the legendary <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nasa-asteroid-dart-mission-hubble-image" target="_self">Hubble telescope</a> has a mirror 2.4 meters (7.8 feet) across. </p><p>On <a href="https://mashable.com/article/earth-pictures-images-from-space" target="_self">Earth</a>, the researchers estimate humanity could meet all its energy needs (with energy storage, of course) by covering around two and a half percent of the surface with solar panels. And if the population hypothetically ballooned to 30 billion, this would mean nine percent of land cover. But how much of the surface of a distant exoplanet might need to be blanketed in these reflective arrays to be detectable? The team ran simulations of how a "super-Hubble" could view these far-off solar panel technosignatures, and found a whopping 23 percent of an Earth-like world's surface would need coverage.</p><p>"That's huge," Kopparapu said. </p><p>And it's perhaps an unlikely scenario from our species' point of view &mdash; though as noted below, perhaps not so for another species. What's more, another civilization simply might not need to generate copious amounts of energy, making sprawling energy-creating solar farms or structures unnecessary. Another civilization could have highly efficient technologies, or a low population. This would make widespread solar panel coverage unlikely.</p><p>"A civilization may not need as much energy as we think," Kopparapu said.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2>Using the NuFACE for the first time&nbsp;</h2><p>Not gonna lie, waiting for the NuFACE Trinity+ to charge felt like torture. I&rsquo;d been eager to try the device after first seeing it on Instagram back in 2019, and I wanted it to be worth the hype. Once it was ready, I watched a few tutorials on the NuFace website and jumped right in.</p><p>NuFACE recommends cleaning your face first with an oil-free cleanser, drying your skin thoroughly, then applying either their Aqua Gel or Silk Cr&egrave;me Activator in a thick, &ldquo;mask-like&rdquo; layer to the area you&rsquo;re going to treat. After that, it&rsquo;s time to turn on the device, set it to your desired intensity, and place it against your skin before gliding it upward with light to medium pressure.</p><p>I started with NuFACE&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.mynuface.com/blogs/how-to-use/5-minute-facial-lift" target="_blank"><u>five-minute facial</u></a> tutorial, which recommended starting with your neck and gradually moving the device upward in separate strokes before repeating the process over the desired area three times. All in all, it took me a little longer than five minutes to complete, and &mdash; aside from a slight tingling sensation in certain areas &mdash; it was pretty much painless.</p><h2>I kinda hated the NuFACE at first</h2><p>While I noticed a slight improvement in the tightness of my skin, especially below my cheeks, I didn&rsquo;t notice a massive difference after my first NuFACE treatment. My face did feel a little sore afterward, especially around my cheeks and jawline, and everything just felt a little off for the next hour or so. I kept using the device daily &mdash; NuFACE recommends using it five days a week for the first two months, then switching to two to three days for maintenance &mdash; but the odd sensations convinced me to stop using the device after a few days.</p><p>A couple of weeks later, I decided to give the NuFACE one more try. I&rsquo;d read some reviews from users who didn&rsquo;t use the NuFACE on their necks (something the company recommends if you have any thyroid issues), and &mdash; while I haven&rsquo;t had any thyroid problems in the past &mdash; I wanted to see if it made a difference, and it absolutely did.&nbsp;</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

        </a>
    </div>
<p>I cautiously restarted my routine, ready to toss the NuFACE if it caused any more issues, and started noticing slight improvements to my skin&rsquo;s elasticity the longer I used it. Everything felt a little more taut, my face looked more defined, and &mdash; while my cheekbones still felt a bit sore after using the device &mdash; a quick trip to Google gave me a surprising answer. As it turns out, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30667597/" target="_blank"><u>research</u></a> shows that microcurrent technology can be used to help reduce sinus pain, and the FDA had even approved the use of another microcurrent device for the treatment of sinus congestion &mdash; something I&rsquo;d struggled with for years. Obviously, I&rsquo;m not a doctor, nor can I conclusively say that the NuFACE produced the same results as an FDA-approved device. However, my lack of sinus headaches was definitely a nice perk, regardless of whether they were eliminated by the NuFACE or placebo effect.</p><h2>The NuFACE won me over</h2><p>Here&rsquo;s the thing, I actually like the NuFACE. I&rsquo;ve had the device for a few months now, and I have definitely noticed an improvement in my face when I&rsquo;m using it. I&rsquo;m a little less puffy, my cheeks are more defined, and I like the idea of giving my facial muscles a mini workout a few times a week.&nbsp;</p><p>That being said, I&rsquo;m on the fence about whether or not it&rsquo;s worth the $395 price tag. On the upside, it worked. A single charge lasted for a surprisingly long time, it was easy to use, and I felt like it did more to lift and tighten my face compared to other microcurrent devices I&rsquo;d tried in the past.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, I had some issues. I didn&rsquo;t love using either of the activator products, and I quickly found out that aloe vera was a much more affordable alternative. Plus, the NuFACE companion app didn&rsquo;t feel super useful, and I struggled with the Bluetooth connectivity feature on the NuFACE Trinity+ so much that I stopped using the app entirely. And while I eventually sorted out my initial problems with the device, I haven&rsquo;t really kept up with using the device long-term. I&rsquo;ll break it out for a few days when I&rsquo;m feeling puffy or insecure, and it does make a difference, but &mdash; like going to the gym &mdash; your results fade without consistency.&nbsp;</p><h2>Is the NuFACE worth it?</h2><p>For some people, the NuFACE might be worth the investment, especially if you&rsquo;re a diehard skincare aficionado who has mastered the art of sticking to a routine or you&rsquo;re tired of splurging on microcurrent facials. However, if you&rsquo;re more into casual skincare, it might not be the right device for you. Based on my experience, I&rsquo;d also recommend talking to your doctor or dermatologist before trying the NuFace if you have any sinus or thyroid issues because, unlike the phrase goes, beauty should not be pain.</p><p>And if you&rsquo;re on the fence like I was, you can always opt for the NuFACE Mini instead. It&rsquo;s smaller, cheaper, and lacks the option to swap out different attachments. And, considering the additional attachments are $160 each, that&rsquo;s not the worst idea for beauty fans on a budget.&nbsp;</p><p>All in all, I like the <a href="https://zdcs.link/joYnL?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=NuFACE%20Trinity%2B&object_type=review&object_uuid=01bANSx5LQlAAimax7iRcK9&short_url=joYnL&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">NuFACE Trinity+</a>, and I&rsquo;ll probably keep using it occasionally. I can definitely see why it&rsquo;s a holy grail product for some people, and &mdash; while I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s one of mine &mdash; it might be one of yours.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

      <description><![CDATA[SwiftScan VIP is an OCR scanner app for iOS or Android that can edit, share, and even fax your high-quality scans, and it's only $59.99.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/04xFqMBaERBBO32S0pVzTO1/hero-image.jpg" alt="Person using a smartphone"><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> If you need high-quality scans anywhere, anytime, get SwiftScan VIP. A lifetime subscription to this iOS and Android compatible OCR scanner is only $59.99.&nbsp;</p><hr><p>The back-to-school season is coming up fast, but there's still plenty of time to prepare. If you're still cleaning the papers out of your desk, help this year go differently by getting a scanner that makes short work of digitizing your notes, documents, and even pages from books.&nbsp;</p><p>SwiftScan is a <a href="https://zdcs.link/qkjmG?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=simple%20scanner%20for%20iOS&object_type=article&object_uuid=04xFqMBaERBBO32S0pVzTO1&short_url=qkjmG&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">simple scanner for iOS</a> or Android devices that produces high-quality scans in seconds. Normally, a lifetime subscription to SwiftScan VIP would be $199, but you can get one on sale for $59.99.&nbsp;</p><h2>How is SwiftScan different from other scanners?</h2><p>In the grand colosseum of <a href="https://zdcs.link/qkjmG?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=scanners%20and%20scanner%20apps&object_type=article&object_uuid=04xFqMBaERBBO32S0pVzTO1&short_url=qkjmG&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">scanners and scanner apps</a>, SwiftScan may come out on top for a few reasons. First, if you're comparing SwiftScan to a desktop scanner, the app is a great find on price alone. Sure, it can't print your scans like a physical scanner could, but it also doesn't take any desk space and doesn't require expensive ink to access half its functions.&nbsp;</p><p>When it comes to scanning capabilities, the app captures premium quality scans starting at 200 dpi, and it even automatically enhances scan quality with color filters and auto-optimization. Trembly hands? There's blur reduction. Once you've scanned your documents, you can save them as a PDF or JPEG. The app also lets you do multi-page scans. Combine that with the OCR capabilities, and you can turn a few pages of your textbook into a scan you can search. You can even annotate your documents, add signatures, redact text, or reorder pages.&nbsp;</p><p>Don't worry. All those documents don't need to take up your phone's limited memory. SwiftScan integrates with cloud services like iCloud, Google Drive, and Dropbox, so you can save or scare your scans seamlessly. Kicking it old school? This scanner can even send a fax.&nbsp;</p><h2>Save 70 percent</h2><p>Get a scanner that doesn't take up any extra room in your office or dorm.&nbsp;</p><p>Get a <a href="https://zdcs.link/qkjmG?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Lifetime%20Subscription%20to%20SwiftScan%20VIP&object_type=article&object_uuid=04xFqMBaERBBO32S0pVzTO1&short_url=qkjmG&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Lifetime Subscription to SwiftScan VIP</a> for $59.99.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.stacksocial.com" target="_blank"><em>StackSocial</em></a><em> prices subject to change.&nbsp;</em></p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

On the surface, the movie appears to be the story of a young woman being chased by a monster. But by the final act, <em>Cuckoo</em> has morphed into something far stranger and more complicated.&nbsp;</p><p>Written and directed by <a href="https://mashable.com/video/cuckoo-dan-stevens-film" target="_self"><u>Tilman Singer</u></a>, the film follows 17-year-old American Gretchen (Hunter Schafer), who&rsquo;s just moved to a resort in Bavaria with her father, Luis (M&aacute;rton Cs&oacute;k&aacute;s), stepmother, Beth (Jessica Henwick), and 8-year-old stepsister, Alma (Mila Lieu). While her parents are employed in helping the owner, Herr K&ouml;nig (Stevens), expand his development, Gretchen is chased by a hooded woman who repeatedly attacks her. But no one believes her, so she's forced to investigate the mystery of the hooded woman largely on her own.

<p>Before the film introduces Gretchen and her family, it begins in an unrelated unhappy household. A man and woman argue in German, while in a nearby bedroom, a teen girl &mdash;&nbsp;presumably their daughter &mdash;&nbsp;twitches violently on her bed. There are no subtitles, so English-speakers are left wondering what they&rsquo;re arguing about. But the loud noise that follows needs no translation.&nbsp;A thick thud, the sound of a blunt object, implies one parent killed the other &mdash; followed by the sounds of the man crying. In a panic, the girl runs into the night. As we learn later, this is not an average girl, but an entirely different species that K&ouml;nig is dedicated to preserving.</p><p>This frightening opening only fits into place when the man reappears as one of the cops who works with K&ouml;nig to help preserve the mysterious species. When K&ouml;nig says on the phone, "You lost your adolescent already? This will complicate matters. A young one is on the way, but the mother will be harder to control without a nestling around,&rdquo; he is presumably talking to this man from the intro, the teen's father. </p><p>After Gretchen is attacked by the hooded woman, we see the same cop visit her in the hospital to question her. Then, later, he appears in K&ouml;nig&rsquo;s villa, confirming a conspiracy between the resort owner and the local police. This could mean that the argument at the beginning involved the cop's wife discovering the truth about her daughter's origins, and suggests the officer killed his wife to keep K&ouml;nig&rsquo;s secret. That&rsquo;s the length this creepy crew will go to to maintain this species: They&rsquo;re willing to kill for it.</p><h2><strong>Why is the hooded woman chasing Gretchen?</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The hooded woman is the "mother" K&ouml;nig refers to on the phone. She and the "adolescent" are part of a cuckoo-like humanoid species, which implants its "eggs" in the "nest" of a human host. And, like the birth mom was perceived as a threat by K&ouml;nig's crony, Gretchen is perceived as a threat by the hooded woman to her offspring, the stepsister Alma. Or, as K&ouml;nig puts it later, Gretchen is &ldquo;competing for resources with her offspring.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Gretchen&rsquo;s family has been summoned to Bavaria to ensure Alma&rsquo;s growth and development. But Gretchen wasn't supposed to be here in Bavaria. The untimely death of her mother left her with her father and his new family. While she grapples with grief, her parents barely notice her, as they&rsquo;re increasingly worried about her younger sister Alma&rsquo;s health. Since they've gotten to Bavaria, Alma has suffered inexplicable seizures.&nbsp;</p><p>During the family's arrival at the resort, Singer drops a hint about Alma's origins. Greeting the family,&nbsp;K&ouml;nig says to her father and stepmother: &ldquo;You two lovebirds stumbled into my nest almost eight years ago to the day, and I believe there were more than just architectural plans conceived.&rdquo; This line explains their affection for K&ouml;nig&rsquo;s resort &mdash;&nbsp;it's where they honeymooned! And it's the clue that Alma is tied to this place.</p><p>This also explains why K&ouml;nig and his conspirators at the hospital and in the police force are so dismissive of Gretchen's talk of the hooded woman. They know she's telling the truth, but they see Gretchen as a barrier to Alma&rsquo;s development. As Dr. Bonomo (Proschat Madani) explains, contact between Alma and her biological mother is essential to accelerating Alma&rsquo;s abilities and physical development. Gretchen stands in the way of the two uniting, as she is the only one calling out the bizarre behavior of K&ouml;nig and his crew.</p><h2><strong>What is the creature at the center of <em>Cuckoo</em>?</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>As the title suggests, the species has a lot in common with the "common cuckoo." K&ouml;nig is a passionate ornithologist and a big fan of this particular bird. As he drives Gretchen to his villa, she notices a picture of a cuckoo bird taped on his dashboard, as well as a cuckoo key ring. &ldquo;Magnificent creature,&rdquo; K&ouml;nig says of the bird. &ldquo;Common, but its behavior is not. Its nature is quite remarkable. A nature modern man destroys by disregard. Some species need our help to reproduce. I&rsquo;m a preservationist, you know.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Turns out, K&ouml;nig isn&rsquo;t <em>really</em> talking about cuckoo birds. His love nest resort has been created as a breeding ground for this humanoid cuckoo creature, which has a strange ability to assault humans through sound. &ldquo;These creatures can&rsquo;t speak like you or I,"&nbsp; K&ouml;nig explains, "When trained, their song can be dizzyingly persuasive." That &ldquo;song&rdquo; is the scream that effectively paralyzes those who can hear it &mdash; and can cause manipulations of time, creating a short time-loop repeating a few seconds over, allowing the creature to get closer. K&ouml;nig helps as well, providing wigs and clothes to the creatures that hide their more eye-catching features. They largely look human, and all present as female. However, their large eyes, pinched faces, and balding scalps might catch the attention of the visiting tourists/victims. So a wig, rain jacket, and goggles can help in hiding them in plain sight.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What is the laying ceremony?</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>When couples come to K&ouml;nig's resort, the hooded woman comes in ahead of presumed fornication to lay her egg. The cuckoo woman sneaks into the cabin, using her hypnotizing scream to knock the human woman unconscious, and the male is paralyzed and ultimately unable to remember what&rsquo;s happened. This is why Alma's parents have only fond memories of their visit to the Lover's Nest cabin. After the hooded woman left, they had sex and got pregnant with no idea they were carrying another's child.&nbsp;</p><p>The ceremony itself is disgusting to watch. In a squat, the hooded woman pulls from her crotch a clump of slimy vaginal discharge. Having used her scream to paralyze the human female, she presumably inserts this cuckoo goo into the woman's uterus. When the male human&rsquo;s sperm fertilizes the cuckoo woman&rsquo;s egg, all inside the human woman, this turns the human mother into a surrogate, which is similar to how cuckoo birds operate. They place their eggs in the nests of other birds, allowing those birds to foster and raise their chicks.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>There were hints to Alma's big reveal.&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Alma cannot speak like her human family does, and so relies on a type-to-talk device to help her communicate. We later learn her inability to vocalize is something she shares with her biological mother and the unnamed adolescent from the first scene.&nbsp;</p><p>The seizures are another clue, as the call of the hooded woman has a dramatic effect on Alma's body that's different from her victims. Are the violent seizures proof that proximity to her biological mother is causing Alma to transform? It's unclear, but these fits could explain why Alma has evolved to emit her own song by film's end. Then there's the special attention K&ouml;nig pays to Alma, overseeing her upbringing closely, giving her gifts, and advising on her medical care.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Why did Gretchen save Alma?</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>At the beginning of the film, you&rsquo;d imagine Gretchen wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to sacrifice Alma for her own survival; she&rsquo;s regularly frustrated with Alma demanding everyone&rsquo;s attention and is quick to point out that she&rsquo;s not her real sister. But after hearing a voice message Alma left on Gretchen's mother's voicemail, she discovers that Alma cares for her older sister deeply, and it changes her entire outlook. Gretchen&rsquo;s going to get Alma the hell out of Bavaria, whether she&rsquo;s the same species or not (and she isn&rsquo;t). By the final showdown against K&ouml;nig, Gretchen has finally accepted Alma as family, a big shift from her vehemently denying any ties to Alma when speaking to resort coworker Trixie earlier in the film.&nbsp;</p><p>The film's climax brings Gretchen to the hospital where Alma is being guarded by K&ouml;nig's conspirators. However, Gretchen manages to outwit both K&ouml;nig, who'd keep Alma to make her a monster, and Henry (Jan Bluthardt), a past victim of the hooded woman, who wants her offspring dead. Their only path out is in the line of fire of both K&ouml;nig and Henry, who stand on either side of them. As the men prepare to shoot, Alma takes things into her own hands, covering her sister's ears before letting out her species' paralyzing scream, leaving both men unable to act as they escape.&nbsp;</p><p>As Gretchen and Alma make it out of the room, Henry and K&ouml;nig shoot each other. The sisters leave the hospital and find Ed (Astrid Berg&egrave;s-Frisbey), who'd hooked up with Gretchen earlier in the movie, by her car, and she drives them to safety. Alma&rsquo;s ear continues to twitch in the car &ndash; a reminder that she&rsquo;s not human. But since her cuckoo development requires her to be in close proximity to her biological mother/the hooded woman &mdash;&nbsp;who by this point has been killed by Gretchen &mdash; maybe, just maybe, Alma will have a chance to be more human. </p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/vdG5W?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3Btemplate=article&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=Cuckoo%20opens%20in%20theaters%20Aug.%209.&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=04Owsq3hiJ1rGwqMiOpSlUh&amp%3Bshort_url=vdG5W&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Fcuckoo-review&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Cuckoo%20opens%20in%20theaters%20Aug.%209.&object_type=article&object_uuid=06AZQoa8lH5OMJ6WxNHpCWw&short_url=vdG5W&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><em>Cuckoo</em> opens in theaters Aug. 9.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Curious how the apocalyptic world in <a href="https://mashable.com/article/a-quiet-place-movie-review" target="_self"><em>A Quiet Place</em></a> came to be? Following the success of the first two films, the hit horror franchise has expanded with a prequel dubbed <em>A Quiet Place: Day One</em>. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/john-krasinski-rom-coms" target="_self">John Kransinski</a>, who directed and starred in the first two films, is no longer involved in the latest, sans a "story by" writing credit. <em>Day One</em> instead is written and directed by Michael Sarnoski, who brought us the unique Nic Cage culinary thriller <a href="https://mashable.com/article/short-ass-movies-hulu" target="_self"><em>Pig</em></a> in 2021. The cast is led by Lupita Nyong'o (<a href="https://mashable.com/article/us-jordan-peele-explainer-themes" target="_self"><em>Us</em></a>), Joseph Quinn (<a href="https://mashable.com/article/stranger-things-eddie-munson" target="_self"><em>Stranger Things</em></a>), Djimon Hounsou, reprising his role from <a href="https://mashable.com/article/a-quiet-place-part-ii-movie-review" target="_self"><em>A Quiet Place Part II</em></a>, and a very <a href="https://mashable.com/article/does-the-cat-die-a-quiet-place-day-one" target="_self">cute cat</a>.</p><p><em>A Quiet Place: Day One</em> <a href="https://mashable.com/video/a-quiet-place-day-one-trailer" target="_self">debuted in theaters</a> in late June and has already made its way to digital on demand services just over a month later. We're still waiting on an official streaming date, but here's how you can watch it at home in the mean time &mdash;&nbsp;as well as everything else you need to know.</p><h2>What is <em>A Quiet Place: Day One</em> about?</h2><p><em>Day One</em> takes place in one of the loudest places on Earth: New York City. So, what happens when noise-sensitive aliens crash land in the city that never sleeps? Chaos. That's the main premise of the apocalyptic alien prequel.</p><p>The story follows Sam (Nyong'o), a terminally ill hospice patient who reluctantly agrees to take a trip into Manhattan only to find herself stuck in the city when the horrifying extraterrestrials take over. As she navigates the alien apocalypse, Sam and her service cat Frodo attract the attention of a young law student named Eric (Quinn). The odd couple (and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/cat-quiet-place-challenge-tiktok" target="_self">the cat</a>) embark on a journey through the city swarming with aliens and their only hope for survival is to remain absolutely silent. </p><p>Check out the <a href="https://mashable.com/video/a-quiet-place-day-one-trailer-2" target="_self">official trailer</a> for a better idea of what Day One is all about:</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

<h2>Is <em>A Quiet Place: Day One</em> worth watching?</h2><p>Listen, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-watch-furiosa-mad-max-saga" target="_self">prequels</a> are hard to get right &mdash; and they're bound to ruffle some feathers. With an 86 percent critic rating and a 73 percent audience rating on <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/a_quiet_place_day_one" target="_blank">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, <em>A Quiet Place: Day One</em> mostly got it right.</p><p>Mashable Film Editor Kristy Puchko thought parts of the film were enchanting. She appreciated the "captivating screen presence" of Nyong'o and Quinn, but felt that "the love story at its core can't shine amid the required carnage and urban devastation demanded by the prequel's promise." Thus, the film as a whole didn't quite equal the sum of its parts. </p><p>However, with the largely positive critic ratings on Rotten Tomatoes, many others felt that the prequel did hold up. That's the best thing about movies &mdash;&nbsp;everyone can form their own opinion. For what it's worth, horror master Stephen King gave it his <a href="https://mashable.com/article/stephen-king-a-quiet-place-day-one-review" target="_self">stamp of approval</a>.</p><p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/a-quiet-place-day-one-review" target="_self"><em>Read our full review of A Quiet Place: Day One</em></a>.</p><h2>How to watch<em> A Quiet Place: Day One</em> at home</h2><p>Just a little over a month after <em>A Quiet Place: Day One</em> made its theatrical debut, it became available to watch at home via video-on-demand sites like Prime Video and Apple TV+.

<p>Want to spend the least amount of money possible to watch <em>A Quiet Place: Day One</em> and its predecessors? Your best bet is to wait until the official streaming date drops and sign up for a month of Paramount+ Essential for just $5.99. If you're new to the streamer, you'll also get a seven-day free trial. After you watch, just be sure to cancel your subscription if you want to avoid charges. You'll have to endure some ads while you watch the movie, but just think of them as built-in snack and bathroom breaks.</p><h3>Best long-term deal: <a href="https://zdcs.link/JdAbn?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Save%2017%25%20on%20a%20Paramount%2B%20Essential%20annual%20subscription&object_type=article&object_uuid=035zK1thQ63rzbPNsqkdPjK&short_url=JdAbn&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Save 17% on a Paramount+ Essential annual subscription</a></h3><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>If you opt for the annual plan instead of the monthly plan, you can save 17% on your subscription. You'll have to pay more upfront, but it pays off in the grand scheme of your streaming lineup. An annual Paramount+ Essential plan will run you $59.99 per year, which breaks down to only $5 per month as opposed to $5.99 per month. If you want to watch more than just <em>Day One</em> and you don't mind ads, this is your best bet.</p><h3>Best deal for no ads: <a href="https://zdcs.link/G15gq?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Save%2017%25%20on%20a%20Paramount%2B%20with%20Showtime%20annual%20subscription&object_type=article&object_uuid=035zK1thQ63rzbPNsqkdPjK&short_url=G15gq&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Save 17% on a Paramount+ with Showtime annual subscription</a></h3><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>If ads are a deal breaker for you, you'll have to sign up for Paramount+ with Showtime. This ad-free tier will run you either $11.99 per month or $119.99 per year (which breaks down to just $10 per month). The good news is that beyond just giving you access to ad-free Paramount+ content, the extra cost unlocks access to Showtime originals and movies (like <a href="https://mashable.com/article/yellowjackets-season-2-review-showtime" target="_self"><em>Yellowjackets</em></a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-curse-review" target="_self"><em>The Curse</em></a>), live TV with CBS, and college football. Although you'll have to pay more, it's definitely a whole lot of bang for your buck.</p><h3>Best deal for students: <a href="https://zdcs.link/XDkwB?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Save%2025%25%20on%20Paramount%2B%20Essential&object_type=article&object_uuid=035zK1thQ63rzbPNsqkdPjK&short_url=XDkwB&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Save 25% on Paramount+ Essential</a></h3><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>It may not be the simplest way to watch <em>A Quiet Place: Day One</em>, but a <a href="https://mashable.com/ad/article/walmart-plus-membership-annual-perks" target="_self">Walmart+ membership</a> gives you free access to Paramount+ and plenty of other sweet benefits. Better yet, you can kick things off with a free 30-day trial, so you can enjoy an entire month of streaming without paying a cent. Just sign up once the official streaming date is announced and be sure to cancel before your trial ends if you want to avoid charges. If you want to keep your Walmart+ membership going, it'll cost you either $12.95 per month or $98 per year ($8.17/month).</p>]]></content:encoded>

Mercury, the closest planet to the sun, can't actually travel backward in retrograde, and doesn't impact us on <a href="https://mashable.com/article/earth-pictures-images-from-space" target="_self">Earth</a>. The notion of Mercury retrograde, a common reference in <a href="https://mashable.com/article/astrology-trend-2021-post-pandemic" target="_self">astrology</a> wherein communication and travel are temporarily impaired, can, of course, be a fun musing. The event occurs when Mercury appears to start traveling the opposite direction in the sky. </p><p>But this is perceptive trickery. Mercury retrograde is <em>apparent motion</em>, such as when you pass a speeding car on the highway and it appears that car is moving backward. It's not an exceptional, or momentous, event.</p><p>"There's nothing unusual about it," Tansu Daylan, a physicist at Washington University in St. Louis who leads <a href="https://mashable.com/category/nasa" target="_self">NASA</a> telescope observations, told Mashable.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>It happens so regularly &mdash; three or four times a year &mdash; that some people easily associate events (misunderstandings or travel woes) with the event. "People are actively searching for connections," Daylan said. </p><h2><strong>What causes Mercury retrograde</strong></h2><p>From our perspective, the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/planets-ranked" target="_self">planets</a>, including Mercury, move west to east across the night sky, relative to the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/star-explosion-supernova-space" target="_self">stars</a>. Greek and Roman astronomers, in fact, referred to planets as "wandering stars."</p><p>If you, hypothetically, could look down on the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/solar-flares-sun-active-why" target="_self">sun</a> from above, you would see the planets orbiting counterclockwise. This creates the easterly movement, from our perch on Earth. <em>But </em>this changes when two planets become aligned as they orbit the sun, Daylan emphasized. Then, an inner planet (Mercury) moves faster than an outer planet (like Earth), resulting in "apparent retrograde motion" &mdash; <em>apparent </em>because Mercury, speeding around our star at over 100,000 mph, does not suddenly start traveling backwards.</p><p>The <a href="https://mashable.com/category/nasa" target="_self">NASA</a> graphic below illustrates apparent retrograde motion, using Mars and Earth. A planet's appearance in the sky can change when planets align or one "overtakes" another, but the actual orbits don't change.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Mercury retrograde lasts for a few weeks at a time, so don't be surprised to hear how it's connected to a multitude of events. Tellingly, it most recently started again on Aug. 5, 2024 &mdash; after the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/crowdstrike-update-fail-explained" target="_self">global Crowdstrike disruption</a>.</p><p>Though we know Mercury's orbit isn't doing anything strange in our <a href="https://mashable.com/article/mars-asteroid-jupiter-moons-space" target="_self">solar system</a> throughout the year, it will remain a world of mysteries. It's a planet that's difficult to observe from Earth, because of its proximity to the sun. "That means it can be spotted only briefly shortly before sunrise and just after sunset, and always appears close to the horizon," the <a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/BepiColombo/Three_reasons_why_we_know_so_little_about_Mercury" target="_blank">European Space Agency explains</a>. What's more, it's extremely challenging to reach &mdash; any spacecraft endeavoring there must contend with the sun's overpowering gravity. That's why Mercury is the least visited of the other inner planets. And, it's precarious to get too close to Mercury because the searing planet's surface, hot enough to melt lead, radiates heat into <a href="https://mashable.com/category/space" target="_self">space</a>. The ongoing <a href="https://mashable.com/article/mercury-mission-bepicolombo-thrust-problem" target="_self">BepiColombo mission</a> is designed to resist these extremes as it makes unprecedented observations.</p><p>Planetary scientists hope to soon answer many questions about Mercury: <em>Is there water? Is it geologically active? How did it get so close to the sun?</em></p><p>But, at least, its strange apparent motion is well understood.</p><p>"There's nothing fancy about it," Daylan said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>To help you pick the right model, Mashable editors and reviewers tested dozens of headphones and earbuds and picked out the best noise-cancelling headphones of 2024 (so far). </p><h2>Do noise-cancelling headphones actually work?</h2><p>There's a big difference between outside noise being blocked and music simply being loud enough to drown it out. If you're looking for the maximum amount of noise cancellation, you want to go for headphones that have active noise cancellation.</p><p>Active noise-cancelling headphones electronically cover up the sounds coming from your surroundings by using internal microphones that listen to what's happening in the world around you, then invert the noise and send it to the speakers. The idea is that both the output and the input will cancel out, leaving you with near-silence. Over-ear headphones can also create a tight seal around your ears that adds another layer of sound blocking.</p><p>If you've tried a pair of noise-cancelling headphones before and haven't been impressed, don't be discouraged. It's partially about finding the headphones that match your preferences, as not all ANC performs equally. For instance, cheaper ANC headphones may have a more noticeable hissing sound that you'll hear when the noise cancellation is turned on, which can be distracting for some folks.</p><p>Other headphones may be great at blocking at low tones, but more prone to letting high-pitched tones in. Typically, more premium headphones will yield better results, but we have budget picks below that still do a solid job.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>In the past, not many <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-wireless-earbuds" target="_self">earbuds</a> featured active noise cancellation that was comparable to over-ear headphones, but newer iterations like the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-airpods-pro-2-review" target="_self">AirPods Pro</a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/oct-31-sony-earbuds-deal" target="_self">Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds</a> hold their own in the ANC space. However, even these <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-earbuds" target="_self">earbuds</a> can't quite get the same seal that headphones can, so if you're looking for maximum silence, you might be happier with over-ear headphones. However, if you want to cut down on the bulk, earbuds make for great alternatives.</p><h2>What are the best noise-cancelling headphones to buy?</h2><p>Bose and Sony are both top names when it comes to any type of audio, but especially when it comes to noise cancellation. Both brands feature industry-leading ANC on top of superb sound quality. There are also some other brands and models worth checking out, so if you want to tune out ambient sound, we've laid everything out for you below, from your more premium options to your budget picks.</p><hr><h2>Most comfortable headphones: Bose QuietComfort Ultra</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p><a href="https://mashable.com/review/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones" target="_self"><em>Read our full review of the Bose Quiet Comfort Ultra headphones.</em></a></p><h3>Who it's for: </h3><p>Over-ear headphones can be great for blocking out noise, but less great for comfort when they're too heavy or squeeze your head too much. If you're someone who wants to wear your headphones all day, the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/bose-quiet-comfort-ultra-headphones-earbuds-preorder" target="_self">Bose QuietComfort line</a> was made for you. We've previously tested the QuietComfort 35 IIs and the QuietComfort 45s, and the QuietComfort Ultra was easily the most comfortable of the three. They're also the most expensive at $429, so you will be paying a premium.</p><h3>Why we picked this:</h3><p>The Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones up the ante on the long-popular line from the brand, giving you all-day wear with spatial audio. </p><p>We don't know how Bose improved on the design as much as they did, but we wore these headphones for hours &mdash; on flights, with glasses on, all day &mdash; and they wore through it all without squeezing or feeling heavy. To drop the royal Mashable we for just moment, I (Lead Shopping Reporter Bethany Allard) can attest to these easily being headphones I could wear all day, and I wasn't alone in that feeling. Shopping Reporter <a href="https://mashable.com/review/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones" target="_self">Sam Mangino also recently tested out these headphones</a>, and found that their biggest draw was their comfort, noticing that she didn't experience the same ear aches she might get after wearing her Sony WH-1000XM4 for the same amount of time.</p><p>She did say, however, that their active noise cancellation and sound profile were good, but not great. In her opinion, she found them to be a bit lacking, noting that the ANC "is really good at blocking out low-pitched noises, [but] it can't wholly block high-pitched sounds unless you turn up the sound to unhealthy volumes." Personally, I found the ANC to do the job for me, but most of the noise I block out on a day to day basis isn't super high-pitched.</p><p>Where Mangino and I really agreed is that the ear cup controls and multipoint pairing leave much to be desired, especially at this price point. It can be difficult to easily connect with the button that acts as the on/Bluetooth pairing button &mdash; sometimes it's immediately responsive, and sometimes you have to press it a few times, and wait in between for it to properly turn on and connect. Like past QC headphones, these also can be touch and go with multipoint pairing, but I found them to function better at least than the QC 45 headphones, which often made audio have small skips with more than one device connected. </p><p>Finally, these headphones weirdly don't offer passive playback, so you will need to rely on them being charged whether you're listening wired or wirelessly. Thankfully, Mangino and I found that it was surprisingly hard to run down the battery on the Ultras, even if you're regularly using ANC and spatial audio. Ultimately, if what you prize above all else is comfort, we think these flaws will feel worth the trade-off.</p><p><strong><em>Battery life:</em></strong><em> 24 hours | <strong>App-connected:</strong></em><em> Yes | <strong>Colors: </strong></em><em>Black, sandstone, white</em></p><hr><h2>Best for audiophiles: Sony WH-1000XM5</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p><a href="https://mashable.com/review/sony-ult-wear-headphones" target="_self"><em>Check out our full review of the Sony ULT Wear headphones.</em></a></p><h3>Who it's for:</h3><p>If you don't need a fancy custom equalizer to know you like punching up the bass ten out of ten times, the new Sony ULT Wear headphones are made for you. Our reviewer praised these headphones for offering balanced sound <em>and </em>powerful bass, a rare combo. These are also a great pick for those looking for a more affordable alternative to the WH-1000XM5s.</p><h3>Why we picked this: </h3><p>Sony <a href="https://mashable.com/review/sony-ult-field-1-speaker" target="_self">released the new ULT line</a> in April, and considering the price, they're some of the best Sony headphones ever made. They're designed for anyone who's a fan of bass. In addition to the equalizer in the app, the headphones have a dedicated ULT button that lets you bump up the bass on demand. The 40-millimeter driver keeps it sounding clear and not crispy, making these headphones a worthy competitor to the WH-1000XM5s, our top pick for the best sounding noise-cancelling headphones.</p><p>When testing the two headphones side by side, Mashable's Miller Kern found that while both headphones sounded great, "the ULT Wear&rsquo;s sound was fuller and felt more like surround sound. And even on the standard setting, the bass sounded richer on the ULTs." We still stand by the WH-1000XM5s as a better pick for audiophiles, but Kern makes a strong case for buying these over the XM5s. "[To] the average person, I&rsquo;d say the ULT Wears are the winners &mdash; especially for those who prioritize bass and fullness in their audio." For $100 cheaper, these are a more than fair alternative to Sony's flagship headphones. </p><p><strong><em>Battery life:</em></strong><em> 30 hours | <strong>App-connected:</strong></em><em> Yes | <strong>Colors: </strong></em><em>Black, off-white</em></p><hr><h2>Best noise-cancelling earbuds for Apple users: Apple AirPods Pro</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p><a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-airpods-pro-usb-c-review" target="_self"><em>Read our full review of the Apple AirPods Pro (Generation 2)</em></a><em>.</em></p><h3>Who it's for: </h3><p>If you want ANC without all the bulk, the AirPods Pro are small, discreet, and (thanks to the their <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-usb-c-charging-change-why" target="_self">long-awaited USB-C charging port</a>) easier to charge. Though headphones typically provide superior ANC, these AirPods have impressive noise cancellation for a pair of buds. You'll probably enjoy them a little extra if you have other devices within the Apple ecosystem. </p><h3>Why we picked this:</h3><p>Are they pricey? Absolutely. Is their ANC worth it? Here's what Mashable Senior Editor <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-airpods-pro-2-review" target="_self">Stan Schroeder</a> had to say: "These are the first pair of earbuds I'd actually consider taking on an airplane (instead of my much larger and clunkier over-ear headphones)." Though these aren't the only Apple headphones with ANC, we highly prefer these over the AirPods Max, which we think are way overpriced (they're double the cost of these Pros) and don't have the performance to justify that price tag.</p><p>Other than that killer ANC, AirPods are great for travel because they take up minimal space in your carry on, they sound great, and they have a Conversation Awareness mode which automatically lowers the volume when you're talking, so placing a drink order is easy as can be. And with their new USB-C port, you can charge them directly from an iPhone 15. </p><p>To get a perfectly snug fit to maximize your listening experience, you'll have your choice between four ear tips. Apple claims these buds support lossless audio, but as of right now, only with the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-vision-pro-teardown" target="_self">Apple Vision Pro</a>, so you'd have to shell out an additional $3,500 for that experience.</p><p>You can find AirPods on sale with some regularity if you shop from Amazon or Walmart &mdash; we recommend waiting until they at <em>least </em>drop down to $199 at either retailer before buying a pair. </p><p><strong><em>Battery life:</em></strong><em> 6 hours (up to 30 hours with charging case) </em>| <strong><em>App-connected:</em></strong><em> No | <strong>Colors:</strong></em><em> White</em></p><hr><h2>Best sounding earbuds: Sony WF-1000XM5</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3>Who it's for:</h3><p>Love high-quality audio but not so fond of the feeling of headphones over your ears? These Sony earbuds are the earbud model of the flagship WH-1000XM5 headphones we recommended above.</p><h3>Why we picked this:</h3><p>These earbuds deliver a rich, well-balanced sound profile, without the weight of over-ear headphones. The ear tips material are not the usual silicone found on AirPods and other earbuds, but a more foam-like material you'd find on an ear plug, allowing for all-day wear that creates a firm seal without sacrificing comfort. People who aren't fans of the stemmed design made popular by AirPods will appreciate that Sony didn't attempt to make a carbon copy. Plus, these Sony earbuds still offer functional touch controls.</p><p>The Sony companion app allows for a ton of customization, including for those aforementioned touch controls, paired devices, and of course, an equalizer. Those who feel a bit intimated by a completely custom equalizer will appreciate the "Find Your Equalizer" feature, which gives you two rounds of options to select from while listening to music to narrow down what settings actually sound the best. Once you've made your selection, a final before and after sound test confirms you're happy with the mix, making it easier than ever to get the most out of your music.</p><p>We also enjoyed the Adaptive Sound Control, which switches the earbuds automatically from noise cancelling to ambient sound transparency modes based on whether you're sitting or walking around (settings that can be adjusted). Multipoint pairing also lets you switch between two devices with next to zero lag. If you hate using transparency mode because of how it amplifies outside sounds, you can adjust that, too. </p><p>Admittedly, these earbuds are pricey, but we think the premium features and quality sound justify the cost for someone who wants a lot out of their earbuds.</p><p><strong><em>Battery life:</em></strong><em> 7-8 hours per charge (24 hours with case)</em> | <strong><em>App-connected:</em></strong><em> Yes | <strong>Colors:</strong></em><em> Black, silver</em></p><hr><h2>Best mid-range earbuds: Beats Studio Buds+</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3>Who it's for: </h3><p>We don't think these earbuds perform quite as well as the newest AirPods Pro, but they <a href="https://mashable.com/deals/march-25-beats-studio-buds" target="_self">also cost $80 less</a>. If you're trying to get quality ANC earbuds for under $200 (but are willing to spend more than $50), then the Beats Studio Buds+ are the way to go. Plus, with Google Fast Pair support, they're <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-headphones-for-android-uk" target="_self">better suited for Android users</a> than the AirPods Pro.</p><h3>Why we picked this:</h3><p>We love a <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dupes" target="_self">good dupe</a>, what can we say? While these Beats aren't a one-to-one match for the AirPods Pro, they give a lot of the same basic functionality at a much more affordable price. And at six hours per charge with ANC, they match the Pro's battery life exactly. </p><p>As for how they sound, these are Beats headphones, so expect the bass to come through nice and clear. They're not too bass heavy though, and they give plenty of balance on higher frequencies. Their ANC definitely isn't at the same level as the Pros, so having a well-rounded sound is nice, as playing music in tandem with ANC will give you your best shot at blocking out the world around you.</p><p>You'll have your choice between four colorways, including black, silver, ivory, and transparent. During our testing, we also found these earbuds fit more comfortably than the AirPods Pro, so if you tend to have trouble getting AirPods to stay in your ears, these are a better option for you. If you can, we recommend waiting for these earbuds to go on sale &mdash; you can often find them for $149.95 or $129.95. </p><p><strong><em>Battery life:</em></strong><em> 6 hours with ANC, 9 without (27 hours hours with charging case) </em>| <strong><em>App-connected:</em></strong><em> No | <strong>Colors: </strong></em><em>Black, silver, white, transparent, pink</em></p><hr><h2>Best budget earbuds: Anker Soundcore Life P3i</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<h3>Who it's for:</h3><p>If you're on a tight budget but still want to enjoy noise cancellation, the Anker Soundcore Life P3i earbuds offer a surprisingly solid performance. Don't expect elite ANC, but these <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-earbuds-amazon" target="_self">affordable earbuds</a> don't require too much of a sacrifice in sound quality.</p><h3>Why we picked this: </h3><p>We're going to start with the major hitch of these earbuds: switching between devices sucks. They don't have multipoint pairing, and if you want to use them with your phone after using them with your laptop, you have to manually disconnect them (or in our experience, sometimes outright unpair them), with your laptop first. It's easily their biggest flaw, and where we most obviously felt their price point during testing.</p><p>With that out of the way, these earbuds still have <em>a lot</em> going for them. For starters, they cost $50 and can often be found on sale for even less. Though inexpensive, these earbuds are comfortable to wear all day, have a custom equalizer in the app plus 21 presets (we're fans of the Treble Booster), customizable touch controls for each earbud, and a battery life that outdoes the Apple AirPods Pro. You won't have extras like spatial audio, and the ANC leans on background hiss more than premium models, but not terribly so. </p><p>For a pair of $50 earbuds, we're impressed. We recommend them for anyone who doesn't want to shell out $100 plus for a pair of noise-cancelling earbuds.</p><p><strong><em>Battery life:</em></strong><em> 7 hours with ANC, 8.5 without (36 hours with charging case)</em> | <strong><em>App-connected:</em></strong><em> Yes | <strong>Colors:</strong></em><em> Black, white</em></p><hr><h2>How we tested the best noise-cancelling headphones and earbuds</h2><p>Every single pair of headphones we included in this guide was hands-on tested by a Mashable reporter or editor. What exactly makes a good noise-cancelling headphone? Here's what we considered: </p><ul><li><p><strong>Active noise cancellation performance: </strong>Though we always weigh this feature when testing headphones, we paid extra attention to it for the purposes of this guide. For the headphones tested specifically for this guide, we made sure to use them indoors and outdoors, to wear them while someone was trying to speak to us, while playing loud music externally, and while going about our usual workdays. (Many headphones not specifically tested for this guide, including the AirPods Pro and Sony WH-1000XM5s underwent very similar testing conditions).</p></li><li><p><strong>Comfort: </strong>Though this category can be extra subjective due to different user preferences and head and ear sizes, we also look at how adjustable headphones are in terms of suiting different wearers, whether with earbud ear tips or headphone band adjustments.</p></li><li><p><strong>Audio quality: </strong>While testing headphones, we listen to music across a variety of genres, as well as podcasts to tell how they perform in different audio settings. Where applicable, we test out different equalizer presets and play around with equalizer settings to see how they affect headphones' performance.</p></li><li><p><strong>Battery life: </strong>We noted how quickly the battery drained while testing, and if the rate at which it drained held up to the battery life claims from the brands.</p></li><li><p><strong>Value: </strong>We considered all the above features combined in relation to the headphones' price points, and compared them against each other to determine which products are worth it. Where applicable, we noted where the value for one feature made sense and where it didn't &mdash; for instance, in the case of the Bose QC Ultra headphones, their price point makes sense for something seeking incredibly comfortable headphones, and less so for someone who wants the best sound experience possible.</p></li><li><p><strong>Premium features: </strong>We looked at the cool extras each headphone offered, whether that be spatial audio or a great customizable equalizer. While this did factor into the value somewhat, we didn't weigh it as heavily as the above conditions, as we believe that a headphone needs to be able to perform the basics well before getting to show off its extras.</p></li></ul><p>We pulled these recommendations from our existing pool of <a href="https://mashable.com/category/headphones" target="_self">headphone reviews</a> and from hands-on testing performed specifically for this buying guide. A couple of options that didn't make our updated guide include the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-airpods-max-review" target="_self">AirPods Max</a>, which do have good ANC and sound quality, but also a less impressive feature to price ratio, especially compared to newer options from Sony and Bose. </p><h3>Recent testing updates</h3><p>As of Jan. 2024, we removed the Bowers &amp; Wilkins PX7 headphones from this guide not because they're sub-par headphones (they definitely aren't), but because they're an older model that's harder to find in-stores and online these days. We recently tested their replacement, the <strong>Bowers &amp; Wilkins Px7 S2e </strong>headphones, and though we loved how they sounded, wore, and looked, we were a little less impressed with the power of their ANC and finicky multipoint pairing. </p><p>In April 2024, we added the <strong>Anker Soundcore Life P3i earbuds</strong>, <strong>Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds</strong>, and <strong>Sony ULT Wear</strong> headphones to our list of recommendations. We also tested the <strong>JBL Tour One M2</strong> headphones, and while we appreciated their excellent multipoint pairing, battery life, and balanced sound, we didn't find that their noise cancellation matched up with similarly priced headphones.</p><p>Finally, as of August 2024, we said goodbye to the <strong>Bose 700 headphones</strong> as our recommendation for the best noise-cancelling headphones with adjustable ANC. This was a long time coming &mdash; these headphones have technically been discontinued since the release of the Bose QC Ultra headphones in September 2023, but remained available from retailers other than Bose. We'll be on the lookout for any new models that feature the 10 levels of adjustable noise cancellation that these ones had. </p><p>We also tried out the <strong>Denon PerL Buds Pro</strong>, but found that their excellent sound quality couldn't make up for how uncomfortable they wore and how much they cost.</p><h3>What's up next</h3><p>As of August 2024, we're testing out the new <strong>JBL Live Beam 3 </strong>earbuds and <strong>Dyson OnTrac</strong> headphones and will update this roundup accordingly once we've spent more time with them.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In total, Pornhub saw more than <a href="https://www.semrush.com/website/top/" target="_blank">5.2 billion visits</a> in May 2024, including over 1 billion visits from U.S. viewers. Pornhub is also a really sticky website, with 80 percent of visitors staying on the site to view multiple pages.</p><p>People in the United States aren't the only ones watching a lot of porn, either. Users in Indonesia, Brazil, and France (of course) also love visiting the hub.</p><p>So, if you like porn, you&rsquo;re definitely not alone. But if you&rsquo;re interested in going beyond the world of pornography and trying out some of your fantasies IRL, then <a href="https://mashable.com/article/pornhub-alternatives-free-porn-paid-porn" target="_self">Pornhub alternatives</a> like NSFW dating sites can help you find a like-minded playmate. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Whether you&rsquo;re looking to explore your kinky fantasies, make a <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-sites-for-serious-relationships" target="_self"><u>lasting romantic connection</u></a>, or just <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-hookup-apps" target="_self">want to hook up</a>, there's a little something for everyone on this list. These sites aren't perfect, and some of them get <em>pretty raunchy</em>. But if you're tired of getting off all by your lonesome (<a href="https://mashable.com/article/what-is-gooning" target="_self">goon caves</a> can get pretty lonely), then you try some of our favorite X-rated dating sites as an alternative to Pornhub. Here's the scoop on what you're getting yourself into.</p><h2>The lowdown on NSFW dating sites  </h2><p>Keep in mind that &ldquo;dating&rdquo; on NSFW sites like Grindr, Sniffies, and AdultFriendFinder is about as subtle as the platforms&rsquo; names: The vast majority of users are there to find a one-night stand, a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-have-threesome-emotionally-supportive" target="_self">threesome</a>, or an ongoing sex buddy situation &mdash; <em>not</em> a long-term partner. Of course, if you're searching for X-rated and NSFW dating sites, we're guessing that's not a problem.</p><p>Take note: NSFW dating sites don't operate without mutual consent, boundary-setting, and respect. When building out your profile, be specific and honest about your intentions and what you&rsquo;re looking for so you can find people who genuinely match up with you and your interests or fetishes.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

While it&rsquo;s against the law in many places to circulate private sexual images, that doesn&rsquo;t stop people from doing it. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>What is the most successful dating site for seniors?</h2><p>While niche sites like SeniorMatch, Singles50, and Just Senior Singles might come to mind, we've found that these platforms can be expensive and sometimes even predatory, offering a poor user experience and limited matches. They've also been known to attract scammers.</p><p>Instead, we recommend looking to larger, more established platforms like <a href="https://zdcs.link/Y0Vwx?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=eharmony&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=07IF4eehX2kCqeNvhlrS84X&short_url=Y0Vwx&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">eharmony</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/9y0pn?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=SilverSingles&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=07IF4eehX2kCqeNvhlrS84X&short_url=9y0pn&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">SilverSingles</a>, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/Jd0wk?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Match&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=07IF4eehX2kCqeNvhlrS84X&short_url=Jd0wk&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Match</a>.

But the stakes may feel a little higher if you're in your 40s.</p><p>You may assume that people in your demographic either aren't interested in dating or are already settled into long-term relationships. However, according to a recent <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/06/28/a-record-high-share-of-40-year-olds-in-the-us-have-never-been-married/" target="_blank">Pew Research Center analysis</a> of Census Bureau data, as of 2021, nearly 25 percent of 40-somethings in the U.S. have never been married.

<p>So, have people in their 40s given up on finding love? Not at all. In fact, according to the Pew Research analysis, approximately one in four 40-year-olds who weren't married in 2001 tied the knot by age 60. But unlike people in their 20s and 30s, single people over 40 know what they want and aren't afraid to wait a little longer to find the right person. </p><h2>How to start dating again at 40</h2><p>Now, after that speech and spew of statistics, you're probably wondering what our grand plan is to get you out on the dance floor. The answer? <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-apps" target="_self">Online dating</a>. Before you scoff, hear us out.</p><p>Online dating is a great way to meet new people in a low-pressure environment. The best dating sites for people over 40 make it so easy to connect with potential partners. You can filter through profiles and find matches who share your interests and values. Imagine if you could do that when scanning the room at a party &mdash; it would save a lot of time and effort.</p><p>But before you download a bunch of apps, <a href="https://www.foriawellness.com/pages/kiana-reeves" target="_blank">Kiana Reeves</a>, Somatic Sex Educator, Intimacy Coach, and Chief Education Officer at Foria, recommends taking a moment for self-reflection: "We join dating sites because we&rsquo;re looking for connection, whether in the form of a serious relationship, a casual fling, or something in between. With that in mind, it&rsquo;s important to identify the kind of connection you&rsquo;re looking for before you join any dating sites, apps, etc."</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

        </a>
    </div>
<p>Next, consider your approach to online dating, Reeves says. "Are you looking for a casual swipe-through site to meet people in a new city? Are you someone who likes to make the first move? Are you looking for someone who is only interested in a serious relationship? Are you looking for someone who shares your same faith? How much time are you planning to devote to making a connection?" </p><p>Once you've clarified your dating goals, Reeves recommends "joining a couple [apps] to start out with, so you can feel out what kind of user experience makes the most sense for you." She adds, "Of course, if you&rsquo;re feeling overwhelmed, it&rsquo;s totally fine to just join one to start."</p><p>Ready to find love after 40? Or maybe you're looking for a no-pressure <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-hookup-apps" target="_self">friend with benefits</a>? We've got you. As data nerds, we've done the research, sourced expert advice, and did a lot of hands-on testing to find the best options for forty-something singles.

The game is all about finding the "common threads between words." And just like <em>Wordle</em>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-20-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> resets after midnight and each new set of words gets trickier and trickier&mdash;so we've served up some hints and tips to get you over the hurdle.</p><p>If you just want to be told today's puzzle, you can jump to the end of this article for August 10's <em>Connections</em> solution. But if you'd rather solve it yourself, keep reading for some clues, tips, and strategies to assist you.</p><h2>What is Connections?</h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

    </a>
</blockquote>
<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. Like <em>Wordle, </em>you can share the results with your friends on social media.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>If you're shopping for a computer or upgrading an old one, you might also want to update it with a new operating system and the apps you're going to use every day.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether you're getting a computer for school, work, or just to use at home, Windows 11 Pro and Microsoft Office could be welcome additions to any machine, and you only have to pay for them once with this lifetime deal. With this bundle, you can get a shiny new OS, the latest Windows 11 security features, and a full suite of <a href="https://zdcs.link/xP5Ap?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=productivity%20apps&object_type=article&object_uuid=07gFm6RY5Ab4oxpWkHE7aAs&short_url=xP5Ap&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">productivity apps</a> &mdash; all for the mad price of &pound;43.10 (reg. &pound;343.39) until Sept. 3.&nbsp;</p><h2>Update your computer for less</h2><p>Microsoft Office Pro 2021 is different from Microsoft 365. Though, this version comes with many of the same apps, including Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, OneNote, Publisher, and Access. However, these are slightly older versions and can only be installed on one device. The tradeoff is that you aren't paying for them every month, and you can use them as long as you have the computer they're installed on.&nbsp;</p><p>Windows 11 Pro isn't compatible with every computer, so double-check your device's specs before purchasing. Once it's installed, you might notice some exciting changes that are immediately apparent. Changes like rounded window edges and snap layouts, and that's not even touching on all the security upgrades.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're installing on a school or work computer, tools like bitlocker encryption, wake and lock, and support for biometrics login could be welcome upgrades, too.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/07b3WWEZxh6khhSK8TNoaKF/hero-image.jpg" alt="X logo on mobile device"><p>Thanks to a new feature, "blue checks" may no longer dominate reply threads on X.</p><p>There has been a lot of criticism over the past few years regarding how Elon Musk changed the blue check. The blue checkmark was previously used to verify the authenticity of notable users when the platform was known as Twitter. Under Musk, X now doles out blue checks to anyone who pays $8 per month for X Premium. On top of that, blue check subscribers were <a href="https://mashable.com/article/twitter-verified-accounts-prioritized-elon-musk" target="_self"><u>given priority</u></a> in the mentions of posts.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

    </div>
<p>As a result, X users would often find blue checkmark accounts' posts sitting at the top of the replies to their own post, even if these replies were completely irrelevant to the conversation.</p><p>\And here's how it looks on X for web:</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The latter two reply sorting options are pretty straightforward. "Most recent" shows replies in chronological order from newest to oldest. "Most liked" shows the replies with most likes first. Blue check accounts appear to have completely lost any advantage that the paid subscription provided them when selecting either of these two menu options.</p><p>It's unclear exactly how X is determining how to sort posts via the "most relevant" option. However, it appears to be the same sorting method as the previous default. Blue checks do still appear to be prioritized in this view.</p><p>Any user can change the reply sorting options on any post that they view, not just their own posts.</p><p>It'll be interesting to see if these new options prove to be popular with X's user base. If many X users prefer to view replies via most liked or most recent, it seems like X Premium subscriber rates could potentially take a hit as one of blue check users' paid subscription benefits loses some of its power.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A large <a href="https://mashable.com/article/rockyou2024-leaked-password-database" target="_self"><u>database</u></a> compilation filled with billions of users' credentials was published just last month.

Many times, there's little to nothing that the average consumer can do about it. Sometimes, affected individuals aren't even aware that their data was part of a breach.</p><p>If you do find out that you're the victim of a data breach, that means a company that has your data was compromised.

        </a>
    </div>
<p>Here's what you can do to protect yourself:</p><h2>Change your passwords</h2><p>First things first, change the password of the account affected by the data breach. Oftentimes, there's so much data stolen that most users will have a chance to stop any unauthorized use of their account.</p><p>Yes, you've been told time and time again to not use the same password for multiple accounts, but we know that you have. Cybercriminals can easily make the connection to those other accounts so go and change the passwords for any secondary accounts tied to your name or username that are the same or similar to the one that has been stolen.&nbsp;</p><h2>Use two-factor authentication</h2><p>Two-factor authentication will stop any unauthorized access to your account, even if someone else has your password. If the service or platform in question offers two-factor authentication, it's highly recommended that you turn it on.</p><p>There are two basic types of two-factor authentication: one that texts users a code, and one that requires the use of an authentication app &mdash; usually (but not always) on a mobile phone. Since phone numbers can be stolen and SMS messages can be intercepted, it's highly recommended that users go with an authentication app. When signing into a platform once an authentication app has been enabled, a user will be required to open the mobile app, temporarily memorize the constantly changing code that appears on their screen, and input it into the platform that they are trying to access. </p><h2>Monitor your accounts</h2><p>It's important to know exactly what accounts on what platforms were affected to discern exactly what type of information could have been stolen. Services like <a href="http://haveibeenpwned.com" target="_blank"><u>haveibeenpwned.com</u></a> help users monitor whether their account credentials have been stolen in a data breach.</p><p>Even if you know which account was affected in a breach, you should still check to see if there were any cascading effects that made its way to your other accounts.</p><p>After finding which accounts were affected, check with the company who experienced the data breach to see if they have any additional information or recommendations as to what their users should do to protect themselves.</p><h2>Check your credit reports</h2><p>Be on the lookout for the worst case scenario: Your identity being stolen as a result of a data breach.</p><p>It's certainly horrible to find a social media account compromised and going through a platform's process to regain access is never fun. But that ordeal pales in comparison to the headaches you'll have in store if someone used your data to access your bank account or commit fraud.</p><p>It's important to monitor your credit report if there's a breach at a company that stored relevant financial-related data. You can get a completely free credit report at <a href="http://annualcreditreport.com" target="_blank"><u>annualcreditreport.com</u></a>. In addition, services like <a href="https://www.creditkarma.com/" target="_blank"><u>Credit Karma</u></a> provide a free daily summary of your credit score and report information.</p><p>If you are a victim of identify theft, it's important to immediately contact your bank and the credit institutions. You'll need to freeze your credit, apply for a new credit card number, and even potentially close accounts. Victims of identity theft can report a crime as well at <a href="http://identitytheft.gov" target="_blank"><u>identitytheft.gov</u></a>.</p><p>Again, most users will likely find that they just need to change passwords and sign up for two-factor authentication. But, if you're one of the more unlucky victims of a data breach whose victimizer crossed over from from stealing data to stealing money, you need to be proactive and take action to protect your finances as soon as you can.</p>]]></content:encoded>

GPT-4o is the underlying model that powers the latest version of ChatGPT, and comes with a Voice Mode that was <a href="https://mashable.com/article/openai-chatgpt-voice-mode-rollout-plus" target="_self">recently released</a> to a select group of users with a ChatGPT Plus subscription.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>The "safety challenges" identified include standard risks like prompting the model with erotic and violent responses, other disallowed content, and "ungrounded inference" and "sensitive trait attribution" &mdash; assumptions that might be discriminatory or biased, in other words. OpenAI says it has trained the model to block any outputs flagged in these categories. However, the report also says mitigations don't include "nonverbal vocalizations or other sound effect" such as erotic moans, violent screams, and gunshots. One can infer, then, that prompts involving certain sensitive nonverbal sounds might improperly receive a response.</p><p>OpenAI also mentioned unique challenges that come with vocally communicating with the model. Red-teamers discovered that GPT-4o could be prompted to impersonate someone or accidentally emulate the user's voice. To combat this, OpenAI only allows pre-authorized voices (<a href="https://mashable.com/article/openai-drops-chatgpt-sky-voice-scarlett-johansson-her-comparisons" target="_self">minus</a> the notorious Scarlett Johansson-sounding voice). GPT-4o can also identify other voices besides the speaker's voice, which presents a serious privacy and surveillance issue. But it has been trained to deny those requests &mdash; unless the model is being prompted on a famous quote.</p><p>Red-teamers also noted that GPT-4o could be prompted to speak persuasively or emphatically, a feature that could be more harmful than text outputs when it comes to misinformation and conspiracy theories. </p><p>Notably, OpenAI also addressed potential copyright issues that have <a href="https://mashable.com/article/new-york-times-open-ai-lawsuit" target="_self">plagued the company</a> and the overall development of generative AI, which trains on data scraped from the web. GPT-4o has been trained to refuse requests for copyrighted content and has additional filters for blocking outputs containing music. On that note, ChatGPT's Voice Mode has been directed not to sing under any circumstances. </p><p>OpenAI's numerous risk mitigations covered in the lengthy document were carried out before Voice Mode was released. So the ostensive message of the report says that while GPT-4o is capable of certain risky behavior, it won't do it. </p><p>However, OpenAI says, "These evaluations measure only the clinical knowledge of these models, and do not measure their utility in real-world workflows." So it's been tested in a controlled environment, but when the broader public gets their hands on GPT-4o, it could be a different beast when out in the wild. </p><p>Mashable reached out to OpenAI for additional clarity about these mitigations, and will update if we hear back.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Thankfully, the process is really easy. (If you already know how to do this, feel free to keep scrolling to get straight to the latest DoorDash coupons.)</p><p>All you need to do is load up your shopping cart with whatever is on the menu for the night and head to the checkout screen. Once you get there, scroll down to the bottom where you'll find a section labeled "Summary."</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

There's a new deal floating around that beats a similar one that we tracked earlier this week, and you won't want to miss out.</p><p>As of August 9, you can snatch up the <a href="https://zdcs.link/ZRWmK?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Apple%20iPad%20%289th%20gen%29&object_type=article&object_uuid=05c1lBFNWvg9uNQpBQnoWNH&short_url=ZRWmK&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Apple iPad (9th gen)</a> at Amazon for just $224, which is down from its normal price of $329. That's $5 cheaper than when we <a href="https://mashable.com/article/aug-7-apple-ipad-deal" target="_self">shared this deal</a> on August 7, and a <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B09G9FPHY6" target="_blank">new low price</a> for this model. That means it's prime time to add it to your cart. </p><p>This is a fantastic option whether you're lookinig for a daily driver table or just something to enjoy the errant Netflix session. It can handle whatever you throw at it thanks to its A13 Bionic chip, and its 10.2-inch Retina display will have no trouble showcasing your favorite TV shows and movies in crisp and bright color. Additionally, it comes with an ultrawide front camera perfect for Zoom calls or taking a ton of selfies, whatever you prioritize. </p><p>It's not just good or entertainment or scrolling around online, though. You can use this iPad with your Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard to make it a portable workstation while you're on the go. It's got plenty of storage space at 64GB, and enough battery life to last you all day &ndash; or longer, if you use it sparingly. </p><p>You can grab one for yourself, or it might be a good idea to go ahead and lock one of these iPads in for the holidays. They're coming up a lot faster than you might think, after all. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>New - and high up - on the list of things I never knew I needed until just now: a smart, voice-controlled tea kettle for brewing tea <em>just</em> as it was intended. </p><p>Today at Amazon, you can score the <a href="https://zdcs.link/JdKXm?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=GoveeLife%20Smart%20Tea%20Kettle&object_type=article&object_uuid=04QKY5uNodwInJl4ds0UvbT&short_url=JdKXm&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">GoveeLife Smart Tea Kettle</a> for just $35.99 at Amazon. That's $24 (or 40%) off the voice-controlled kettle's usual price of $59.99. It's a return to the Kettle's <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0CFDMJXTZ" target="_blank">best price</a>, which we also saw last month. </p><p>If you're like me, you bring your water to a boil on the stove with your old-school kettle, taking the exact temperature instructions on the box of your tea of choice totally for granted. But any true tea connoisseur will tell you that those steeping temperatures matter: water temperature has a major impact on the tea's favor. With the Goveeife Smart Tea Kettle, you have to-the-exact-degree temperature control within the range of 104&deg;F to 212&deg;F. You can control the WiFi-enabled Bluetooth tea kettle through the app, voice commands, or simple buttons. Not only do you have full control over temperature, but you can also set the Kettle on a schedule to save yourself some extra time in the morning. </p><p>Take your daily tea ritual to the next level when you score the <a href="https://zdcs.link/JdKXm?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=GoveeLife%20Smart%20Tea%20Kettle&object_type=article&object_uuid=04QKY5uNodwInJl4ds0UvbT&short_url=JdKXm&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">GoveeLife Smart Tea Kettle</a> for just $35.99 at Amazon. </p>]]></content:encoded>

So often these shows appeal to our most hedonistic desires, deliberately stoking discord amongst their cast in pursuit of spectacle and commercial gain. Yet despite this, we just can't seem to stop watching.</p><p>Indie game <em>The Crush House</em> seizes upon this voyeuristic thirst for drama, positioning you as a reality show producer tasked with recording the flirting, fighting, and failed friendships synonymous with shows like <em>Love Island</em>, <em>Big Brother</em>, <em>Too Hot to Handle</em>, and the like. It also puts a menacing spin on such shows, lampooning our never ending craving for content. Even so, it unfortunately struggles to capture why people like reality television in the first place.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Developed by UK studio <a href="https://www.nerial.co.uk/" target="_blank">Nerial</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2337820/The_Crush_House/" target="_blank"><em>The Crush House</em></a> is a self-described "thirst-person shooter" centering on a late '90s reality television show of the same name. In it, four young singles are put up in a coastal Malibu mansion for five days, with the assumption that interpersonal drama will inevitably follow. Of course, this isn't the only conflict transpiring in the deceptively bright and welcoming house.</p><p>You play as Jae Jimenez Jung, <em>The Crush House</em>'s producer. You're also the show's casting director, props master, and advertising coordinator, though the vast majority of your time will be spent as the reality show's cameraperson. In fact, aside from a lone production assistant delivering instructions via a walkie talkie, it seems as though you're the only staff member working to ensure the show goes on.</p><q>
    Stave off cancellation for five straight days and you'll have completed a season.
    </q>
<p>This responsibility doesn't come with as much freedom as you might imagine. Unseen corporate powers monitor your daily performance, and will cancel <em>The Crush House</em> if you fail to satisfy enough audience groups by filming their preferred content. You also have to choose when not to record, so you can let ads run to earn money for props around the house.</p><p>Stave off cancellation for five straight days and you'll have completed a season, winning you and the cast a trip down the Crush House's swirly pink Success Slide. Then it's time to do it all again with a new cast &mdash; and further <em>The Crush House</em>'s ominous persisting story.</p><h2>The audience is always right. Weird, but right.</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p><em>The Crush House</em>'s audience demographics will vary each day, and have different preferences regarding the subjects, action, and cinematic techniques they like to see on screen. Most of them are fairly straightforward, though it isn't always clear exactly what every demographic is after. While Foot Fans, Butt Guys, and Girls For Girls' desires were obvious, I still have no idea what the Glitched or Libertarians wanted.</p><p>Fortunately, continuing to pander to an audience you've already fully satisfied will grant overflow points into all the other demographics watching. So if you film enough exercise equipment to make the Gym Rats happy, their contagious joy will begin to impact the Fish Freaks, Art Collectors, and Divorced Dads as well. Filming three or more audiences' preferred content in the same frame also nets you a very satisfying bonus, helping you fill the gauges faster. As such, it didn't matter too much that I never figured out what made the Activists or Cynics happy.</p><div id="related-video" class="mx-auto mt-8 mb-12 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans md:mt-12 md:mb-16 text-primary-400">

<p>I found the best strategy was to satisfy my audiences as early as possible, then simply put the camera down and let ads run until night falls and the day's episode ends. (Despite some discussion of voyeuristic sex, there isn't any risque after dark filming. It's all kept fairly PG-13, with nobody getting further than some enthusiastic kissing, while the residents sleep in unsexy pods kept in an off-limits area.)</p><p>Airing the same ad multiple times in one day does devalue it, making it pay out less. Even so, less cash is still cash, and there didn't seem to be any benefit of continuing to serve audiences once my quota was filled. It was also fun to see ads nodding to other indie games such as <a href="https://mashable.com/article/cult-of-the-lamb-review-single-parent" target="_self"><em>Cult of the Lamb</em></a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/mars-first-logistics-preview-review" target="_self"><em>Mars First Logistics</em></a>. I was typically able to net over $1,000 per day, which I used each night to buy audience-satisfying props such as karaoke machines and butt-shaped pillows. </p><h2>Rules are made to be crushed</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Nighttime is also when you can break one of the only two rules you're given as <em>The Crush House</em>'s producer: Do not speak to the talent.</p><p>Cast members make requests regarding how you portray them on the show, creating an extra challenge on top of simply satisfying your audiences. Though never deep enough to stir up empathy or make you feel connected to the characters, these nighttime conversations further the game's progression while providing your best glimpse into the cast's personalities.</p><p>All 12 of <em>The Crush House</em>'s rotating roster of sexy singles have individual profiles with separate likes and dislikes. Milo is the "volatile hippy kid," Ayo is a "scary gym chick," while Emile is described as a "French stud."<em> </em>The game encourages you to consider how their traits might interact when choosing four cast members at the beginning of each season. However, aside from surface level behaviour, these profiles seemed to have minimal bearing on how the housemates actually interacted.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p><em>The Crush House</em> uses a <a href="https://x.com/TheCrushHouse/status/1804242889884733927" target="_blank">"semi-procedurally generated dialogue system"</a> which takes into account cast members' character traits and relationships when creating conversations. Yet they all tend to repeat the same base conversations, asking each other about their opinion on birds, starting fights over whether or not it's "margarita time," and failing to confess their affections to each other. People swing suddenly from enemies to lovers and back again at dizzying speeds, with no clear rhyme or reason to these changes. They'd also occasionally have conversations while in completely separate rooms.</p><p>The result is that, instead of feeling like you're in your favourite reality show, <em>The Crush House</em> feels more like watching chatbots talk to each other. I quickly stopped paying attention to relationships or trying to evaluate a cast's chemistry, simply choosing whoever I felt like tossing into the house next. Half my audience would prefer I film flowers, plumbing, or a drink dispenser than the cast's shenanigans anyway. In fact, I'd often ignore drama unfolding on the other side of the house in favour of filming a bush. What makes for well-rated television in real life in no way translates to <em>The Crush House</em>.</p><p>In a clever twist, the shallow and repetitive nature of the cast's conversations did begin to take on new significance as <em>The Crush House</em>'s larger plot developed. It's always gratifying to see indie devs find clever approaches to managing their technical limitations, and in fact use such limits to enrich the narrative of their game.

<p>The lack of coherent in-universe cast plotlines and personalities is where much of <em>The Crush House</em>'s untapped potential lies. The fun of reality television isn't just watching people fight or kiss. It's in getting to know the people and following their storylines, so you're elated when the couple you're shipping finally kisses or shocked when they betray each other.&nbsp;</p><p>While <em>The Crush House</em>'s procedurally generated conversations do attempt to make each playthrough feel dynamic, they sacrifice such stories and audience connection. As a result even the most fiery exchanges had no significance or weight, with their participants easily interchangeable and their words meaningless. It made me wonder whether the game might have benefitted from a smaller cast with more curated, impactful dialogue and relationships.&nbsp;</p><p>Lacking such interpersonal dynamics, <em>The Crush House</em> relies on its darker underlying plot to try engaging players. Unfortunately, while this does add some interest with a clear narrative, its obvious predictability fails to make up for the lost potential. It's also difficult to become invested in the characters' fates when they feel so two-dimensional.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-Z30Scg9u1u4"></div>
</div>


<p>It took me approximately nine hours to play through to <em>The Crush House</em>'s credits, and I didn't find much replay value unless you want to try rushing through a second playthrough to get the alternate ending. The game frustratingly auto-saves after you're already locked into one ending, so you have to go through the whole game again to see the other.</p><p>I do think <em>The Crush House </em>is an interesting title, particularly for reality show fans. A video game about filming a reality show is a fairly unique concept with undeniable potential. Sadly, it's such a big, fun idea that doing it justice is a difficult task. While the nature of reality shows is that they are largely unscripted, generated dialogue just doesn't have the same effect. There's a reason video game narratives and dialogue are typically carefully written and planned.</p><p><em>The Crush House </em>is a short, sweet game that you can finish in a day, and reality show fiends will likely find it novel. But I can't shake the feeling that it could have been more.</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/KJ31j?pageview_type=RSS&template=review&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=The%20Crush%20House%20is%20out%20now%20on%20PC.&object_type=review&object_uuid=01iAPEW3uyymDd3JrnSlw5g&short_url=KJ31j&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><em>The Crush House</em> is out now on PC.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

Hackers apparently got into ADT's systems and stole limited customer information to post on a hacking forum. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>"After becoming aware of the incident, the ompany promptly took steps to shut down the unauthorized access and launched an investigation, partnering with leading third-party cybersecurity industry experts," ADT's 8-K filing said.</p><p>According to ADT, the information that was leaked was limited to email addresses, phone numbers, and postal addresses. Without giving any hard numbers, ADT claimed that only a small percentage of its customers were affected by this hack.</p><p>BleepingComputer noted that data apparently stolen from ADT was posted on a hacking forum at the end of July. That data allegedly included customer user IDs and what products they had purchased from ADT. Companies <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/data-breach-response-guide-business" target="_blank">are required</a> to notify affected customers after data breaches in the U.S. and elsewhere, so if you were affected, you may hear from ADT soon, if you haven't already.</p>]]></content:encoded>

It boasts a 24.2MP CMS sensor, 3.5 fps burst shooting mode with autofocus, 4K video capture, and 120 fps shooting at 1280 x 720. It has a sleek black body and is comparable to the more expensive DSLR EOS Rebel T7 but for less money, making it a good entry-level mirrorless option for anyone looking to get more into serious photography. Plus, its autofocus mode helps to pick out faces while shooting so you don't have to struggle with doing it on your own. </p><h2><strong>Best point and shoot camera</strong></h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

It's a compact option that's also good at shooting still photos, with a 20.1MP 1-inch sensor that makes for absolutely excellent video quality paired with a 3.5mm mic that means you don't have to provide an external one if you're recording a lot of sound beyond voice. It's simple to use for beginners and professional users alike, and its autofocus is worth writing home about, too &ndash; it can nail down moving people and pets easily so you don't have to fiddle with your settings. </p><h2><strong>Best instant camera</strong></h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>An individual AirTag typically costs $29, which means it would cost you about $116 to buy four separately. With this four-pack deal, however, you'll pay just $74.99. That's basically like getting one and a half for free. Stick one on your luggage, keys, bike, tools, and anything else you don't want to lose and keep track of their location as long as there's an Apple device with Find My nearby.

<p>The Sony LinkBuds S have "mighty noise cancellation features, immersive sound sure to please, and are also super portable and workout-friendly," former Mashable intern Stacia Datskovska wrote in <a href="https://mashable.com/review/olivia-rodrigo-sony-linkbuds-s" target="_self">her review</a>. They might not be the best-looking buds on the block, but they definitely beat the original LinkBuds and are a solid choice for noisy commutes or flights. As of Aug. 9, they're also back on sale for just $128 at Amazon. That's a savings of 36% and about nine bucks away from their record-low.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>On Wednesday, we <a href="https://mashable.com/article/amazon-deals-of-the-day-apple-ipad-9th-gen-aug-7" target="_self">featured</a> the ninth generation iPad as our top Amazon deal of the day. At $229, it was matching a previous record-low price. On Aug. 9, however, that price has dropped even further to just $224 &mdash;&nbsp;a new record-low. Even though it's not the newest iPad on the market (it hails from 2021), it's still our <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-tablets" target="_self">favorite tablet for most people</a>. It packs the A13 Bionic chip, a 10.2-inch Retina display, and up to 10 hours of battery life that'll help you power through all your basic tasks. I held off for awhile on buying this for myself, but at this price, I finally pulled the trigger.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>For just $5 more than the typical Amazon Fire TV Stick, you can get the Fire TV Stick 4K. It does everything the regular streaming stick does, but better. As the name suggests, the 4K version offers support for cinematic 4K Ultra HD, as well as support for Dolby Vision, HDR10+, Dolby Atmos, and WiFi 6. Not to mention, Fire Stick now let you play Xbox games without a console. Snag it on sale for just $29.99 as of Aug. 9.</p><p><em>None of these deals catching your eye?

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>The <a href="https://zdcs.link/joYBr?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Tommy%20Bahama%20Backpack%20Beach%20Chair&object_type=article&object_uuid=041Tcwi2gN37BYTmOkPafh0&short_url=joYBr&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Tommy Bahama Backpack Beach Chair</a> is an ultra-functional comfy seat for the beach. It has five different positions, including the option to set it up so you can lie completely flat. Thanks to its backpack straps, it's super easy to pack the chair up and trek it to the beach or to the park for a picnic. With a rust-proof aluminum frame, it's durable for years of use. My grandmother got me the Tommy Bahama Backpack Chair for my birthday over ten years ago, and I still use it all through the summer to this day. While the sale price of $71.50 might still seem a little steep for a beach chair, it's a great value buy when you consider its quality and longevity. </p><h2>Best SUP deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>The debut title from BlueTwelve Studio released back in July of 2022 and was met with critical acclaim for its creativity, engaging puzzles, and overall <a href="https://mashable.com/article/cats-watching-stray-game-twitter" target="_self">cuteness</a>. In it, you step into the paws of a nameless cat that is separated from its other cat friends and dumped into a cyberpunk-style city. Through exploration, platforming, and puzzle-solving, you'll have to find your own way out if you want to be reunited with your buddies. Although the situation isn't ideal, you'll still have the opportunity to partake in plenty of relaxing cat activities along your journey, like scratching random objects and taking short-but-frequent naps.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

<p>Owning and maintaining carpets is hard work, which is why it's best to rely on <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-upholstery-cleaners" target="_self">carpet and upholstery cleaners</a> to do the maintenance part. Although the Bissell Little Green Machine is our top recommendation, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/R0OpV?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Dirt%20Devil%20Portable%20Spot%20compact%20carpet%20cleaner&object_type=article&object_uuid=05F7G5FI3u84y8hHJdaBlbE&short_url=R0OpV&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Dirt Devil Portable Spot compact carpet cleaner</a> is a great alternative, and it's discounted right now. </p><p>As of August 9, you can get the <a href="https://zdcs.link/R0OpV?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Dirt%20Devil%20Portable%20Spot%20compact%20carpet%20cleaner&object_type=article&object_uuid=05F7G5FI3u84y8hHJdaBlbE&short_url=R0OpV&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Dirt Devil Portable Spot compact carpet cleaner</a> for just $79.99 at Amazon, down from the usual list price of $109.99.

<p>In the UK alone, around <a href="https://www.endometriosis-uk.org/endometriosis-facts-and-figures" target="_blank"><u>1.5 million women</u></a> and AFAB people are currently living with the condition. Demi, a contestant on <em>Love is Blind UK</em>, is one of them.</p><h2><em>Love Is Blind UK</em> makes space to talk about endometriosis</h2><p>In episode 3, when Ollie asks Demi what&rsquo;s stopping her from connecting with him emotionally, she explains how her endometriosis has been a barrier in past relationships.</p><p>"I&rsquo;ve always wanted a family and to be a good mum," she tells him. "It&rsquo;s hard for me to naturally conceive because I&rsquo;ve got endometriosis."</p><p>"Sometimes I don&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;m enough which is really scary," Demi adds.

<p>These life-altering symptoms of endometriosis are so important to talk about with a partner, and receive support for. It&rsquo;s a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/living-with-gynaecological-conditions" target="_self"><u>well-known fact</u></a> that endometriosis is also <a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-023-02820-y#:~:text=The%20underlying%20problems%20are%20diverse,options%20are%20progressing%20only%20slowly." target="_blank"><u>under researched</u></a> &ndash; making its representation in TV shows even more crucial for raising awareness and demanding change.</p><p>"Latest research shows that<a href="https://www.endometriosis-uk.org/endometriosis-awareness-month-2020-launches-tackle-fact-54-dont-know-about-endometriosis#:~:text=Despite%20affecting%201%20in%2010,not%20know%20what%20endometriosis%20is." target="_blank"> <u>only 54 percent of people know what endometriosis is</u></a>," Faye Farthing, head of communications at Endometriosis UK, tells Mashable. She adds that this directly impacts diagnosis times and awareness of symptoms &mdash; both crucial to improving treatment for and day-to-day experiences of the disease.&nbsp;</p><p>Specifically, <em>Love Is Blind UK</em>&rsquo;s spotlighting of endometriosis and how it can impact people's experiences of dating and relationships is a fantastic step forward for raising awareness. But it's also crucial for teaching people without it about the romantic and intimate difficulties that people with endometriosis may face.</p><h2>Dating with endometriosis can mean challenging conversations</h2><p>"Endometriosis can have a significant impact on people&rsquo;s relationships," Farthing says. "It can be hard to start a conversation about your condition to a new partner, and it&rsquo;s encouraging that this will be spotlighted on the new series of <em>Love Is Blind</em>, to show how open discussions can take place and the importance of highlighting your needs with a partner."&nbsp;</p><p>"This can be a really difficult conversation, and can be challenging for both the person with endometriosis and their partner."</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

    </div>
<p>She adds that many with endometriosis report feeling isolated by their condition, feeling "frustrated at having to cancel social plans, and having an understanding partner is so incredibly important for those with the disease".</p><p>"Dating with endometriosis isn&rsquo;t always given the spotlight it deserves and shining a light on this not only helps remove the taboo associated with the disease and its symptoms, but also hopefully highlights how to have an open dialogue with a partner and the importance of being in a supportive relationship," Farthing says.</p><q>
    &ldquo;Dating with endometriosis isn&rsquo;t always given the spotlight it deserves."
    </q>
<p>Another fantastic example of endometriosis representation in pop culture right now is author Coco Mellors&rsquo; latest novel <a href="https://harpercollins.co.uk/products/blue-sisters-coco-mellors" target="_blank"><em><u>Blue Sisters</u></em></a>. Published in May 2024, it explores the lives of four sisters &mdash; one of whom sadly passes away (before the novel even starts, so don&rsquo;t worry, no spoilers) after an accidental overdose from attempting to medicate the pain from her endometriosis. Mellors has spoken openly about her reasons for incorporating endometriosis so centrally into a storyline &mdash; and it has everything to do with representation and spotlighting the need for more time and money to be put into women and non-binary people's health issues. </p><p>"In my first book, I have a character that has epilepsy, and that was because my best friend has epilepsy and I have never seen in any work someone dealing with the realities of it in a way that wasn't defining their life, but it was in their life, and I felt endometriosis is quite a similar disease in some ways,"<a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/entertainment/a60845718/coco-mellors-blue-sisters-novel/" target="_blank"> <u>Mellors told <em>Cosmopolitan</em></u><u> in an interview</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"It's just such an example for me of how male-centred the medical industry still is today, and how much women are expected to endure physically. It's a kind of lonely disease to be living with and I thought it felt true to this world that one of the sisters would have [endometriosis]."</p><p>It&rsquo;s never been more important that endometriosis is talked about and recognised as a serious legitimate health condition &mdash; and watching storylines on TV and reading books about people and characters dealing with it can only further emphasise this.</p><h2>Don't call it "benign"</h2><p>Endometriosis UK is campaigning for healthcare professionals to stop using the word "benign" when referring to the disease, as well as other gynaecological conditions. The term can mean very real, often debilitating symptoms are underestimated, deprioritised, and ignored. Calling endometriosis "benign" stinks of medical misogyny, and lessens the perceived impact of diseases that affect so many women and non-binary people.&nbsp;</p><p>We see the impact of the lack of awareness around endometriosis in author Sally Rooney&rsquo;s debut novel <a href="https://mashable.com/article/conversations-with-friends-review" target="_self"><em><u>Conversations With Friends</u></em></a><em> </em>and its TV adaptation. Protagonist Frances (played onscreen by Alison Oliver) has endometriosis, and struggles to be diagnosed and treated appropriately throughout the series. Frances experiences debilitating pain and excessive bleeding that she dismisses as "just her period". Then, when she does consult a medical professional, she is accused of having unprotected sex and is dismissed with a prescription of the contraceptive pill &mdash; <a href="https://mashable.com/article/living-with-gynaecological-conditions" target="_self"><u>a common tale</u></a>. Eventually, she is diagnosed with endometriosis, but not after some wrong turns lead to her suffering from her symptoms for longer. <em>Conversations With Friends</em> perfectly encapsulates the importance of representing the realities of misdiagnosis and/or delayed diagnosis when it comes to conditions like endometriosis.</p><p>"Endometriosis care urgently needs to improve," Farthing says. "Not only does diagnosis in the UK take on average eight years and 10 months, but gynaecology waiting lists in England have grown faster each month than any other elective specialty in percentage terms and are now over double the size they were prior to the pandemic."</p><p>Campaigning for change, Endometriosis UK is calling for the UK government to commit to an average diagnosis time target for endometriosis, to recognise it as a common and chronic disease, and adjust menstrual wellbeing education to reflect this. More than that, more research and funding is needed "as part of an investment into women&rsquo;s health" to discover better treatment, pain management, and a cure.</p><q>
    Representation of endometriosis on TV and in books...can help to raise much needed awareness to demand change.&nbsp;
    </q>
<p>The sharing of endometriosis stories, on screen and otherwise, can help create real change, Farthing says. "We often hear from patients who have felt ignored and dismissed, and seeing other people&rsquo;s experiences can be incredibly validating, and shows that you are not alone in what you are experiencing and that this is a disease that can have a huge impact on people&rsquo;s lives."</p><p>So, representation of endometriosis on TV and in books &mdash; whether it&rsquo;s on <em>Love Is Blind UK</em>, a bestselling novel or another form of pop culture &mdash; can help to raise much needed awareness to demand change.&nbsp;</p><p>"Onscreen stories of endometriosis can go a long way in improving public awareness," Farthing says. "Driving public awareness is key to ensuring everyone recognises the symptoms of the disease and how to seek help."</p><p><strong>How to watch:</strong> <a href="https://zdcs.link/vd2G0?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Love%20Is%20Blind%20UK%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Netflix.&object_type=article&object_uuid=03AepY9CqsAYJl3wJIhLNuk&short_url=vd2G0&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><em>Love Is Blind UK</em> is now streaming on Netflix.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/077seMRIWbwVmksdtq2dGDo/hero-image.png" alt="Two images of Sunny Choi"><p>Less than two years ago, Sunny Choi was living a double life working in corporate America by day and breaking by night. Then breaking was announced as an official Olympic sport, and Choi knew it was now or never. As a child, she had dreamed of attending the Olympics as a gymnast. Now, at 35, she is attending the IRL Games as a member of Team USA's first ever breaking team &mdash; <em>and</em> wandering around the metaverse as a digital avatar in a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/olympics-kids-roblox-obby-games" target="_self">new Olympics-themed Roblox game</a>. </p><p>Mashable caught up with Sunny for a quick chat less than a week before she headed off to Paris.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

        </a>
    </div>
<h3>Hi Sunny! You're part of a new Olympics-themed Roblox game. Have you played Roblox before?</h3><p>I knew of Roblox because my nieces play, but I had never played. My sister-in-law, actually, was saying that my nieces will probably be more excited about me being in Roblox than my being in the Olympics.</p><h3>You've just given your nieces priceless bragging rights at school.</h3><p>That's basically what my sister-in-law said. "They're gonna be so excited when they find out!" To be honest, I haven't been able to play in the experience myself because I've been a little busy <em>[laughs]</em> but I would love to, because I did get to see the two emotes [a Roblox avatar animation] of my breaking moves and they're so cute. With one of them, especially, you can definitely tell it's me if you know what my movements are.</p><h3>How would you describe the move depicted in that emote?</h3><p>It's like a signature move, I don't know that anyone else does anything quite like it. Some of my signature moves have names &mdash; like I have one that I call "wizardry" &mdash; but this one doesn't. It's just a long string of movements [and actually] that's the name, just because it helps me to remember it.&nbsp;</p><p>There's this segment where I do a kind of one-handed back walkover, like a gymnast, but it goes around in a circle. It reminds me of a gymnastics move called the Valdez, so I call it a "Valdez-step-on-hand," because I literally land stepping on my hand, and then I grab my foot and I throw my foot up in the air.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-atuX8NsUg8I"></div>
</div>


<h3>Isn't the gaming term "noob" also used in the breaking community?</h3><p>Yes, and it means the same thing: to be a beginner. I started breaking with people who were in the engineering school at Penn, so it may be that they use that word more than the rest of the breaking community, because I don't hear it often.</p><h3>You were director of global creative operations for skincare at Est&eacute;e Lauder before quitting to pursue breaking full-time in January 2023. What was that time like for you?</h3><p>That life was actually really, really challenging, and I was lucky to be able to make that decision to jump into my passion and quit the corporate job. Had I not, I either would have had to find a job where I was able to work less, or I would have needed to dial back on the breaking because it was getting to a point where it was unsustainable. I was getting up at six in the morning, going to the gym and then working a New York City corporate day &mdash; which is not just a nine-to-five, by the way &mdash; and then logging off, changing, going to practice, answering emails and Slack while I was at practice, coming home, finishing the job, going to bed, getting six hours of sleep if I was lucky, and then doing it all over again. So it was definitely really, really tough.</p><p>I don't recommend trying to work full-time and pursuing another passion to that level. It is possible, I think, to go ahead and work a full-time job, and then also be passionate about something. But I think pursuing it at an Olympic level is definitely going to be challenging. You don't have any sense of balance. You have no time for anything else, including yourself. You don't have any downtime. And any time I did have downtime, I was so exhausted that I didn't get to really enjoy it.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h3>Will you attend other sporting events at the Olympics?</h3><p>We can apply to get tickets to watch other events, but I probably won't know what my schedule looks like until I'm there. And I'm assuming I'm not going to be the only athlete that wants to watch other events <em>[laughs]</em>. I don't know how that process goes, but I do think that they encourage athletes to go watch other sports.</p><p>There's a few sports where I've actually met the athletes. I've never been into water polo, but just meeting [Team USA water polo player] Ashleigh Johnson, she's really cool, so I'd like to watch her. Rugby Sevens looks really cool, I'd love to watch the women's team. I'm all about women's sports, so we're just talking women here by the way. Gymnastics, of course, is on there. I've always loved diving, so maybe diving would make it on there. Those on the top of my list.</p><p><em>This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

The game is all about finding the "common threads between words." And just like <em>Wordle</em>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-20-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> resets after midnight and each new set of words gets trickier and trickier&mdash;so we've served up some hints and tips to get you over the hurdle.</p><p>If you just want to be told today's puzzle, you can jump to the end of this article for August 9's <em>Connections</em> solution. But if you'd rather solve it yourself, keep reading for some clues, tips, and strategies to assist you.</p><h2>What is Connections?</h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. Like <em>Wordle, </em>you can share the results with your friends on social media.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/026STPPQagI37t5QFT1yXKi/hero-image.jpg" alt="Lily Collias in "Good One.""><p>A backpacking trip becomes imbued with simmering tensions in <em>Good One</em>, India Donaldson's subtly gripping feature debut about a father and daughter at odds. Told through the eyes of a queer teenager on the verge of adulthood, the film centers the kind of gruff, occasionally uncomfortable heterosexual machismo around which camping can thrive, but it grounds its notions of clashing genders and generations in a precisely wound family story.</p><p>It is, in essence, an adventurous thriller in which the adventure is a breezy trek at a slight elevation, and the thrills comprise mere glances. But rarely has a film conferred such monumental weight and importance upon the perspective of a teenage girl. Whether&nbsp; anything happens through most of <em>Good One</em> depends on the point of view, though by the end of the movie's brisk 90 minutes, Donaldson's arch direction places Murphy's Law in its crosshairs.

<p>After opening with calming shots of a burbling stream in the woods &mdash; a promise of sorts, towards which the movie's city-dwelling characters are drawn &mdash; <em>Good One</em> introduces New York high schooler Sam (Lily Collias) and her uptight father Chris (James Le Gros). As they pack for their trip to the Catskill Mountains, Sam spends time with a female friend of hers on whom she clearly has a crush, while Chris meticulously fits rectangular snacks and supplies into a cylindrical jar until there's no more room left.</p><p>Chris, who's divorced from Sam's mother, is remarried and has a wailing newborn; he sees this trip as an escape from frustrating domestic mundanities, and tries to exert a sense of control over every aspect. Sam, meanwhile, goes with the flow. What she wants out of this hike isn't certain, but she isn't opposed to the idea of it in general &mdash; or, it would appear, to new opportunities. Both characters exist at vastly different stages of transformation in middle age and teenhood; for Sam, college applications loom.They're soon joined en route to the Catskills by Chris' old friend Matt (Danny McCarthy), a more frustrated and far less-prepared accomplice in a transition of his own. Divorced as well, Matt was meant to bring his teenage son along &mdash; a close friend of Sam's &mdash; but a fight between them makes Matt the awkward third wheel to Chris and Sam's father-daughter bonding, or so it would seem.</p><p>Before long, this dynamic shifts as well. Chris and Matt have a brotherly dynamic, and their similarities cause them to fall into a familiar rhythm, though one that's alienating to Sam. The two men's dynamic is endearing at times, if occasionally tinged with language that Sam's generation might've long soured on &mdash; like calling women "females." But they are, for the most part, harmless lunks at opposite ends of a comedic spectrum: a man who's meticulously over-prepared, and a man who wears jeans on a hike and forgets his sleeping bag.</p><p>However, what sets <em>Good One</em> apart from the usual crop of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/sacramento-review" target="_self">men-in-arrested-development American comedies</a> is that Sam is caught in the middle of their straight-man/funny-man shtick, not just as a casual observer but an unwitting participant in their lives, their arguments, and their disagreements. She isn't just a casual mediator who has fun intervening, but someone whose life is (and has been, for as long as she's been alive) tied up in theirs. This places her in the awkward position of wanting to help and joke around, but without ruffling any feathers.</p><p>As jovial as this dynamic may be, it soon grows fragile. Cracks first begin to appear when a trio of young men set up their own camp nearby, and Sam's objection to her father in private goes unheard, or at best misunderstood. They grow more pronounced when Matt's drunken self-loathing veers into territory so discomforting that you might momentarily stop breathing. All the while, the story of <em>Good One</em> lives and breathes through its stellar lead performance.</p><h2><strong><em>Good One</em> features some of the best acting this year.</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The complexities of Donaldson's screenplay are owed, in large part, to the fact that Matt and Chris are deeply sympathetic characters. Spending time with them is largely a joy, even if the occasional verbiage of theirs feels retrograde at times.</p><p>Chris, for instance, embodies an eager, clownish dad, a protector who builds emotional shields through low-hanging humor and fun factoids. He takes pride in the simplest of things, like the way Sam pours soup ("Isn't that a steady pour?" he repeats more than once), and while cooking rustic meals, talks about how you "need the bean to meet its potential." Le Gros leans fully into the goofy persona of a man desperately trying to be one with nature, forcing himself into the groove of camping to the point that anyone stepping a foot out of line or not following his rule book receives a scolding.</p><p>However, where Le Gros really taps into Chris is in his refusal to fully see his daughter, despite practically never taking his eye off her. This applies to both men, but where Matt can afford to be disengaged, Chris is never concerned (or even really aware) that Sam is changing her tampons in the open forest when strange men could be nearby. And where a more traditional drama might weave ongoing verbal conflicts into this father-daughter story, <em>Good One</em> paves the path for them through reaction shots from both Le Gros and Collias, building Chris and Sam's relationship not through communication but through a lack thereof.</p><p>Collias, meanwhile, puts on a clinic of concern and self-doubt, as Sam intuits ever-so-slightly weird vibes at several turns. Of course, to break such an intricate story down to a matter of gender binaries would do it a disservice, but it truly does embody the varying ways men and women learn to navigate the world, given their experiences and how they're socialized.</p><p>Right in the middle of this dynamic is the streetwise Matt, who McCarthy fills to the brim with emotions simply waiting to burst forth. The character (a former actor on a mid-2000s procedural, echoing McCarthy's recurring role on <em>Prison Break</em>) conceals the real ways his failures at fatherhood continue to bother him. Matt casually brushes off these paternal inadequacies, though he always seems to search for answers about what to do, even if those answers come from a high schooler. McCarthy is the movie's secret weapon, its beating heart and soul &mdash; which makes it all the more viscerally impactful when Matt's comments towards Sam begin skirting the line of appropriateness.</p><h2><strong><em>Good One</em> is an unexpected gut punch.</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>For Sam, who's nearing the end of high school, navigating the world in the long run means being exposed to it first, then living outside of the comforts and confines of home. This risky adventure is given literal form by Donaldson's setting: the great outdoors, where practically any scenario could arise when strangers are nearby.</p><p>Sam may exist in close proximity to Chris' protective shadow, but a tragic part of the story is her discovery that this, too, has its limits. No character in the film, not Matt nor any of the young men they come across, has any particularly sinister aura, but the film's sense of looming unease is born from brief moments and stray dialogue that makes Sam (and the audience) question the intent of other characters, without ever providing answers.</p><p>This functions as a kind of filmic plausible deniability, and allows any and every character to simply resume their regular, friendly status quo as though nothing out of the ordinary has happened. And to them, this is indeed the case, whereas to Sam, <em>something</em> definitely has happened. Meanwhile, the plot and dialogue constantly poke and prod at Sam's sense of equilibrium. That nothing happens in terms of overt genre or thriller flourishes is precisely the point, because the phantom possibilities are unnerving all on their own. From there on out, it becomes a question of who in the film, including Sam herself, will take those emergent possibilities into consideration, and how this will affect the rest of the trip &mdash; an unfortunate question she not only needs to ask, but has answered for her in the process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>Good One</em> is ultimately a dialogue-heavy film about a culture of silence. It's akin to Mira Nair's <em>Monsoon Wedding</em> in that regard, though it lives at the far opposite end of the cinematic spectrum, unfolding quietly and unassumingly, and sans overt confrontation, until things finally boil over in ways that can't help but strain even the most pleasant relationships. Its intensity is born not from what happens but the possibility of what could, and the question of whether or not that possibility is enough to change one's perception of other people, and of the harshness of the world at large.&nbsp;</p><p>Sam is essentially forced to come of age before our eyes when witnessing this harshness firsthand. She's not only exposed to the failures and insecurities of two father figures, but to their indifference to her lived experience in a way that pierces the veil of childhood safety and comfort. Few experiences are more jarring. Donaldson's deft direction ensures that by the end of the film, much like Sam, we also feel our sense of trust has been shaken as we emerge into the real world.</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/2eMYl?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Good%20One%20opens%20in%20theaters%20Aug.%209.&object_type=article&object_uuid=026STPPQagI37t5QFT1yXKi&short_url=2eMYl&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><em>Good One</em> opens in theaters Aug. 9.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>That's because Season 3 of <em>Industry </em>is the show in experimentation mode. Flashbacks are on the table now, supporting characters get more of a spotlight, and the scope has never been larger. Co-creators Mickey Down and Konrad Kay pull references from everywhere from <a href="https://mashable.com/article/uncut-gems-memes" target="_self"><em>Uncut Gems</em></a> and the films of Michael Mann to <em>Barry Lyndon </em>and <em>A Room with a View</em>, creating episodes that vary in tone but never lose the frenetic energy that makes <em>Industry </em>tick. The risks of constantly playing with a show's formula may not always pay off (looking at you, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-bear-season-3-review" target="_self"><em>The Bear </em></a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-bear-season-3-review" target="_self">Season 3</a>), but for <em>Industry</em>, whose characters live on risky choices and shifting alliances, this approach proves absolutely perfect.</p><h2><strong>What's <em>Industry</em> Season 3 about?</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

    </div>
<p>Of course, the risks <em>Industry </em>characters take often end them up in hot water. Take Harper Stern (Myha'la, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/leave-the-world-behind-review" target="_self"><em>Leave the World Behind</em></a>), whose forged college transcript in Season 1 led to her firing from fictional investment bank Pierpoint &amp; Co. at the end of Season 2. Hungry to stay in the game by whatever means possible, Harper's now taken an assistant role at investment fund FutureDawn. And while she finds the job &mdash; and FutureDawn's focus on ethical investment &mdash; mind-numbing, she also discovers a potential new ally in cutthroat portfolio manager Petra Koenig (Sarah Goldberg, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/barry-season-4-finale-ending-explained" target="_self"><em>Barry</em></a>).</p><p>Harper may roll her eyes at ethical investing, but over at Pierpoint, it's all the rage. Yasmin Kara-Hanani (Marisa Abela, <a href="https://mashable.com/video/back-to-black-amy-winehouse-marisa-abela-interview" target="_self"><em>Back to Black</em></a>), taking over Harper's old role, is working alongside Eric Tao (Ken Leung, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/lost-finale-good" target="_self"><em>Lost</em></a>) and Robert Spearing (Harry Lawtey, <a href="https://mashable.com/video/joker-folie-a-deux-trailer" target="_self"><em>Joker: Folie &Agrave; Deux</em></a>) on the IPO of buzzy green energy company Lumi, headed by untested (yet very rich) Lumi CEO Sir Henry Muck (Kit Harington, <a href="https://mashable.com/category/game-of-thrones" target="_self"><em>Game of Thrones</em></a>). Whether anyone at Pierpoint actually <em>believes </em>in Lumi's mission or the "ethical" aspect of ethical investing is something <em>Industry </em>takes razor-sharp delight in skewering, just as the show tackled COVID-19 profiteers in Season 2.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

        </a>
    </div>
<p>This being <em>Industry</em>, it's not long before the personal and professional clash in spectacular fashion. Lumi's IPO comes at a fraught time for almost every member of Pierpoint. Yasmin has become tabloid fodder following her father Charles' (Adam Levy, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-witcher-liam-hemsworth-first-look-video-images-henry-cavill-netflix" target="_self"><em>The Witcher</em></a>) embezzlement scandal; Robert is reeling following an unexpected loss; and Eric's recent separation has led him down a road of sex, drugs, and poor managerial decisions. Honestly, Harper should be thanking her lucky stars she's not at Pierpoint anymore &mdash; although that certainly won't stop her from re-entering the fray in unexpected ways.</p><h2><strong><em>Industry </em>embraces the chaos in Season 3, with thrilling results.</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

        </div>
    </div>
<p><em>Industry</em>'s new focus on ethical investing and the addition of characters like Petra and Henry prove its commitment to expanding season by season. That commitment is evident on a formal level, too. Yes, you'll still get juicy personal drama and high-speed trading-floor chatter. But you'll often be served these <em>Industry </em>staples in new ways. Flashbacks to Yasmin's time on a boat with her father add an intriguing mystery element to the season, and an episode focused entirely on Rishi Ramdani (Sagar Radia) adds necessary depth to an oft-sidelined character, all while raising the bar on just how stressful <em>Industry </em>can be. (Seriously, you've seen nothing yet.)</p><p>As <em>Industry </em>kicks itself into higher gear, so too does its ensemble cast. Myha'la, Abela, and Lawtey remain three anchor-solid leads, playing the complicated feelings of friendship and competitiveness between this trio with as much pathos as cutthroat instinct. Goldberg and Harington are fun additions, too: Goldberg's sharpness as Petra perfectly complements Myha'la's as Harper, while Harington's Muck hides layers of sleaze and manipulation under the guise of "being vulnerable."</p><p>But it's Leung's Eric who feels the most like <em>Industry</em>'s rotten core in Season 3. Separated from his wife but newly made partner, Eric's whole identity is Pierpoint, Pierpoint, Pierpoint &mdash; with a side of midlife crisis. As he gets back into drugs &mdash; "I haven't done blow since 9/11," he reveals in the premiere &mdash; and casual sex, it's almost as if we're watching him return to his early days at the bank. He would have fit right in with the hard-partying grads in Season 1, with the small caveat that he's still their boss. It's fascinating to watch Eric try to recapture that youth and the "relentlessness" he ties to his masculinity, with Leung often playing him like a just barely contained explosion. </p><p>Yet even as Eric and every other member of <em>Industry</em>'s cast throw their entire beings into their work, there's always the chance that it could chew them up and spit them out at the slightest wrong move. Of course, there's also the chance that it could reward them and make them richer than rich. That atmosphere of high-risk, high-reward decision-making, complemented by high-risk, high-reward television-making, makes watching <em>Industry </em>a high of its own. It's brutal, it's intoxicating, and it's never been better.</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/eBGk1?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Industry%20Season%203%20premieres%20Aug.%2011%20at%209%20p.m.%20ET%20on%20HBO%20and%20Max%2C%20with%20new%20episodes%20weekly.&object_type=article&object_uuid=00SaWUehhfFE8YwrmZ5bYab&short_url=eBGk1&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><em>Industry </em>Season 3 premieres Aug. 11 at 9 p.m. ET on HBO and Max, with new episodes weekly.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>According to a survey by the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/02/08/for-valentines-day-facts-about-marriage-and-dating-in-the-us/" target="_blank">Pew Research Center</a>, nearly 44 percent of adults say they use dating apps to find a long-term partner rather than just casual dating or <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-hookup-apps" target="_self">hookups</a>. This survey also found that one in 10 partnered adults met their current partner through a dating app. So, even if you've yet to find that magical, swoon-worthy connection, the statistics show that it's definitely possible to find true love through online dating. Some of our own writers and editors have even found lasting love on these apps.</p><p>With that said, if you've been on the apps for a while and find yourself dealing with some serious burnout, it's always fair to take some time off, and come back to it when you feel ready &mdash; our guide will be here for you then. Even <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-apps" target="_self">the best app</a> can feel exceptionally tedious when you simply don't have the energy.</p><h2>Which dating app is best for serious relationships?</h2><p>There are <em>so many</em> dating apps, but not all of them are created equal when it comes to finding a serious, committed relationship. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

      <description><![CDATA[Apple is reportedly working on a Mac mini redesign that would make the mini its smallest desktop computer ever.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/002VLVHGfHRRn1LU8bOIMiq/hero-image.jpg" alt="Apple Mac mini"><p><a href="https://mashable.com/category/apple" target="_self">Apple</a> is working on a new version of Mac mini, and this one will truly live up to its name. </p><p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-08/mac-mini-m4-apple-plans-to-release-smallest-desktop-computer-yet" target="_blank">Bloomberg's Mark Gurman</a>, the company is planning a thoroughly redesigned Mac mini that would be far smaller than the current edition, "approaching the size of an Apple TV set-top box."</p><p>Here's what this means, exactly. The current version of Mac mini is 1.41 inches tall, 7.75 inches wide, and 7.75 inches deep. The version with the M2 chip weighs 2.6 pounds, while the version with the M2 Pro weighs 2.8 pounds. </p><p>Apple TV 4K is roughly half the size of that. It's 1.2 inches tall, 3.66 inches wide, and 3.66 inches deep. The Wi-Fi model weighs just 0.46 pounds. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>According to the report, however, the Mac mini will be more cube-like in appearance, as it might actually be taller than the current version. Its enclosure will once again be made of aluminum, just like on the previous version. </p><p>Gurman recently predicted that Apple would put its new <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-every-mac-line-will-get-m4" target="_self">M4 processor into all of its Macs</a>, including the Mac mini. The current version of Mac mini is available with either an M2 or M2 Pro chip. </p><p>But what about the performance? According to Gurman's sources, the new Mac mini is "essentially an iPad Pro in a small box" (the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-ipad-pro-13-inch-2024" target="_self">iPad Pro</a> was the first Apple device to get the new M4 chip). Two versions will be available, one sporting the M4 chip, and the other powered by the M4 Pro chip, which hasn't been announced yet. </p><p>The new Mac mini should become available for purchase later this year, likely in October or later. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On one hand, the Rabbit R1, billed as a pocket AI companion, has <em>something </em>here. From its impressive Vision features that rival <a href="https://mashable.com/article/wild-ways-chatgpt-vision-being-used" target="_self">ChatGPT Vision</a> (i.e., GPT-4V) to the accurate Spanish-to-English translation, the Rabbit R1 gets it right. </p><p>However, these praise-worthy features are overshadowed by buggy performance, frustrating Spotify playback, hair-pulling experiences with a mid AI assistant, and other bothersome quirks.</p><p>So should you indulge in the Rabbit R1? It depends on how you like your tech: rare or well cooked?</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>I pointed the Rabbit R1 to a Spanish menu, and to my surprise, it translated it in English with ease. My only gripe is that you need to request the R1 to complete this task in a <em>specific way</em> or it will not follow your command (more on that in the "What I don't like" section).</p><h3><strong>Summarizes text like 'CliffsNotes'</strong></h3><p>Sometimes, I get too lazy to read an article in its entirety.

I treated the Rabbit R1 quite carelessly throughout my testing (e.g., haphazardly throwing it into my bag), but I don't see a single scratch &mdash; not even on the display. This hardware is definitely durable. (And as a bonus, the chassis doesn't attract fingerprints.)</p><h2><strong>Rabbit R1: What's 'eh' about it</strong></h2><p>While some Rabbit R1 testers despise the scroll wheel and turn their nose up at needing to shake the device to access the Settings menu, I don't mind it.</p><h3><strong>Bizarre functions make it fun &mdash; kind of</strong></h3><p>At first, I didn't love the scroll wheel either. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>It's the only way to hop from one Settings option to another. Plus, I found that the scroll wheel lacked sensitivity. In other words, you need to deploy a lot of "scroll rolls" to navigate the UI. However, there is something very fidgety about the scroll wheel I enjoy &mdash; it brings me back to a time when toys were more tactile.</p><p>I even dig that I need to shake the Rabbit R1 to access the Settings menu. </p><p>However, it does bother me that, if I'm on the very last Settings menu option (and I want to get back to the top), I need to scroll for dear life. Still, it's all a part of this device's charm.</p><h3><strong>A touchscreen that's not really touchscreen</strong></h3><p>Interestingly, the Rabbit R1 is touchscreen, but you can't actually touch the screen to make selections. Let me explain.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>You can turn the Rabbit R1 to the right to access the virtual keyboard, allowing you to make demands to the AI without using your voice. However, this is the only time you can utilize the touchscreen. This is by design, though. Lyu wants users to be reliant on the Rabbit R1's scroll wheel.</p><h3><strong>Hit-or-miss response times</strong></h3><p>The Rabbit R1 is typically pretty quick, answering my queries in less than two seconds. However, the response times with the Vision feature can be slower. At times, the Rabbit R1 appears to finish a complete thought, making me to think that it's done speaking.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>But after an awkward five-second pause, the Rabbit R1 would continue speaking.

<p>Consequently, I found myself sometimes missing the first half of the other person's speech because I pushed the side button too late. I would have preferred if Rabbit R1 could be vocally invoked in the same way we use Google Assistant and Siri, but Lyu says that the upside of a push-to-talk button is that you don't have an AI that's "always listening."</p><h3><strong>Doubles as a sound recorder</strong></h3><p>You can also record audio with the "Start a recording session" command.

<p>You can find "notes" in the Rabbit Hole, too &mdash; little reminders you've told Rabbit R1 to store, allowing you to access them later.</p><p>However, I can't find myself to get excited about these features. They're not particularly noteworthy.</p><h2><strong>Rabbit R1: What I dislike about it</strong></h2><p>One of the biggest selling points of Rabbit R1 is tha, in addition to the LLM that underpins it (with Perplexity at the helm), it features something unique that ChatGPT and its ilk do not have: a large action model (LAM).</p><p>What is a LAM, you ask? Without getting too nerdy, it means that the Rabbit R1 is capable of stepping in and doing things for you on your behalf. With this orange device, this manifests in the form of Uber and DoorDash. The Rabbit R1 can supposedly hail a rideshare and order food for you, but in my experience, it falls short.</p><h3><strong>DoorDash and Uber errors</strong></h3><p>Rabbit R1 lets you connect your DoorDash and Uber accounts via the Rabbit Hole, but unfortunately, I wasn't able to order food nor hop into an Uber with the AI pocket companion. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

      <description><![CDATA[An ad non-profit is shutting down after a lawsuit from X but there will likely be consequences for Elon Musk's social media company.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03DRaJ4WDRXOwGJeRzsjm4X/hero-image.jpg" alt="X logo behind broken glass"><p>Just earlier this week, Elon Musk's X <a href="https://mashable.com/article/elon-musk-x-twitter-linda-yaccarino-lawsuit-ad-boycott" target="_self"><u>announced</u></a> that it was suing the constituent members of an initiative known as the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM). </p><p>On Thursday, just days after X's federal antitrust lawsuit was filed, the organization behind GARM, the World Federation of Advertisers (WFA), announced that it was dissolving GARM.&nbsp;The WFA and several corporations were the suit's named defendants, not GARM itself.</p><p>X claimed in its lawsuit that WFA and a number of its major advertising members "conspired" to &ldquo;collectively withhold billions of dollars in advertising revenue&rdquo;</p><p>After the news was announced, X CEO Linda Yaccarino took to X to celebrate GARM's end. However, at least one adtech watchdog is claiming that this might actually backfire for X.</p><h2><strong>GARM shuts down</strong></h2><p>According to a letter from the WFA that was sent to its members, as first reported by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ad-group-to-suspend-garm-initiative-following-elon-musk-lawsuit-2024-8" target="_blank"><u>Business Insider</u></a>, the group was "discontinuing" GARM as a result of X's lawsuit as the initiative was a non-profit with limited resources. The GARM initiative, which helped members avoid advertising on harmful websites, was staffed by only two full-time employees.</p><p>However, the WFA will continue on and challenge X's lawsuit, saying they committed no wrongdoing.</p><p>The Republican-led House Judiciary Committee, whose report was used by X in its lawsuit, <a href="https://x.com/JudiciaryGOP/status/1821587859700424933" target="_blank"><u>deemed</u></a> GARM's closure a "big win for the first amendment."</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <a class="text-gray-600" href="https://twitter.com/lindayaX/status/1821594759187853395" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(opens in a new window)">

</blockquote>
<p>X CEO Linda Yaccarino quoted the House Judiciary Committee post in her own reply.</p><p>"No small group should be able to monopolize what gets monetized," Yaccarino said. "This is an important acknowledgement and a necessary step in the right direction. I am hopeful that it means ecosystem-wide reform is coming."</p><p>Mashable reached out to X for comment. In a reply, X emailed a link to Linda Yaccarino's statement above.</p><h2><strong>Not so fast, X</strong></h2><p>However, Check My Ads, an adtech watchdog that has successfully taken on hateful websites and ad platforms that serve advertising on them, says that X's celebration is premature.</p><p>"Advertisers know a bad ad placement when they see one," said Claire Atkin, co-founder of Check My Ads, in a statement provided to Mashable. "The reality is today&rsquo;s decision means even more advertisers will flee X, and quickly so they&rsquo;re not targeted in the future."&nbsp;</p><p>In an <a href="https://checkmyads.org/elon-musk-garm-lawsuit/" target="_blank"><u>analysis</u></a> of GARM's closure on its own website, Check My Ads' founders say that the more likely outcome is that advertisers will now be less likely to advertise on X as they won't base advertising decisions on GARM's recommendation. Check My Ads points out that X was just <a href="https://x.com/XBusiness/status/1807812681803452741" target="_blank"><u>touting</u></a> how it was reinstated into GARM just last month. </p><p>X posted that the reinstatement was part of its "deep commitment to brand safety."</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <a class="text-gray-600" href="https://twitter.com/XBusiness/status/1807812681803452741" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(opens in a new window)">

    </a>
</blockquote>
<p>So to recap, X had just regained GARM as an ally, and then it filed a lawsuit, apparently causing its ally to disband, leaving &mdash; assuming it really was a monopoly &mdash; no comparable initiative in existence to recommend that advertisers make deals with X.</p><p>"Everyone can see that advertising on X is a treacherous business relationship for advertisers," Atkin's said in Check My Ads' statement to Mashable. "And we know, based on public reporting, X doesn&rsquo;t have all that many to lose."</p>]]></content:encoded>

But theory and practice are two different things, and when it comes to the latter, <em>Borderlands</em> is an adaptation that's equal parts miserable and unnecessary.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Our journey begins with the generic, straight-man soldier Roland (Hart)<strong> </strong>joining forces with the unstable juggernaut Krieg (Florian Munteanu, a German boxer who I just learned also goes by "Big Nasty") to rescue a very special young woman named Tina (<a href="https://mashable.com/article/barbie-movie-review" target="_self"><em><u>Barbie</u></em></a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/barbie-movie-review" target="_self"><u>'s</u></a> Ariana Greenblatt) from a prison cell on an exploding space station. The trio makes their way down to the rough desert planet of Pandora, known for its lawless wastes full of would-be treasure hunters searching for a rumored ancient alien vault that has a special connection to Tina.</p><p>It turns out that Tina is the daughter of the villainous corporate overlord Atlas (&Eacute;dgar Ram&iacute;rez), whose elite Crimson Lance paramilitary squad previously employed Roland. Atlas employs the merciless bounty hunter Lilith (Blanchett) to track down Tina and bring her back into his clutches. But maybe 15 minutes of screen time later, Lilith teams up with Roland, Krieg, and Tina to find the vault, hoping to use what is inside to stop Atlas' plan for dominance.</p><p>Oh, and Jack Black is here lending his voice as <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mashable/video/7398163019441737003?lang=en" target="_blank">Claptrap</a>, the "lovable" robot who more or less acts as the franchise's mascot.

<p>Narratively speaking, <em>Borderlands</em> is a bit of an odd amalgamation of the first two games. Roland and Lilith hail from the first game, while Krieg and Tina debuted in its sequel. Atlas is an original character for the film who sort of fills the same "evil murder CEO" role as Handsome Jack from <em>Borderlands 2</em>, but with all the charisma of a guy hosting an airline safety video. I'd estimate that he's on screen for a total of 10 minutes, at most.</p><p>The measly bits of plot and character development that do exist in <em>Borderlands</em> are only in service of justifying aggravating, banter-filled exchanges in between action sequences. In this respect, <em>Borderlands</em> is accurate to the source material; the big joke among every gamer I know is that you should play the games with the dialogue muted.&nbsp;</p><p>Its mercifully short 102-minute runtime somehow puts <em>Borderlands</em> at a disadvantage, because absolutely nothing is given time to breathe. Nearly every joke consists of hastily farted-out one-liners that are shockingly easy to miss at times, though I would argue you're not really missing anything. One of the only gags that&rsquo;s given any time to shine is an uncomfortably long shot of Claptrap pooping bullets.</p><p>This is a movie that thinks "badonkadonk," a term that has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjIvu7e6Wq8" target="_blank"><u>been in the pop culture lexicon for at least 22 years</u></a>, is a really funny thing to say in 2024. According to <em>Borderlands</em>, the most hilarious and twisted thing in the world is a teenage girl who uses curse words and shoots people with guns. That was kind of funny when I was 14 and <a href="https://mashable.com/video/whats-the-difference-kick-ass" target="_self"><em>Kick-Ass</em></a> was in theaters, but not anymore.</p><p>I can tell you that I chuckled precisely once during the entire film, when the nearly mute Krieg belts out a spirited "THANK YOU!" after being called handsome. It's one of the only lines delivered with sincere enthusiasm, and I appreciated that.</p><p><em>Borderlands</em> suffers, above all else, from an extreme lack of silence. Every moment of it is jacked up to 11 without so much as a brief pause, almost as if Roth knew that letting audiences think for a second or two about what they just heard might prompt them to get up and do anything else with their lives. By the end, I badly wished everyone would just shut the hell up.</p><h2><strong>I didn't know Cate Blanchett could be bad.</strong></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>It's not easy for any actor to save a script that might qualify as a war crime, but nobody in <em>Borderlands</em> is trying that hard to do so. Hart is strangely cast as a comedy straight man, only rarely doing the exuberant, exasperated fast-talking that has long been his signature. Curtis, to her credit, brings enjoyable quirky aunt vibes as the crew's archaeologist Tannis, but her character is such an afterthought that it doesn't really matter.</p><p>Black's high-pitched wailing as Claptrap is at least faithful to the games, if not very fun to listen to. Munteanu doesn't have to do much other than be burly and occasionally grunt out monosyllabic words as Krieg, who is honestly my favorite character <em>because</em> he barely talks.</p><p>Blanchett's turn as Lilith deserves special mention here, though, because it's the first time I've ever seen her phone in such a terrible performance. She probably has the most dialogue in the movie, and almost none of it is delivered in a convincing manner. Acting is more than just line delivery, of course, but all of her reads are so wooden and stilted that it's genuinely distracting from the start. </p><p>I get it. If I were an accomplished thespian, I wouldn't feel excited about this material either. It doesn't make for a great viewing experience though. While this doesn&rsquo;t necessarily impact their performances, I'll also point out that Blanchett, Hart, and especially Curtis are all <em>substantially</em> older than the characters they're playing are in the games. Everyone feels out of place.</p><p>The moment when I realized what I was in for was when <em>Borderlands</em> made it clear that Greenblatt's Tiny Tina is the most important character in the story. If you don&rsquo;t know, Tiny Tina is famously one of the most obnoxious characters in video game history. Her whole schtick in the games is "little girl who loves explosives and speaks in AAVE," and that's kept largely intact here.</p><p>To be fair, it isn't really Greenblatt's fault that Tiny Tina is as exasperating as she is. The material demands that she be really brash and abrasive, while also delivering lines that would make Shakespeare regret his contributions to this English language.

<p>The <em>Borderlands</em> games are primarily about shooting guns, so naturally, the <em>Borderlands</em> movie has a bunch of action sequences in it. None of them are the slightest bit novel or interesting. Not one.</p><p>Maddeningly, the film is rated PG-13 despite the games very much warranting an R rating. This means any opportunities for the kinds of fun, nonsensical violence you see in the games are neutered before they can even begin. Every gunfight consists of shots of our heroes trying to look cool while shooting guns, interspersed with shots of literally faceless and nameless bandits just sorta bloodlessly falling over.</p><p>There's no physicality or kineticism to these scenes, as you might see in a competent action movie like <a href="https://mashable.com/article/john-wick-chapter-4-review" target="_self"><em><u>John Wick</u></em></a>. The movie's few pathetic attempts at interesting fight choreography are obscured by poor lighting or frantic cuts. There is one single moment where it seems like Lilith might kill a bad guy in the way that would get people to jump out of their seats in a better movie, but you can't actually see it because it's in the middle of a flashing strobe light sequence, for no apparent reason.</p><p>Possibly the most confusing decision Roth made was completely leaving out the <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/weirdest-weapons-borderlands-series/" target="_blank"><u>weird guns</u></a> that permeate the <em>Borderlands</em> games. One of the big selling points from the first game onward was that you can find guns that turn into throwable grenades when they run out of ammo, or release a human scream when you fire, or coat enemies in acid, or a million other fun variables. Some of the guns in the film <em>look</em> unusual, but they all just fire regular bullets. Come on!</p><p><em>Borderlands</em>' greatest sin as an action movie might be the fact that its setting is extremely reminiscent of <em>Mad Max</em>, and its late-summer release is just a couple of months after the tremendous <a href="https://mashable.com/article/furiosa-a-mad-max-saga-review" target="_self"><em><u>Furiosa</u></em></a>'s Cannes premiere. Tossing aside the fact that <em>Furiosa</em> is a prodigious and elegiac meditation on actual themes, it's also a highly accomplished car chase movie that was directed with a deft hand by genre master George Miller.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Eli Roth is not George Miller, and <em>Borderlands</em> is not <em>Furiosa</em>. There's one major car chase scene in the first half of the film that is so embarrassing in comparison to <em>Furiosa</em> (or <em>Fury Road</em>, or any other <em>Mad Max</em> movie) that I would not have let it see the light of day were I Eli Roth. It's a mess of genuinely awful-looking CGI vomit, with green-screen shots so obviously fake that you could almost convince me they were a bit, if only they appeared in a more clever movie.&nbsp;</p><p>There's no sense of danger in these sequences. Plus, it&rsquo;s impossible to tell where any vehicles are in relation to other vehicles, and the whole thing ends with the heroes being covered in worm piss. In that moment, the audience can relate. </p><p>The lesson here is that if George Miller is about to release another masterpiece, maybe get your own crappy desert action movie well out of the way so nobody thinks to compare the two.</p><h2><strong>A <em>Borderlands </em>movie came 10 years too late.</strong></h2><p>While developer Gearbox has continued making <em>Borderlands</em> games over the last decade (with <a href="https://gamingbolt.com/borderlands-3-has-shipped-over-18-million-units-worldwide" target="_blank"><u>great financial success</u></a>), I and many of my gaming cohorts have long felt that its time to shine ended somewhere around 2014.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2009, the first game stood out because it melded role-playing mechanics with first-person shooting that felt good &mdash; something that hadn't really been done before at that scale. It also had a unique art style and a sense of humor, both of which went a long way in an era dominated by bland <em>Call of Duty</em> knock-offs. The 2012 sequel was more of the same, but the formula was still worthwhile, and I had a fun time with it. However, my sense of humor evolved well past the dated pop culture and internet meme references that plagued those games. And plenty of other RPG/shooter hybrids came out in the last decade that negated the uniqueness of <em>Borderlands</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>It's unbelievably vexing, then, that anyone decided to make <em>Borderlands</em> into a movie in the 2020s. Game adaptations always, by necessity, lose the kinds of player-driven interactivity that make video games, well, video games. Sometimes the game in question has enough going for it to cover for that, but <em>Borderlands</em> does not. It is a series that made sense at a specific point in time entirely due to the circumstances surrounding it.&nbsp;</p><p>When you remove the fun co-op gunplay and build the whole thing out of irritating jokes, you get one of the worst movies I've seen in years. Congratulations to all involved for somehow making a movie that feels way too much like <em>Borderlands</em> without being very much like <em>Borderlands</em> in any of the ways that matter at all.</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/JdAGg?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Borderlands%20is%20now%20in%20theaters.&object_type=article&object_uuid=00Ks3ckVmZrlNT5Cb6jjxd7&short_url=JdAGg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><em>Borderlands </em>is now in theaters. </a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Called <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-spotlight" target="_blank">TikTok Spotlight</a>, the tool will aid entertainment studios in turning social media hype into streaming numbers and ticket sales. Whether it's a new release or newly discovered, the feature identifies brand-friendly TikToks and adds a link to the landing page of information about the movie or TV show. The hub will feature details about the show or movie, including the plot, cast, official accounts, and other creator content. TikTok Spotlight explicitly turns organic fandom into marketing material.</p><p>TikTok previously partnered with Warner Bros. Discovery to promote <a href="https://mashable.com/category/dune" target="_self"><em>Dune: Part Two</em></a> utilizing the same hub approach. </p><p>TikTok Spotlight will provide analytics to studios where they "can glean valuable insights into their fandoms, so they can know exactly what their fans want and how to most effectively activate around their title."</p><p>The new feature further entrenches TikTok in the ticketing game as users will be directed to both streaming platforms and to purchase movie tickets from TikTok Spotlight. The social media platform recently partnered with <a href="https://mashable.com/article/tiktok-eventbrite-ticket-partnership" target="_self">Eventbrite</a> to directly link tickets in videos.

Regardless of studies and reports showing <a href="https://mashable.com/article/x-twitter-ccdh-hate-speech-israel-gaza" target="_self"><u>misinformation</u></a> on his social media platform are running rampant, Musk has <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1616713669819371520" target="_blank"><u>repeatedly</u></a> claimed that X is the <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1731470010478887098" target="_blank"><u>best</u></a> online destination for <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1809251925306777944" target="_blank"><u>truth</u></a>.</p><p>On Thursday, Musk <a href="https://x.com/Josh_Self_/status/1821476378480365639" target="_blank"><u>seemingly fell</u></a> for a photoshopped fake news headline from a far-right user on X &mdash; and shared it with his more than 293 million followers.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<h2><strong>Musk's tweet-and-delete post</strong></h2><p>"Detainment camps&hellip;" Musk posted alongside a quoted post from X user Ashlea Simon, who posted a fake image that was created to look like a headline from <em>The</em> <em>Daily Telegraph</em>'s website. The fake headline read "Keir Starmer considering building 'emergency detainment camps' on the Falkland Islands."&nbsp;</p><p>Simon is one of the leaders of the far-right UK party known as Britain First. The fake headline was referencing the far-right's anti-immigration riots that have been unfolding throughout the UK and appeared to claim that the UK Prime Minister and Labor Party leader was building "detainment camps" to hold the arrested rioters.</p><p>Musk appeared to have deleted his post roughly 30 minutes after publishing it. It received more than two million impressions on the platform before Musk removed it. Musk has yet to acknowledge its deletion or issue a correction for his followers who were deceived by the fake news.</p><p>As previously mentioned, Musk has pushed hard for X to be seen as a news media application &mdash; not just a social media platform. However, Musk and X have repeatedly posted fake news. In fact, at times, the platform itself has created fake news.&nbsp;</p><p>Earlier this year, the platform's own AI chatbot Grok <a href="https://mashable.com/article/elon-musk-x-twitter-ai-chatbot-grok-fake-news-trending-explore" target="_self"><u>created</u></a> a fake news story falsely claiming that Iran was striking Tel Aviv with missiles.

While the original poster of the video labeled the clip as a parody, Musk removed any reference to the video being a parody and shared it without any context to his hundreds of millions of followers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>So certain Apple Intelligence access could be bundled into the Apple One subscription as a higher subscription tier.

It would also be a way to offset the costs of AI investment, which isn't cheap. </p><p>The timing of this is uncertain. Even some of the Apple Intelligence features announced at this year's WWDC<a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-intelligence-siri-features-coming-2025" target="_self"> won't be available until next year</a>. That includes features related to Siri's AI revamp like understanding personal context and on-screen awareness. </p><p>However, there are some <a href="https://mashable.com/article/5-apple-intelligence-features-ios-18-1-developer-beta" target="_self">Apple Intelligence features you can try now</a> through the iOS 18.1 developer beta. Writing Tools, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ios-18-1-developer-beta-call-recording" target="_self">Call Recording</a>, and some new AI-powered Siri features are available to test out. And they're free &mdash; for now. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>We've tested a lot of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-headphones" target="_self">headphones</a>. Like a lot. So when we declare a pair of headphones to be the most comfortable, we mean it. When I tested the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones" target="_self">Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones</a>, I wasn't thrilled about the price, but I was enthralled with the all-day comfort. Now the headphones are back down to their Prime Day price, providing a sweet $80 discount.</p><p>Bose makes exceptional headphones &mdash; we're big fans of their <a href="https://mashable.com/review/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds" target="_self">QuietComfort Ultra</a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/review/bose-ultra-open-earbuds" target="_self">Ultra Open earbuds</a>, too. However, that quality means steep price tags. Normally, priced at $429, the Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones aren't cheap by any means.</p><p>Having <a href="https://mashable.com/review/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones" target="_self">tested</a> them myself, the price is worth it in some ways. The headphones deliver rich audio and active noise cancellation to block out the world around you. Three different listening modes &mdash; quiet, aware, and immersive &mdash; let you listen exactly how you want. But above all, these headphones are comfortable. Having worn them for 8 hours with glasses and earrings on, I was perfectly comfortable with no sore ears at the end of the day.</p><p>While I do think their comfort earns the price tag, spending over $400 on headphones hurts the wallet. Luckily, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/wenyA?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Bose%20QuietComfort%20Ultra%20headphones&object_type=article&object_uuid=01PlqR1TlUWA5iBBNfW2y0D&short_url=wenyA&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones</a> are back down to their Prime Day price of <a href="https://zdcs.link/wenyA?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=%24349%20on%20Amazon&object_type=article&object_uuid=01PlqR1TlUWA5iBBNfW2y0D&short_url=wenyA&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">$349 on Amazon</a>.

But for the aesthetically-minded among us, incorporating a <a href="https://mashable.com/category/tvs" target="_self">TV</a> into our home d&eacute;cor can be...a challenge. Samsung answered this dilemma with <a href="https://mashable.com/article/samsung-unboxed-2024-tv-lineup-pre-order" target="_self">The Frame TV</a>. The brand's line seamlessly turns TVs into works of art when turned off, plus, this spring, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/samsung-unboxed-2024-tv-lineup-pre-order" target="_self">Samsung launched a Frame speaker</a> that looks just another picture frame on your gallery wall.</p><p>Until this year, <a href="https://mashable.com/category/samsung" target="_self">Samsung</a> didn't have much competition since it launched The Frame in 2017. Back in 2022, Amazon embraced aesthetic multitasking with its line of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/amazon-qled-fire-tv-ambient-experience" target="_self">Omni Fire TVs</a>.

<h2>Meet the HiSense CanvasTV</h2><p>Launched in July 2024, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/mVRoJ?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Hisense%20CanvasTV&object_type=article&object_uuid=04X6ds7GviGe3Fpvzvku64u&short_url=mVRoJ&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Hisense CanvasTV</a> offers an immersive Art Mode. Right on par with The Frame, Art Mode on the CanvasTV shows a collection of pre-loaded artwork as well as personalized photographs when not in use. So rather than the boring black screen you're used to, the CanvasTV shows beautiful images of your choosing.</p><p>While the immersive Art Mode is the big draw of The Frame-style TVs, they're also really good at their main function. The CanvasTV is <a href="https://mashable.com/article/aug-6-tv-deals" target="_self">4K QLED</a> and features Hisense's Hi-Matte tech for anti-glare viewing. Plus, it's loaded with surround sound &mdash; no extra sound system needed. It's a Google TV as well, providing access to your favorite streaming apps.</p><p>It's available in both 55- and 65-inch models. The CanvasTV comes with a teak frame, with additional frames available for purchase. The best part of the Hisense CanvasTV is that it is significantly cheaper than Samsung's The Frame.

<h2>The latest competitor &mdash; the TCL NXTFRAME TV</h2><p>And just this week, TCL announced its NXTFRAME TV. Like The Frame and the CanvasTV, it's all about merging d&eacute;cor with the functionality of a TV. The NXTFRAME TV boasts an exceptionally thin design (apparently the thinnest TV ever), just 1.1-inch deep (1.2-inches on the 85-inch model). It mounts flush to the wall to blend into your gallery and comes with a curated Art Library. It also features a personal photo gallery mode and has AI Art capabilities, an interesting choice considering how <a href="https://mashable.com/article/etsy-ai-art-policy" target="_self">controversial AI art</a> has been.</p><p>TCL has also entered a licensing partnership with <a href="https://mashable.com/article/bang-and-olufsen-beosound-emerge" target="_self">Bang &amp; Olufsen</a>, giving NXTFRAME TV Pro models audio by Bang &amp; Olufsen. Like the other art TVs available, it's 4K QLED with a matte anti-glare screen. It comes in four sizes: 55-, 65-, 75-, and 85-inches. Like Samsung and Hisense's TVs, it comes with a swappable wooden frame.</p><p>The 55-inch and 65-inch NXTFRAME TVs are supposed to be available now but still listed as coming soon on <a href="https://zdcs.link/4AkgA?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=TCL%27s%20website&object_type=article&object_uuid=04X6ds7GviGe3Fpvzvku64u&short_url=4AkgA&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">TCL's website</a>. The 75- and 85-inch models are coming in September.

<p>If you're trying to drink more water, a nice tumbler can definitely help you reach that goal. But believe it or not, there's a world beyond <a href="https://mashable.com/article/tiktok-shop-is-tricking-you" target="_self">Stanley cups</a>. In fact, there are tons of great options to choose from out there. One in particular is Owala, which makes a variety of colorful cups and tumblers that come with versatile form factors, lids, and other useful features. Like Stanley cups, however, they can be a bit pricey. But that's where Owala's latest discount comes in. </p><p>As of August 8, <a href="https://zdcs.link/yLBrO?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=save%20up%20to%2020%25%20on%20select%20Owala%20tumblers&object_type=article&object_uuid=018uw7m4GHe9fYYopPjrGNr&short_url=yLBrO&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">save up to 20% on select Owala tumblers</a> as part of the Owala Back to School Sale. Visit the sale page to choose from discounted tumblers, though you won't see discounts applied until you add them to your cart. </p><p>You can choose from classics like the Owala 40oz Tumbler (which comes in several different colors), which is normally $37.99. It's discounted to just $30.40 as part of the sale. There's also the stainless steel 24oz version if you need something a little smaller. It's discounted to $22.40 from $27.99. </p><p>It's a great time to make sure you're staying hydrated, or if you need to get the kids something fun to encourage them to drink more water, too. And if bright colors help do that, well, more power to you. There are some pretty interesting color combinations still available now, too. The sale is on for a limited time, so snatch up your Owala tumblers while you still can. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"We wanted to make the final moment really special and say that in this final timeline, things have all come back to normal. All the other timelines don&rsquo;t exist and it&rsquo;s just a normal life," <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/the-umbrella-academy-season-4-easter-eggs-explained" target="_blank">series creator Steve Blackman told Netflix's Tudum blog</a>. "So we brought back in as many of the returning cast as we could."</p><p>But who was that guy? And why do I remember that face? We're here to help identify every familiar face in the final scene, <strong>and there's some spoilers in here so beware.</strong></p><h2>The family on the lawn </h2><p>Blowing bubbles and having tea parties on the lawn, Lila (Ritu Arya) and Diego's (David Casta&ntilde;eda) family have made it, including Lila's parents (Geet Arora and Shiva Safari), Uncle Inny (Sylvan Valladares), Aunt Banu (Gurbir Bal), Cousin Ronnie (Devanshu Narang), and their daughter Grace (Ciara Rose Feeney). They're joined by Allison's daughter Claire (Millie Davis). They were all put on a time-travelling subway train by Lila to ensure their safety before the Hargreeves made their final sacrifice &mdash; so, it worked.</p><h2>The three guys playing frisbee</h2><p>Remember the Swedes? The assassins from Season 2? They're not dead, nor will they be as they don't foolishly try to kill the Hargreeves siblings in the future! Triplets Otto (Jason Bryden), Axel (Kris Holden-Ried), and Oscar (Tom Sinclair) were assigned to kill the Umbrella Academy members by the Handler of the Temps Commission, and they all died instead. </p><div id="related-video" class="mx-auto mt-8 mb-12 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans md:mt-12 md:mb-16 text-primary-400">

<h2>The two people walking their bikes</h2><p>That's Griddy's Doughnuts owner Agnes Rofa (Sheila McCarthy) and time-travelling assassin Hazel (Cameron Britton) who fell in love in Season 1.</p><h2>The lady pushing the pram</h2><p>No longer a Kugelblitz worshipping android, the Hargreeves' robot mother Grace (Jordan Claire Robbins) pushes a pram holding a baby presumably without powers.</p><h2>The jogger</h2><p>Stopping to stretch, that jogger is The Handler (Kate Walsh), Lila's adoptive mother and a big cheese at the Temps Commission in Season 2. She's the main villain in that season, so it's nice to see her more centred.</p><h2>The sketcher</h2><p>That's none other that <em>The Umbrella Academy</em>'s comic book co-creator, illustrator by Gabriel B&aacute;. "I hope people scream a little if they catch me there because it was fun for me," <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/the-umbrella-academy-season-4-easter-eggs-explained" target="_blank">B&aacute; told Tudum</a>. </p><h2>The backgammon players</h2><p>Being sketched by B&aacute; is Herb (Ken Hall) and Dot (Patrice Goodman) from the Temps Commission.

<p>High profile items are the name of the game with <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-buy-drops" target="_self">Best Buy Drops</a>, and there's no higher profile TV than Samsung's The Frame. The gigantic <a href="https://zdcs.link/AdG14?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=85-inch%20version%20of%20The%20Frame&object_type=article&object_uuid=04ypsUbYE3U6fCSV01nS8d1&short_url=AdG14&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">85-inch version of The Frame</a> is the Best Buy Drop of the day for August 8, where you can snag it for $1,499.99 &mdash; a jaw-dropping $2,300 price cut that's way more intense than what we expected.</p><p>The fine print is that you'll only get access to that price if you click on it through the Drops tab in the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Lbo70?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Best%20Buy%20mobile%20app&object_type=article&object_uuid=04ypsUbYE3U6fCSV01nS8d1&short_url=Lbo70&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Best Buy mobile app</a>, which is the only version of Best Buy where Drops exists. Once you find the TV in Drops, be sure to peek at the status bar showing how many items are left &mdash;&nbsp;Drops items are released in limited quantities, so when they're gone, they're gone. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>To be clear, the model featured as the Drop is the 2022 version of The Frame. <a href="https://zdcs.link/6XVe7?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Several%20sizes&object_type=article&object_uuid=04ypsUbYE3U6fCSV01nS8d1&short_url=6XVe7&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Several sizes </a>of the 2024 version are also on sale at Best Buy, but obviously, aren't nearly as heavily discounted. For reference, you could almost buy three 2022 85-inch Frames at this price before hitting the $4,299.99 price tag of the <a href="https://zdcs.link/6XVvY?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=2024%2085-inch%20Frame&object_type=article&object_uuid=04ypsUbYE3U6fCSV01nS8d1&short_url=6XVvY&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">2024 85-inch Frame</a>.</p><p>Of the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/aug-6-tv-deals" target="_self">good TV deals</a> popping up in early August, The Frame is definitely one of our favorites. If you clicked on this story, you probably already know why The Frame has such name recognition. If not, let's quickly unpack the overarching question asked by Google users when "the frame" is searched: What does Samsung's The Frame actually do?</p><p>When it's on and being watched, The Frame is just a solid QLED TV: It has stellar peak brightness and punchy quantum dot-fueled colors that make it great for watching sports in bright rooms. (This Drop happens to be right before football season gets into full swing. Coincidence? Doubt it.) The matte screen does quite well with reflection handling as well, though the whole "matte" thing comes way more into play when the TV's not being watched.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

        </a>
    </div>
<p>When it's off and just chilling on your wall, The Frame uses ambient light sensors to dim itself and sort of melt into the wall. The non-shiny screen can display the fine art of your choice, photos of loved ones you've uploaded, or photos you've uploaded of the wall around the TV to mimic the design and fully blend in. The concept is seriously cool for folks who aren't psyched on the idea of this giant hunk of technology cramping the style of their carefully-curated accent wall.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>Streaming shows and movies has become a way of life for most of us.

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p>Kitchen appliances have come a long way in the last decade.

It's currently on sale for just $49.99, a $10 discount off its typical price of $59.99.</p><p>One of the coolest aspects of the Ninja Blast is its portability with a rechargeable power base, meaning you can take it with you anywhere.

<p>Looking to <a href="https://mashable.com/travel" target="_self">travel</a> the world on your own for a bit? There's nothing wrong with hopping into a plane and flying solo. In fact, companies like Priceline are encouraging you to get out there and take that trip you've been thinking about with deals like the Solo Explorer Sale, which discounts a variety of flights to destinations as well as hotels to exotic locales around the world. It's time to rip off that solo travel Band-Aid and do the thing with the savings you can take advantage of. </p><p>As of August 8, you can save up to 40% off when you book select flight and hotel packages during the <a href="https://zdcs.link/3dgDM?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Priceline%20Solo%20Explorer%20Sale&object_type=article&object_uuid=003FLWh6FzQYlplJIXAKXyy&short_url=3dgDM&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Priceline Solo Explorer Sale</a>. Choose from locations like Kyoto, Sedona, Kauai, and other locales, and you'll be given a sample itinerary of your visit. Then book your flight with one of the package deals offered through the Solo Explorer Sale landing page and you'll receive your booking discount. You must book before August 11 to take advantage of the sale. </p><p>This is a great option if you've been bitten by the travel bug, but aren't quite sure where to go. Or if you've been wanting to go globetrotting, but haven't yet found anyone who wants to go with you. You can take care of two birds here and snatch a more affordable trip with hotel included, plus you get to do things on your own terms. And the best part is, you can have your entire vacation planned out for you. Just be sure and book soon, because you only have a few days left to make a decision. No pressure, it's just the trip of a lifetime, right?</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It's a perfect nod to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6Q3mHyzn78" target="_blank">1987 synthpop cover by Tiffany</a> that won hearts in Season 1. If you'll cast your memory back to 2019, when we first met the Hargreeves in the series, there's a moment in the first episode when the siblings need a timeout. </p><p>Luther (Tom Hopper), the leader of the bunch, decides to play the song in his room loud enough for the rest of the Hargreeves manor to hear, and Diego (David Casta&ntilde;eda), Allison (Emmy Raver-Lampman), Klaus (Robert Sheehan), and Viktor (Elliot Page) all can't resist the temptation to dance. The scene cuts between the siblings, eventually panning out to reveal the whole house throwing down a move, unbeknownst to each other.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

<p>It's the dance scene that would ensure an Umbrella Academy dance scene every season, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-umbrella-academy-dance-scene-cher-nick-offerman-megan-mullally" target="_self">including Season 4.</a> Viktor, Klaus, and Alison muck around to Sam Cooke's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/netflixgeeked/videos/1132006803953229/" target="_blank">"Twistin' The Night Away"</a> in Season 2, and the season-opening <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2lpV4uopr4" target="_blank">"Footloose"</a> dance-off from Season 3 is a series highlight.</p><div id="related-video" class="mx-auto mt-8 mb-12 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans md:mt-12 md:mb-16 text-primary-400">

<p>The Season 1 "I Think We're Alone Now" moment proved such a hit with fans the cast recreated the scene during lockdown &mdash; including Number Five (Aidan Gallagher) and Ben (Justin H.

<p>So, to finish the entire series with the song that started it all? 11/10. Yes, there's a different song for Season 4's end credits (Talking Heads' "This Must Be The Place"), but this is the real finisher. Crank it up.</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/pgL1g?pageview_type=RSS&amp%3B%3B%3Btemplate=video&amp%3B%3B%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3B%3B%3Belement=offer&amp%3B%3B%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3B%3B%3Belement_label=The%20Umbrella%20Academy%20Season%204%20premieres%20Aug.%208%20on%20Netflix.&amp%3B%3B%3Bobject_type=video&amp%3B%3B%3Bobject_uuid=04M9N6UY2pZKevVehuJfPjO&amp%3B%3B%3Bshort_url=pgL1g&amp%3B%3B%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Fvideo%2Fumbrella-academy-season-4-teaser-trailer-netflix&amp%3B%3Btemplate=article&amp%3B%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3B%3Belement=offer&amp%3B%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3B%3Belement_label=The%20Umbrella%20Academy%20Season%204%20is%20streaming%20on%20Netflix%20from%20Aug.%208.&amp%3B%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3B%3Bobject_uuid=02wrVcIjg8vFCBK53k68I0z&amp%3B%3Bshort_url=pgL1g&amp%3B%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Fthe-umbrella-academy-season-4-review&amp%3Btemplate=article&amp%3Bmodule=content_body&amp%3Belement=offer&amp%3Bitem=text-link&amp%3Belement_label=The%20Umbrella%20Academy%20Season%204%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Netflix.&amp%3Bobject_type=article&amp%3Bobject_uuid=03FyjHdItsexptTk1RUMuMW&amp%3Bshort_url=pgL1g&amp%3Bu=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Fumbrella-academy-ending-explained&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=The%20Umbrella%20Academy%20Season%204%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Netflix.&object_type=article&object_uuid=0151lQ1kC2SVi7qEDlh9r18&short_url=pgL1g&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><em>The Umbrella Academy</em> Season 4 is now streaming on Netflix.</a> </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a sequence that involves a daring rescue, the show needs a legitimate reason why Gene and Jean aren't surveilling their kidnapping victim for three minutes or so. And because we've spent the last few episodes watching this dynamic duo team up for everything from Euchre tournaments to casual carpark murder, it's not out of character to have them practicing a little somethin' somethin' for their own amusement: a dance routine.</p><p>During the rescue sequence, the camera alternates between henchmen getting brutally owned and Gene and Jean absolutely tearing up their home's floorboards with sweet moves. Their chosen tune, Cher's "Gypsies, Tramps and Thieves," could only be an old favourite of this conspiracy theory loving pair, who perhaps listen less to the lyrics about teen pregnancy and sex work, and concentrate more on that sick beat.</p><div id="related-video" class="mx-auto mt-8 mb-12 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans md:mt-12 md:mb-16 text-primary-400">

This is to ensure the apocalyptic event known as "The Cleanse" happens. In the finale, that call comes in the form of a broadcast of Muse's "Map of the Problematique", which snaps the organisation's followers into armed mob-like ranks. The Keepers converge on the dilapidated department store where kindred apocalyptic spirits and lovers Ben and Jennifer (Victoria Sawal) are holed up having been taken over by The Cleanse, actually an oozing virus that threatens to envelop them and subsequently the world. </p><div id="related-video" class="mx-auto mt-8 mb-12 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans md:mt-12 md:mb-16 text-primary-400">

<p>During the battle with The Ben/Jen Cleanse, Lila makes it clear to Five "it's over." So, he returns to the subway solo, to live out his days presumably either travelling mindlessly or to return to the strawberry-filled greenhouse he and Lila spent their happiest days in. But glimpsing another Five on the platform, he finds his way to a subterranean diner called Max's Delicatessen, filled with alternate versions of Five from different timelines, all of whom have ended up in the delicatessen trying to solve the problem like Five is right now.</p><p>In a conversation over pastrami sandwiches and coffee with himself, Five realises that there's only supposed to be one timeline after all, and that the only thing that shattered the original timeline was...the Umbrella Academy itself.</p><h2>The Umbrella Academy broke the original timeline (guyyyys!)</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Yup, the Hargreeves siblings, who have both caused the end of the world and saved it multiple times over four seasons, broke the original timeline by being born. Five finds out from himself that their births &mdash; remember, when 43 women around the world simultaneously gave birth on Oct. 1, 1989 &mdash; started an infinite loop of them trying to save the world while being the cause of its destruction.</p><p>"The family is the problem. We're doomed to save or destroy the world over and over again, ad infinitum," Five realises gazing around at all the deli's photos of apocalypses past.</p><q>
    "The family is the problem. We're doomed to save or destroy the world over and over again, ad infinitum."
    </q>
<p>Five takes this knowledge to his siblings, who have converged on the original Hargreeves manor, and he goes multiverse-explainer on them all.</p><p>"We are the reason that this is happening," says Five. "The marigold that infected our mothers, bringing forth our births, had an unexpected side effect. It shattered the timeline, and it broke it in to an infinite number of alternate timelines. The timelines are bleeding into each other."</p><p>Five explains that's how The Keepers were able to find the artefacts (Umbrella Academy merchandise, news clippings, paraphernalia from the first three seasons) which led them to realise there were multiple timelines and start their cult &mdash; again, they were...right?</p><p>"So we need to go back to the original timeline before any of the other ones were created," Five explains. How? The Umbrella Academy needs to let the marigold in their bodies merge with the durango in The Jen/Ben Cleanse monster. </p><h2>Wait, what the hell is the marigold and the durango?</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>That glowing substance Ben spiked everyone's drink at the teppanyaki restaurant with in episodes 1 and 2? The stuff that gave them back their talents? That's marigold, a particle that gives the Hargreeves their powers in the first place. All the women who gave birth to the Hargreeves siblings were infected with it, then passed it to their instant babies. Durango is another particle, one that lives inside Jennifer, and the physical reaction between Ben's marigold and Jen's durango created the monster that is "The Cleanse."</p><p>SO, to undo The Cleanse, save the world and stop the extinction of humanity, the Hargreeves make a decision &mdash; they need to cancel out the monster by letting their marigold merge with the durango inside it. "They should cancel each other out," is the idea. But it will erase them too.</p><h2>Why do the Umbrella Academy know their sacrifice will save their loved ones?</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>By sacrificing themselves to The Cleanse, the Hargreeves cease to exist at all. In fact, they never did &mdash; everything we just watched, done. Gone.

Alison genuinely saying "I'm sorry you left Canada for this," to Viktor gets an 11/10 from me.</p><p>"Fuck you" are literally the last words anyone says to each other.

<h2><strong>Samsung's 'Apple clones'</strong></h2><p>Samsung was hit with a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-buds-3-apple-clones-unpacked-2024" target="_self">wave of criticism</a> last month following its big annual Galaxy Unpacked event. Alongside its newest smartphones, the consumer electronics giant also announced two new products: the Galaxy Watch Ultra smartwatch and its new line of earbuds, the Galaxy Buds 3 series.</p><p>However, the celebratory Galaxy Unpacked event quickly turned negative online as smartphone reviewers, tech commentators, and even Samsung fans noted the uninspired Apple-like designs of the smartwatch and earbuds.</p><p>"Today was a huge L for Samsung," <a href="https://x.com/SnazzyLabs/status/1811061102072967177" target="_blank"><u>said</u></a> Quinn Nelson of Snazzy Labs, a popular tech review channel on YouTube. "Watch Ultra is the most shameless copy of an Apple product in ages &mdash; and it&rsquo;s hideous."</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>"To see Samsung just release a bunch of Apple clones is disheartening," Apple Insider's Andrew O'Hara <a href="https://x.com/Andrew_OSU/status/1811073617481937332" target="_blank"><u>said</u></a> following the event. "It&rsquo;s boring and a massive fail compared to where Samsung used to be."</p><p>According to the Ajunews report, these criticisms were even heard among reporters who attended a media briefing held at the company's flagship Samsung Store in Seoul. Reporters that attended "constantly talked about Samsung's new devices looking exactly the same as Apple's" according to the report.</p><p>Recently published reviews of Samsung's newest products also can't help but mention the Apple-like design.</p><p>"Samsung built an Apple Watch Ultra of its own" reads the headline of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-02/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review-an-apple-watch-ultra-for-android" target="_blank"><em><u>Bloomberg</u></em></a>'s review.&nbsp;</p><p>The Verge went with "If you can&rsquo;t beat &rsquo;em, join &rsquo;em" for its own Galaxy Watch Ultra <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24210505/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review-smartwatch-wearables" target="_blank">review,</a> while noting how "disappointing" it was to see Samsung copy Apple in this way.</p><p>It's very likely that the next iteration of Samsung's Galaxy Ultra&nbsp; smartwatch and wireless earbuds will look very different from the Apple clones that are out now. But, until then, Samsung is stuck with hearing the accusations that they copied one of their biggest competitors.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The first round of filming of the reality show<em> </em>took place at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas where close to 2,000 participants gathered to compete for a grand prize of $5 million. Contestants ate, slept, and generally lived in the stadium during filming and had to give up their food, clothes, and &mdash; oddly &mdash; medication to staff.</p><p>Meals were described as tiny, with staff serving cold oatmeal, raw veggies, and a hard-boiled egg to participants. The only other type of food contestants were given was MrBeast-branded Feastable chocolate bars. Medicine that was handed over to staff was hard to get back promptly, with one participant claiming to have gone days without needed insulin. When another contestant told staff they needed to eat with their medication, they claimed that staff members were dismissive and reluctantly gave them "half a banana."</p><p>Several of the complaints given to the <em>New York Times</em> included sleep deprivation due to having to film at night, and having to sleep on the turf of the sun-soaked Las Vegas stadium during the day. Women who competed during the event also alleged sexism that caused some not to get underwear while menstruating because menstruation was said to be "not a medical emergency." </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>It was made clear during the report that anonymous contestants felt that the production team was not adequately prepared for the number of participants included in the event. In fact, from the start, several felt misled as many were told the initial number of contestants would be near 1,000. But according to an introductory video by Donaldson, the YouTube star claimed to have always intended to have 2,000 and then cut it down to half for the actual show.</p><p>"The MrBeast promotional video shoot, which included over 2,000 participants, was unfortunately complicated by the CrowdStrike incident, extreme weather, and other unexpected logistical and communications issues, which we are currently reviewing," said a MrBeast representative to the <em>New York Times</em>. "But we are grateful that virtually all of those invited to Toronto for our next production have enthusiastically accepted our invitation."</p><p>Mashable reached out to representatives for MrBeast and will update if we hear back.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>According to the Trend Micro report, scammers are tricking page owners into handing over their login credentials through basic phishing campaigns. Once the scammers have access to an already established account, they rebrand the Facebook Page as an AI photo editing tool. In the case analyzed by Trend Micro, the scammers posed as Evoto, a real AI photo editing tool.</p><p>After rebranding the stolen pages as Evoto, the scammers then began running paid Facebook ads through those pages, sending users to a fake website where users could supposedly download the AI photo editing tool. Of course, the target isn't downloading AI software. In this case, the unaware victim is downloading endpoint management software which gives the attacker remote access to their device. From there, the hacker can steal the user's login credentials as well as other sensitive data.</p><p>Social media users should proceed with caution when it comes to any unknown downloadable software being promoted via advertisements on a platform. They could very well be malware in disguise.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>However, along with the end of the longest running U.S. gaming print magazine, another aspect of <em>Game Informer</em> that won't live on is the video game publication's entire digital archive. The <a href="http://GameInformer.com" target="_blank">GameInformer.com</a> domain name now forwards to a landing page which only displays the shut down announcement. All of the Game Informer website's internal links now also forward to the same page meaning previously published news articles, reviews, and other content can no longer be viewed.</p><h2><strong>Lost digital archives are becoming much too common</strong></h2><p>According to ex-<em>Game Informer</em> content director Kyle Hilliard, the magazine was <a href="https://x.com/KyleMHilliard/status/1819403288980132298" target="_blank"><u>more than halfway</u></a> done with its next issue when it received the news that its parent company was shutting it down.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>"Game Informer has been closed down by GameStop and the entire, incredibly talented staff (including myself) have all been laid off," Hilliard posted on X on Friday.</p><p>The sudden decision to kill off the gaming magazine, which GameStop acquired in 2000, clearly caught <em>Game Informer</em>'s employees off guard. As a result, employees likely did not have a chance to archive their own work before the company took the content on its website offline.</p><p>Unfortunately, the shutdown and removal of online archives is becoming all too common in the digital media industry as a whole, resulting in content being lost to time. Most recently, Paramount decided to <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/mtv-news-website-archives-pulled-offline-1236047163/" target="_blank"><u>take down the MTV News website</u></a> along with its digital archives more than a year after the news organization shut down. Reporters as well as fans of the organization lamented the loss of years of interviews and other MTV news-related content. And while the Internet Archive likely has a good amount of Game Informer's content archived, Internet Archive documents are typically incomplete snapshots of the originals, with altered formatting and missing elements.</p><p>GameStop has struggled in recent years to keep up with the change within the video game industry from physical to digital media. While the meme stock craze in 2021 helped keep it afloat, GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-informer-gamestop-meme-stock-gme-last-issue-1851611973" target="_blank"><u>recently called</u></a> for "extreme frugality" as its troubles continue.</p><p>Mashable reached out to GameStop for confirmation that the archive is gone, and to ask if there were plans to make it available at any point. We will update if we hear back.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Most Western-style knives typically feature edge angles of around 25 degrees, which provides a durable but relatively thicker cutting edge. In contrast, Seido <a href="https://zdcs.link/pgmW0?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Japanese%20knives%20are%20crafted%20with%20a%20more%20acute%2015-degree%20edge%20angle&object_type=article&object_uuid=03CTrt2LN1PbSVJSVFtlWjM&short_url=pgmW0&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Japanese knives are crafted with a more acute 15-degree edge angle</a>. This sharper angle results in a noticeably finer cutting face, allowing for precision slicing and cleaner cuts.

<p>Comets are enormous balls of <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/comets/" target="_blank"><u>ice, dust, and rock</u></a> that formed in the outer solar system, left over from the early days of planet formation about 4.6 billion years ago, according to <a href="https://mashable.com/category/nasa" target="_self"><u>NASA</u></a>. Their ice starts to disintegrate as they get closer to the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/sun-images-real-solar-telescope" target="_self"><u>sun</u></a>, converting instantly from a solid to a gas, skipping over the liquid phase. That process creates <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/solar-system/new-insights-on-comet-tails-are-blowing-in-the-solar-wind/" target="_blank"><u>their signature tails</u></a>, millions-of-miles-long trails of debris.</p><p>Hundreds of years ago, people considered comets bad omens. Today, scientists know these icy bodies as time capsules of the ancient solar system. Some astronomers believe comets brought water and organic compounds &mdash; aka <a href="https://asd.gsfc.nasa.gov/blueshift/index.php/2013/02/22/brians-blog-a-look-into-the-building-blocks-of-life/" target="_blank"><u>the building blocks of life</u></a> &mdash; to early Earth.</p><p>Along with their trails of dust, comets also drag <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/solar-system/new-insights-on-comet-tails-are-blowing-in-the-solar-wind/" target="_blank">plasma</a>, sometimes bluish in color, across the sky. The plasma tail, which looks a bit like Harry Potter's lightning bolt scar in Bartlett's photo, is composed of ionized gas molecules. These charged particles are easily influenced by changes in the sun's activity, said Henry Hsieh, a Planetary Science Institute researcher.&nbsp;</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>He compares the solar wind to a river constantly flowing away from the sun.&nbsp;</p><p>"The ion tail is basically caught up in that river," Hsieh told Mashable. "You see a straight tail most of the time, but then every so often, you'll have this bit of a hiccup in the sun &mdash; these coronal mass ejection events &mdash; where it'll just kind of send a particularly large or denser bunch of material outward."</p><p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/solar-eruption-space-radiation-danger" target="_self"><u>Coronal mass ejections</u></a>, or plasma spewed from the outer layer of the sun's atmosphere, involve enormous solar explosions. Through a solar telescope, the ejection looks like a fan of gas flying into space. NASA likens these ejections to cannonballs hurtling in a single direction, only affecting a targeted area.&nbsp;</p><p>"If this hits the comet, then it will cause a disruption to this nice flowing river," Hsieh said, "like a rock suddenly came loose, and the flow of the river suddenly got a little bit faster, but momentarily."</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Right now the sun is near the height of its activity in the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/solar-eclipse-2024-guide-for-path-map-glasses-times" target="_self">11-year solar cycle</a>, so its magnetic field is more chaotic. As the comet experiences these changes traveling through the inner solar system, the tail keeps trying to realign, resulting in these kinks and bends, said Tony Farnham, an astronomer at the University of Maryland.</p><p>"There are even occasions when the comet passes through a region where the magnetic field completely changes direction (called a sector boundary)," Farnham wrote in an email, "and the plasma tail will 'disconnect' from the comet, to be followed by the formation of a new tail over the next few days."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The comet, officially dubbed 13P / Olbers, is named after German astronomer <a href="https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/journey-to-the-stars/educator-resources/stars/olbers-paradox" target="_blank">Heinrich Olbers</a>, who first observed it in 1815. The comet was last seen from Earth in 1956.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Comet Olbers' closest approach to the sun was on June 30, but it's now on its way back toward the so-called <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/oort-cloud/facts/" target="_blank"><u>Oort Cloud</u></a> on the outer edge of the solar system. Though the weirdly distorted tail is probably just the result of a lively comet reacting to the sun's wild behavior, little is known about this particular visitor to rule out something else inherently unusual about it.&nbsp;</p><p>This is essentially the first opportunity in contemporary times that astronomers have had to study the comet up close and during peak activity, Hsieh said. Astronomers will know more in the coming months as they complete their analyses. </p><p>"All comets are kind of like different beasts," he said. "They're all special, and that's what makes them fun to study."</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>There are indeed some well-managed cryogenic vaults holding tissue samples &mdash; such as the Ambrose Monell Cryo Collection at the American Museum of Natural History. "Nevertheless, all these biorepositories require intensive human management, electrical power, and an ongoing supply of liquid nitrogen, which makes them susceptible to unpredictable natural and geopolitical disasters," the researchers note. "Today, many frozen collections are stored in urban centers, making them even more susceptible to destabilization threats."</p><q>
    "Our goal is to cryopreserve most animal species on Earth."

<p>The moon, however, provides a solution. In the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nasa-moon-landing-sites-artemis-mission" target="_self">lunar south pole</a> &mdash; where <a href="https://mashable.com/category/nasa" target="_self">NASA</a> intends to establish a permanent presence &mdash; there are permanently shadowed regions that stay at or below -196 degrees Celsius (-320 degrees Fahrenheit), the temperatures needed to completely stop cellular and molecular activity. The biodiversity vault would require neither power nor constant oversight.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<h2><strong>Storing life on the moon</strong></h2><p>On Earth, there's a biorepository for seeds in Norway's <a href="https://mashable.com/feature/the-svalbard-global-seed-vault-photos" target="_self">Arctic Svalbard Global Seed Vault</a>. It naturally stays at some - 18 C (about 0 F). But such an endeavor on the moon, while able to naturally preserve animal cells, comes with a host of hurdles. </p><p>To achieve such a lunar vault, cryopreserved cells will first be tested in <a href="https://mashable.com/category/space" target="_self">space</a>. For example, they would collect a species like the starry goby, a species important in coral reef habitats, take samples from their fins, and store them in a biorepository on Earth. The cells and packaging would be tested in space-like environs before actually launching up to a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nasa-international-space-station-spacex-deorbit-vehicle" target="_self">space station</a>. Then the samples will return to Earth "for analysis of viability and changes to DNA."</p><p>But before truly journeying to a lunar vault, the researchers note these issues must be addressed:</p><p><strong>- Packaging: </strong>They'll need to develop "robust packaging" capable of withstanding <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nasa-voyager-mission-space-radiation" target="_self">extreme space environs</a>.</p><p><strong>- Radiation: </strong>The moon's surface has a significantly higher level of background radiation than Earth &mdash; and like Mars is susceptible to <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nasa-mars-rover-solar-storm" target="_self">solar storms</a>. Introducing "antioxidant cocktails" to protect cells during the freezing process can help, as would building physical barriers (thick layers of moon regolith, walls of water, etc.).</p><p><strong>- Temperature: </strong>Once on the lunar surface, transporting samples to the cryogenic vault will require rovers capable of maintaining cryogenic temperatures. That's because, in daylight, exposed parts of the moon can reach some 100 C (212 F).</p><p><strong>- Competition for resources: </strong>The vault would exist in the south pole's permanently shadowed regions, which is home to invaluable stores of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/who-owns-moon-resources-nasa-artemis" target="_self">lunar ice</a> (necessary for survival and likely the creation of rocket fuel). It may not be easy to utilize these areas for a repository, as such highly sought regions (that are also valued by different nations) "may be highly restricted and managed," the researchers said.</p><p><strong>- Microgravity: </strong>In space, tissue samples may change when exposed to near weightlessness, and this effect on cryopreserved cells needs more study.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The great decades-long payoff, however, is that, once stored, the samples wouldn't need power, and would have relatively little vulnerability to environmental and societal disruption. The first "class" of preserved animals would likely include endangered or threatened species, pollinators, culturally significant species, and others.</p><p>"Protecting <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-many-species-live-on-earth" target="_self">Earth's life</a> must be a top priority in the rush on the moon sites for industries and many types of science," the scientists conclude.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The game is all about finding the "common threads between words." And just like <em>Wordle</em>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-20-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> resets after midnight and each new set of words gets trickier and trickier&mdash;so we've served up some hints and tips to get you over the hurdle.</p><p>If you just want to be told today's puzzle, you can jump to the end of this article for August 3's <em>Connections</em> solution. But if you'd rather solve it yourself, keep reading for some clues, tips, and strategies to assist you.</p><h2>What is Connections?</h2><p>The <em>NYT</em>'s latest daily word game has become a social media hit. The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

    </a>
</blockquote>
<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple. Like <em>Wordle, </em>you can share the results with your friends on social media.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

It can be brutal.</p><p>On July 27, one of the largest and most dominant bears of Katmai National Park and Preserve's Brooks River attacked a cub, to the dread of web onlookers. The cub looked seriously injured, appeared to slightly improve over a couple of days, but the young animal's current status remains unknown. It's a moment that reveals the bears' natural world in its full, wild spectrum.</p><p>"We get to see their moments of joy," Mike Fitz, a former Katmai park ranger and currently a resident naturalist for the bear cam livestreamers <a href="http://explore.org" target="_blank">explore.org</a>, said in an online live chat. "However, the webcams are live, the footage is uncensored.

<p>These bears, living remote lives on the Alaskan Peninsula where visitors arrive aboard small floatplanes, are <a href="https://mashable.com/article/fat-bear-week-livestream-how" target="_self">beamed to the world</a> with the aid of radio transmitters. Katmai's bears have grown internet-famous in the park's annual <a href="https://mashable.com/article/what-is-fat-bear-week" target="_self">Fat Bear Week</a> contest, an event celebrating the success of these persevering animals in the harsh wilderness. They must devour salmon throughout the summer to build enough fat stores to outlast the long winter famine, when they <a href="https://mashable.com/article/why-bears-hibernate-fat-bear-week" target="_self">hibernate</a>. That's why a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/fat-bear-week-747-biggest-bear" target="_self">fat bear is a healthy bear</a>.</p><p>In July, bears congregate in the park's Brooks River to capitalize on these prodigious runs of salmon &mdash; bringing the often solitary <a href="https://x.com/exploreorg/status/1818698181385044022" target="_blank">animals in crowded, close proximity</a>. It's here where the attack occurred. </p><p>The well-known mother bear Grazer &mdash; who was last year's <a href="https://mashable.com/article/fat-bear-week-winner-2023" target="_self">Fat Bear Week champion</a> &mdash; was fishing atop a waterfall with her two spring cubs (meaning they were just born this year). This was a somewhat risky endeavor, because the current is strong. Soon enough, both young bears fell over the falls, and one passed near the large male bear 32, "Chunk," an animal in his prime whose dominance affords him the most productive fishing spots. For reasons unknown, Chunk went after and attacked the cub, as shown in the screenshot below. He clenched the small bear in his jaws.</p><p>But the drama didn't end there. Grazer sprinted to defend her cub. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Grazer is a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/fat-bear-week-dominant-bear-grazer" target="_self">particularly aggressive bear</a>, who has previously charged bears that came close to her cubs, and even <a href="https://mashable.com/article/fat-bear-cam-bear-attacks-another-bear" target="_self">mauled a bear</a> that attempted to steal a fish. It's this fearless aggression, against a dominant bear hundreds of pounds larger than her, that likely spared the cub fatal injury. Numerous times, Grazer forced Chunk to back off.</p><q>
    "She's courageous &mdash; she's defensive."
    </q>
<p>"She continued to fight back," Naomi Boak, who covers the bears for the Katmai Conservancy, an organization supporting the national park, said during the live chat. "She's courageous &mdash; she's defensive."</p><p>You can watch the encounter below, from 12:20 to 14:30.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-22tWtxvBKS0"></div>
</div>


<p>Although the cub appeared severely injured following the attack &mdash; bawling, licking its paw, and moving little &mdash; the young bear persevered in the aftermath, though rangers haven't seen it in recent days. "Cubs are tough," Fitz told Mashable over email. </p><p>"We don't know if the cub will recover or the extent of its injuries, although there is plenty of reason for hope," Fitz added. "It has adapted to its injuries. Rangers have seen it walking on its hind legs in days immediately after the attack. Grazer continues to care for it and her other cub."</p><q>
    "Cubs are tough."
    </q>
<p>We'll never know why Chunk opportunistically attacked the cub. Prior to the cubs falling, Chunk expressed no interest in Grazer's family; rather, he was focused on capturing 4,500-calorie sockeye salmon. Large males have <a href="https://mashable.com/article/bear-cam-dead-cub" target="_self">killed bears on the livestream</a> before. It could simply have been an instinctual reaction. It's possible, as in other cases of bear infanticide, Chunk intended to send a potentially cub-less Grazer back into estrus, a form of sexual selection (though this doesn't add up when considering his previous disinterest in the family group). Chunk might have felt he was competing with Grazer's family for food. Or perhaps it's a reason our species can't understand or imagine. </p><p>The Katmai bears will continue fighting for survival on the bear cams. It's a dynamic view into a largely untrammeled realm. It's a world that is at once beautiful and ruthless.</p><p>"National parks such as Katmai exist to protect and preserve wild landscapes and ecosystem processes," Fitz said. "This includes the grand spectacles such as bears fishing at Brooks Falls and nature's harsh realities."</p>]]></content:encoded>

But if you're indecisive, have no fear: We've gone through the hundreds of documentaries on Max and picked out the ones you absolutely have to make time to watch.</p><p>These movies prove the versatility of the documentary genre, both in terms of subject matter and form. They'll immerse you in high school basketball, concerts, fights for racial justice, and so much more.</p><p>Here are the best documentaries on Max streaming now.</p><h2>1. <em>Stop Making Sense</em></h2><p>Quite possibly the greatest concert film of all time, director Jonathan Demme's <em>Stop Making Sense </em>was filmed over four nights of the Talking Heads' tour in 1983 at the Pantages Theater in Los Angeles, and oh, what I would have given to be there in the audience! But Demme sure makes us feel like we were there across this doc's 88-minute runtime. Starting on a completely barren stage, where lead singer David Byrne walks out with a boombox and begins performing "Psycho Killer," the concert grows ever more expansive from song to song, scene to scene, until it's delirious funk chaos of the finest and most anarchic sort. I have never seen this movie screened where an audience hasn't felt compelled to rise up out of their seats to dance in the aisles, and I doubt you could do it sitting at home on your couch either.

<p>Welcome to Action Park! This New Jersey amusement and water park, built by former Wall Street tycoon Gene Mulvihill, was home to attractions such as Cannonball Loop and the Alpine Slide. It was also severely mismanaged and the cause of many injuries and deaths. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/class-action-park-review-hbo-max" target="_self"><em>Class Action Park</em></a><em> </em>reveals just how insane the story behind Action Park was, from the park's madcap rides to Mulvihill's shady tactics for keeping his venture afloat. </p><p>Through a mixture of fun animation and interviews with comedians who attended Action Park as children, <em>Class Action Park </em>keeps things light and humorous. However, it still exercises proper seriousness and restraint when discussing the park's fatalities. Overall, <em>Class Action Park </em>is a wild documentary about a truly wild place. Come for the descriptions of the insane rides, and stay for the nuanced exploration of nostalgia and childhood in the 1980s. &mdash; <em>Belen Edwards, Entertainment Reporter</em></p><p><strong>How to watch:</strong> <a href="https://zdcs.link/1q3gR?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Class%20Action%20Park&object_type=article&object_uuid=07gJzLof90VwSbbjbFpGLDO&short_url=1q3gR&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><em>Class Action Park </em></a><a href="https://zdcs.link/1q3gR?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Max.&object_type=article&object_uuid=07gJzLof90VwSbbjbFpGLDO&short_url=1q3gR&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">is now streaming on Max.</a></p><h2>4. <em>Everything Is Copy </em></h2><p><em>Everything Is Copy</em> is the best kind of love letter: one that's effusive in its admiration of its subject, but also clear-eyed about her quirks and imperfections.

<p>In their famed 1976 film <em>Grey Gardens</em>, brothers and documentary team Albert and David Maysles pay a visit to a dilapidated mansion in the Hamptons. There, they profile the intriguing and tragic lives of a reclusive mother and daughter, both named Edith Beale, in a strange and winding character study unlike any other.</p><p>Relatives of First Lady Jackie Kennedy, the life stories of "Little Edie" and "Big Edie" are sensationalized in the documentary, and many argue that the film takes an inherently exploitative view of its subjects and their apparent mental health conditions. But as far as fascinating footage goes, <em>Grey Gardens</em> is a must-watch &mdash; capturing a unique family at the heart of a broader dialogue about the decline of political royalty and '60s-era Americana.<a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-movies-hbo-max" target="_self"><u>*</u></a> &mdash; <em>Alison Foreman, Entertainment Reporter  </em></p><p><strong>How to watch:</strong> <a href="https://zdcs.link/76Wpn?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Grey%20Gardens&object_type=article&object_uuid=07gJzLof90VwSbbjbFpGLDO&short_url=76Wpn&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><em>Grey Gardens </em></a><a href="https://zdcs.link/76Wpn?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Max.&object_type=article&object_uuid=07gJzLof90VwSbbjbFpGLDO&short_url=76Wpn&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">is now streaming on Max.</a></p><h2>7. <em>Harlan County, USA </em></h2><p><em>Harlan County, USA</em> drops us into small-town Kentucky in the 1970s to show us a time, a place, and a community &mdash; and to reveal wheat happens when a group of coal miners go on strike, incurring the wrath of the Duke Power Company.

<p><em>Hoop Dreams </em>dives into the lives of Arthur Agee and William Gates, two young men from inner-city Chicago who dream of making it big in the NBA. Both are recruited to play for St. Joseph High School's highly regarded basketball program early on in the film, but over the next four years they take extremely different paths. Through Agee and Gates' basketball careers, director Steve James explores issues of race, class, and how sports recruitment can cross into the realm of the exploitative and put undue amounts of pressure on young players. </p><p>What's astonishing about <em>Hoop Dreams </em>is the level of intimacy James achieves with both Agee and Gates. He follows their journeys on and off the basketball court as they and their families experience parental separations, sports injuries, and financial struggles. The resulting documentary makes you feel like you're experiencing life alongside Agee and Gates, so you desperately want them to succeed. It all comes to a head in the thrilling and tense basketball sequences. Even though these games were played decades ago, James makes every missed shot feel like a lost opportunity and every successful play feel like a massive victory. &mdash; <em>B.E.</em></p><p><strong>How to watch:</strong> <a href="https://zdcs.link/517GO?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Hoop%20Dreams&object_type=article&object_uuid=07gJzLof90VwSbbjbFpGLDO&short_url=517GO&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><em>Hoop Dreams </em></a><a href="https://zdcs.link/517GO?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Max.&object_type=article&object_uuid=07gJzLof90VwSbbjbFpGLDO&short_url=517GO&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">is now streaming on Max.</a></p><h2>9. <em>Original Cast Album: Company</em></h2><p>If you're a fan of the legendary Stephen Sondheim and George Furth musical <em>Company</em>, or of musical theater in general, this documentary is for you.

<p>In 1972, the legendary singer Aretha Franklin went to church to record her live gospel album <em>Amazing Grace</em> over the course of two nights of performances. All of this was captured on camera too, but while the album went on to become the highest-selling live gospel album of all time, issues with syncing the footage and the sound kept the filmed version sitting in a vault for (checks notes) 45 years.</p><p>Part of the issue there was Franklin herself though, because for unknown reasons, she repeatedly sued the producer who'd bought the footage from Warner Brothers and tried to reshape it into something that could be released. Only after Aretha's death in 2018 did her family make a deal with him, and (sorry, Aretha!) thank goodness they did: <em>Amazing Grace</em> captures the singer at the height of her lofty powers.

It's a master lesson in filmmaking from a master filmmaker. <em>&mdash; J.A.</em></p><p><strong>How to watch</strong>: <a href="https://zdcs.link/gk55P?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=De%20Palma%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Max&object_type=article&object_uuid=07gJzLof90VwSbbjbFpGLDO&short_url=gk55P&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><em><u>De Palma</u></em><u> is now streaming on Max</u></a>.</p><h2>19. <em>Honeyland</em></h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>My favorite thing that documentaries can do fairly effortlessly is transport you to a totally alien and unexpected world and drop you right in there, making it suddenly seem not at all alien but instead deeply familiar &mdash; empathy by way of immersion. One such standout is Tamara Kotevska and Ljubomir Stefanov's Oscar-nominated 2019 film <em>Honeyland</em>, which chronicles the life of a Macedonian beekeeper named Hatid&#382;e and her blind, bedridden mother Nazife.</p><p>The drama that unfurls in Hatid&#382;e's life as she gets new obnoxious neighbors who promptly begin mucking up the delicate balance of nature that their already precarious lifestyle depends on is more riveting than 10 Hollywood blockbusters. It's a story in miniature that's echoing across our entire planet, told with such intricacy and intimacy that it takes your breath away. (And when Hatid&#382;e showed up at the Oscars ceremony that year, I cried.) <em>&ndash; J.A.</em></p><p><strong>How to watch</strong>: <a href="https://zdcs.link/mbyvN?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Honeyland%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Max&object_type=article&object_uuid=07gJzLof90VwSbbjbFpGLDO&short_url=mbyvN&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><em><u>Honeyland</u></em><u> is now streaming on Max</u></a>.</p><h2>20. <em>Faye</em></h2><p>One of the most gorgeous, fashionable, and celebrated movie stars of the 1970s, Faye Dunaway strutted through an iconic string of films that would make any actor tremble and weep with jealousy and awe. <em>Bonnie and Clyde, The Thomas Crown Affair, Chinatown, Network</em> (for which she won a much-deserved Oscar) &mdash; you can place her best performances against any of her most beloved contemporaries and call it a wash. Then came her turn as Joan Crawford in the camp classic <em>Mommie Dearest </em>in 1981, and suddenly she found herself a punchline.&nbsp;</p><p>This 2024 doc from director Laurent Bouzereau marks one of the few times that Dunaway's been willing to go on the record about that biopic &mdash; a so-called disaster that I personally consider to be one of her greatest acting achievements, by the way &mdash; and it's riveting. She's too hard on the movie, if you ask me. She's also pretty hard on herself, though even that's not as hard as her critics have been. Labeled as difficult for years, <em>Faye</em> feels like a bit of a mea culpa from the star, especially as she speaks at length about her recently diagnosed bipolar disorder. Faye Dunaway will forever be a legend, and this doc's a great way to familiarize yourself with why.

<p>Years after <a href="https://mashable.com/archive/robin-williams-dead-dies-at-63" target="_self">Robin Williams's death by suicide in 2014,</a> the loss of his talent and presence still stings. <em>Come Inside My Mind</em> uses interviews with those who were closest to him &mdash; his son, ex-wife, best friends, and many more &mdash; along with archival footage to create a portrait of someone immensely, inordinately talented who battled mental illness for most of his life. Marina Zenovich's documentary chronicles Williams's whole life, from a sometimes-lonely childhood to a meteoric rise in comedy, as well as his struggles with addiction and an often-troubled career, despite his cemented status as a legend. Clips of his performances remind us (though no one needs reminding) that there was and likely never will be another with Williams's iconic spark. <em>&mdash; P.K.</em></p><p><strong>How to watch:</strong> <a href="https://zdcs.link/WmlZ6?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Robin%20Williams%3A%20Come%20Inside%20My%20Mind%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Max.&object_type=article&object_uuid=07gJzLof90VwSbbjbFpGLDO&short_url=WmlZ6&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><em>Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind </em>is now streaming on Max.</a></p><h2>22. <em>Moonage Daydream</em></h2><p>When David Bowie died in January of 2016, some people decided in retrospect that that was the moment where humanity shifted onto the shittier timeline that's brought us the past several years of chaos. And while <a href="https://mashable.com/article/moonage-daydream-review" target="_self">Brett Morgen's 2022 musical bio-doc</a> of the man doesn't make that exact case, it does in its margins make the case for why people would feel that way.

Some of that was due to AIDS, some of that was due to violence and poverty, so some of those things haven't changed that much after all. But the people interviewed &ndash; including ball legends like Pepper LaBeija, Dorian Corey, Willi Ninja, and Angie and Venus Xtravaganza &ndash; didn't have that luxury: One of the film's most defining and shocking moments in the film comes when we hear that Venus has been murdered.

Thankfully there are still plenty of people around who knew and cavorted with Rock in his lifetime, so there's no shortage of subjects more than willing to now spill the beans. As the <em>Tales From the City </em>author Armistead Maupin hilariously says at one point, "If I was fucking Rock Hudson, I would want my mother to know immediately."&nbsp;</p><p>But it's not just gossip about his sex life that makes Rock's story worth being told; the man was the biggest star in Hollywood for several years, emblematic of the 1950s and '60s ideals of big, strong manly-man masculinity, all while being forced to hide who he really was lest that unravel it all.

According to legend, they just chose four Bible salesman to follow with their cameras by virtue of their schedules, and then the movie sorted itself out from there. But what the filmmakers ended up finding in the salesmen's stories somehow approaches mythical proportions. It ends up being about as staggering a portrait of mid-century America, religion, and consumerism as could possibly be imagined.

<p>Depicting the high wire artist Philippe Petit's mind-boggling 1974 walk on a wire between the Twin Towers in NYC, this doc from filmmaker James Marsh uses rare video footage of Petit's prep along with recreations of the event and current-day interviews with everyone involved to craft a heart-racing heist film. Winning every award within reach, up to and including the Oscar, the film memorializes not just Petit's stunt but also those buildings, and the legend of their monumental status. &mdash; <em>Jason Adams, Contributing Writer</em></p><p><strong>How to watch</strong>: <a href="https://zdcs.link/7XjB8?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Man%20on%20Wire%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Prime%20Video&object_type=article&object_uuid=01AuvejdOtNR8AhL4vy6SNf&short_url=7XjB8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><em><u>Man on Wire</u></em><u> is now streaming on Prime Video</u></a>.</p><h2>2. <em>Phil Tippett: Mad Dreams and Monsters</em></h2><p>The same man who gave us the dinosaurs in <em>Jurassic Park</em> gave us the holographic chess game in <em>Star Wars</em>, the killer bugs in <em>Starship Troopers</em>, and the terrifying Enforcement Droid in <em>RoboCop</em>. That man's name is Phil Tippett, and those are just four of the special effects wizard's credits that this 2019 documentary on the man features.

Namely, creator Don Mancini and his crew of delightful wackadoos. That's given the franchise not just a thematic throughline that the other '80s slasher franchises have lacked, but an actual personal one, since decades of relationships have bloomed behind the scenes.&nbsp;</p><p>And that's the juice that this 2022 doc thrives on. For example, director Kyra Elise Gardner quite literally grew up with Chucky; her dad Tony has been working on make-up and puppeteering for all things <em>Child's Play</em> for decades.

So go rewatch <em>Grizzly Man</em>, setting aside your best existentially somber Herzog impression for a minute, and immerse yourself in the director's meticulous reconstruction of Treadwell's life, work, and multiple follies.

<p>Val Kilmer is one of the greats, without question. He's played Batman and The Doors frontman Jim Morrison. His performance in <em>Tombstone</em> as Doc Holliday is a frequently quoted cult hit that's inspired any number of memes. And he's Hollywood's best Moses to date, with his star turn in <em>The Prince of Egypt</em>, an animated retelling of the Passover story from 1998, far exceeding that of Charlton Heston in <em>The Ten Commandments</em>. </p><p>In <em>Val</em>, the famed actor who largely fell out of public view in the mid-2010s as he battled throat cancer, bares his whole self. Kilmer himself created many of the home movies and behind-the-scenes clips featured in this Amazon Original documentary, and they're weaved together here to paint a picture of his life and career. Featuring narration from Kilmer's son Jack and words written by the actor himself, <em>Val</em> is about as personal as a biographical documentary can get. <em>&mdash; Adam Rosenberg, Video Game Reporter</em></p><p><strong>How to watch:</strong> <a href="https://zdcs.link/BJG5N?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Val&object_type=article&object_uuid=01AuvejdOtNR8AhL4vy6SNf&short_url=BJG5N&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><em>Val</em></a><a href="https://zdcs.link/BJG5N?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Prime%20Video.&object_type=article&object_uuid=01AuvejdOtNR8AhL4vy6SNf&short_url=BJG5N&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"> is now streaming on Prime Video.</a></p><h2>13. <em>Mr. Dynamite: The Rise of James Brown</em> </h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p><em>No No: A Dockumentary</em> has one hell of a powerful hook: Dock Ellis, the late Major League Baseball pro who is its subject, once pitched a no-hitter as a Pittsburgh Pirate while tripping his face off on LSD.</p><p>Wild as it is, that incident is, of course, just a moment in a much larger and more complex life. Director Jeffrey Radice assembles his picture of Ellis from interviews with friends, family, and former teammates, bolstering the production even further with a generous helping of archival materials &mdash; including words from Ellis himself. </p><p><em>No No</em> is a thorough look at the man behind the moment. The documentary anchors itself in that moment only to highlight and heighten the life that led to and followed it. We come away with a deeper understanding of who Ellis was, the various forces that shaped his life, and the highs and lows that characterized his journey. <em>&mdash; A.R.</em></p><p><strong>How to watch:</strong><em> <a href="https://zdcs.link/VmBZO?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=No%20No%3A%20A%20Dockumentary&object_type=article&object_uuid=01AuvejdOtNR8AhL4vy6SNf&short_url=VmBZO&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">No No: A Dockumentary</a></em><a href="https://zdcs.link/VmBZO?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Prime%20Video.&object_type=article&object_uuid=01AuvejdOtNR8AhL4vy6SNf&short_url=VmBZO&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"> is now streaming on Prime Video.</a></p><h2>17. <em>American Movie</em></h2><p>Celebrating the 25th anniversary of the greatest year for movies in modern history has proven a Herculean effort in 2024, but no such celebration is complete without giving some love to Chris Smith's classic and endlessly quotable documentary <em>American Movie</em>. The doc has Smith following around the low-budget Wisconsinite filmmaker Mark Borchardt as he tries, against literally all of the odds, to make a horror movie called <em>Coven</em>, which tells the tale of a sobriety support group that is in reality the front for a bunch of witches.&nbsp;</p><p>Borchardt is one of those subjects whom you just cannot look away from &mdash; and so too is his best friend Mike Schank and his uncle/financier Uncle Bill. They're a lovable, infuriating, and surprisingly ingenious bunch, under all the endless bungling.

<p>Focusing on LGBTQ refugees escaping from Chechnya, where they've been subject to government-sanctioned torture and murder, <em>How to Survive a Plague </em>filmmaker David France's harrowing 2020 doc follows its subjects' flight from their homeland using a wealth of modern tech, including cell phones and GoPros. <br><br>But it's the film's usage of <a href="https://mashable.com/category/artificial-intelligence" target="_self">AI technology</a>, in order to disguise the refugees' faces and preserve their anonymity, that proved revolutionary, showing that AI can actually be used for good in some instances (<a href="https://mashable.com/article/hollywood-writers-strike-ai" target="_self">rather than</a> to just <a href="https://mashable.com/article/netflix-ai-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-job" target="_self">obliterate</a> all <a href="https://mashable.com/article/stephen-king-ai-fiction" target="_self">artists'</a> <a href="https://mashable.com/article/prosecraft-novel-ai-analysis-shut-down" target="_self">well-being</a>, as has been the case <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ai-art-copyright-debate" target="_self">as of late</a>).

<h2>27. <em>Time </em></h2><p>Documenting Sibil Fox Richardson's 20-year battle to get her husband Rob out of the Louisiana State Penitentiary for a crime that he very much did commit, filmmaker Garrett Bradley pieced together <em>Time</em> using home movies that Richardson herself filmed over the years. What the two summon forth is a devastating critique of the prison industrial complex and the state-sanctioned gears that grind up families. Because, as the film's moving footage attests at every turn, Rob's guilt is not who he is, not as a man or a husband or a father. We are all so much more than the mistakes we make, and the system as it's designed is blind, cruel, and indifferent. Rob was granted clemency in 2018, 21 years after he was convicted as a first-time felony offender to 60 years in jail, with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/16/opinion/louisiana-criminal-justice-reform.html" target="_blank">no possibility for parole or probation</a>. <em>&mdash; J.A.</em></p><p><strong>How to watch:</strong> <a href="https://zdcs.link/pLDK4?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Time%20is%20now%20streaming%20on%20Prime%20Video.&object_type=article&object_uuid=01AuvejdOtNR8AhL4vy6SNf&short_url=pLDK4&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><em><u>Time</u></em><u> is now streaming on Prime Video</u>.</a><br></p><p class="mx-auto">

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/roundups/03B3P1HGivoIiv5ebmt4NWk/hero-image.png" alt="A man strimming his garden lawn"><p>A <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-lawn-mowers-uk" target="_self">beautiful lawn</a> doesn't come easy. It takes, blood, sweat, tears, and the real equipment. That's the same for everyone, whether you just dabble in gardening or you're a pro landscaper. Even if you struggle with the blood, sweat, and tears bit, it's certainly worth tooling up with the best gardening equipment you can afford.</p><p>Top of the list, of course, is a lawn mower. But it's worth backing that up with a strimmer (sometimes called a lawn trimmer). If a lawn mower does the bulk of the worth, a strimmer is for the finer details. Strimmers are designed to trim the edges, borders, and even keep the lawn itself tidy by cutting back weeds and long patches. In other words, the strimmer takes care of the bits that your lawn mower can't reach. </p><p>But unless you&rsquo;re a gardening expert, choosing the right strimmer is harder than lugging a mower around. There's plenty of jargon and spec that might not make sense &mdash; not to mention a selection of brands to choose from. But we're here to help put you on the right (garden) path by recommending some top models. But before we get to that, here&rsquo;s some helpful information about buying a new strimmer.</p><h2>Are there different types of lawn strimmers?</h2><p>The main types you&rsquo;ll have to choose from are electric strimmers that plug into the mains, cordless strimmers powered by rechargeable batteries, and petrol strimmers which give you extra power.&nbsp;The best option for you really depends on the size of your garden and its current state. Is it big and overgrown? In that case you'll need power.</p><h2>Corded vs. cordless strimmers &mdash; which are best?</h2><p>It&rsquo;s less a case of which is best and more which type best suits your <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-robot-lawnmowers-uk" target="_self">garden and gardening needs</a>. Corded strimmers are generally cheapest and best for casual use, but they&rsquo;re slightly limited by the cord. You&rsquo;ll need easy access to a mains outlet &mdash; and you must check that the cord reaches far enough to cover your lawn.</p><p>Cordless strimmers are built for convenience &mdash; lightweight and easy to handle around the garden. The main drawback is that you have to recharge them after use. Look for a model with battery power to match the size of your garden.&nbsp;</p><h2>What are the benefits of a petrol strimmer?</h2><p><a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-petrol-lawn-mowers-uk" target="_self">Petrol-powered</a> strimmers give you power. If you have a large garden, or particularly tough grass and weeds to cut through, a petrol strimmer is likely the best option. They&rsquo;re not always the best for delicate or precision-perfect jobs.</p><h2>What is lawn edging?</h2><p>Lawn edging is pretty much as it sounds &mdash; the art of keeping your lawn neat, tidy, and even styled. It can be surprisingly hard to do if you don&rsquo;t have the right tools. Some strimmers are built for both regular trimming and edging, or may have a cutting head that converts into an edger. This can add a touch of artistic flair to your gardening.</p><h2>What are the most important lawn strimmer features?</h2><p>As well as edging, there are other handy features that can elevate a strimmer from good to great. They can include a telescopic shaft, adjustable handle, shoulder strap, and brush cutter for tackling brambles and shrubbery.</p><h2>What's an automatic line feed?</h2><p>Another feature that can be a deal-breaker for some gardeners is an automatic line extension. The &ldquo;line&rdquo; is the thing that whips around quickly and does the actual business of grass cutting (though some strimmers use a blade). The line can sometimes break, so you need a system to replace the line mid-cut. Strimmers may have an automatic line feed, which replaces the line as you cut, meaning you do don't have faff about with changing spools. Others replace the line with the press of a button &mdash; or by giving the head a bump on the ground.</p><h2>What is the best lawn strimmer?</h2><p>There are plenty of impressive models out there from top brands like Bosch and Flymo. To help you find the right strimmer for you and your garden, we have lined up a selection of the very best models. We have considered customer reviews, specifications, and features to give you a clear idea of what's out there.</p><p>These are the best garden strimmers in 2024.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/roundups/07EZRs8RHxOS22JNQVMfmGc/hero-image.jpg" alt="NordVPN on phone"><p>The <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-uk" target="_self">best VPNs</a> aren't necessarily the most expensive. Some leading <a href="https://mashable.com/category/vpn" target="_self">VPNs</a> are actually really affordable, which is great news for anyone looking to secure cheap online security, data protection, and increased <a href="https://mashable.com/category/streaming" target="_self">streaming</a> options.</p><p>You have come to the right place if you're looking for a <a href="https://mashable.com/category/vpn" target="_self">premium VPN</a> with advanced features, without the big price tag. We've lined up some great value options for absolutely everyone, and there is no need to compromise on security, connection speed, customer support, or anything else.</p><p>But first, there are a few things we need to cover.</p><h2>What is a VPN?</h2><p><a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-for-anonymity-uk" target="_self"><u>Virtual Private Networks</u></a> (VPNs) provide valuable protection for your data and identity when you're navigating the online world. How do they do this? VPNs offer online privacy and anonymity by creating a private network that hides your real IP address and makes all of your information unreadable. </p><p>All of your activity is untraceable and secure, because your online traffic passes through an encrypted tunnel. Everything inside the tunnel is protected against online threats like viruses, hackers, and malware. VPNs are primarily designed to provide online security, but there is another reason that millions of people use these services.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

            <svg class="inline-block ml-1 w-4 h-4 font-normal fill-current"><use href="https://mashable.com/images/icons/spritemap.svg#sprite-arrow-right-thin"></use></svg>
        </a>
    </div>
<p>VPNs can also be used to <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-streaming-movies-uk" target="_self">stream movies and shows</a> from around the world, and the process is actually really simple. We've already mentioned how VPNs provide anonymity by hiding your real IP address. Well, this technique can also be used to manipulate the streaming market. By hiding your real IP address and connecting you to a server in another location, you can trick your favourite streaming sites into thinking that you are based in a different country. This provides access to all the extra content that would normally be restricted in your location.</p><h2>Should you use free VPNs?</h2><p>The question that everyone wants an answer to is whether you actually need to pay for a VPN. There are plenty of <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-reviews-paid-free" target="_self">free VPNs</a> out there, but do these offer the features you need to browse, shop, and stream securely? Unfortunately, there is often a catch with free versions (usually in the form of a limitation on your data usage or connection speed). </p><p>Occasional users will probably be satisfied with a free VPN, but if you're going to be streaming or downloading on a regular basis, you should look elsewhere. The only exception to this rule is a free trial. These come without limitations, but obviously don't tend to last for a long time.</p><p>The conclusion is that the best option for securing your data and streaming more content from around the world is with a paid subscription. The sad fact is that you'll have to pay to gain access to advanced security features without limitations on your usage. It's not all bad news though, because there are plenty of cheap plans out there, especially if you're willing to commit to a lengthy contract.</p><h2>What should you consider before subscribing to a VPN?</h2><p>The process of actually selecting a VPN can be seriously tricky, especially if you don't know what to consider. Most of the best VPNs offer many of the same features with similar packages, so it's important to know what matters.</p><p>To make your life a little bit easier, we have shortlisted a few things to consider before making any sort of decision:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Customer support</strong> &mdash; VPNs can be difficult to understand if you're not an experienced user, and even if you are, problems can occur. Whether you're a total beginner or not, customer support is key for dealing with any potential issues that might arise. You should also consider whether customer support is offered by phone, email, or web chat. </p></li><li><p><strong>Jurisdiction</strong> &mdash; It's a good idea to look for VPNs based in the British Virgin Islands, Panama, Switzerland, and other <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-no-log-vpn-services-uk" target="_self">privacy-friendly countries</a>. VPNs based in countries that fall under the jurisdiction of the intelligence-sharing alliances should be avoided: the U.S., UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, France, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Sweden, and Spain. VPNs in these countries can be forced by authorities to collect and hand over user data.</p></li><li><p><strong>Network size and location</strong> &mdash; The best VPNs offer a large network of geographically diverse servers. The more servers (and server locations) offered by a VPN, the more likely you are to find a reliable and fast connection. This is also particularly important for streaming, as you should always be able to connect to a server in the country with the content you want to watch.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trustworthiness</strong> &mdash; We recommend finding an experienced provider with a strong track record and a clear privacy policy. It's important that your VPN of choice guarantees your data won't be logged or collected. If it isn't obvious what happens to your data, you should steer clear.</p></li></ul><p>Make sure you carefully consider these features before deciding on the VPN that suits you and your lifestyle. Once you have narrowed down your options, you can begin the process of finding the best deals.</p><h2>What is the best VPN?</h2><p>We're sorry to burst your bubble, but there isn't one VPN that stands above all the rest. The best VPN for you really comes down to your own set of personal preferences. Once you find a few options that tick your boxes, you need to consider the <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-deals" target="_self">best deals</a>.</p><p>We have reached out to partners in order to provide you with market-leading prices on VPN subscriptions, with performance and security in mind. All of these VPN services have been handpicked not only because of the prices and deals on offer, but because they all offer the most important features to protect your online data and identity.</p><p>There are also plenty of services to consider on this list if your priority is unlocking streaming sites like <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-netflix" target="_self">Netflix</a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/category/amazon-prime-video" target="_self">Prime Video</a>, and Disney+. Online security should always be the priority, but we know that many subscribers use these services to unlock more content from around the world. We get it, and we're here to help.</p><p>These are the best deals on cheap VPNs in 2024.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00E9wOfdLk06O0j77ZJIahn/hero-image.jpg" alt="Gemini Ai is seen on a phone"><p>Apparently using Google Gemini to write a fan letter in the voice of a little girl doesn't sit well with people. </p><p>Google has pulled its "Dear Sydney" ad after major backlash that criticized Google for misjudging how much the public values genuine human expression. </p><p>The ad features a father using the Google Gemini chatbot to help his daughter write a fan letter to Olympic track and field star Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone. "I'm pretty good with words," says the father, "but this has to be just right." Cue Gemini, and a fan letter written entirely by a bot that, being a bot, can't possibly understand concepts like admiration, inspiration, or just the experience of being a human child. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

<p>"We believe that AI can be a great tool for enhancing human creativity, but can never replace it," said a Google spokesperson in a statement to Mashable. "Our goal was to create an authentic story celebrating Team USA. It showcases a real-life track enthusiast and her father, and aims to show how the Gemini app can provide a starting point, thought starter, or early draft for someone looking for ideas for their writing."</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>But given the negative reaction online, Google missed the mark. The ad's message is offset by a recurrent theme in the generative AI era: companies have eagerly adopted generative AI in the hopes of attracting users. But in a classic case of a tech solution in search of a problem, they've sometimes repulsed consumers, and have struggled to find applications that prove genuinely useful. Earlier this week Meta <a href="https://helios-preview.mashable.com/article/meta-ai-celebrity-avatars-getting-axed" target="_self">scrapped</a> its celebrity AI personas, while Taco Bell has <a href="https://helios-preview.mashable.com/article/taco-bell-expands-ai-ordering-hundreds-drive-thru-locations-in-us" target="_self">expanded</a> its AI voice automated ordering system despite McDonald's failings with a similar experience. </p><p>Even if Gemini nailed the tone and successfully mimicked the tone and age-appropriate literacy of the little girl, people online were horrified by the premise of using AI to write a fan letter. "It is one of the most disturbing commercials I&rsquo;ve ever seen," <a href="https://x.com/shellypalmer/status/1817887280352141314" target="_blank">posted</a> Shelly Palmer, professor of advanced media at Syracuse University Newhouse School.

<p>Washington Post columnist Alexandra Petri was so infuriated that she wrote an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/07/31/google-gemini-ai-dear-sydney-ad-olympics-satire/" target="_blank">entire column</a> about it saying, "This ad makes me want to throw a sledgehammer into the television every time I see it."</p><p>It's hard to summarize all the ways the public feels Google's ad fell short.

<p>Since Elon Musk took over X, then known as Twitter, in October 2022, pirated content has run rampant. Almost immediately after Musk's acquisition, users began <a href="https://mashable.com/article/twitter-copyright-full-movies" target="_self"><u>sharing full-length films</u></a> from major companies with little-to-no oversight. The company seemingly made matters worse by rolling out <a href="https://mashable.com/article/twitter-2-hour-long-videos-twitter-blue" target="_self"><u>new updates and features,</u></a> like the ability to upload longer videos, that seemed to further enable the unauthorized distribution of copyrighted content.</p><h2><strong>The football world calls out X</strong></h2><p>Along with the Premier League and LaLiga, the letter to X was also signed by major soccer governing bodies like UEFA and CONMEBOL.&nbsp;</p><p>Potentially even more concerning for X is the fact that networks and platforms that air the leagues' games signed the letter too. Companies like DIRECTV, Sky, Movistar Plus+, beIN, and DAZN &ndash; all of which signed the letter &ndash; have distribution rights to a variety of sports, not to mention entertainment events and shows, in addition to soccer.</p><p>In the letter, these organizations specifically call out X for its "persistent failings" in moderating unlawful distribution of copyrighted material. The letter makes it clear that this problem is unique to the platform since Musk's acquisition.</p><p>"X&rsquo;s approach to taking down unlawful live content notified to them is woefully insufficient and inadequate," reads the letter sent to Musk, Yaccarino, and X. "This makes our respective intensive efforts to tackle this problem hugely inefficient. Critically, since you acquired the platform, we have witnessed a demoralizing reduction in technical support making it ever more difficult to engage with the platform in any kind of meaningful discussion on this topic."</p><p>The letter mentions how X under Musk has severely lacked in providing support for these companies, an issue the letter says has been exacerbated by the fact that X's content moderation resources were recently decreased by 20 percent. The letter also says that X "lacks many of the features which other responsible social media operators deploy to combat piracy.&rdquo;</p><p>All of these issues combined have resulted in "an increased perception among pirates that they can do as they wish on X with impunity," according to the letter, which provides examples of illegal live streams being broadcast on X.&nbsp;</p><p>Mashable noticed such livestreams spreading on X during the recent 2024 Copa Am&eacute;rica and Euros tournaments as well, and monitored some of these streams. These streams were rarely taken down on X. When one was removed, often a new feed would just be shared in its place.</p><p>Mashable has reached out to X about these streams, and the others mentioned in the letter, and will update if we hear back.</p><h2><strong>Will this affect X's sports dominance?</strong></h2><p>X has lost users from various online communities to competitor platforms like <a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/threads-gains-growth-momentum-as-it-reaches-200-million-users/723154/" target="_blank"><u>Threads</u></a> and Bluesky over the past few years.</p><p>However, one user base that's continued to hold strong on X are sports fans.&nbsp;</p><p>X is still the place for real-time discussion of the biggest games and matches on social media. Because X is where the fans are, many sports leagues and teams have remained active on the platform. Right now, for example, X is filled with not only Olympics-related content but also paid advertising from the networks currently airing the 2024 summer games in Paris.</p><p>However, X's relationship with sports leagues and broadcasters could certainly be affected by the company's blas&eacute; response to the publication of pirated content. X is already very familiar with advertiser <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-suspends-x-twitter-advertising-elon-musk-antisemitic-conspiracy" target="_self"><u>boycotts</u></a> as a result of Musk's leadership or even his own behavior.&nbsp;</p><p>The leagues and organizations behind the letter sent to X says that they "urgently call for a meeting with X&rsquo;s representatives to address this unacceptable situation."</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"Although the credentials were not leaked directly, hackers can associate the IP addresses with the identity from other leaks," explained Cybernews information security researcher Mantas Kasiliauskis in its reporting. </p><p>The sensitive information had been stored on an unprotected instance of Elasticsearch, a searchable distributed document storage system typically used for high-volume data. The largest file of the leak contained nearly 11 million records.

According to Cybernews, however, there's still a risk to users if adversaries accessed the data.</p><p>"If bad actors managed to get their hands on this data, they might trace and link adult content viewers' habits to specific individuals," Kasiliauskis said. "Combined with other private information, this could lead to significant privacy issues, cause personal embarrassment, and result in social stigma in places with conservative attitudes."</p><p>Mashable has reached out to BangBros for comment and will update if we hear back.</p>]]></content:encoded>

COPPA, which was passed over two decades ago, requires social media platforms and other websites to get parental consent before collecting personal information from children under 13. In response, most social media platforms &mdash; including Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat &mdash; simply don't allow anyone under 13 to make an account. TikTok, on the other hand, offers a <a href="https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/tiktok-under-13-experience" target="_blank">view-only experience for children under 13</a>.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>"This action is necessary to prevent the defendants, who are repeat offenders and operate on a massive scale, from collecting and using young children&rsquo;s private information without any parental consent or control," Brian M. Boynton, the head of the Justice Department&rsquo;s Civil Division, <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2024-08-02/justice-department-sues-tiktok-accusing-the-company-of-violating-a-childrens-online-privacy-law" target="_blank">told the Associated Press in a statement</a>.</p><p>This comes after the FTC sued Musical.ly, the app that would later become TikTok, for violating COPPA in 2019, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-bytedance-ftc-justice-investigation-children-6044e57cc7adf9e57319e351c671483c" target="_blank">the AP reported</a>; Musical.ly paid $5.7 million to resolve the allegations at the time.</p><p>According to NBC News, "TikTok knowingly and repeatedly violated kids&rsquo; privacy, threatening the safety of millions of children across the country."&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/tiktok-lawsuit-justice-department-sues-company-child-privacy-rcna164907" target="_blank">FTC Chair Lina Khan said</a>. The FTC will continue to use the full scope of its authorities to protect children online, especially as firms deploy increasingly sophisticated digital tools to surveil kids and profit from their data.</p><p>In response to these allegations, a TikTok spokesperson emailed Mashable the following statement: </p><blockquote><p>"We disagree with these allegations, many of which relate to past events and practices that are factually inaccurate or have been addressed. We are proud of our efforts to protect children, and we will continue to update and improve the platform. To that end, we offer age-appropriate experiences with stringent safeguards, proactively remove suspected underage users, and have voluntarily launched features such as default screentime limits, Family Pairing, and additional privacy protections for minors."</p></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Suno had been vague about how it trained its AI music generator, despite damning note-for-note comparisons of RIAA copyrighted songs and Suno-generated songs included in the lawsuit. But now, Suno is claiming that this is perfectly legal according to fair use guidelines. "We train our models on medium- and high-quality music we can find on the open internet," said Suno CEO Mikey Schulman in a <a href="https://suno.com/blog/future-of-music" target="_blank">blog post</a> accompanying the legal filing. "Much of the open internet indeed contains copyrighted materials, and some of it is owned by major record labels."</p><p>In response, RIAA <a href="https://x.com/RIAA/status/1819108132787745207" target="_blank">posted</a> a statement on X, saying "[Suno's] industrial scale infringement does not qualify as 'fair use.' There's nothing fair about stealing an artist's life's work, extracting its core value, and repackaging it to compete directly with the originals."</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#107" target="_blank">U.S. Copyright Office</a>, fair use "promotes freedom of expression by permitting the unlicensed use of copyright-protected works in certain circumstances." Such circumstances include "criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research." </p><p>In the blog post, Schulman goes on to say Suno's neural networks learn "like a kid learning to write new rock songs by listening religiously to rock music," and therefore, "learning is not infringing." However equating synthetic intelligence to human intelligence is very much unresolved in the eyes of the law. Currently the Copyright Office says AI-generated art <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ai-art-copyright-debate" target="_self">cannot be copyrighted</a>, which pretty clearly distinguishes artificial intelligence from human intelligence when it comes to the final product. But the "learning process," i.e. training data is entirely new territory. </p><p>Suno's legal filing alleges the RIAA lawsuit is essentially a David and Goliath situation where major record labels are trying to stifle competition. "Where Suno sees musicians, teachers, and everyday people using a new tool to create original music, the labels see a threat to their market share," the filing said. </p><p>Mashable has reached out to Schulman for additional comments and will update if we hear back. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<h3>Why we like it</h3><p><a href="https://mashable.com/review/m3-macbook-air-15-inch" target="_self"><em>Read Mashable's full review of the 15-inch Apple MacBook Air.</em></a></p><p>Apple's latest MacBook Air takes the excellent design of its <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-macbook-air-m2-2022-review" target="_self">predecessor</a> and upgrades it with a faster processor, support for WiFi 6E, and the ability to drive two external displays with its lid closed. It's our current <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-laptops" target="_self">favorite MacBook</a> for most people and another Mashable Choice Award winner. </p><p>The base configuration of the 15-inch model (which has two more speakers than the 13-inch version) normally retails for $1,299, but you'll pay $1,099 if you buy it from Amazon or Best Buy. That's 15% off and $50 away from its all-time low price from <a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-prime-day-laptop-deals-2024-july-18" target="_self">Amazon Prime Day</a>.</p><h3>More laptop

<p>Fall is just about here. Why not take some time to tidy up your home? It's a great time to do so, especially since there are deals like Target's that practically reward you for picking up some paper towels and cleaning that bathroom or for tackling that sink full of dishes you've been neglecting. And if you're the type of person who needs a reward in order to handle tasks like that, we've got just the deal for you. </p><p>As of August 2, you can get a <a href="https://zdcs.link/vdB5q?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=free%20%2415%20Target%20GiftCard&object_type=article&object_uuid=07xbJvT7dyzQGl96quToim8&short_url=vdB5q&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">free $15 Target GiftCard</a> when you spend $50 on select cleaning supplies. This deal is for those with a Target Circle membership and you must activate it by heading to the deal page. You can use the coupon once per Target Circle account, and the discount will be automatically applied at checkout. </p><p>You can choose from a wide variety of goodies you'll need to tackle just about every cleaning need, from Target's up&amp;up brand paper towels to Clorox Disinfecting Wipes and everything in between. There are also sandwich storage bags, Tide Pens, Scrub Mommy sponges, plastic forks, toilet paper, and other home goods to choose from. All you need to do is buy at least $50 of it and add it all to your cart, then check out with the deal activated. </p><p>This deal is only available for a limited time, and it's only good for one use. Make it count and get ready to fall into some serious savings on things you're probably going to be buying for your home anyway. Now you just get a treat for doing so that you can put back into, you guessed it, buying more of the things you need. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Intel reported losses of $1.6 billion for the previous fiscal quarter.

      <description><![CDATA[A new sports streaming service from broadcast giants is coming soon and it'll cost you.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/06qsQnZ5vQfBXfV2wf2fjZL/hero-image.jpg" alt="nfl football on field"><p>Hey, do you want to have to pay even <em>more </em>money for <em>yet another </em>streaming service? Boy, are you in luck: Venu &mdash; the joint <a href="https://mashable.com/category/streaming" target="_self">sports streaming</a> offering from Disney (ESPN), Fox, and Warner Bros. Discovery &mdash; has officially set its price-tag and outlined when it plans to launch. </p><p>It'll cost $42.99 per month and launch in the fall, with no exact date set just yet. At least on it's surface value, that's a tough ask, considering it's much more expensive than pretty much any other streaming service. But sports, and live broadcast rights, are big business and one of the few remaining things on TV that are appointment viewing. In short: sports, typically speaking, get folks to pay-up. </p><p>It seems the goal from Venu &mdash; which by the way, is pronounced like the word Venue, which is just wrong &mdash; is to get younger customers who loves sports but don't want to pay for a cable package. </p><p>"We're building Venu from the ground up for fans who want seamless access to watch the sports they love, and we will launch at a compelling price point that will appeal to the cord cutter and cord never fans currently not served by existing pay TV packages," Venu CEO Pete Distad said in a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pricing-confirmed-at-42-99month-for-upcoming-venu-sports-streaming-service-302212256.html" target="_blank">statement</a>. </p><p>So, what'll be on Venu? You get all the sports offerings on ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU, SECN, ACCN, ESPNEWS, ABC, FOX, FS1, FS2, BTN, TNT, TBS, truTV, and ESPN+. The press release, and pretty much every write up of the news, notes the service will include the NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, WNBA, NASCAR as well as college sports, golf, tennis, and soccer offerings.</p><p>The big question here, however, is the NFL because, well, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nfl-streaming-death-cable" target="_self">it is by </a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/nfl-streaming-death-cable" target="_self"><em>far </em></a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/nfl-streaming-death-cable" target="_self">the most popular thing on TV</a> in the U.S. With ESPN and Fox onboard, you have a <em>decent </em>amount of the NFL offerings on Venu. But, if you're an NFL completist, as most American sports fans are, Venu won't be enough. NBC,&nbsp;CBS, Amazon, and the NFL Network and also air a fair number of NFL games, meaning you'll need to pony up for other streaming services or a YouTube TV/cable subscription if you want to watch every game. </p><p>So, no matter what decision you make, watching sports is going to continue to cost a lot of money. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>Why we like it</h2><p>While <a href="https://mashable.com/review/psvr2-review" target="_self">PlayStation VR 2</a> didn't really blow up in the way that many of us expected it to, Sony's attempt at creating a smash-hit <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-vr-headsets" target="_self">headset</a> is still a worthwhile investment for VR diehards, if you ask us &mdash; especially when you can snag one for $200 off. This PSVR 2 deal not only comes with the VR rig itself, but also with a copy of <em>Horizon Call of the Mountain</em>, which is definitely a must-play PSVR 2 title. The deeply immersive experience throws you into the world of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/horizon-forbidden-west-review" target="_self"><em>Horizon</em></a> as you've never seen it before. You'll climb treacherous mountains, go head-to-head with dangerous machine enemies, and bask in the gorgeous environments that the game has to offer. If you've enjoyed the other <em>Horizon </em>games and want to connect with the franchise even deeper, this is your best bet. This deal ends on Aug. 4, so be sure to grab one quickly if you're considering it.</p><h2>Best subscription deal</h2><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

Pictures’ crime drama thriller “TRAP,” a Warner Bros. Pictures release."><p>Somewhere along the way, M. Night Shyamalan went from a classy, "elevated horror" auteur &mdash; "The Next Spielberg," Newsweek <a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51HBH9dIDyL.jpg" target="_blank"><u>called him</u></a> in 2002 &mdash; to a purveyor of cheap thrills. It was the best thing that ever happened to him. <em>Trap</em> follows in the footsteps of the schlockier work he's made in the last decade, beginning with the self-funded found footage thriller <em>The Visit</em>. The film's story is tightly wound around a dopey premise, but it's also buoyed by incredible heart and soul, and seldom slows down while twisting every possible screw. In short, it&rsquo;s an absolute blast.</p><p>Set largely at a pop concert, and featuring narrative zig-zags that stretch incredulity, it's easy to see how <em>Trap</em> might lose viewers eager to nitpick plot holes and logistics. However, that would be missing the forest for the trees. At the movie&rsquo;s core is a surprisingly layered story of parenthood, which is entirely in service of the kind of thrilling goofiness Shyamalan brought to 2021's <a href="https://mashable.com/article/old-review-m-night-shyamalan" target="_self"><em><u>Old</u></em></a> &mdash; a movie whose visual and narrative framing is similarly (and intentionally) off-kilter while remaining utterly committed to sincere melodrama.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Man, what <em>isn't</em> <em>Trap</em> about?&nbsp;</p><p>In the broadest possible strokes: it's about a well-to-do Philadelphia firefighter, Cooper (Josh Hartnett), who takes his teenage daughter Riley (Ariel Donoghue) to a show by her favorite popstar, only to discover that the concert is also a trap to capture him &mdash; as it turns out, he's secretly a notorious serial killer known as The Butcher.</p><p>That's all you really need to know going in, though the film is surprisingly spoiler-proof. Long gone are the days when even Shyamalan's most prestigious works hinged on major reveals &mdash; such has been his reputation, even though it's only really happened in three or four of his 16 features &mdash; because he's proven much more adept at telling stories with numerous, cascading twists and turns. But perhaps the biggest twist in <em>Trap</em> is that it's a thoughtful father-daughter story at its core.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Trap</em> is a film about 'girl dads'</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>As much as its plot concerns Cooper discovering the scale of this police operation, and wriggling through whatever cracks he can find, the reason it feels urgent &mdash; and why he can't simply go on the run &mdash; is that he truly, deeply cares about Riley. She's been having a tough time at school with bullies and seeing the spark in her eye as she sings and dances means the universe to him. As much as Cooper might want to find a way out of the labyrinthine concert venue, he doesn't want to arouse her suspicions, and he needs to make sure she has a good time too.</p><p>Which is to say: if the premise didn't seem loopy enough from the trailers, it's also a girl-dad movie in saccharine, sentimental ways. After all, the pop singer at its center, Lady Raven, happens to be played by R&amp;B artist Saleka (Shyamalan's daughter), who features heavily on screen (not to be confused with his other daughter, Ishana, who directed<a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-watchers-shyamalan-movie-review" target="_self"> </a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/the-watchers-shyamalan-movie-review" target="_self"><em><u>The Watchers</u></em></a> this year). <em>Trap</em> is practically an ode to his daughters and their teenage years, though it also wrestles with some of the darker implications of fatherhood. It plays, at times, like a confrontation of what it means for a daughter to challenge a man's view of the world, and of himself.</p><div id="related-video" class="mx-auto mt-8 mb-12 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans md:mt-12 md:mb-16 text-primary-400">

<p>During <em>Trap</em>, it's fun to see the uncommon sight of a western pop star of South Asian origin (quite fitting for <a href="https://www.today.com/popculture/music/what-is-brat-summer-charli-xcx-rcna163061" target="_blank"><u>brat summer</u></a>, the doing of British Asian sensation Charli XCX), but the inclusion of Saleka is more than just a gimmick. Sure, Shyamalan attempts to highlight her musical talents, but the young singer-songwriter proves a surprisingly key (and radiant) presence, a bastion of aspirational goodness who vitally contrasts with Cooper. Shyamalan casts his daughter as a symbol of absolution, who suggests that her fans hold up their phone flashlights in the name of forgiveness and acceptance &mdash; traits Cooper doesn't adhere to when the movie occasionally delves into his backstory. It's a moving meta-text, made all the more tragic by the fact that Cooper is constantly trying to escape Lady Raven's orbit, and willing to make innocent bystanders his pawns.</p><p>There is perhaps no more fitting a venue in which to wrestle with casual misogyny than a pop concert aimed at teenage girls, and the film incorporates this idea with surprising subtlety. Cooper is quick to put several young women and girls at the concert in harm's way to create distractions, and he doesn't appear to take Lady Raven very seriously (his ultimate folly, Shyamalan, you old softie). Protecting Riley from bullies may be just as important to him as evading the cops, but he also has a casually violent misogynistic streak. One gets the sense that Cooper might trot out a defense like "as the father of a daughter&hellip;" as though it were a get-out-of-jail-free card.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Trap</em> is a cat-and-mouse game where the mouse has a head start</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>However, <em>Trap</em> isn't a film of learning moments. It's far too mischievous for something so didactic. Rather, it uses Cooper's relationship to Riley as a kind of rubber band. He often leaves her to enjoy the show while scouting the venue for exits, like some kind of serial killer 007 &mdash; it's hard not to root for him each time he pulls off a small heist to slip past security guards. But his role as a chaperone means he constantly finds himself back with Riley no matter how much progress he makes.</p><p>The more Cooper's suspicions are aroused by the increased police presence, the more he tries to sleuth out their strategy. It's a cat-and-mouse game where the mouse has a head start (the police don't know what he looks like). Minor characters are surprisingly forthcoming with what they share &mdash; in part because he can turn on the charm, but also for plot convenience &mdash; and new opportunities to slip out unnoticed seem to arise as soon as existing ones are thwarted. Some of these exit strategies are ludicrous, from Cooper trying to score a backstage pass, to a featured artist inexplicably appearing through an illogically placed trap door (<em>heh</em>). </p><p>But Shyamalan has a secret weapon amid all this: the talents of Josh Harnett.&nbsp;</p><h2>Josh Hartnett's fine-tuned, operatic performance keeps <em>Trap</em> on track</h2><p><em>Trap</em> does for Harnett what Shyamalan's <em>Split</em> did for James McAvoy: both films provide their actors with some truly madcap material that allows them to flex their most unexpected thespian muscles. Hartnett and McAvoy ham it up like nobody's business, but they have so much god damn fun with it.</p><p>In Harnett's case, the first layer of this fun takes the form of well-meaning dad jokes and stilted delivery that hints at a kind of pretense. Shyamalan's dialogue has never felt polished or naturalistic, but its floweriness here beats with distinct purpose. It feels robust during fleeting moments of exposition, allowing Cooper to create a detailed roadmap to his origins through implication, and paint pictures of his daily life using words alone. It also creates a sandbox for Hartnett, in which he plays with polite pleasantries and laces them with devious implications, accentuating the character's white, suburban, middle-class fa&ccedil;ade. The actor wields Cooper&rsquo;s friendly front with precision, luring other characters in with his charm while winking to the audience.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Trap</em> is effectively about an all-American father trying, and slowly failing, to maintain a work-life balance, while keeping an addiction to bloodshed under wraps. The film isn't particularly interested in any realistic serial killer psychology, and it's also not concerned with his actual methodology, or any of the salacious tenets one might expect from <em>Dexter</em> or <em>Criminal</em> <em>Minds</em> &mdash; trauma, motive, trophies, what have you. However, the film is deeply invested in the mask of normalcy Cooper wears.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The film circles the question of what fatherhood means for someone who has such horrific, secret impulses, a theme that may as well reflect the desire to create horror movies, as though Shyamalan were turning the camera on himself. However, this self-reflexivity is more of an echo than a linear conclusion. Harnett is far from an avatar for Shyamalan. Rather, he seems to represent Shyamalan's movies &mdash; his cinematic essence &mdash; which tend to wrestle with beliefs about the world, and about oneself.</p><p>Cooper, in the process, embodies the kind of spiritual war Shyamalan's movies have come to fight in the latter half of his career, with works like <em>After Earth</em>, <em>Old</em>, and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/knock-at-the-cabin-review" target="_self"><em><u>Knock at the Cabin</u></em></a>. These films ask what it would take for parents to protect their children from the world, and from themselves, and <em>Trap</em> is no different. But as thoughtful as it may be, the reason it works like a charm is because it's unrelenting in its use of themes of family and fatherhood as fuel for a genuinely raucous thriller.</p><h2><em>Trap</em> is a propulsive visual romp<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>As much as Shyamalan is responsible for <em>Trap</em> as its writer-director, an equal degree of credit must be given to cinematographer Sayombhu Mukdeeprom, the Thai maestro behind Apichatpong Weerasethakul's <em>Uncle Boonmee</em> and Luca Guadagnino's <em>Challengers</em>. Shyamalan's thriller wouldn't be nearly as impactful without Mukdeeprom's visual trickery and his evolving use of space.</p><p>When the movie begins, it features a sense of vast, open possibility while framing Lady Raven's performance as a distant feature. Her show is always seen through Cooper's point of view, literally and metaphorically, as something far away, and something he doesn't understand (or really care to). But the film takes surprisingly intimate turns, and contorts geography until it feels like every wall is closing in on Cooper, &agrave; la non-stop concert thrillers like<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEoM7bM7KVw" target="_blank"> <em><u>Grand Piano</u></em></a> and the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZWk243pIu0" target="_blank"> <u>opera scene</u></a> in <em>Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation</em>. Mukdeeprom employs techniques like split diopters to compress space when it feels like authorities are close, and in immediate response, awkward framing with an excess of emptiness whenever Cooper finds some kind of escape hatch. The film practically controls your breathing through its aesthetics, alternating between claustrophobia and a bizarre form of relief, where you find yourself rooting for a guy to get back to his hobby of dismembering innocent people.</p><p><em>Trap</em> is also impeccable in its use of close-ups, which become tighter and more discomforting as the film progresses. Each time Harnett is in frame, Mukdeeprom lights him in ever-so-slightly eerie ways. Nothing feels overtly "wrong" with Cooper, but his eyes feel just a little too obscured by shadow. He feels a little too duplicitous, or a little too asymmetrical, in ways that your brain may only register subconsciously.</p><p>Something just feels <em>off</em>, much in the same way cinematographer Michael Gioulakis made each camera movement feel off in Shyamalan's <em>Old</em>. In this case, what's most puzzling is an inescapable stillness that's as alluring as it is uncanny. You can't look away, but you also don't want to. <em>Trap</em> is filled with these opposing dichotomies. At the end of the day, it's about following a serial killer as he finds his way out of a corner like a wounded animal, if only for his daughter's love &mdash; until a sly switch in POV turns it tense, tragic, and downright terrifying, both thanks to Hartnett's performance, and thanks to Shyamalan's fable-like approach to perpetuating cycles of bad parenthood.</p><p>His masterstroke, however, is that all throughout every thematic and tonal turn, and each gonzo narrative escalation,<em> Trap</em>&nbsp; remains wildly and consistently entertaining, with laugh-out-loud dramatic ironies that collide headfirst with a sincere father-daughter story in the most fucked up packaging.</p><p><em>Trap </em>is now in theaters. </p>]]></content:encoded>

According to Google, "Depending on your question, you might get an <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-ai-overviews-benefit-of-doubt" target="_self"><u>AI Overview</u></a> response that brings together the most relevant information from across the web."</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

<p>Starting your own business might sound complicated, but it's not all brick and mortars and figuring out where people buy those huge ribbon-cutting scissors. In fact, starting your own business can be as easy as opening up an Amazon or Shopify store and sending out a few packages.</p><p>The <a href="https://zdcs.link/pgmYZ?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Amazon%20FBA%20and%20Shopify%20Drop-Shipping%20Business%20Model%20and%20Strategies%20Bundle&object_type=article&object_uuid=04x6bBcPMEJ86dvxjS1d6sD&short_url=pgmYZ&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Amazon FBA and Shopify Drop-Shipping Business Model and Strategies Bundle</a> breaks down the practicalities of building a business on either of these super popular platforms. There's only three courses, so it's not as big a lift as getting a whole business degree, and the whole bundle is even on sale for just $24.97 (reg. $597).&nbsp;</p><h2>Why start drop-shipping?</h2><p>There's a ton of <a href="https://zdcs.link/pgmYZ?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=reasons%20to%20start%20a%20business&object_type=article&object_uuid=04x6bBcPMEJ86dvxjS1d6sD&short_url=pgmYZ&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">reasons to start a business</a>, but the reason to start drop-shipping really comes down to two things: you can make money, and you might not have to change out of your pajamas.&nbsp;</p><p>Between the courses on Amazon FBA (which just stands for Fulfilled By Amazon), and Shopify Dropshipping, you have six hours of video lessons breaking down the how, what, and why of building a business on both of these platforms.</p><p>The key takeaway is that with Amazon, you have an established platform with a ton of traffic, but your little shop might get lost unless you follow the guides to stand out. Conversely, Shopify gives you more control, but then you're in charge of everything, including figuring out how to get traffic your way.&nbsp;</p><h2>Great for aspiring business owners</h2><p>Find out how you can start your own Amazon or Shopify business.&nbsp;Get the <a href="https://zdcs.link/pgmYZ?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Amazon%20FBA%20and%20Shopify%20Drop-Shipping%20Business%20Model%20and%20Strategies%20Bundle&object_type=article&object_uuid=04x6bBcPMEJ86dvxjS1d6sD&short_url=pgmYZ&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Amazon FBA and Shopify Drop-Shipping Business Model and Strategies Bundle</a> for $24.97.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.stacksocial.com" target="_blank"><em>StackSocial</em></a><em> prices subject to change.&nbsp;</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[Ford is offering Mustang Mach-E GT owners a software upgrade that makes the car a lot quicker.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/07dq1vDo0AYPHeCLqFe271w/hero-image.png" alt="Ford Mustang Mach-E GT"><p>One of the first big tricks <a href="https://mashable.com/category/tesla" target="_self">Tesla</a> pulled from its sleeve was when it started offering <a href="https://mashable.com/article/tesla-spring-update" target="_self">over-the-air upgrades</a> that made its cars considerably quicker. There's just something special about getting a performance upgrade for a car you already purchased. Now, Ford is following suit by offering to make the Mustang Mach-E GT a lot faster with a software upgrade. </p><p>The upgrade applies only to the owners of the 2024 Mustang Mach-E GT, but it is considerable, adding an extra 100 lb-ft of torque from the car's two electric motors, and lowering the 0-60 miles per hour time from 3.8 to 3.3 seconds. According to Ford's general manager for integrated services <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7224412071545688066/" target="_blank">Chet Dhruna</a>, a Mustang upgraded in this way can run a quarter mile in 11.8 seconds, at 114 miles per hour. </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

            Tesla recalls 1.8 million cars over hood issue

        </a>
    </div>
<p>The upgrade isn't free; it costs $995 before tax, but it still sounds like a pretty sweet deal that can turn your Mustang Mach-E GT into a proper tire destroyer. </p><p>Customers buying a new Mustang Mach-E GT can add this upgrade as an option; folks who already own the car can download it through the <a href="https://www.ford.co.uk/technology/connectivity/fordpass" target="_blank">FordPass app</a> (but remember, it needs to be the 2024-year model). </p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">
    <div id="video-container-lhLBLJ5F9zY"></div>
</div>


<p>The Mustang Mach-E GT is the most powerful electric Mustang in Ford's roster, and this upgrade makes it one of the quickest SUVs you can get. For example, it's quicker than a Tesla Model Y Performance, which goes from 0-60 miles per hour in 3.5 seconds. It's also quicker than all of Porsche's electric Macan variants, except the Turbo Electric, which beats the Mustang at 0-60 miles per hour by 0.2 seconds. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Here's what to expect from Made by Google 2024.</p><h2>What is Made by Google?</h2><p>Made by Google is an annual event unveiling Google's latest gadgets, with the primary focus typically going to the next generation of Pixel phones. They aren't the only devices on the agenda though, with past Made by Google events also featuring <a href="https://mashable.com/review/google-pixel-watch-review" target="_self">Google's Pixel Watch</a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/review/google-pixel-buds-pro-review" target="_self">Pixel Buds</a>.</p><p>This year the in-person event will take place at Google's headquarters in Mountain View, California, though it has previously been held in New York and Brooklyn.&nbsp;</p><h2>What can we expect at Made by Google 2024?</h2><p>Google has already dropped multiple hints regarding what we can expect at its August event, teasing its upcoming devices across social media.</p><h3>Google Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro</h3><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <a class="text-gray-600" href="https://twitter.com/madebygoogle/status/1813967957590241437" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="(opens in a new window)">

</blockquote>
<p>August's Made by Google event is set to unveil the next generation of Pixel phones, including the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-pixel-9-pixel-9-pro-release-date-rumors" target="_self">Google Pixel 9</a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-pixel-9-pro-fold" target="_self">Pixel 9 Pro</a>. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-pixel-8-pro-leak" target="_self">As is tradition</a>, a lot about these phones has <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-pixel-9-pixel-9-pro-release-date-rumors" target="_self">already been leaked</a>, and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-pixel-9-pixel-9-pro-release-date-rumors" target="_self">rumours about the lineup abound</a>.</p><p>Google appears to be changing up its hardware design with the Pixel 9, eschewing the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/google-pixel-8-and-pixel-8-pro" target="_self">Pixel 8</a> series' rounded edges in favour of a flatter feel. The Pixel 8's rectangular back camera strip also seems to be out, replaced with a rounder, pill-shaped design.</p><p>The Pixel 9 series will of course get a spec boost to go with its new look, with reports of higher megapixel cameras and faster Tensor G4 chips across all models. The Pixel 9 Pro will reportedly have a 4GB RAM increase from the Pixel 8 Pro as well, offering 16GB of RAM to more smoothly run <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-gemini-ad-olympics" target="_self">Google's AI chatbot Gemini</a>.</p><p>It's likely there will be considerable focus on the Pixel 9 series' AI and Gemini functionality. Even Google's official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMVpP-Zam1A" target="_blank">Pixel 9 Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC_A3EHFKF4" target="_blank">Pro 9 Fold</a> teaser videos focused more on Gemini than the phones themselves, like a parent who makes their child's birthday party all about said kid's younger sibling. While Made by Google is first and foremost a hardware event, AI is currently the undisputed darling of the tech industry, so it isn't surprising that it would get a look in.&nbsp;</p><h3>Google Pixel 9 Pro XL</h3><p>We know for certain that the Google Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro are coming. If rumours are to be believed, they could very well be joined by a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-pixel-9-pro-xl-leaks-video" target="_self">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>.</p><p>The last XL variation in Google's Pixel series was the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/google-pixel-4-xl-review" target="_self">Pixel 4 XL</a> back in 2019, which offered increased screen size and battery life over the Pixel 4. As such, it wouldn't be surprising if the rumoured Pixel 9 Pro XL offered a similar bump over the Pixel 9 Pro.</p><p>Even so, early leaks suggest the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-pixel-9-pixel-9-pro-release-date-rumors" target="_self">Pixel 9 Pro XL is even smaller than the Pixel 8</a>, sporting a 6.5-inch screen compared to the latter's 6.7 inches. If true, this could mean the Pixel 9 Pro is smaller still. We'll just have to wait until Aug. 13 to find out for sure.</p><h3>Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</h3><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Google launched its first foldable smartphone at <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-io-2023-everything-you-need-to-know-ai" target="_self">last year's Google I/O event</a>, introducing the world to the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-pixel-fold-announced-price-release-date" target="_self">Google Pixel Fold</a>. This year the tech giant will follow it up with the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-pixel-9-pro-fold" target="_self">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>.</p><p>This is another announcement that we know for certain is happening, with Google having already posted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC_A3EHFKF4" target="_blank">teaser video</a> saying as much. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold appears slimmer than Google's first generation foldable, with a squarer back camera module replacing its predecessor's rectangular strip. As usual, we can likely expect upgraded specs as well.</p><h3>Google Pixel Watch 3 (and Pixel Watch 3 XL)</h3><p>Though Google's Pixel 9 phones are undoubtedly the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/bridgerton-season-3-characters-ranked" target="_self">diamonds</a> of this Google season, they likely won't be attending this party alone. <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-google-pixel-watch-3-has-2000nit-peak-brightness-20-faster-charging-more.html" target="_blank">Leaks suggest that Made by Google will launch the Google Pixel Watch 3</a>, available in both 41- and 45-millimetre sizes. In comparison, last year's <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-pixel-watch-2-announcement-release-date" target="_self">Pixel Watch 2</a> only comes in a 41-millimetre size.&nbsp;</p><p>Some older reports suggest that the Pixel Watch 3's 45-millimetre variant will actually be called the <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/pixel-watch-3-xl" target="_blank">Pixel Watch 3 XL</a>, though the name's absence in <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-google-pixel-watch-3-has-2000nit-peak-brightness-20-faster-charging-more.html" target="_blank">newer leaks</a> have cast some doubt on exactly how Google will title these devices.</p><div id="related-video" class="mx-auto mt-8 mb-12 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans md:mt-12 md:mb-16 text-primary-400">

<p>The Pixel Watch 3 will reportedly have thinner bezels allowing for a larger screen, while said screen will also be twice as bright as the previous model. Google's latest watch may also introduce a new battery saver mode, stretching the Pixel Watch 3's charge to last 36 hours. The device's standard battery life with its always-on display is apparently still 24 hours, the same as the Pixel Watch 2.</p><h3>Google Pixel Buds Pro 2</h3><p>Google may also bring out the next generation of its wireless earbuds this August. While details about the rumoured Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 remain scant, leaks suggest that the earbuds will come in <a href="https://9to5google.com/2024/07/09/pixel-buds-pro-2-colors-leak/" target="_blank">at least four different colours</a>: pink, pale green, ivory, and grey (though they'll likely get more fanciful names).</p><p>The Pixel Buds Pro 2 case will reportedly be <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-buds-pro-2" target="_blank">slightly bulkier than the Pro</a>, while the Buds themselves seem to have larger grills. Google also appears to have <a href="https://9to5google.com/2024/07/25/pixel-buds-pro-2-wing-tips/" target="_blank">brought back the Pixel Buds' stabiliser arcs</a>, which are intended to help keep the earphones in your ear.</p><h3>Google TV Streamer</h3><p>New smartphones, new earphones, and a new watch would be a lot, but Google may not be stopping there. Made by Google may also introduce a follow up to 2020's <a href="https://mashable.com/review/chromecast-with-google-tv-review" target="_self">Chromecast with Google TV</a> called the <a href="https://9to5google.com/2024/07/22/google-tv-streamer/" target="_blank">Google TV Streamer</a>.</p><p>Leaks suggest that the Google TV Streamer has abandoned its predecessor's dongle form factor, opting for hardware designed to sit on a table or entertainment unit. The wide, pill-shaped device's slanted surface makes it look similar to a magnetic phone charger.</p><p>The Google TV Streamer may have <a href="https://9to5google.com/2024/07/28/google-tv-streamer-fcc/" target="_blank">HDMI, Ethernet, and USB ports</a>, while its remote will have a <a href="https://9to5google.com/2024/07/22/google-tv-streamer/" target="_blank">customisable shortcut button</a> as well as ones for <a href="https://mashable.com/category/youtube" target="_self">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/category/netflix" target="_self">Netflix</a>.</p><h3>Android 15, maybe?</h3><p>Made by Google may be a hardware event, but hardware is nothing without software. Many have been expecting Google to launch Android 15 this August, bringing with it new features such as <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-android-15-best-new-features" target="_self">Theft Detection, a locked space to hide apps, and the ability to add photos to your Google Wallet</a>.</p><p>However, recent reports claim that the <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-google-pixel-9-launching-android-14" target="_blank">Pixel 9 series will be launched on Android 14</a> rather than 15, casting doubt on whether Google's OS system is ready to debut. Android 15 is currently in its fourth and final scheduled beta, with the next update expected to be its official release. </p><p>Though even if Android 15 doesn't show up on Aug. 13, it's likely it will appear within the next few months.</p><h2>How do I watch Made by Google 2024?</h2><p>Made by Google will kick off on Aug. 13 at 10 a.m. PT / 1 p.m. EST. Fortunately for those of us unable to make it to California, the event will be livestreamed on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@madebygoogle/featured" target="_blank">Made by Google YouTube channel</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/kneecap-movie-review" target="_self">In </a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/kneecap-movie-review" target="_self"><em>Kneecap</em></a><a href="https://mashable.com/article/kneecap-movie-review" target="_self">, the semi-fictionalized origin story</a> of the Belfast Irish-language rap group of the same name, Irish is the language of rebellion &hellip; and consuming large quantities of ketamine, cocaine, acid, and MDMA.&nbsp;</p><p>Often repeated in the film is the line, "Every word of Irish spoken is a bullet for Irish freedom." The movie takes place in 2019 in West Belfast, during the height of advocacy for recognition of the Irish language in the United Kingdom. In 2022, the country's Identity and Language Act passed, granting Irish an equal status to English. It established the Irish language commissioner to develop Irish in Northern Ireland, repealed the ban of Irish in Northern Ireland courts, and allowed members of the Northern Ireland Assembly to speak Irish. The reality of the band's formation in 2017 was just as closely tied with the moment.&nbsp;</p><p>In real life, Naoise &Oacute; Caireall&aacute;in, who goes by M&oacute;gla&iacute; Bap, was out spray painting walls with the slogan "Cearta," which means "rights" in Irish, the night before an Irish Language Act march. While Bap got away, the friend who was with him got picked up by the police, refused to speak English, and spent the night in jail awaiting a translator.&nbsp;</p><p>The incident inspired Bap to recruit Mo Chara, real name Liam &Oacute;g &Oacute; Hannaidh, to join him in writing and recording "C.E.A.R.T.A," their first song. They filmed and put out a music video, but didn't plan to do any more songs. After the song was denied play on the Irish language radio station due references to drugs and cursing, a petition circulated and the track went locally viral. "We had no plan to start a band, but that demand&hellip;" Bap said to Mashable. The group has since released two albums, all in Irish with a dash of English, and they still frequently go viral, for both tongue-in-cheek republican stunts &mdash; that often turn into self-referential songs of their own &mdash; and their <a href="https://mashable.com/article/sxsw-drops-military-sponsors-amid-pro-palestine-organizing" target="_self"><u>solidarity with Palestine</u></a>.</p><h2>Kneecap puts the live music in living language</h2><p>The group takes a necessary alternative approach to the legal and political work around the Irish language in the UK. Having begun their band five years before the 2022 law was passed, they've worked to create energy around the language, which continues to be <a href="https://www.elalliance.org/languages/irish" target="_blank">"endangered,"</a> according to some linguists. </p><p>"Having music is an important part of a living language, especially music that represents the language people speak on the streets and amongst each other socially," said Bap. "It's a very natural way to learn, especially with hip-hop, because hip-hop has story lines and a certain way of delivery. You're going to learn a lot of the language through the music."</p><p>The third member of the group, JJ &Oacute; Dochartaigh / DJ Pr&oacute;va&iacute;, a former Irish teacher, used to translate pop songs into Irish as a teaching tool. "Learning through music always sticks in your head more than just rote stuff," Pr&oacute;va&iacute; told Mashable.&nbsp;</p><p>While Chara insists that they are also "just trying to make tunes," their impact on interest in the Irish language is undeniable. When the British director of the film, Rich Peppiatt, enrolled in a night Irish class in Belfast in 2019 while doing research for the film, half the students in the class said they were there because of Kneecap.&nbsp;</p><p>When interviewed about <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ireland-meme-culture-cillian-murphy" target="_self">American interest in Ireland</a> earlier this year, Eleanor O'Leary, a lecturer in media and communications at South East Technological University in Ireland, noted the new attention to the Irish language, pointing to Kneecap's online following as an example of the new energy.&nbsp;</p><p>Duolingo has also seen surges in interest in Irish. During the pandemic, Irish became the most popular language in Ireland for both new and existing users, overtaking Spanish. In <a href="https://imminent.translated.com/ireland-back-to-irish" target="_blank"><u>2021</u></a>, Irish was the fastest growing language on Duolingo, with a million people actively learning it &mdash; quite high for a language which, according to <em>Kneecap,</em> only 80,000 people speak. From the end of 2022 to the end of 2023, Duolingo saw a 70 percent increase in daily active learners in the Irish course.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, with the film, the group is poised to reach a more global audience.</p><h2>Paying homage to rap's legacy</h2><p>Bap grew up speaking Irish at home, while Chara and Pr&oacute;va&iacute; learned it through school. The boys are quick to cite their history, telling Mashable that Irish language primary schools didn't exist in Northern Ireland until 1972, and Irish language secondary schools didn't come into being until 1991.&nbsp;</p><p>Kneecap's members are, of course, big fans of hip-hop's sound, but they were also attracted to the genre's history of giving a voice to Black Americans and its central nature of storytelling. "Irish speakers in the North never really had a voice for a long time. We thought it was a great opportunity for us to let the world know about the North, about Ireland, that the Irish language does exist, it's not just English with a funny accent," said Bap.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Storytelling is intrinsic to Irish culture, and knowing that not many of their listeners understand Irish, having elaborate visual stories in their music videos was of the utmost importance. The film incorporates many of their pre-established storylines &mdash; from the cross-community relationship with a Protestant girl developed in their 2019 single "Fenian Cunts," to their film rivals, the fictitious Radical Republicans Against Drugs, which they use to poke fun at the staunch anti-drug stance of republicans and which dates back to "Your All Legitimate Targets" off their mixtape. The band benefits from the medium of film pushing these storylines and viewer connection with the Irish language further through the use of subtitles when Kneecap speaks and raps.</p><p>A large portion of <em>Kneecap</em> is in Irish, a rarity in film, and an entirely different approach to <em>The Quiet Girl</em>, the 2022 primarily Irish language adaptation (which doesn't have much dialogue at all) of Claire Keegan's short story "Foster" that earned a Best International Feature Film nomination at the Oscars. While <em>The Quiet Girl</em> presents a quaint view of Ireland set in the 1980s, <em>Kneecap </em>and the band's music takes the Irish language out of the past and into the raucous semi-present.&nbsp;</p><h2>Irish solidarity and beyond</h2><p>"Hopefully when people see Kneecap, the movie and the music, they'll see that it's possible to do stuff in your own language," said Bap. "We've met people who tell us the film makes them reflect on how they can be creative with the language, because even in Ireland for a long time, most people wouldn't sing in Irish, and even worse, they'd sing in American accents."&nbsp;</p><p>Chara added that your native language can connect you to where you're from, your history, your past, and the land. "Belfast doesn't have a meaning [in itself], but it comes from B&eacute;al Feirste in Irish, which means 'the mouth of Farset River that runs underneath Belfast,'" said Chara. "The list goes on everywhere in Ireland a name originates from Irish and was translated to English a long time ago."</p><p>The group and their championing of the Irish language is ultimately a reaction to their people's history of being colonized and England's attempt at erasing Irish culture. But Kneecap isn't only concerned with the Irish cause. The film ends with a PSA noting that an Indigenous language dies every 40 days. The group made headlines when <a href="https://mashable.com/article/sxsw-drops-military-sponsors-amid-pro-palestine-organizing" target="_self">they dropped out of SXSW in solidarity with Palestine</a>. Kneecap's attitude has earned them the respect of politically aware Gen Z fans.&nbsp;</p><p>"We're very good at history and remembering stuff in Ireland, and we're very bitter and resentful, so we never, never forget. But the history repeats itself," said Bap. "We understand the importance and the impact that solidarity can have on people, and we see that now in Palestine. That's why it's important for us to make sure people feel seen, heard, and not dismissed."</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/b1Gq6?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Kneecap%20is%20in%20theaters%20Aug.%202.&object_type=article&object_uuid=02Sb78BLU7CIb8ihDSvg1NE&short_url=b1Gq6&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><em>Kneecap</em> is in theaters Aug. 2.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[In "Kneecap,"  the music-fueled biopic named for the Irish hip-hop trio on which it centers, Móglaí Bap, Mo Chara, and DJ Próvaí play themselves.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03lFiSiwEbSF79OoV5mtLj2/hero-image.jpg" alt="Naoise Ó Cairealláin as Móglaí Bap or Naoise, JJ Ó Dochartaigh as DJ Próvaí or JJ, Liam Óg Ó Hannaidh as Mo Chara or Liam Óg in "Kneecap.""><p>Don't let the truth get in the way of a good story. <em>Kneecap, </em>the music-fueled biopic named for the Irish hip-hop trio on which it centers, spins a tale that is at times so outrageous you might suspect poetic liberties have been taken. But the film itself embraces the blurring of fact and feeling to deliver a propulsive and political romp that rejects the austere approach of so many indulgent Oscar-chasing biopics. And thank God and all the saints for that!&nbsp;</p><p>Too often, larger-than-life rock stars or pop divas or legendary musicians are reduced by a color-by-numbers approach that fails to capture exactly why they were so enthralling to begin with. (For recent examples, see <a href="https://mashable.com/article/elvis-movie-review" target="_self"><em>Elvis</em></a><em>,</em> <a href="https://mashable.com/article/back-to-black-amy-winehouse-movie-review" target="_self"><em>Back to Black</em></a><em>, and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/bob-marley-one-love-review" target="_self">One Love</a></em> &mdash;&nbsp;or don't.) However, <em>Kneecap</em> embraces the raw and reckless energy of Naoise &Oacute; Caireall&aacute;in, Liam &Oacute;g &Oacute; Hannaidh, and JJ &Oacute; Dochartaigh, who perform under the stage names M&oacute;gla&iacute; Bap, Mo Chara, and DJ Pr&oacute;va&iacute;. So, early on, a sprawling club scene with flashing lights and hard drug-taking spills into a dark, forbidding forest &mdash;&nbsp;not nearby, but connected &mdash;&nbsp;as the police (or "peelers," as the boys call them) chase them down.&nbsp;</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>By collapsing the set of a nightclub into a forest that seems plucked out of nightmarish fantasy, director/writer Richard Peppiatt swiftly establishes that <em>Kneecap </em>won't play by the rules. Hand-drawn graphics burst onto the screen, emphasizing motions and odd analogies. Claymation will be employed to illustrate the mind-bending effects of an ill-timed ketamine trip. And alongside the band, who play themselves in the film, two-time Academy Award nominee Michael Fassbender strides onscreen to bring a bit of surreal grit.&nbsp;</p><p>Combined with a soundtrack flushed with Kneecap's high-octane hip-hop, the result is a rush to the head that's hard to shake. But why would you want to?</p><h2><em>Kneecap</em> is a fuck you to boring biopics and tedious vanity projects.&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The premise of <em>Kneecap </em>might sound a bit dry if you're new to the group's music. A few years back, a debate brewed over the proposed Irish Language Act, which would formally recognize the native tongue alongside English. While advocates and academics rallied for the dying language, an unlikely resurgence came to it through fast-growing interest in a band from Belfast, who rap in Irish about drugs, sex, and rebelling against British authority &mdash;&nbsp;including the police.&nbsp;</p><p>Smartly, <em>Kneecap </em>interweaves this larger political story into the playful personal stories of its three members. Liam &Oacute;g serves as the cheeky narrator, providing voiceover to all parts, including his Romeo-and-Juliet romance with a British party girl (Jessica Reynolds), who likes a kinky night in. However, the story begins with Naoise's baptism, which was raided by a police force suspicious of his father, a Catholic radical Republican named Arl&oacute; (Fassbender), who had a habit of planting bombs in the name of rebellion. Raised under the shadow of his dad's politics, Naoise is stuck between a rock and a hard place, pressured by Arl&oacute;'s admirers to follow in his dad's footsteps and the snarl of a police force that expects him to.&nbsp;As the Irish language was previously banned by the imperialist English authorities, Naoise's embrace of it does follow in his father's edict that "Every word of Irish spoken is a bullet fired for Irish freedom" &mdash;&nbsp;though perhaps not as Arl&oacute; intended.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>While these "Ceasefire babies" are painted as altar boys corrupted by the bad streets of West Belfast &mdash;&nbsp;and not troubled about that or The Troubles &mdash;&nbsp;JJ is introduced as a middle-aged music teacher on the brink of dying of boredom. A chance encounter over a police interrogation table changes everything, when JJ becomes inspired by Liam's in-your-face lyrics and proudly Fenian posturing. Just like that, a band is born. But their rise will be rife with violence, huge mistakes, and lots of drugged-up shenanigans. And most of that is an absolute blast.&nbsp;</p><h2>Mo Chara, M&oacute;gla&iacute; Bap, and DJ Pr&oacute;va&iacute; thrill playing themselves&hellip;as fools.&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p><em>Kneecap </em>throws up a brazen middle finger to another "North of Ireland" set biopic, Kenneth Branagh's <em>Belfast</em>. Where the world-renowned actor/director made a prestige pic out of his childhood, Mo Chara, M&oacute;gla&iacute; Bap, and DJ Pr&oacute;va&iacute; reject the opportunity to gloss up their images. Instead, they gamely present themselves as fun-loving fuckups, never shying away the havoc that lies in the wake of their road to stardom.&nbsp;</p><p>They welcome us to witness them stumbling on stage, too high to function after a dime bag mix-up. They invite us to laugh at sexual proclivities that thrust into political orgasms. They show their asses, literally and metaphorically, which proves crudely inspiring. These three didn't set out to change their nation. They set out to sing (or rap) a song for themselves, and in doing so, connected to an undercurrent of cultural pride and resilience that connected them to others.&nbsp;</p><p>But what first unites us to them is their rough-hewn charisma. Playing themselves on-screen could have spelled disaster, as plenty of musicians have fumbled at acting. But they excel, managing to play scenes of clownish absurdity and more tender moments with stirring screen presence. DJ Pr&oacute;va&iacute; proves the strongest &mdash; to the point where I wondered if his signature onstage attire of an Irish flag balaclava allowed them to cast an established actor for the role. But the whole crew thrives on-screen as they do onstage, exploding in a frenzy of humor, music, and attitude that is wicked fun.&nbsp;</p><p>In the end, Peppiatt has done a superb job of not only shaking off the oh-so-serious shackles that are musician biopic conventions, but also enthusiastically embracing the hip-hop energy of his subjects, allowing them to be both the stars and fuel of their story, propelling them to a climax that deserves its rowdy encore across the credits.&nbsp;</p><p>Simply put, <em>Kneecap </em>is sensational, silly, sharp, and ultimately sublime.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/weopy?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Kneecap%20opens%20in%20theaters%20Aug.%202.&object_type=article&object_uuid=03lFiSiwEbSF79OoV5mtLj2&short_url=weopy&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><em>Kneecap </em>opens in theaters Aug. 2.</a>&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Plus, the bezels have slimmed down, too, for a more modern look. (Because, come on, large bezels are so <em>pass&eacute;</em>.) The LCD display features a 2,304 x 1,536-pixel display with a dynamic 120Hz refresh rate. In other words, depending on your task, it can climb up to 120Hz (e.g., light gaming and other frenetic activities) while dropping down to 60Hz for less demanding activities. </p><p>The Surface Laptop 7 also features a 3:2 aspect ratio, which means the screen is more tall than it is wide. Emanating about 600 nits of brightness, the Surface Laptop 7 passed my "sunny day" test. Yes, its display can be seen in bright environments, but the screen is quite reflective. (You could somewhat see yourself while using the screen, even with the panel cranked up to max brightness.) As such, the Surface Laptop 7 could benefit from an antireflective coating on the display.</p><p>I watched the <em>Gladiator 2 </em>trailer on YouTube, and the Surface Laptop 7 delivers rich, pungent colors. But compared to my <a href="https://mashable.com/review/m3-macbook-air-15-inch" target="_self">15-inch M3 MacBook Air</a>, it could stand to be a tinge sharper and more crisp. For example, Denzel Washington, playing as Macrinus, is draped in a Roman grab with vivid red, gold, and purple hues, but the leopard print portion of his getup appeared to be more detailed and sharper on my MacBook.</p><h2><strong>Microsoft Surface Laptop 7 ports</strong></h2><p>The Surface Laptop 7 is a bit selfish with its ports, but my MacBook Air is worse; it doesn't even have legacy ports like USB Type-A. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>So perhaps the Microsoft's offerings aren't too bad.</p><p>On the left side: </p><ul><li><p><strong>USB Type-A port (3.2 Gen 1)</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Two USB4 Type-C ports</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>3.5mm headphone jack</strong></p></li></ul><p>On the right side:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Microsoft's proprietary Surface Connect port</strong></p></li></ul><p>Like the MagSafe 3 connector for MacBooks, the Surface Connect port is proprietary. It lets you charge the Surface Laptop 7, freeing up the other ports for displays, peripherals, and more. This model doesn't have a microSDXC card slot, but you can find one on the 15-inch model.</p><h2><strong>Microsoft Surface Laptop 7 audio</strong></h2><p>The Surface Laptop 7 has MacBook-beating performance and power efficiency, but it cannot match the<em> </em>stunning sound quality you get on an Apple laptop.</p><p>I fired up "Not Like Us" by Kendrick Lamar via Spotify, and while the audio can get pretty loud at max volume, the diss track didn't sound very impactful on the Surface Laptop 7's speaker set up. The tune lacked bass and that rich depth you get from a MacBook Air or MacBook Pro.</p><h2><strong>Microsoft Surface Laptop 7 keyboard and trackpad </strong></h2><p>If I could rate the Surface Laptop 7's keyboard, I'd give it a &mdash; well &mdash; 7. The keyboard's key travel is a bit shallow as you'd imagine for a thin-and-slim laptop, but there is still enough snappiness and tactile feedback to gracefully launch my fingers from one keycap to another.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>The touchpad, compared to the last iteration, now has precision haptic capabilities. This means you'll receive reliable click feedback across the entire surface. It felt a bit stiff out of the box, as if I needed to exert more effort than usual to move the cursor around the screen. However, this can be remedied by going to <strong>Settings &gt; Bluetooth &amp; devices &gt; Touchpad &gt; Cursor speed. </strong></p><h2><strong>Microsoft Surface Laptop 7 benchmarks and performance</strong></h2><p>The Microsoft Surface Laptop 7 comes equipped with the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite star chipset. As mentioned at the outset, Qualcomm has been boasting that it can beat the M3 MacBooks. We ran Geekbench 6, which stress tests the CPU, to validate Qualcomm's claims. </p><p><strong>Surface Laptop 7 - 11,875</strong></p><p><strong>M3 MacBook Pro - 11,998</strong></p><p><strong>M3 MacBook Air - 12,170</strong></p><p>You can squeeze more performance out of the Surface Laptop 7 by switching the power mode to "best performance," which eked out an incredible multi-core score of <strong>14,586.</strong></p><h2><strong>Microsoft Surface Laptop 7 battery life</strong></h2><p>I couldn't believe my eyes.

<p>The webcam is a bit of potato. It's giving watercolor vibes; it's a bit fuzzy and lacks crispness. On the plus side, it renders color relatively well, accurately picking up my complexion and the bright colors on my shirt.</p><h2><strong>Microsoft Surface Laptop 7 compatibility quirks</strong></h2><p>I tried to download the Apple Music app from the Microsoft Store, but it doesn't surface (no pun intended) in search results. As it turns out, the Apple Music app doesn't support the Surface Laptop 7 (though it supports other non-Windows-on-ARM PCs I've tested). For the uninitiated, the Surface Laptop 7 has an ARM chip (hence why it's called Windows-on-ARM), and in order for software to run its smoothest on PC, developers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/26/24186432/microsoft-windows-on-arm-qualcomm-copilot-plus-pcs-prism-emulator" target="_blank">must create ARM64 native apps.</a></p><p>For example, apps like Photoshop, Dropbox, Zoom, Prime, Spotify, Hulu, and Chrome all have native apps on Windows-on-ARM PCs. Apps that <em>don't </em>have native support require emulation with Microsoft's Prism (a translation framework). However, Apple Music isn't available on the Surface Laptop 7 whatsoever, so my guess is that Apple simply hasn't <em>allowed</em> support for it just yet. (According to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/1e0bftr/will_apple_ever_make_apple_music_available_for/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, you can sideload it to your PC, though.)</p><p>I haven't spotted any other compatibility issues during my normal workflow, but one <a href="https://www.worksonwoa.com/games/?compatibility=Unplayable" target="_blank">website claims</a> that some games like <em>Fortnite </em>and <em>Dirt 5</em> are not playable on Window-on-ARM PCs. However, this doesn't faze me much; the Surface Laptop 7 isn't a <a href="https://mashable.com/category/gaming-laptops" target="_self">gaming laptop</a>. (But if you like to bend the rules, you can definitely get away with some light gaming, as long as the titles are compatible).</p><h2><strong>Microsoft Surface Laptop 7 AI features</strong></h2><p>The Snapdragon X Elite chip is a power-efficiency champ and a performance beast, and on top of that, it boosts the Surface Laptop 7's AI capabilities with an NPU, a dedicated processor designed to shoulder all the AI-related tasks.</p><p>This makes the Surface Laptop 7 a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/what-is-copilot" target="_self">Copilot+ PC</a>, allowing users to play around with fun features like <a href="https://mashable.com/article/windows-11-paint-cocreator" target="_self">Cocreator on Paint.</a></p><p>For example, I was able to draw a rough sketch of a pink flamingo with heels on Paint, only for the new-and-improved AI-powered app to recognize my drawing and fix it into a more sophisticated masterpiece of a fancy, rose-colored bird. </p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

The <em>Times</em> credits associate puzzle editor Wyna Liu with helping to create the new word game and bringing it to the publications' Games section. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyt-connections-hint-answer-today-february-21-2024" target="_self"><em>Connections</em></a> can be played on both web browsers and mobile devices and require players to group four words that share something in common.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Each puzzle features 16 words and each grouping of words is split into four categories. These sets could comprise of anything from book titles, software, country names, etc. Even though multiple words will seem like they fit together, there's only one correct answer. If a player gets all four words in a set correct, those words are removed from the board. Guess wrong and it counts as a mistake&mdash;players get up to four mistakes until the game ends.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Players can also rearrange and shuffle the board to make spotting connections easier. Additionally, each group is color-coded with yellow being the easiest, followed by green, blue, and purple.

We're not trying to scare you, but have you ever considered just how much of your personal data is exposed to this sort of thing whilst you're browsing? If not, you probably should. You might be surprised by the results.</p><p>Your data is seriously valuable stuff these days, and everyone is looking to get their hands on it. Once you come to understand that the internet is insecure, it's perfectly normal to feel a little concerned about how much of your data is up for grabs. There's no need to panic though, because there is a simple and effective way that you can stay protected.</p><p>To stay safe online and keep all of your data and personal information secure, you really should consider investing in a <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-uk" target="_self">VPN</a>. </p><h2>What is a VPN?</h2><p><a href="https://mashable.com/category/vpn" target="_self">VPNs</a> provide protection for your data and identity by creating a private network that hides your real IP address (digital location). All of your activity is untraceable and secure because everything passes through an encrypted tunnel. Nobody can see into the tunnel, and everything inside is protected against online threats. This means that hackers, governments, and your internet service provider will be unable to access any of your information.</p><h2>Do you need a VPN?</h2><p>Investing in a VPN is one of the best ways to ensure your safety and anonymity online. VPNs are vital tools in the fight against scammers and cybercriminals, but there's another reason you might consider these security services. And it has nothing to do with security.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

            <svg class="inline-block ml-1 w-4 h-4 font-normal fill-current"><use href="https://mashable.com/images/icons/spritemap.svg#sprite-arrow-right-thin"></use></svg>

<p>VPNs can be used to <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-for-streaming-uk" target="_self">unlock streaming services</a> from around the world, including the likes of <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-netflix" target="_self">Netflix</a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-amazon-prime-video-uk" target="_self">Prime Video</a>, and Disney+. How do they do this? It's actually a really simple process, and it can significantly boost your content options. All you need to do is open up your preferred VPN, connect to a server from another country in order to spoof your IP to another address, and then head to your preferred streaming site. This process tricks the site into thinking you are based in another country, meaning you can watch all that great content that is normally blocked.</p><p>VPNs are really useful for cybersecurity and streaming, which means they should be a worthwhile investment for just about everyone.</p><h2>What should you know before subscribing to a VPN?</h2><p>Selecting a VPN that is right for you is not easy, because there are a lot of options all offering similar packages. To make the decision a little simpler, we have highlighted a selection of the most important things to consider before making any sort of purchase:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Connection speed </strong>&mdash; This is absolutely vital whether you're looking to use a VPN for online security or streaming. It's normal for a VPN to result in a drop in your connection speed, but you shouldn't accept anything significant.</p></li><li><p><strong>Encryption </strong>&mdash; We know that a lot of people will be using VPNs for streaming, but these services are primarily designed to provide cybersecurity, so encryption is important. The best VPNs will offer powerful protection for your data, meaning that everything is unreadable and untraceable.</p></li><li><p><strong>Number of connections </strong>&mdash; You should seek out a VPN that offers multiple simultaneous connections, so you can stay protected on all your devices at the same time. This is also beneficial for large families or households with multiple people likely to be online at the same time.</p></li><li><p><strong>Privacy policy </strong>&mdash; The best VPNs should be very clear about how they handle, store, and use your data. These practices should be laid out in a privacy policy, and if they aren't super clear, you should look elsewhere.</p></li><li><p><strong>Server network </strong>&mdash; The best VPNs provide access to thousands of servers located all around the world. This is useful as you should always be able to find a stable and speedy connection for <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-vpn-streaming-movies-uk" target="_self"><u>streaming</u></a>, shopping, or browsing.</p></li></ul><p>There are plenty of other things that are worth considering, like bandwidth, apps for certain operating systems, and customer support, but these are probably the most important features to keep in mind.</p><h2>Should you use free VPNs?</h2><p>With free versions of popular VPNs and free trials of VPNs with full access to everything you get with a premium plan, why would you ever pay? As with most things in life, you get what you pay for with VPNs. </p><p>There tends to always be a catch with free versions, and it's normally in the form of limited data usage. If you're just an occasional user, these plans will work fine. But if you're going to be streaming or downloading, this isn't going to work. Free trials are a little bit different: they come with everything you get in a paid plan, but obviously they don't tend to last very long. Trials are great for testing out a service before committing, but this isn't a long-term solution. </p><p>To gain access to advanced security features without limitations on usage, you need to pay up. The best VPNs are generally the most expensive, but there are plenty of <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-cheap-vpn-services-uk" target="_self"><u>cheap plans</u></a> out there, especially if you're willing to commit to a lengthy contract. </p><h2>What is the best VPN?</h2><p>There are a lot of VPNs out there, and we recommend taking some time to carefully access all your options. Once you have established exactly what you need, you can turn your attention to finding the best deals on all the top VPNs. </p><p>We have reached out to partners in order to line up a list of the best deals on the most popular providers, to help you save big. You can find all the best deals on the likes of <a href="https://go.expressvpn.com/c/190434/1462855/16063" target="_blank">ExpressVPN</a>, <a href="https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=340&amp;aff_id=682&amp;aff_sub=mashablebestvpndeal" target="_blank">NordVPN</a>, <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/8608?pageview_type=RSS&template=roundup&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=PureVPN&object_type=roundup&object_uuid=02qLcv6rKrrWvpfnvVvjhgo&short_url=8608&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">PureVPN</a>, and more.</p><p>These are the best VPN deals in 2024.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Or so goes the popular English children's rhyme. But a more pertinent question might actually be this: Just how bloomin&rsquo; big is it? Because gardens aren't only about relaxing in the sunshine. It takes hard work to maintain them. In other words, it you have a lawn it will need to be cut. And the size and cutting requirements will dictate the lawn mower you use. </p><p>If you're wondering whether you actually need a decent lawn mower, the answer is almost certainly yes. Gardens can be hard work, but a lawn mower does most of the work for you. And you can find suitable lawn mowers for just about every type of garden. Nowadays, gardeners can purchase manual, electric, <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-cordless-lawn-mowers-uk" target="_self"><u>cordless</u></a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-robot-lawnmowers-uk" target="_self"><u>robot</u></a>, and <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-petrol-lawn-mowers-uk" target="_self"><u>petrol</u></a> lawn mowers from recognisable brands like Bosch, Hyundai, and Flymo.</p><p>We can't pick the best lawn mower for you, because it ultimately depends on your garden and gardening habits. But we've dug through the weeds to help steer you in the right direction. In other words, we've shortlisted a selection of impressive lawn mowers that will offer a solution for every type of garden and gardener. But to get you started, here&rsquo;s some helpful information.</p><h2>Are there different types of lawn mower?</h2><p>It&rsquo;s not quite as straightforward as just strolling into B&amp;Q and picking up the first mower you see. There are regular corded lawn mowers that plug into the mains, cordless battery-powered mowers, manual push-mowers, robot lawn mowers, and even tractor-like lawn mowers that you can ride on.</p><h2>Are cordless lawn mowers better than electric?</h2><p>Electric lawn mowers might seem slightly behind the times with the increasing availability of battery-powered and robot mowers, but there are benefits to electric lawn mowers. They&rsquo;re generally cheaper and totally reliable. The main drawback is that you need an accessible power outlet. And if you have an especially big garden, you&rsquo;ll need to make sure the cord can stretch far enough to cover the whole lawn. Indeed, they can have limited range or get tangled as you mow. Cordless lawn mowers give you a much bigger range and easier handling, but they can be a little pricier &mdash; and there&rsquo;s the added issue of needing to keep it charged.</p><h2>What are the benefits of a robot lawn mower?</h2><p>Like their indoor counterpart &mdash; the <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/roundup/best-robot-vacuums-uk" target="_self">robot vacuum cleaner</a> &mdash; robot mowers take all the work out of cutting the grass. Put your feet up and let them do the hard work. It&rsquo;s really that simple. But they&rsquo;re also smarter that that. You can map out routes, helped by smart apps and guidance wires, and the mower will get to work every day. They can even make adjustments to the schedule based on the weather, get into tricky spots that regular mowers can&rsquo;t reach, and will return to their charging station automatically. The ultimate in luxury, effort-free gardening.</p><h2>What is the best lawn mower for large gardens?</h2><p>While there are electric, cordless, and robot mowers made for big lawns, the best mower for the job is probably a petrol lawn mower. Petrol lawn mowers give you serious power to cover more ground and mow through tough grass and even tougher terrain. The downside is that petrol lawn mowers can be absolute beasts &mdash; heavy, noisy, and hard to handle. For a pro-level job, however, they&rsquo;re seriously tough to beat.</p><h2>What is the best lawn mower?</h2><p>It all depends on the kind of garden you have and what best suits your needs, but we have tracked down examples of every type of mower so you can get a taste of what's on offer. We've checked out reviews, customer feedback, and everything you need to know about the best lawn mowers, so you don't need to spend hours doing the research. The result is this selection of impressive devices for you to check out.</p><p>These are the best lawn mowers in 2024.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In the past, Apple has deviated from this cadence due to reported production hindrances (e.g., supply chain issues). For example, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/france-suspends-iphone-12-sales-high-radiation-levels" target="_self">the iPhone 12</a> and the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-iphone-14-plus-review" target="_self">iPhone 14 Plus</a> shipped in October, but typically, we get new iPhones unveiled some time during the first half of September every year.</p><h2><strong>iPhone 16 design</strong></h2><p>Let&rsquo;s dive into arguably the most important aspect of the iPhone&rsquo;s design: the screen. </p><p>There haven&rsquo;t been any significant changes to the display sizes since the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/iphone-12-and-iphone-12-pro-review" target="_self">iPhone 12</a>, but according to reliable leaker <a href="https://twitter.com/URedditor" target="_blank"><u>Unknownz21</u></a>, the upper-tier iPhone 16 models are going to be a little bit more unwieldy in your hands. For an overview of how the iPhone 16 may look, here are some renders:</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>As you can see, you'll find the Action Button, which was left out of the lower-tier models on the current generation iPhone, now present on the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus. More on that later.</p><h3><strong>Display</strong></h3><p>The iPhone 16 Pro will reportedly have a 6.3-inch display while the iPhone 16 Pro Max will pack a 6.9-inch panel. You may be wondering, &ldquo;What about the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus? Will they get a screen size bump, too?&rdquo; The answer is likely no. The lower-tier models will reportedly have the same display sizes as their predecessors.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>However, he offered slightly different numbers: 6.2 inches and 6.8 inches. What could be the reason behind the discrepancy? According to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/16/iphone-16-display-sizes/" target="_blank"><u>MacRumors</u></a>, it&rsquo;s "likely due to the difference between actual display area and viewable display area."</p><p>Another rumor we're hearing is that the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-iphone-16-60z-refresh-rate" target="_self">iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus will continue to have 60Hz refresh-rate displays.</a> This is a little disappointing considering other phones in the market at least have 90Hz screens, making navigating through the UI smoother, zippier and seamless.</p><p>Finally, according to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/10/iphone-16-pro-brighter-display/" target="_blank">MacRumors</a>, citing popular Weibo leaker "Instant Digital," the iPhone 16 Pro will reportedly have a 20% brighter display for SDR content. In other words, the iPhone 16 Pro will reportedly emanate up to 1,200 nits of brightness.</p><h3><strong>Thinner bezels</strong></h3><p>The iPhone 16 will also reportedly have slimmer bezels, according to a report from <a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=27023" target="_blank">The Elec</a> (h/t <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/04/iphone-16-even-thinner-bezels/" target="_blank">MacRumors</a>). Apple is tipped to be using something called Border Reduction Structure (BRS) technology, which reduces the internal footprint of the circuitry inside, allowing for thinner bezels (without sacrificing anything important aspects like display performance, for example).</p><p>Thinner bezels means that the iPhone 16 series should yield more screen real estate for users.</p><p>In fact, according to popular leaker <a href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1797408311513600503" target="_blank">IceUniverse</a>, the iPhone 16 Pro models will have the world's narrowest bezels.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>A tipster from <a href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5040859970798441" target="_blank">Weibo concurred with IceUniverse's claim</a>, adding that the iPhone 16 Pro series will have the following bezel measurements:</p><ul><li><p><strong>iPhone 16 Pro - 1.2mm</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>iPhone 16 Pro Max - 1.15mm</strong></p></li></ul><p>For reference, the iPhone 15 Pro models' bezels have a thickness of about 1.71mm, give or take.</p><h3><strong>Dimensions</strong></h3><p>Thanks to yet another leak from IceUniverse, it appears that we now have information of the most premium next-generation iPhone:</p><ul><li><p>iPhone 16 Pro Max reportedly measures 163.024mm &times; 77.575mm &times; 8.26mm</p></li></ul><p>According to the aforementioned measurements, the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-bezel" target="_self">iPhone 16 Pro Max is bigger than its predecessor</a>: 1mm thicker, 3.1mm taller, and 0.88mm wider.</p><h3><strong>Action Button</strong></h3><p>A report from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/30/iphone-16-action-button-all-models/" target="_blank">MacRumors</a> claims that every single model in the iPhone 16 line will feature an Action Button &mdash; not just the iPhone 15 Pro variants. The current-gen iPhone 15 Pro models' Action Button can be programmed to launch a range of apps and functions, including Flashlight, Camera, Silent Mode, Voice Memo, Focus, Magnifier, Translate (coming to iOS 17.2), and a range of accessibility features.</p><p>When iPhone 16 drops, however, the rumor mill states that Apple will add more functionality to the Action Button.</p><h3><strong>Capture Button</strong></h3><p>The Action Button was all the rage for the iPhone 15 series, however, according to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/iphone-16-capture-button/" target="_blank">MacRumors</a> and <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-plans-iphone-camera-button-as-creators-shift-to-horizontal-videos?rc=bdqvyp" target="_blank">The Information</a>, a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/iphone-16-camera-button" target="_self">new Capture Button</a> will be one of the biggest selling points for the iPhone 16. Reportedly placed slightly under the power button, the Capture Button is a camera-focused feature that can do the following:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Zoom in and out of photos/videos with swiping gestures</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Allows users to focus on subjects</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Activates the shutter button</strong></p></li></ul><p>While MacRumors and The Information both concur that Apple is testing a "capture button" on the iPhone 16, both aren't on the same page on whether it's a mechanical button or a capacitive one. MacRumors says it's the latter, but The Information claims it's both.</p><h3><strong>Solid-state buttons</strong></h3><p>Apple reportedly planned on introducing solid-state buttons with the iPhone 15 Pro models, but instead, we got a customizable Action Button. For the uninitiated, solid-state buttons aren&rsquo;t buttons <em>per se </em>&ndash; they&rsquo;re panels that feature haptic feedback sensations that simulate real button presses (Think of the iPhone SE series' Home button). On the plus side, the solid-state buttons aren&rsquo;t totally out of the picture. According to respected <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/two-iphone-15-pro-models-removal-of-solid-state-button-design-negatively-affects-cirrus-logic-and-a456d5e7386c" target="_blank"><u>Apple leaker and analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</u></a>, Apple is working on debuting solid-state buttons on the iPhone 16 Pro models instead.<br></p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Kuo added that these solid-state buttons will add two additional <a href="https://apple.fandom.com/wiki/Taptic_Engine" target="_blank">Taptic Engines</a>, which will help fire off tangible feedback to users. (If this is true, the number of Taptic Engines in the iPhone 16 will increase to three &mdash; up from one.)</p><p>According to a tip from Weibo (via <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/iphone-16-extra-button-rumor/" target="_blank">MacRumors</a>), the Action Button on the iPhone 16 Pro will be a solid-state button and sit flush against the chassis. To make room for this change, Apple will reportedly move the mmWave antenna to the left of the iPhone 16 Pro as opposed to the right. This Weibo tip comes from a leaker with the moniker "Instant Digital," a bean spiller that reportedly has an accurate track record, according to MacRumors.</p><h2><strong>iPhone 16 colors</strong></h2><p>According to a leak dropped on X, the iPhone 16 comes in five colors: white, black, blue, green, and pink.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>According to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/15/iphone-16-pro-wifi-7-48mp-ultra-wide-rumors/" target="_blank"><u>Jeff Pu</u></a>, a tech analyst from Haitong International Securities (a Hong Kong investment firm), the ultrawide cameras are getting a boost, too.</p><p>Pu stated tthe iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max models will also feature a 48-megapixel ultrawide camera with better light gathering. As such, camera performance in dimmer environments should improve. As it stands now, the iPhone 15 Pro models have a 12MP ultrawide camera. </p><p>The ultrawide camera is perfect for taking landscape photos, allowing you to capture more scenery. However, compared to the main camera, the ultrawide lens tends to deliver a slight drop in crispness and sharpness. If this rumor is true, the new 48-megapixel ultrawide camera may ameliorate this minor foible.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/sony%E7%94%A2%E8%83%BD%E5%9B%A0iphone-16%E5%B0%87%E6%8E%A1%E6%9B%B4%E5%A4%9A%E5%A0%86%E7%96%8A%E8%A8%AD%E8%A8%88cis%E8%80%8C%E6%8C%81%E7%BA%8C%E7%B7%8A%E5%BC%B5%E8%87%B32025-%E6%9C%89%E5%88%A9%E9%9F%8B%E7%88%BE%E9%A0%98%E5%85%88%E6%89%8B%E6%A9%9F%E7%94%A2%E6%A5%AD%E8%A7%B8%E5%BA%95%E4%B8%A6%E6%81%A2%E5%BE%A9%E6%88%90%E9%95%B7%E8%88%87%E7%94%A2%E5%93%81%E7%B5%84%E5%90%88%E5%BF%AB%E9%80%9F%E6%94%B9%E5%96%84-sonys-capacity-will-remain-dd387a74afe" target="_blank"><u>Ming-Chi Kuo</u></a> claims that Apple will upgrade the rear cameras on the iPhone 16 Pro models, introducing a stacked design.

<h2><strong>iPhone 16 battery life</strong></h2><p>As we reported in early April, a Weibo leaker by the name of "OvO Baby Sauce OvO" seemingly unveiled the new <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-iphone-16-plus-battery-size-reduction" target="_self">new battery sizes across the iPhone 16 lineup</a>:</p><ul><li><p><strong>iPhone 16:</strong> 3,561mAh</p></li><li><p><strong>iPhone 16 Plus:</strong> 4,006mAh</p></li><li><p><strong>iPhone 16 Pro:</strong> 3,355mAh</p></li><li><p><strong>iPhone 16 Pro Max:</strong> 4,676mAh</p></li></ul><p>All the iPhone 16 models have some sort of <em>increase </em>from two to six percent <em>except </em>for the iPhone 16 Plus, which reportedly has a reduction of nearly nine percent compared to the <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-iphone-15-plus-review" target="_self">iPhone 15 Plus</a>.</p><p>Keep in mind that an increase in battery size doesn't necessarily mean that the device will deliver longer battery life. And in the same vein, a battery size reduction doesn't necessarily lead to shorter runtimes. There are other aspects at play (the display's efficiency, for example). So we won't know for sure how battery life is affected until we get the phones in our hands.</p><p>It's also worth noting that <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/%E4%BF%A1%E7%B6%AD%E9%80%9A%E4%BF%A1%E7%82%BA%E6%96%B0%E6%AC%BEiphone-16-pro-max%E7%9A%84%E9%9B%BB%E6%B1%A0%E8%83%BD%E9%87%8F%E5%AF%86%E5%BA%A6%E5%8D%87%E7%B4%9A%E7%9A%84%E4%B8%BB%E8%A6%81%E5%8F%97%E7%9B%8A%E8%80%85-sunway-is-a-major-beneficiary-of-the-new-iphone-16-pro-9df9c5cd3913" target="_blank">Kuo</a> claimed that Apple is increasing the the iPhone 16 Pro Max's "battery energy density,"</p><h2><strong>iPhone 16 specs</strong></h2><p>The iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are equipped with 8GB of RAM while the lower-tier models, the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro Max, are stuck with their predecessors&rsquo; 6GB of RAM.

<h3><strong><br>Storage</strong></h3><p>According to news aggregator account "yeux1122" from Naver, a Korean blog, the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max will feature options that offer <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/iphone-16-pro-2tb-option-rumor/" target="_blank">2TB of storage</a>.</p><p>That is double the current max storage capacity of the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><h3><strong>Chipset</strong></h3><p>In recent years, Apple has followed the trend of putting <em>last year's </em>chip into the two entry-level models while the Pro models, the Pro and the Pro Max, get the new-generation chip. For example, the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus got the A16 Bionic chip, the same inside the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max. However, the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max got outfitted with the <em>new </em>A17 Pro chips.</p><p>If this pattern continues, it should follow that the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus get the A17 Pro while the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max get the A18 chips. Pu hinted that this is how it will be for the iPhone 16 line, hinting that the A17 Pro will reportedly be less efficient. In other words, the iPhone 16 models equipped with this chip may take a battery life hit. This is because the next-generation chip will offer tremendous performance gains at the expense of power efficiency.</p><p>However, another rumor tells a different story. </p><p>According to an alleged iOS 18 code leak from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/20/ios-18-code-four-new-iphone-models/" target="_blank">MacRumors</a>, the<strong> entire</strong> iPhone 16 line will get<em> </em>an<em> </em>A18 chip. However, there&rsquo;s a chance that Apple will use a &ldquo;Pro&rdquo; identifier name to differentiate from the standard and Pro models (e.g., A18 chip and A18 Pro).</p><p>The iPhone 16 Pro models will also reportedly support Wi-Fi 7 (current models support WiFi 6E). Wi-Fi 7 should offer zippy transfer speeds that exceed 40 Gbps, quadrupling what WiFi 6E can do.</p><p>According to Pu (via <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/10/12/iphone-16-pro-faster-5g-wi-fi-7/" target="_blank"><em>9to5Mac</em></a>), the iPhone 16 Pro will come with Qualcomm&rsquo;s Snapdragon X75 modem, which can reach a 5G download rate of up to 7.5 Gbps.</p><p><em>We&rsquo;ll periodically update this rumor hub as new iPhone 16 leaks trickle in, so be sure to bookmark this page.&nbsp;</em></p><p></p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

      <description><![CDATA[A sprint of comedy excellence is now running in "Cellino V. Barnes." Review.]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/07xcXBQM6AQVF7qnXvF4EF8/hero-image.jpg" alt="Noah Weisberg and Eric William Morris in "Cellino V. Barnes.""><p>What do you know about Cellino and Barnes? If you've spent time anywhere near Buffalo, New York, you might know of them as the law firm behind the insidiously catchy jingle that played for over 25 years across TV and radio: "Cellino and Barnes! Injury attorneys! 800-888-8888!" </p><p>But you don't need to be a local to have heard this dastardly ditty; it's spawned a celebrity-studded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qHwRwX6UzE" target="_blank"><u>viral challenge</u></a>, as well as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpmjtZWVN0A" target="_blank">a <em>Saturday Night Live</em> skit</a>. Of course, their accidentally amusing billboards are a <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/injured-billboard" target="_blank"><u>meme</u></a> unto themselves. But even if you know nothing else about their sordid history, that's more than enough to revel in every moment of the new off-Broadway comedy <em>Cellino V. Barnes</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>In the vein of contemporary off-Broadway hits like campy Celine Dion jukebox musical <em>Titanique </em>and Cole Escola's Mary Todd Lincoln spoof <em>Oh, Mary!</em> (which has since made the leap to Broadway)<em>, Cellino V. Barnes</em> is far less concerned with the truth behind their story, and far more focused on unleashing madcap humor upon its giddy audience. In fact, reading up on the real-life Ross Cellino and Steve A. Barnes only makes this show more remarkable. Played by Eric William Morris and Noah Weisberg, these regionally recognizable "ambulance chasers" are not the mercurial family man and the hard-nosed military vet depicted in the 2020 <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/cellino-and-barnes-breakup.html" target="_blank"><em><u>New York </u></em><u>magazine<em> </em></u><u>expos&eacute;,</u></a> which thoroughly detailed their break-up after decades together. Instead, playwrights Mike B. Breen and David Rafailedes reimagine them as an arrogant buffoon and his slyly sophisticated sidekick, determined to make big bucks through marketing... and ambulance chasing.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the course of just 74 minutes &mdash; with no intermission &mdash;&nbsp;<em>Cellino V. Barnes </em>spins a story that is outrageous, entertaining, and even a bit poignant.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Cellino V. Barnes</em> reimagines its heroes in a buddy-cop comedy.&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Swaggering on stage in a sharp plaid suit, suspenders, and clip-on tie, Eric William Morris instantly depicts Ross Cellino as Gordon Gecko wannabe, a "greed is good" businessman who refuses to play by the rules. By contrast, Noah Weisberg's Steve Barnes &mdash;&nbsp;wearing a bright blue suit and a bald cap slicked with an unflattering ring of brown hair &mdash; is comically conciliatory, showering the hot-shot nepo baby with praise to get a job at Cellino's dad's firm. Where others see this slick slip-and-fall lawyer as a huckster, Barnes sees in Cellino's shameless litigiousness &mdash; he'd even sue a dog! &mdash; a huge potential for fame and fortune. </p><p>Minutes into their meeting, they've not only bonded but are plotting their own law firm. And naturally, that means they need what every self-respecting attorney has: a jingle. </p><p>A pitch-perfect spoof of every bad musician biopic, <em>Cellino V. Barnes </em>presents the creation of the teeny tune as a moment of divine inspiration. A spotlight shines on Cellino, who has a bizarre affinity for the number eight. Then, like an angel &mdash;&nbsp;or "Cellino Dion" &mdash;&nbsp;he lets loose the unforgettable jingle, earning applause and giggles from the knowing audience. And that's just the first half.&nbsp;</p><h2>Eric William Morris and Noah Weisberg make a crackling comedy duo.&nbsp;</h2><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>From the moment their characters connect over a ludicrous lawsuit, Morris and Weisberg click. With his chest out and his chin in the air, eyes wild, Morris has the gusto of a coked-up Foghorn Leghorn, whether he's venting about his daddy issues or ranting about his deranged dedication to girls hockey. Weisberg balances this manic energy with a bouncy guilelessness, even as the pair talks loan-sharking or a particular case filing so juicy it's basically orgasmic.&nbsp;</p><p>Together, the two create a fast-paced and fluid banter that ranges from bonkers bromance to brutal break-up. Playwrights Breen and Rafailedes give them the fuel with a screenplay that is relentlessly stuffed with jokes. Meanwhile, directors Wesley Taylor and Alex Wyse have created a simple staging of a few filing cabinets, a desk, and a handful of office supplies,&nbsp;with a near-breathless pacing. Whenever a bit runs the risk of growing stale, the play swiftly shifts, anticipating the audience's flagging interest by presenting a new plot development or a fresh gag. And Morris and Weisberg make it all look easy as they leap across decades, from 1997 to 2007 to the 2010s, creating a compelling arc even amid the extreme silliness.&nbsp;</p><h2>I didn't expect <em>Cellino V.

<p>Before seeing this play, I didn't spend much time pondering the emotional weight of the break-up of Cellino &amp; Barnes. I'd wager to say that I'm like a lot of New Yorkers, where I was mostly shocked and a bit bemused when their billboards took sides, either becoming Cellino Law or the Barnes Firm. But sitting in the Asylum theater, I found myself gasping in alarm when the two started throwing down "passive-aggressive memos" (which, yes, are based on real &mdash; and really petty &mdash;&nbsp;missives between the former law partners).</p><p>While <em>Cellino V. Barnes </em>is an unabashedly silly spoof of the injury attorneys' story, it's also empathetic. Amid the manic mugging of Morris and the comedic clucking of Weisberg, the two establish such a rich chemistry that it stings when their characters turn their fire on each other. Perhaps this is why the play ends more sweetly than the actual Cellino and Barnes story, in which they became estranged before the latter died in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/02/nyregion/stephen-barnes-dead-plane-crash.html" target="_blank">a plane crash</a> in 2020. Like <em>Furious 7, </em>the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/fast-and-furious-movies-ranked" target="_self">Fast and Furious movie</a> to which all plays dream to be compared, <em>Cellino V. Barnes </em>offers its audiences a sweeter resolution that invites us to celebrate the long-running partnership over its messy ending (or at least alongside it). Perhaps the fat payday is not the millions earned from personal injury lawsuits, but the friends we made along the way?&nbsp;</p><p>In the end, <em>Cellino V. Barnes </em>is sublimely stupid and a bit brilliant. Relishing in the tabloid elements of the true story, its playwrights spin a yarn that doesn't lean so hard into the real attorneys that an unfamiliar audience might be left in the cold. Committed and kooky, Morris and Weisberg create characters whole cloth that are as hilarious as they are compelling. Combined with a snappy direction, this play's humor hits so fast and hard, it's not just thrilling. It might be exactly the kind of the shock to the system its crooked counselors would drool to litigate over.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://zdcs.link/0PDWr?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Cellino%20V.%20Barnes%20is%20playing%20for%2012%20weeks%20at%20the%20Asylum%20in%20New%20York%20City.%C2%A0&object_type=article&object_uuid=07xcXBQM6AQVF7qnXvF4EF8&short_url=0PDWr&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"><em><u>Cellino V.

<h2><strong>Reddit wants search engines to pay due to AI training</strong></h2><p>Last week, tech outlet <a href="https://www.404media.co/google-is-the-only-search-engine-that-works-on-reddit-now-thanks-to-ai-deal/" target="_blank"><u>404 Media</u></a> reported that Reddit was <a href="https://mashable.com/article/reddit-google-excludes-bing-duckduckgo-search-engines" target="_self"><u>blocking</u></a> search engine's like Microsoft Bing and DuckDuckGo from crawling the platform and indexing its pages. As a result, recent Reddit posts would no longer show up in Bing or DuckDuckGo search results.</p><p>One search engine that is still providing Reddit posts in its search results is Google. That's thanks to a $60 million <a href="https://mashable.com/article/reddit-traffic-google-search-update" target="_self"><u>deal</u></a> Google and Reddit agreed to that allows the search giant to train its AI models on Reddit's data.</p><p>Along with Google, Reddit has also signed a deal with OpenAI, which will now be able to include Reddit posts in the search results for its new <a href="https://mashable.com/article/openai-searchgpt-chatgpt-announcement" target="_self"><u>SearchGPT</u></a> search product.</p><p>Huffman specifically cited Microsoft and AI companies Anthropic and Perplexity as examples of those that they are currently blocking for not negotiating on how they can use Reddit's data.&nbsp;</p><p>The Reddit CEO also noted that it was "a real pain in the ass to block these companies," but claimed that it was necessary especially in light of comments from Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman about publicly accessible data on the open web being equivalent to "freeware," and, thus, fair game for AI models to train on.</p><p>Reddit certainly has legitimate concerns regarding AI companies training their models on data without providing compensation to the platforms they're scraping and crawling. However, the side effect of Reddit content disappearing from search engines is also unfortunate and doesn't bode well for the future of the internet. </p><p>It seems, however, that these are the consequences of search engine companies now becoming AI companies too.</p><p>Mashable has reached out to Reddit for confirmation and comment, and will update if we hear back.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><em>A Quiet Place: Day One</em> follows Sam, played by Lupita Nyong'o, on the day the Death Angels arrive on Earth.

<p>In the generative AI era, businesses are clambering to AI-ify their products. But how customers feel about automated systems is still very much up for debate. Generative AI has proven to be lucrative for some things, but not everything. Just this week, Meta <a href="https://mashable.com/article/meta-ai-celebrity-avatars-getting-axed" target="_self">axed its celebrity AI personas</a> after low engagement, and Google's AI search summaries got the wrong kind of attention for recommending users do things like <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-ai-overviews-weird-responses-explained" target="_self">put glue on their pizza</a>. Customer service and sales have used automated systems for years, but talking to AI at the drive-thru is fairly new territory.</p><p>The Taco Bell chatbot builds on the restaurant's existing digital ordering kiosk. Now instead of giving your order to a Taco Bell employee, you'll talk to a bot which relays the information on the screen. Taco Bell said it designed Voice AI to take some of the back-of-house work off of staffers' plates. "Benefits include easing task load for team members, improving order accuracy, providing a consistent, friendly experience, and reducing wait times, while driving profitable growth for Taco Bell, Yum! Brands and their franchisees," said the announcement. Taco Bell did not respond to Mashable about whether implementation of Voice AI is mandatory for all franchises at the time of publication.</p><p>The company also said it would "elevate the order experience for consumers." But interacting with chatbots doesn't always go smoothly. McDonald's learned that the hard way when it attempted a similar AI-ordering experience. The Golden Arches scrapped its plan in June after numerous failures that quickly <a href="https://www.today.com/food/news/mcdonalds-ai-drive-thru-fails-tiktok-rcna70851" target="_blank">went viral</a> on TikTok. In one instance, the McDonald's chatbot mistakenly added 28 orders of Chicken McNuggets. </p><blockquote class="tiktok-embed" data-video-id="7198528478533258542" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;">

<p>Wendy's has also <a href="https://mashable.com/article/wendys-ai-drive-through" target="_self">jumped on the AI-ordering</a> bandwagon. Although it's been possible to order your Frosty from a chatbot for over a year, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wendys/comments/1cb846n/dear_wendys_please_get_rid_of_ai_ordering_at_the/" target="_blank">many customers</a> are begging Wendy's to make it stop. </p><div class="reddit">

<p>Despite failures from its fast food rivals, Taco Bell is charging ahead. KFC, which is also owned by Yum! Brands is also testing Voice AI at five locations in Australia. So, like it or not, AI bots are very much on the menu. </p><p class="mx-auto">
   <em><strong>UPDATE: Aug. 2, 2024, 4:23 p.m. EDT </strong>A Taco Bell spokesperson provided the following information after this story was published:

"The technology enables customers to interact just as they would with a team member, providing a friendly and seamless experience. If needed, a team member can provide assistance quickly. [...] The Voice AI drive thru technology is completely voice-operated, allowing customers to place orders just as they would at a traditional drive thru. [...] We&rsquo;re in the early stages of testing Voice AI in partnership with operators and franchisees at more than 100 company-owned and franchise restaurants as we prepare for a rollout to hundreds more locations throughout the remainder of the year."</em>

And the arena &mdash; and the internet &mdash; promptly erupted in cheers. </p><p>It was a much closer competition than most would have predicted after Biles made a few mistakes in the uneven bars. Biles, however, was too strong overall in the other three events &mdash; vault, balance beam, and floor. It's the sixth Olympic gold medal of her career. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Her last Olympics experience was difficult. She had to withdraw from much of the 2021 games in Tokyo while dealing with "the twisties," which is a dangerous phenomenon where gymnasts encounter a mental block doing their routines. The return to glory at the 2024 games marks a remarkable comeback. Since Biles also took home the gold at Rio 2016, the win on Thursday marked the first woman to win two all-around Olympic titles in decades, dating back to the '60s.</p><p>It was a huge day for Biles and confirmation of something we already knew: She's the best to ever do it.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

But <a href="https://mashable.com/article/dating-app-fatigue-has-led-to-a-flurry-of-irl-singles-events" target="_self">dating is tough</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/19/opinion/male-loneliness.html" target="_blank">men are lonely</a>, and <a href="https://thoughtcatalog.com/shahida-arabi/2023/12/hundreds-of-women-share-why-they-quit-dating-apps-and-men-say-theyre-happier-single/" target="_blank">women are sick of men's antics</a>. Swooping in to save the day are <a href="https://mashable.com/article/exclusive-dating-apps-raya-the-league-lox-club" target="_self">"exclusive" dating apps</a> like Raya, which promises a user base of vetted, career-oriented (<em>hot and rich) </em>professionals &mdash; for a price. That price is $25 a month, and the unfortunate truth is Raya, "the celebrity dating app," is just like every other service one can find in the App Store. (Mashable has reached out to Raya for comment.)</p><p>I spent one month on Raya, after waiting 10 days to get approved before I could shell out for a membership. My mission? To see if the app was overrun with TikTok influencers. Spoiler: either they weren't there, or they were so niche that my mildly-online self couldn't spot them.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>Instead, Raya's vibe felt so <a href="https://mashable.com/category/tinder" target="_self">Tinder</a>-esque, so reminiscent of other swipe-based apps that, I truly believe we as a society have hit critical mass dating app singularity.</p><h2>What is Raya &mdash; and can an average person use it?</h2><p>Raya, known as the "celebrity dating app," is marketed as an exclusive, members-only platform for the elite and ultra-connected. Imagine Tinder but with a velvet rope. Supposedly, getting in requires more than just a catchy bio; you need referrals, approval through a vetting process, and a solid Instagram game. Once you're in, expect a feed of curated, career-focused hotties &mdash; think models, actors, musicians, and entrepreneurs. At $25 a month (or $50 for premium), it's a splurge that promises glam and privacy, as the app is very uptight about discretion. Raya has strict rules against sharing information or taking screenshots of user profiles.</p><p>Part of Raya's allure to average people like me is the potential celebrity encounters. Case in point: The internet lit up in 2021<strong> </strong>when TikTok user Nivine Nash shared a video claiming that Oscar-winning filmmaker and actor Ben Affleck had previously matched with her on Raya. After unmatching, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@nivinenash/video/6958092416284921093?lang=en" target="_blank">she received a video message from Affleck himself</a>, asking, "Why did you unmatch me? It's me."</p><p>The story quickly went viral, shedding light on the fact that yes, even A-listers are swiping away on dating apps. In fact, <a href="https://www.mamamia.com.au/celebrities-on-dating-app-raya/" target="_blank">several celebs</a> have been <a href="https://thelatch.com.au/what-is-raya-secret-dating-app-for-celebrities/" target="_blank">outed for their (alleged) time</a> on Raya including Owen Wilson, Chris Rock, Zach Braff, Elijah Wood, Sharon Stone, Cara Delevingne, and John Cusack.</p><p>According to a 2018 <em>New York Times </em>article, only <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/27/style/raya-dating-app.html" target="_blank">eight percent of Raya applicants are accepted</a>, making it supposedly harder to get into than Harvard Business School. That statistic was published six years ago, though, and Raya's exclusivity is a bit overhyped in my experience. Despite its reputation as the "[members' only club] Soho House of dating apps," the reality is far less glamorous than what those quoted influencers and testimonials make it out to be.</p><h2>The Raya experience</h2><p>So, here's how I got onto the app: I started with a simple, straightforward application. Raya asked for my name, date of birth, location, industry, occupation, and Instagram username. My Instagram? Locked, with a humble following of about 150. No big-shot referrals in sight. And it only took 10 days to get the coveted acceptance email &mdash; which surprised me, considering some say they've been on the waitlist for years. There's a whole subreddit dedicated to getting a referral for the app. Ludicrous stuff.</p><div class="reddit">

</div>
<p>Despite my modest social media presence, I made it through Raya's reportedly rigorous vetting process. According to that <em>New York Times</em> article, applications are allegedly reviewed by a committee of 500 people scrutinizing each Raya hopeful. Again, that was the status quo six years ago, but it's a process that promises exclusivity and high standards. As my experience reveals, though, the reality might not be as glamorous as the hype.</p><p>After getting the coveted approval, I curated my best photos, carefully selected a backing song that screamed "me," and eagerly logged in. And who was at the top of my queue? Not a celebrity, but a local nurse. Huh. So, the swiping began: blonde, blonde, blonde, blonde, blonde &mdash; seriously, where are the Black women on this app? &mdash; blonde, brunette, blonde. Raya founder and CEO Daniel Gendelman tried to assure the <em>Times </em>that the community was diverse, more focused on being interesting than an Instagram model aesthetic. My impulse was to screen-record this experience, but the app immediately flashed a warning. Not wanting to waste my $25 in one go, I decided to play it safe and moved on.</p><p>Swipe left, swipe right &mdash; it's the same drill as all the other apps. Swipe right too much, and you'll run out of likes (unless you're willing to pay for more). Swipe left too much, and Raya will cut you off for a while. That's their way of saying, "Stop being so picky."</p><p>Instead of a parade of celebrities, my time on Raya was a mix of consultants, aspiring actors, medical professionals, recruiters, and even students for some reason. Every profile is linked to Instagram, and I saw plenty of locked accounts with low follower counts, just like mine. Yeah, there were some people of high stature here, but everyone else is here too &mdash; so what's the point?</p><p>Here's the catch: if you're not in New York City or Los Angeles &mdash; which I'm not &mdash; good luck finding the celebs you're hoping for. And since Raya is ostensibly a global social networking platform, you can't filter by location. You also can't set your height, which isn't a big deal for me since I'm already short, but for some, it'd be nice to know.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<h2>Should you use Raya?</h2><p>To be completely honest, one of the few things I actually liked about Raya is its vetted user base. Unlike the free-for-all chaos of Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge, where <a href="https://mashable.com/article/dating-apps-tinder-bumble-hinge-catfishing-easy" target="_self">catfishing is possible</a>, Raya's users are the real deal.</p><p>Another plus? In this age of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-tiktok-became-a-place-for-tattletales" target="_self">TikTok and oversharing</a>, where everyone's spilling every detail of their lives for content, Raya offers a breath of privacy. Nobody wants their <a href="https://mashable.com/article/viral-hinge-message-shows-major-problem-with-dating-app-culture" target="_self">dating app chats or minor dating annoyances</a> broadcast to millions. Raya's no-screenshot policy is a godsend in this regard. Sure, it doesn't stop someone from forcing an actor to admit he's back in the dating game post-divorce, but it does keep most personal business under wraps.</p><p>Is this level of privacy and vetting worth $25 a month? Probably not. But good vibes and venture capital can only carry an app so far &mdash; you need revenue. Influencers might market the app as the "Soho House of dating apps," but the actual experience? It's more like an expensive Tinder with a better PR team.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The story of Meta's doomed AI personas highlights the growing challenge of shipping consumer-facing generative AI features that people actually want to use. While chatbots like ChatGPT have been undeniably successful, other tools have struggled to bring meaningful value or engagement to users. Many consider the addition of the Meta AI searchbar in Instagram, Facebook, and Messenger an annoying hindrance to the previous search interface &mdash;&nbsp;especially since it <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-turn-off-meta-ai" target="_self">can't be turned off</a>. And Google's <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-ai-overviews-benefit-of-doubt" target="_self">AI-generated search summaries</a> had a rocky start, that ranged from aggravating imposition to <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-ai-overviews-weird-responses-explained" target="_self">downright inaccurate</a>. </p><p>Meta <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/meta-is-paying-creators-millions-for-ai-chatbots?rc=fioipi" target="_blank">reportedly</a> paid its high-profile celebrities up to 5 million dollars for their likenesses over a two-year contract. But the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/meta-ai-dystopian-chatbot-kendall-jenner-persona" target="_self">confusing premise</a>, announced at last <a href="https://mashable.com/article/meta-connect-2023-ai-roundup-celebrities-personal-assistant" target="_self">September's Meta Connect</a>, may have inhibited any meaningful engagement.

<p>The AI personas had the celebrities' profile photos and their personality, but weren't actually AI replicas of the celebrities. The Padma Lakshmi persona, for example, inexplicably played a "travel expert" named Lorena. Links to these AI personas on Instagram now say the page is unavailable. </p><p>Instead of going forward with AI personas, Meta is trying other approaches to integrating generative AI into its platforms. On Tuesday, the company announced AI Studio, which lets users create AI replicas of themselves, much like the existing platform <a href="https://mashable.com/article/character-ai-generator-explained" target="_self">Character.ai</a>. The idea is for creators, or any user for that matter, to clone versions of themselves online and interact with other accounts (with a disclaimer saying it's AI). Meta has also deployed <a href="https://adage.com/article/digital-marketing-ad-tech-news/meta-ai-ads-what-know-about-image-and-headline-automation/2558161" target="_blank">AI tools for advertisers</a> to create images and copy for ads.  </p><p>So, we're saying goodbye to Billie (Kendall Jenner), Bru (Tom Brady), and Lorena (Padma Lakshmi), but Meta's efforts to foist AI on the masses isn't going away. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It's unclear whether these are the <em>only</em> colors we should expect from the 16 Pro &mdash; or if there will be at least one more to match the four color options that debuted last year. That would seem to be the case if you follow the leaks, as <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-iphone-16-pro-bronze-color" target="_self">one that came out of China this week</a> claimed there would be a bronze-like color for the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max. There were also rumblings of a new <a href="https://mashable.com/article/iphone-16-pro-rose-pink-color-reports" target="_self">"Rose" color</a>, but again, it's not present in the photo. </p><p>This may come as a disappointment to people who want the benefits of an iPhone 16 Pro, but also like vibrant colors. The base iPhone 16 will reportedly come in <a href="https://mashable.com/article/iphone-16-leaked-colors-photo" target="_self">five colors</a>, including blue and pink. Apple will confirm or deny all of this at some point in September.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Some of the most highly anticipated Apple Intelligence features, like <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-use-genmoji-on-ios-18" target="_self">Genmoji</a> (AI-generated emojis) and Image Playground (AI-generated images), are not available yet. However, there are still some Apple Intelligence utilities you can test right now &mdash; especially since they've made their first robust debut with the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-intelligence-how-to-install-ios-18-developer-beta" target="_self">iOS 18.1 developer beta</a> that Apple dropped on Monday.</p><p>With my <a href="https://mashable.com/article/iphone-15-pro-max-2-months" target="_self">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a>, I tested some Apple Intelligence features, and to be succinct, I appreciate how much it indulges my laziness. Of course, it's not perfect &mdash; not yet at least. After all, the iOS 18.1 developer beta is expectedly a bit rough-around-the-edges as Apple collects feedback from testers. (This is why you should always <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-backup-iphone" target="_self">backup your iPhone</a> before installing any iOS beta because it can be risky.) </p><p>Overall, though, Apple has something here that will make its "Pro" and "Pro Max" iPhone models even more enticing than ever. (Apple Intelligence is only available on the current-gen "Pro" variants: <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-review" target="_self">iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max</a>.)</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>As someone with an attention deficit, I can't help but get a little antsy after stumbling upon a wall of text or a verbose story. Typically, I'd read a few sentences and give up. However, with the "Summarize" tool, I received short-and-sweet synopses on articles that ramble, meander, and seem to go nowhere fast. In fact, at times, I found myself wanting to read a lengthy article <em>in its entirety </em>after the AI-powered summary revealed that the story is juicier than expected.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>That being said, when it comes to delving into dense articles, why would I use Google Chrome? I'm hopping and skipping over to Safari to take advantage of that new Apple Intelligence-powered Summarize tool.</p><p>The only downside, however, is that the Summarize tool tests my patience sometimes. It can be a few seconds too slow for my tastes, but this isn't unique to Apple Intelligence (ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini can be slow pokes, too.) But admittedly, it's worth the wait.</p><h2><strong>'Writing Tools' feature is surprisingly useful</strong></h2><p>One of the most popular use cases for AI, whether it's <a href="https://mashable.com/category/chatgpt" target="_self">ChatGPT</a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/wwdc-2024-apple-ai-gemini-chatgpt" target="_self">Google Gemini</a>, or <a href="https://mashable.com/article/what-is-copilot" target="_self">Copilot,</a> is "tone tuning" text. For example, you can drop in an email draft and ask those AI tools to help adjust your tone.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>However, I'll admit that I was one of those people who thought, "Pfft, I don't need an AI chatbot to tell me how to make something sound more professional!" As it turns out, the Apple Intelligence-based tone-adjustment tool, which can be accessed via the new Writing Tools feature, is a lot more helpful than I thought.</p><p>You'll be surprised how often you may <em>think </em>you're coming across friendly and congenial in emails and texts, but instead, your messages are being interpreted as prickly. </p><div class="raw-embed">

<p>To reduce the risk of this, I found myself using the "friendly" tone-adjustment tool to nix unintended snippiness. The best part is that I was able to use Writing Tools in almost <em>any</em> text field across the iOS 18.1 developer beta. I just highlight the words, hit "Writing Tools," and choose my desired tone.</p><p>As a result, I've definitely seen more positive responses from my co-workers, friends, and other loved ones.</p><h2><strong>No more endless scrolling on the Photos app</strong></h2><p>I take a <em>lot </em>of pictures and selfies, but no, I don't categorize them nor put them into albums (because, spoiler alert, I'm lazy). </p><p>I just let them pile up into a haphazard collection of random snapshots. Every now and then, however, I need to find that <em>one </em>picture, which requires me to scroll endlessly to find it.</p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

<p>Fortunately, with the iOS 18.1 developer beta, I can use natural language to search for a particular picture in the Photos app. For example, I typed the word "pancakes" to find a saved screenshot of my favorite IHOP order.</p><p>I could even type in the words "woman with a red top," and surprisingly, all of my selfies of me wearing red (my favorite color) surfaced.

<h2><strong>Siri is more helpful than ever</strong></h2><p>Siri received an AI-powered boost with Apple Intelligence, but my favorite perk is its contextual awareness.

<p>Siri is aware of which article I'm looking at, so it can snatch the URL and send it to my fianc&eacute; without needing to lift a single finger. (I'm telling you &mdash; I've been spoiled rotten.)</p><h2><strong>Is Apple Intelligence worth it?</strong></h2><p>As hinted at the outset, Apple Intelligence nurtures my laziness &mdash; and I dig that. I don't always want to suffer through several paragraphs to get to the author's point. I don't want to spend too much time hemming and hawing over how to best respond to someone. And finally, I don't want to scroll endlessly through my cluttered gallery to find a specific photo &mdash; it's like finding a needle in a haystack.</p><p>Apple Intelligence addresses all of those concerns. I was initially skeptical of Apple's new suite of AI features, but as it turns out, Apple Intelligence is useful, and yes, totally worth it.</p><p>Apple Intelligence is expected to officially roll out with iOS 18 later this year (but keep in mind that reports claim that <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-ai-late" target="_self">some features may be delayed).</a></p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

<p>The summer season might be winding down, but that doesn't mean the backyard gatherings need to end. In some locations, outdoor get togethers in the fall are actually <em>way </em>more comfortable than those that happen during the summer heat. If you're planning to continue the outdoor party into the fall or you love wood-fired pizza, Best Buy has a pretty special deal in store today. </p><p>As of Aug. 1, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/xPgYd?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Ooni%20Frya%2012%20portable%20outdoor%20pizza%20oven&object_type=article&object_uuid=06ei9WHxwsSPKnV0B0nnIcM&short_url=xPgYd&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Ooni Frya 12 portable outdoor pizza oven</a> is on sale for $249, marked down from the usual price of $349 which makes for a savings of $100. In addition to saving 30% on the pizza oven, Best Buy is tossing in a free $75 Best Buy gift card.</p><p>Weighing just 22 pounds, the Ooni Frya 12 portable outdoor pizza oven will make you the most popular person to invite over for a party. Its portable design and weight mean you can make wood-fired pizza in just 60 seconds. It's powered by hardwood pellets and can reach up to 950 degrees F in just 15 minutes. After that, a 12-inch stone-baked pizza can be all yours is just 60 second (plus cooldown time so you don't burn your mouth!).</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>In terms of convenience, the Ooni Frya 12 uses a gravity-fed hopper for delivering the hardwood pellet fuel into the oven. It's made of a powder-coated carbon steel shell for ideal heat retention. </p><p><a href="https://mashable.com/review/ooni-wood-pellet-fyra-review" target="_self">Mashable's review of the Ooni Frya 12</a> gave it high praise, once you've overcome the learning curve. Mashable culture reporter Tim Marcin wrote, "It produced restaurant-quality wood-fired pizza at home. You could taste the sweet smoke. And the super high heat gave you that pleasant char, bubbly crust, and impossibly fast cook time. There is no way, that I know of, to replicate this with an oven or stove."</p><p>If you're a pizza fanatic or just enjoy cooking great meals outside, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/xPgYd?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Ooni%20Frya%2012&object_type=article&object_uuid=06ei9WHxwsSPKnV0B0nnIcM&short_url=xPgYd&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Ooni Frya 12</a> could be perfect.

Having tested them side-by-side, we can say that the devices are more alike than they are different.</p><p>The <a href="https://zdcs.link/oerYL?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Echo%20Dot&object_type=article&object_uuid=058PJL2GqLQfbkeKbunfU8b&short_url=oerYL&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Echo Dot</a> is a full-size home assistant. In addition to playing music by voice command, it's able to adjust your smart thermostat or lightbulbs. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/0PDLN?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Echo%20Pop&object_type=article&object_uuid=058PJL2GqLQfbkeKbunfU8b&short_url=0PDLN&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Echo Pop</a> is a downsized version, both in size, price, and ability. This pint-size speaker is best for smaller spaces, as the speaker won't fill a full room. It doesn't have the same smart home capabilities as the Dot, but works just fine if you want to play music at your desk or set a timer.</p><p>At Best Buy, you can find both devices marked down up to 55%. The <a href="https://zdcs.link/0PDLN?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Echo%20Pop&object_type=article&object_uuid=058PJL2GqLQfbkeKbunfU8b&short_url=0PDLN&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Echo Pop</a> is back down to its Prime Day price of $17.99, saving you $22 for 55% off. The more advanced Echo Dot is just $7 more for $24.99. This is just $2 higher than its <a href="https://zdcs.link/yLkYO?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=lowest%20price%20ever&object_type=article&object_uuid=058PJL2GqLQfbkeKbunfU8b&short_url=yLkYO&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">lowest price ever</a>. That gives you 50% off for $25 in savings.</p><div class="flex flex-col mx-auto mt-8 mb-16 max-w-3xl font-sans md:flex-row">

And right now, you can save on a particularly great pair at Amazon as they've been reduced nearly all the way back down to their Prime Day 2024 price. </p><p>As of August 1, you can get the <a href="https://zdcs.link/gl5Yb?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Beats%20Studio%20Pro&object_type=article&object_uuid=07k8hCAaHnTEAfwG8ubnrWV&short_url=gl5Yb&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Beats Studio Pro</a> noise-cancelling headphones for $179.95, down from their original price of $349.99. That's a 49% discount and a savings of $170.04. This is within just $10 of the headphones' Prime Day price, so you're getting a great discount on the off chance you missed out during the sales event last month. </p><p>These plush headphones offer excellent noise cancellation and are quite comfortable to wear for long stretches of time. While they're great for enjoying all types of music, they're also excellent for chatting on the phone if you need to take a call. You'll be heard with surprising clarity even if you're in the middle of a busy environment &ndash; which can sometimes happen even if we try our best to avoid it. Further, these headphones boast a 40-hour battery life so they're good to go as long as you are. </p><p>If you want a premium pair of over-the-ear headphones and don't want to shell out too much cash, these make an especially good option, since they're on sale for their next-to-Prime Day price. Be sure and get yours before they're out of stock. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>For starters, the Fitbit Ace LTE comes with the Fitbit Arcade, which is packed with movement-based games for kids to enjoy throughout the day. Instead of closing rings, the watch uses "the Noodle," a fun animal design that lets kids keep better track of their steps, jumps, and bounces. </p><p>But when it comes time to focus in the classroom or in the evening while completing homework, parents can set downtime on the Fitbit Ace LTE, which restricts access to some features while still allowing kids to get in touch should they need to. </p><p>Through the Fitbit Ace app, kids can make calls and texts to 20 contacts, which parents can approve. The app also allows parents to see where their kids are currently located, so you'll know they made it from school to soccer practice or decided to study in the library this afternoon.</p><p>It's worth noting that the Fitbit Ace LTE smartwatch requires a monthly Fitbit Ace Pass, which costs $9.99 per month. You can purchase this plan during setup of the watch. The pass gives unlimited LTE connectivity, GPS tracking, calling, and messaging. </p><p>Make sure the kids are ready to head back to the classroom with the motivational Fitbit Ace LTE smartwatch. Not only will they enjoy the games, it gives parents reassurance of always being in touch.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03zj5CLGpxHiiX9z5gR1XkQ/hero-image.png" alt="hand holding key, another hand emerging from smartphone with a lock"><p><a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-sites-for-serious-relationships" target="_self">Dating apps</a> require users to disclose vulnerable information &mdash; and not just someone's romantic dreams. Most times, these apps require personal data like your name, age, and location. In the case of the latter, a new paper details that, for a time, several major apps left user locations able to be exposed by potential adversaries.</p><h2>Dating app location vulnerabilities</h2><p>In a new paper out of Belgian university KU Leuven, "<a href="https://lepoch.at/files/dating-apps-usesec24.pdf" target="_blank">Swipe Left for Identity Theft</a>," researchers break down potential privacy risks for 15 location-based dating apps (LBDs) with at least 10 million downloads. These days, dating apps are typically location-based in order to help users find matches physically close to them. By needing location, however, it opens users up to potential risks.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>All apps except one used distance between users to measure location. (That exception, TanTan &mdash; an Asian dating app &mdash; used exact coordinates one-time at the point of matching, and only if they matched.) "However, lacking sufficient protections, the availability of distances can still lead to the inference of a user's location," the paper states. "This is done through trilateration."</p><p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/trilateration" target="_blank">Trilateration</a> is the process of determining location by measuring distances between three triangles (or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O3ZVHVFhes" target="_blank">circles, or spheres</a>). There are different types of trilateration apps use to determine location. The authors &mdash; Karel Dhondt, Victor Le Pochat, Yana Dimova, Wouter Joosen, and Stijn Volckaert &mdash; found that they were able to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/31/bumble-and-hinge-allowed-stalkers-to-pinpoint-users-locations-down-to-2-meters-researchers-say/" target="_blank">pinpoint almost an exact location in six out of 15 apps</a>, as TechCrunch reported. </p><h2>Which dating apps had location vulnerabilities?</h2><p>The most common vulnerability was through "oracle trilateration," which the paper explains, "Adversaries use an <em>oracle</em> that indicates through a binary signal whether a victim is located within proximity, i.e., when they are within a defined 'proximity distance' from the attacker."</p><p>Hinge, Bumble, Badoo (which is owned by Bumble), and Hily were susceptible to such trilateration. </p><p>A Hinge spokesman told Mashable:</p><blockquote><p>At Hinge, the safety and privacy of our users is always a top priority. Our app is built with a privacy-by-design approach and strictly protects sensitive user data. We are proud of our state-of-the-art bug bounty program and our ongoing dialogue with researchers, which are designed to attract comments so we can make adjustments before any harm happens to our users. We reviewed the feedback from this research team when we received it in early 2023 and immediately took action where appropriate.</p></blockquote><p>A <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/31/bumble-and-hinge-allowed-stalkers-to-pinpoint-users-locations-down-to-2-meters-researchers-say/" target="_blank">Bumble spokesperson told both TechCrunch</a> and Mashable, "We were made aware of these findings in early 2023, and swiftly resolved the issues outlined. As a global business with members in countries all over the world, we are committed to protecting our users&rsquo; privacy and have adopted a global approach to privacy compliance."</p><p>This statement applies for Badoo as well, Bumble told Mashable.</p><p>Dmytro Kononov, CTO and co-founder of Hily, shared this statement with TechCrunch:</p><blockquote><p>The findings indicated a potential possibility for trilateration. However, in practice, exploiting this for attacks was impossible. This is due to our internal mechanisms designed to protect against spammers and the logic of our search algorithm...Despite this, we engaged in extensive consultations with the authors of the report and collaboratively developed new geocoding algorithms to completely eliminate this type of attack. These new algorithms have been successfully implemented for over a year now.</p></blockquote><p>Grindr was vulnerable to "exact distance trilateration." This can be done when services reveal exact distances to other users. The authors were able to figure out user locations as close as 111 meters (around 364 feet). Exact distance trilateration was possible even when the distance was hidden, such as in Egypt where Grindr hides all user locations for safety reasons.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-3xl font-sans text-lg leading-normal md:text-xl md:leading-7">

<p>"The proximity Grindr offers to this community is paramount in providing the ability to interact with those closest to them, Grindr's chief privacy officer Kelly Peterson Miranda told TechCrunch. "As is the case with many location-based social networks and dating apps, Grindr requires certain location information in order to connect its users with those nearby...Grindr users are in control of what location information they provide."</p><p>Finally, the app happn was vulnerable to "rounded distance trilateration," which can be done if an app utilizes a rounded location as a precaution. CEO and president of happn, Karima Ben Abdelmalek, told TechCrunch:</p><blockquote><p>After review by our Chief Security Officer of the research findings, we had the opportunity to discuss the trilateration method with the researchers. However, happn has an additional layer of protection beyond just rounding distances...This additional protection was not taken into account in their analysis and we mutually agreed that this extra measure on happn makes the trilateration technique ineffective. </p></blockquote><p>It appears that for apps with these vulnerabilities, the apps took measures to stop bad actors from determining user location using trilateration, with the exception of Grindr.</p><h2>Which dating apps weren't vulnerable?</h2><p>According to the paper, Tinder and LOVOO used "grid snapping" to prevent trilateration. <a href="https://robertheaton.com/2018/07/09/how-tinder-keeps-your-location-a-bit-private/" target="_blank">Grid snapping</a> is a technique of dividing one's location into a grid of squares. Coordinates (aka where users are) are moved to the center of these squares (Tinder) or the right side (LOVOO) and one's distance is measured from there. Therefore, their actual distance is inaccurate and can't be trilaterated. </p><p>Plenty of Fish and Meetic don't access GPS locations. While MeetMe, Tagged, and OkCupid do access this information, they convert it to the nearest town. The authors couldn't reverse engineer the information they needed for TanTan and Jaumo, so they couldn't test this method to find user locations. </p><p>The paper shows the importance of caution when using dating apps. As the paper concludes, "We hope that the awareness that we bring of these issues will lead LBD app providers to reconsider their data gathering practices, protect their APIs [application programming interfaces]<strong> </strong>from data leaks, prevent location inference, and give users control of their data and therefore ultimately their privacy."</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A truly functional kitchen has some essential appliances and cooking implements that make creating meals easy. Sure, you'll probably want a range (or some type of cooking surface), a refrigerator, a set of knives, and most people want a microwave. But there's a certain food prep appliance that some see as an essential luxury, particularly models from a high-end brand, and one that's synonymous with steep prices. If you're looking for a blender that's one of the best on the market, Best Buy has something epic in store today.</p><p>As of Aug. 1, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/1vdwk?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Vitamix%20Ascent%20A2500%20blender&object_type=article&object_uuid=03FpG3Hj4KO4vPZSSTGm7qP&short_url=1vdwk&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Vitamix Ascent A2500 blender</a> is just $299.99 at Best Buy, marked down from the usual price of $599.95. That's a massive 50% discount or a savings of $299.96.</p><p>Sometimes, buying the value-centered version of a product doesn't cut it, like the different between name-brand cola and the store brand. In a pinch, the store brand does just fine, but the flavor is distinctly different.</p><p>In the world of blenders, sometimes the high-end (and expensive) models are actually worth it when it comes to performance and lifespan. The Vitamix Ascent A2500 is a great example &mdash; sometimes high-quality comes with a high price tag. But thanks to today's deal at Best Buy, you can pay just 50% of the normal retail price.</p><p>The Vitamix Ascent A2500 comes with three pre-set programs &mdash; smoothies, hot soup, and frozen dessert. Yes, you read that right &mdash; <em>hot </em>soup, produced from the friction of the powerful Vitamix blades in just a handful of minutes.</p><p>Aside from those three pre-set functions, there's a dial with settings between 1 and 10 for variable speed control. The blender also incorporates a pulse feature which is great to make sure all ice cubes or frozen strawberries are fully integrated into the smoothie. </p><p>The 64-ounce included container comes with a lid and a lid plug. Plus, its low-profile design is more likely to fit on the counter under cupboards. You'll also get a low-profile tamper to use with the blender. </p><p>If you've always wanted a Vitamix blender in your kitchen but haven't loved the typical high price tag, today you can score the <a href="https://zdcs.link/1vdwk?pageview_type=RSS&template=article&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=Vitamix%20Ascent%20A2500&object_type=article&object_uuid=03FpG3Hj4KO4vPZSSTGm7qP&short_url=1vdwk&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">Vitamix Ascent A2500</a> for half price. But you'll want to hurry because this deal expires tonight at 11:59 PT.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>1. <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-docs-sync-edit-share/id842842640" target="_blank">Google Docs</a></h2><p>When it comes time to get assignments done, the Google Workspace apps are essential. These services include Docs, Drive, Sheets, and Slides, which are simpler to use across mobile and desktop than Microsoft Office Suite (now known as Microsoft 365).</p><p>Google Docs is ideal for writing essays and collaborating in real-time, while Sheets makes managing data and creating spreadsheets a breeze. For presentations, Slides is your go-to for making polished demonstrations without the added learning curve of PowerPoint. </p><p>Google Drive (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-drive/id507874739" target="_blank">which has its own app</a>) then ties everything together, providing seamless storage and sharing across all devices. You can even <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-drive-document-scanning-iphone" target="_self">scan your assignments with Drive</a> which is essential for those professors who require you to upload printed homework onto Canvas or Blackboard.</p><h2>2. <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/notion-notes-docs-tasks/id1232780281" target="_blank">Notion</a></h2><p>Unlike other note-taking or task-management apps, Notion combines it all. Notes, to-do lists, calendars, and databases, its drag-and-drop interface makes it easy to customize your workspace to fit your needs. While other apps might focus on one feature&mdash;like Evernote for note-taking or Trello for task management&mdash;Notion offers a complete package.</p><p>This all-in-one approach is perfect for students who want to stay organized and efficient without the hassle of switching between multiple apps, giving them more time to focus on their schoolwork. Although it does have a subscription tier, you can use the core of its features for free, and who doesn't love free?</p><h2>3. <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bear-markdown-notes/id1016366447" target="_blank">Bear Notes</a></h2><p>This beautifully designed app offers a distraction-free interface, perfect for jotting down lecture notes, brainstorming ideas, or crafting the perfect essay. Its clean, intuitive design makes it easy to stay focused and organized.</p><p>With its rich text editing, easy organization using hashtags, and seamless syncing across devices, Bear Notes ensures your thoughts are organized and easily accessible. Plus, its Markdown support makes formatting a breeze, turning your notes into polished documents effortlessly.</p><h2>4. <a href="https://www.zotero.org/" target="_blank">Zotero</a></h2><p>Zotero is a free, open-source tool that helps you collect, organize, cite, and share your research materials. As its site says, it's basically your "personal research assistant." It's a godsend for the end of the semester when you have multiple research papers due and way too many tabs open for multiple assignments &mdash; it's honestly a nightmare.</p><p>While other citation tools might focus solely on generating citations, Zotero integrates seamlessly with your browser and word processor, providing a comprehensive solution for your research needs.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sure, there have been some tweaks and changes over the years, like upgrades to the aperture and image processing, for example. But a 12MP selfie camera has been on the iPhone series' spec sheet since Apple introduced it in 2019.</p><p>That's not necessarily a bad thing, though. As someone who has reviewed iPhones since the debut of the iPhone 12, the 12MP selfie camera has always been sufficient enough for me. In fact, I'll even venture to say it's <em>too </em>good, as it picks up on all my flaws and imperfections.</p><p>However, for anyone who disagrees with me, you'll be relieved to know that the iPhone 17 is getting a big upgrade to a 24MP selfie camera. </p><p>It's unclear whether the new 24MP selfie camera will be featured across the entire lineup or limited to a few models.</p><h2><strong>3. Relocated camera</strong></h2><p>If you're tired of the iPhone's camera array being located on the top-left corner, you may appreciate a new rumor that suggests the iPhone 17 Slim will have its shooter relocated to the top center, according to <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-plans-a-thinner-iphone-in-2025" target="_blank">The Information.</a></p><div class="eloquent-imagery-image">

        </div>
    </div>
<p>We're also hearing whispers that the iPhone 17 Slim will have just one rear camera (i.e., a solo wide lens).</p><p>If you're a sucker for visual symmetry, Apple moving the wide camera to the top center may be appealing for you.</p><p>There is also scuttlebutt that Apple will shave a little bit off the Dynamic Island on the iPhone 17, thanks to a reported new under-display Face ID technology. So if you're not a fan of the ovular, interactive area at the top of your iPhone screen, and you feel it's a little too obstructive, the iPhone 17 may be worth the wait.</p><p></p><p></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>VPNs aren't new, and that's actually the problem. There are so many that finding a<a href="https://zdcs.link/OdOvn?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=reliable%20VPN&object_type=article&object_uuid=00Otk62q7XAcbU0flMczRNA&short_url=OdOvn&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank"> reliable VPN</a> is a task all of its own. If you're still on the hunt for a good VPN that can block ads, protect your privacy, unlock geo restrictions, and more, SurfShark is the way to go.&nbsp;</p><p>Normally, a <a href="https://zdcs.link/OdOvn?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=two-year%20SurfShark%20VPN%20Starter%20Plan&object_type=article&object_uuid=00Otk62q7XAcbU0flMczRNA&short_url=OdOvn&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">two-year SurfShark VPN Starter Plan</a> would be $290, but you can get it on sale for only $56.99. Check out everything it can do.</p><h2>How's SurfShark different from other VPNs?</h2><p>SurfShark has many of the same features of other VPNs, but it either adds on new sub-features or just does the same job better. Most VPNs have i<a href="https://zdcs.link/OdOvn?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=nternational%20servers&object_type=article&object_uuid=00Otk62q7XAcbU0flMczRNA&short_url=OdOvn&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">nternational servers</a> you can connect to, but SurfShark has 3,200, and they're spread across 65 different countries. Security protocols are normal, but SurfShark locks your data behind military-grade AES-256 encryption and offers CleanWeb, which blocks ads and malware.&nbsp;</p><p>Tired of your search results being useless? Try SurfShark Search and get unbiased search results. You can also browse more securely on public or private WiFi, and users can choose from the latest security protocols like WireGuard&reg;, IKEv2, and OpenVPN.</p><div class="mx-auto mt-8 w-full max-w-4xl">

<p>A large number of servers is nice, but it's useless if they're slow or unreliable. That's why SurfShark has 10GB VPN servers, private DNS and leak protection, and a kill switch that disconnects the internet if the VPN connection drops. This service is compatible with various operating systems and devices, including macOS, Windows, Android, iOS, Linux, and FireTV.</p><h2>Save 80% on a two-year VPN</h2><p>Get a reliable VPN that has your back whether you're streaming, working, or just browsing.&nbsp;</p><p>Get a <a href="https://zdcs.link/OdOvn?pageview_type=RSS&template=deals&module=content_body&element=offer&item=text-link&element_label=SurfShark%20VPN%20two-year%20Starter%20Plan&object_type=article&object_uuid=00Otk62q7XAcbU0flMczRNA&short_url=OdOvn&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Ffeeds%2Frss%2Fall" rel="nofollow sponsored"title="(opens in a new window)" target="_blank">SurfShark VPN two-year Starter Plan</a> for $56.99.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.stacksocial.com" target="_blank"><em>StackSocial</em></a><em> prices subject to change.&nbsp;</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

It'll also be available on Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and Google Built-in.</p><p>Google has also upgraded tools for reporting incidents and happenings on the road, whether lane closures, police presence, or construction work.

New camera types have been added to Waze, which users can select when reporting road information like speed cameras, bus lane cameras, and red light cameras.

A seriously big moment. </p><p>The league was already stacked with genuine superstars like A'ja Wilson and Sabrina Ionescu, but everything has exploded since the introduction of young ballers like <a href="https://mashable.com/article/caitlin-clark-wnba-salary-reactions-explained" target="_self">Caitlin Clark</a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/angel-reese-lsu-caitlin-clark" target="_self">Angel Reese</a>, and Cameron Brink.

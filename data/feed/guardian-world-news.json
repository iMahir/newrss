    "summary": "After Tory MPs send their vaguely normal candidate packing, all the rest of us can do is applaud them for their comic timing\nA day on from the latest leadership ballot and still no one in the Tory party can quite work out how Kemi Badenoch and Robert Jenrick made it through to the last two. So what chance do the rest of us have? All we can do is applaud them for their comic timing.\nIn one corner we have KemiKaze. A woman who is actively dangerous. And in the other we have an overgrown schoolboy who is dangerously stupid. Honest Bob makes Jimmy Dimly look like an intellectual giant.\nTaking the Lead by John Crace is published by Little, Brown (£18.99).

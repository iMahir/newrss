I mean, you might be keeping them on the table, but no one’s picking up what you’ve got on the table.\nWell, we remain committed to them, PK, and you know if – and I would say the more likely path is if Peter Dutton stops being stubborn and engages with us – there is a way through on this. I don’t know why they have dealt themselves out on this…\nThey know this is good, sensible policy, and I would urge them to reconsider their opinion, their position, because we’re not going to go around being threatened, having the finger wave by Nick McKim saying that the government should rip up the way the bank the fiscal and monetary policy systems have worked in this country very successfully without political interference on the monetary policy side for decades.\nWell, I just think the Greens are out of control at the moment, full of self importance and out seeking populist approach to everything. It’s crazy what they’re saying to us.\nSo if that’s their ultimatum – and you know, it’s a bit unseemly, Nick McKim going around issuing ultimatums – you know, no, we won’t work with that, because that is crazy.

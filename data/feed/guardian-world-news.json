He said he did not agree with his colleague Michael Bennet’s assessment that the party is on track to lose both control of Congress and the presidency if Biden remains:\nIs it fair to point these things out? It has to be. This is about age. Nothing more. But also nothing that can be reversed. We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won’t win the House, and we’re going to lose the Senate.

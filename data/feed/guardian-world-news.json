    "summary": "Landmark ruling could shape historical narrative of key event in anti-government protests\nA Hong Kong judge has convicted seven people, including a pro-democracy former lawmaker, of rioting during mob violence at a subway station at the height of the city’s anti-government protests in July 2019.\n\r\n Prosecutors accused the former legislator Lam Cheuk-ting and six other defendants of provoking members of a group of about 100 men armed with wooden poles and metal rods who attacked protesters and bystanders at a train station.

Ukrainian troops have made further advances in the Kursk region of Russia, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/14/ukraine-forces-continuing-advance-into-russian-territory-zelenskiy-kursk\">Volodymyr Zelenskiy said yesterday</a>. Meanwhile, Kyiv said it had launched a “major” drone attack on four Russian airbases, and the governor of Russia’s Belgorod region declared a state of emergency. And while Kyiv insists it has no intention of trying to hold Russian territory permanently, there is little doubt that it intends its cross-border incursion to bring home the cost of the war to the Russian public.</p><p>So how do ordinary Russians view the surprise attack on their own territory – and what is Vladimir Putin doing to try to shape their response? For today’s newsletter, I spoke to Dr Olga Vlasova, a visiting scholar at King’s Russia Institute in London who researches Russian state propaganda with a focus on the “politics of pacification”, about the impact of Ukraine’s incursion on perceptions of the war. Here are the headlines.</p><p><em><strong>Metropolitan police </strong></em>| London’s police force <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/aug/15/inspection-finds-met-police-failing-or-inadequate-in-key-fighting-areas\">is providing an inadequate or failing service</a> in seven of eight key areas, and there are “serious concerns” about its management of dangerous offenders, according to an official inspection.

    "summary": "In today’s newsletter: As Ukrainian forces make further advances inside Russia, Vladimir Putin goes on an offensive to calm fears and mould perceptions at home. Will it work?\n• Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition\nGood morning. Ukrainian troops have made further advances in the Kursk region of Russia, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said yesterday. Meanwhile, Kyiv said it had launched a “major” drone attack on four Russian airbases, and the governor of Russia’s Belgorod region declared a state of emergency. And while Kyiv insists it has no intention of trying to hold Russian territory permanently, there is little doubt that it intends its cross-border incursion to bring home the cost of the war to the Russian public.\nSo how do ordinary Russians view the surprise attack on their own territory – and what is Vladimir Putin doing to try to shape their response? For today’s newsletter, I spoke to Dr Olga Vlasova, a visiting scholar at King’s Russia Institute in London who researches Russian state propaganda with a focus on the “politics of pacification”, about the impact of Ukraine’s incursion on perceptions of the war. Here are the headlines.\nMetropolitan police | London’s police force is providing an inadequate or failing service in seven of eight key areas, and there are “serious concerns” about its management of dangerous offenders, according to an official inspection.

    "summary": "Over three-quarters of English applicants gain enough points for their favoured course\nPrivate schools which could close as a result of the government’s plans to impose 20% VAT are already facing “big budget shortfalls”, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has said.\nShe told Sky News:\nPrivate schools are businesses that can make choices about how they manage their budgets, the level of fees that they charge, and ultimately, it’s about how attractive they are to families in terms of the numbers of students that are sent there.\nWe have seen private schools in recent years whack up their fees year on year, way beyond inflation, and that has priced out lots of people.\nOverall, 425,680 applicants (all ages, all domiciles) have been accepted into university or college – an increase on 414,940 (+3%) in 2023.\nIn total, 376,470 students (all ages, all domiciles) have been accepted at their first (UCAS ‘firm’) choice, a 4% increase on last year. This represents 82% of those holding an offer who received their decision this morning up from 79% in 2023.\nThe overall number of accepted international students stands at 51,170, in line with 51,210 in 2023. However, accepted applicants from China are slightly down compared to last year – 10,950 (-6%).\nThe top three subjects with the largest increase in total placed applicants are engineering and technology (+11% on last year), architecture, building and planning (+9%) and law (+9%).\nAcceptances for UK students (all ages) to nursing have risen slightly compared to 2023, with 18,450 applicants securing a place (up 1%). This still represents a decline from the peak seen during the pandemic.\nI’m particularly thrilled to see free school meals students securing a place at university or college in record numbers. I know how important it is to everyone working in education that every student, no matter their background, has the opportunity to reach their full potential. Widening access and participation is not just about numbers; it’s about opening up doors and transforming the lives of students through higher education so they can pursue their passions and career aspirations.\nUcas is here to help all applicants take their next step, including students who received different results than expected, or those who are looking to change their mind.\n Continue reading..."

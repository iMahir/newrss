    "summary": "Democratic congressman Pat Ryan tells New York Times endorsing Joe Biden would be ‘grave disservice’\n\nDemocratic senator says Trump is on track to win as Pelosi says Biden must ‘decide if he’s going to run’\n\nWhile many of his allies are expressing pessimism about Joe Biden’s re-election chances, other Democrats aren’t so sure.\nCNN caught up with Pennsylvania senator Bob Casey, who is up for re-election in November in a purple state that polls show is moving away from Biden. He said he did not agree with his colleague Michael Bennet’s assessment that the party is on track to lose both control of Congress and the presidency if Biden remains:\nIs it fair to point these things out? It has to be. This is about age. Nothing more. But also nothing that can be reversed. We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won’t win the House, and we’re going to lose the Senate. This isn’t only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I’ve spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly …\nIt is disingenuous, at best, to argue that Democrats have already spoken with their vote and therefore the nomination is settled and done, when we just received new and upsetting information. We all think Republicans should abandon their nominee now that he’s been convicted of 34 felonies. That’s new and upsetting information as well. Top Democrats – Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries, Nancy Pelosi – and senators, representatives and other candidates who face losing in November need to ask this president to voluntarily step aside.\n Continue reading..."

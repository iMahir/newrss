    "summary": "Pentagon says US air force used long-range B-2 stealth bombers to target ‘five hardened underground weapons storage locations’ of Iran-backed Houthis \n\nSee all our Middle East coverage\n\nThe US military has mobilised its long-range B-2 stealth bombers to conduct strikes against “five hardened underground weapons storage locations” in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen. The Pentagon said the facilities house various weapons components the Houthis have used to target civilian and military vessels, roiling commercial shipping in the Red Sea. “This was a unique demonstration of the United States’ ability to target facilities that our adversaries seek to keep out of reach, no matter how deeply buried underground, hardened, or fortified,” defence secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement.\nThe US Central Command said its battle damage assessments from the strikes were under way and did not indicate civilian casualties. The early morning strikes marked the first the US has used the B-2 bomber to attack Houthis in Yemen, and according to Bloomberg, the first time since January 2017 the wing-shaped bomber has flown in a combat mission.\nThe mayor of one of the largest cities in Lebanon’s south has been killed in an Israeli airstrike that hit the city’s municipal headquarters during a meeting to coordinate aid deliveries to residents and those displaced by war.

    "summary": "In today’s newsletter: Chancellor Rachel Reeves is painting a bleak picture ahead of the budget later this month. Here’s what all the jargon means\n• Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition\nGood morning. I’m really sorry about this, but today’s newsletter is about the extent of the “black hole” in the public finances and the government’s fiscal rules.\nI don’t like this any more than you do: I’d frankly rather be writing about whether King Conker is a cheat. But the budget is nearly upon us, and the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has started talking about a £40bn funding gap, when you might have only just got used to being alarmed about the £22bn “black hole”. Several of today’s front pages carry reports of planned tax rises to balance the books; meanwhile, Reeves is planning to redefine debt to give herself more room for manoeuvre. If you have found yourself confused by this, congratulations on at least paying close enough attention to notice how knotty it all is.\nMusic | Liam Payne, a former member of the boyband One Direction, has died after falling from a third-floor hotel room in Buenos Aires. Hundreds of fans gathered outside the hotel to pay tribute after the news, while authorities in Argentina said they were investigating the circumstances of Payne’s death.\nNational security | Counter-terrorism police are investigating whether Russian spies planted an incendiary device on a plane to Britain that caught fire at a DHL warehouse in Birmingham in July, the Guardian can reveal.

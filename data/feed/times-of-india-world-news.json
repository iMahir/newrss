The US Central Command stated that the strikes were carried out in response to an imminent threat to US coalition forces and merchant vessels in the region. The Huthis are an Iran-backed group that has been targeting vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden since November 2023. They claim their attacks are in solidarity with Palestinians during the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.",

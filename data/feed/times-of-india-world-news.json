Despite earning £2 million on the platform, Lily admitted the experience was overwhelming and left her visibly shaken. Public reaction has been polarized, with critics calling it degrading and demanding an OnlyFans ban, while others empathize with her or defend the platform. Lily has expressed interest in even larger challenges, sparking debates about personal choice and societal impact. Supporters argue the issue lies with societal attitudes, not the platform, opposing outright bans.",

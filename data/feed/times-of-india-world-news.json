Critics, including McBride, argue that such legislation distracts from pressing issues like healthcare and housing. Mace, once considered a moderate, has shifted rightward after redistricting secured her district for Republicans. This controversy highlights the GOP's focus on cultural issues, with figures like Marjorie Taylor Greene supporting similar measures. Democrats face challenges as Republicans leverage transgender rights debates to energize their base post-2024 elections.",

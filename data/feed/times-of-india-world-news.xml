This is the core function of the dog," said the operator, who works for a British company providing military equipment.A more advanced model, known as "BAD Two" could not be shown for security reasons.The device used in the demonstration has a battery that powers it for around two hours.Useful for detecting mines or improvised explosive devices, the robot dog can also be used to carry up to seven kilos (15 pounds) of ammunition or medicines to hot spots on the battlefield."I can't say how many we deployed" in Ukraine, Yuri said, adding: "But it will have a significant impact on the operations and increase the safety of soldiers."And if the robot dogs were ever to fall into Russian hands, he said, an emergency switch allows the operator to erase all its data.</description><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/next-gen-war-robots-ukraine-set-to-deploy-bad-one-dogs-for-recon-missions-and-mine-detection/photostory/112382442.cms</link><guid>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/next-gen-war-robots-ukraine-set-to-deploy-bad-one-dogs-for-recon-missions-and-mine-detection/photostory/112382442.cms</guid><pubDate>2024-08-08T21:32:26+05:30</pubDate><enclosure type="image/jpeg" url="https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-112382442,imgsize-1407146.cms"/></item><item><title>Fears for women's rights as Iraqi bill resurfaces</title><description>&lt;img border="0" hspace="10" align="left" style="margin-top:3px;margin-right:5px;" src="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/112382503.cms" /&gt;Iraq's proposed bill allowing citizens to choose between religious and civil authorities on family matters has sparked concerns about women's rights, underage marriage, and male dominance.

The former Vice President's showing has left many Democrats deeply concerned about his ability to effectively challenge the incumbent, Donald Trump, in the upcoming election. In light of Biden's lackluster performance, some within the Democratic Party are now suggesting that he should withdraw from the race.</description><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/panicked-democrats-call-for-joe-biden-to-stand-down-after-debate-debacle/articleshow/111347303.cms</link><guid>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/panicked-democrats-call-for-joe-biden-to-stand-down-after-debate-debacle/articleshow/111347303.cms</guid><pubDate>2024-06-28T21:35:55+05:30</pubDate><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chidanand Rajghatta</dc:creator><enclosure type="image/jpeg" url="https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-111347296,imgsize-1051373.cms"/></item><item><title>Putin was fast asleep when Biden, Trump shouted his name</title><description>&lt;img border="0" hspace="10" align="left" style="margin-top:3px;margin-right:5px;" src="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/111346368.cms" /&gt;It was 4 am in Moscow when Joe Biden and Donald Trump were screaming his name in the first US presidential debate Thursday.

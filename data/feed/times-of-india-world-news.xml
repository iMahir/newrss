This nearly complete sauropod, believed to be of the genus diplodocus, is 75 feet long and weighs five tons. The green hue is a result of volcanic activity that altered its bones. It will headline a new museum wing opening in November.</description><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/rare-green-dinosaur-fossil-discovered-in-utah/articleshow/112952978.cms</link><guid>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/rare-green-dinosaur-fossil-discovered-in-utah/articleshow/112952978.cms</guid><pubDate>2024-08-31T20:24:13+05:30</pubDate><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">TOI World Desk</dc:creator><enclosure type="image/jpeg" url="https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-112953287,imgsize-1709394.cms"/></item></channel></rss>

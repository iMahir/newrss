In his latest social media post, Trump referred to Trudeau as the “Governor of the Great State of Canada,” revisiting his earlier joke that Canada could become the 51st state of the United States. The comment, originally made during a dinner at Mar-a-Lago, resurfaced as Trump doubled down, suggesting that statehood might be Canada’s best option to survive the potential devastation of his proposed 25% tariffs on Canadian goods.</description><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trudeau-harris-trump-loss/articleshow/116219042.cms</link><guid>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trudeau-harris-trump-loss/articleshow/116219042.cms</guid><pubDate>2024-12-11T20:16:58+05:30</pubDate><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">TOI World Desk</dc:creator><enclosure type="image/jpeg" url="https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-116219006,imgsize-1321285.cms"/></item><item><title>Malibu wildfire is raging out of control as dry winds fan flames</title><description>&lt;img border="0" hspace="10" align="left" style="margin-top:3px;margin-right:5px;" src="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/116218461.cms" /&gt;A rapidly spreading wildfire near Malibu, California, has scorched nearly 4,000 acres, destroying structures and forcing evacuations.

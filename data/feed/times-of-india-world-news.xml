Now an old friend of Vance, Sofia Nelson, who identifies himself as a transgender, has leaked his old private mail exchanges with Vance -- to the New York Times hoping that voters would be now well informed about Mr Vance -- who already is at the center of a major controversy for his past remark on 'childless cat ladies'.</description><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jd-vances-old-friend-leaks-shocking-email-exchange-he-wishes-sofia-all-the-best/articleshow/112071204.cms</link><guid>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jd-vances-old-friend-leaks-shocking-email-exchange-he-wishes-sofia-all-the-best/articleshow/112071204.cms</guid><pubDate>2024-07-28T01:22:15+05:30</pubDate><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">TOI World Desk</dc:creator><enclosure type="image/jpeg" url="https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-112071200,imgsize-1946306.cms"/></item><item><title>Andy Roddick says it doesn't matter if Trump was hit by bullet or sharpnel because...</title><description>&lt;img border="0" hspace="10" align="left" style="margin-top:3px;margin-right:5px;" src="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/112071053.cms" /&gt;​Tennis legend Andy Roddick said it does not matter whether former president Donald Trump was hit by a bullet or a sharpnel as it does not change the fact that there was an assassination attempt on him. The comment came as FBI director Christopher Wray earlier this week expressed some doubt over what actually grazed Trump's right year at his rally in Pennsylvania.

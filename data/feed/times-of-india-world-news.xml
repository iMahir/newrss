Trump’s remarks focused on condemning violence against Hindus in Bangladesh, opposing California’s caste bill, and promising stronger ties with Indian PM Narendra Modi. This approach contrasts with Kamala Harris, who has faced criticism for her perceived lack of connection to her Indian heritage. With influential figures like Vivek Ramaswamy supporting Trump, there’s a growing interest among Hindu Americans in the GOP.

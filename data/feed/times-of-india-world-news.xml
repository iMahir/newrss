The study found that Equality Labs’ anti-caste materials heightened perceptions of bias, fostered dehumanizing rhetoric against Brahmins, and fueled distrust. Critics argue such trainings exacerbate divisions instead of reducing discrimination. HAF condemned the media for withholding the findings, calling for transparency and accountability. The controversy highlights broader issues with DEI programs and the risks of fostering polarization instead of promoting inclusivity.</description><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hindu-brahmin-caste-dei-trump-hindu-america-foundation-equity-labs/articleshow/115695894.cms</link><guid>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hindu-brahmin-caste-dei-trump-hindu-america-foundation-equity-labs/articleshow/115695894.cms</guid><pubDate>2024-11-26T16:42:42+05:30</pubDate><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">TOI World Desk</dc:creator><enclosure type="image/jpeg" url="https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-115696607,imgsize-62940.cms"/></item><item><title>Prosecutors seek 20-year sentence for main accused Dominique Pelicot in France mass rape case</title><description>&lt;img border="0" hspace="10" align="left" style="margin-top:3px;margin-right:5px;" src="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/115693535.cms" /&gt;French prosecutors sought a 20-year sentence for Dominique Pelicot, accused of drugging and facilitating the rape of his wife by dozens of men.

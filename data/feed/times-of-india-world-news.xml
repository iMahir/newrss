Kamala Harris' height has some confusion as records claim that the vice president is 5'2'' but in an interview, Kamala said it was not true. "I am 5'4'' and a quarter -- something 5/4'' and a half. With heels, which I always wear, I', 5'7'' and a half," Kamala said. So even with heels, Kamala Harris will appear much shorter than Donald Trump.</description><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/always-the-nasty-man-did-donald-trump-mock-kamala-harris-height/articleshow/113170137.cms</link><guid>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/always-the-nasty-man-did-donald-trump-mock-kamala-harris-height/articleshow/113170137.cms</guid><pubDate>2024-09-08T19:21:30+05:30</pubDate><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">TOI World Desk</dc:creator><enclosure type="image/jpeg" url="https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-113170335,imgsize-1231881.cms"/></item><item><title>Kamala Harris will be on right side of screen in debate with Trump.

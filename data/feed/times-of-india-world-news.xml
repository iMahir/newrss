The Indian-American billionaire said the more the Democrats delay choosing their 'puppet', it's best for them -- contrary to the popular belief as there will be a honeymoon period after a new candidate is picked. The Democrats' ideal situation would be the election to be held during that honeymoon period sans public scrutiny, Vivek Ramaswamy said.</description><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/vivek-ramaswamy-has-this-advice-for-democrats-on-which-puppet-to-choose/articleshow/111466690.cms</link><guid>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/vivek-ramaswamy-has-this-advice-for-democrats-on-which-puppet-to-choose/articleshow/111466690.cms</guid><pubDate>2024-07-03T22:40:18+05:30</pubDate><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">TOI World Desk</dc:creator><enclosure type="image/jpeg" url="https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-111466674,imgsize-517293.cms"/></item><item><title>Biden told ally he may not be able to salvage candidacy: Report</title><description>​President Joe Biden, despite the top Democrats now putting up a brave face publicly following the debate debacle, knows that he may not be able to salvage his candidacy if he cannot convince the public in the coming days he knows how to do the job.

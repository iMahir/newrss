Macron's decision to call the early election appears to have backfired. The RN's stance against further EU integration and its plans to reduce funding to the EU have raised concerns. </description><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/200-candidates-withdraw-from-french-poll-to-block-far-rights-win-prospect/articleshow/111435404.cms</link><guid>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/200-candidates-withdraw-from-french-poll-to-block-far-rights-win-prospect/articleshow/111435404.cms</guid><pubDate>2024-07-02T19:59:10+05:30</pubDate><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">TOI World Desk</dc:creator><enclosure type="image/jpeg" url="https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-111436977,imgsize-180900.cms"/></item><item><title>Will Indian diaspora back Rishi Sunak in UK polls?</title><description>&lt;img border="0" hspace="10" align="left" style="margin-top:3px;margin-right:5px;" src="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/111437208.cms" /&gt;Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who has often looked exhausted as he crossed the country during a six-week campaign, started the penultimate day of campaigning before Thursday's vote in a vast Ocado warehouse in Luton, north of London, watching robots pick items for delivery.

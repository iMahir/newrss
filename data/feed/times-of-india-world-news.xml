It was a 'disaster of a night' for Melania, Kimmel said. It was only a good night for Putin, polio and lovable billionaires like Elon Musk, Kimmel said. "I will say something that Trump would never say unless it favoured him.... He won. That doesn't mean we give up and that doesn't mean we storm the Capitol because we don't like the result," Kimmel said.</description><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-jimmy-kimmel-tears-up-speaking-about-terrible-election-night/articleshow/115059704.cms</link><guid>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-jimmy-kimmel-tears-up-speaking-about-terrible-election-night/articleshow/115059704.cms</guid><pubDate>2024-11-07T21:04:41+05:30</pubDate><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">TOI World Desk</dc:creator><enclosure type="image/jpeg" url="https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-115059971,imgsize-458207.cms"/></item><item><title>'Nostradamus' Allan Licthman blames democracy after failure to predict Trump win</title><description>&lt;img border="0" hspace="10" align="left" style="margin-top:3px;margin-right:5px;" src="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/115058858.cms" /&gt;For over four decades, Lichtman has used his "Keys to the White House" model with striking accuracy, having correctly predicted every presidential winner since 1984. The 77-year-old American University professor believed that Harris would emerge victorious in the 2024 election, convinced by the model's indicators that pointed towards a Democratic win. However, as the results confirmed Trump’s landslide victory, Lichtman found himself caught off-guard, live-streaming his disbelief alongside his son, Sam. The political soothsayer was left pondering what went awry, even joking, “Good thing I’ve nothing on tomorrow. No interviews for me.”</description><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nostradamus-allan-licthman-blames-democracy-after-failure-to-predict-trump-win/articleshow/115058858.cms</link><guid>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nostradamus-allan-licthman-blames-democracy-after-failure-to-predict-trump-win/articleshow/115058858.cms</guid><pubDate>2024-11-07T20:26:15+05:30</pubDate><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">TOI World Desk</dc:creator><enclosure type="image/jpeg" url="https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-115059135,imgsize-55048.cms"/></item><item><title>Elon Musk and son X are part of Donald Trump's family photo.

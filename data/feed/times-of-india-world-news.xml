Critics, including McBride, argue that such legislation distracts from pressing issues like healthcare and housing. Mace, once considered a moderate, has shifted rightward after redistricting secured her district for Republicans. This controversy highlights the GOP's focus on cultural issues, with figures like Marjorie Taylor Greene supporting similar measures. Democrats face challenges as Republicans leverage transgender rights debates to energize their base post-2024 elections.</description><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/sarah-mcbride-is-a-biological-man-the-transgender-bathroom-row-rocking-the-capitol/articleshow/115456724.cms</link><guid>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/sarah-mcbride-is-a-biological-man-the-transgender-bathroom-row-rocking-the-capitol/articleshow/115456724.cms</guid><pubDate>2024-11-19T20:13:15+05:30</pubDate><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">TOI World Desk</dc:creator><enclosure type="image/jpeg" url="https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-115456768,imgsize-2109246.cms"/></item><item><title>Did Matt Gaetz have a son before he married Ginger Luckey?</title><description>&lt;img border="0" hspace="10" align="left" style="margin-top:3px;margin-right:5px;" src="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/115456415.cms" /&gt;Embroiled in controversy, Matt Gaetz, a former congressman facing allegations of sex trafficking, is under scrutiny for his relationship with his adopted son, Nestor.

While William emphasized doing things differently for his generation, the remarks were interpreted as a thinly veiled criticism of his father's approach to governance.

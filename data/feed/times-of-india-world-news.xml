Trump gained four points since September, while Harris dropped by one. Key findings indicate significant gender and demographic gaps. Republican pollster McInturff said Harris' popularity waned as the vice president does not represent change from President Joe Biden and voters see Trump's presidency in a more positive light than Biden's. "She is asking for another term from the incumbent party," McInturff said.</description><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nbc-poll-says-trump-and-harris-are-now-tied-at-48-per-cent-details-here/articleshow/114192890.cms</link><guid>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nbc-poll-says-trump-and-harris-are-now-tied-at-48-per-cent-details-here/articleshow/114192890.cms</guid><pubDate>2024-10-13T20:03:06+05:30</pubDate><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">TOI World Desk</dc:creator><enclosure type="image/jpeg" url="https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-114192871,imgsize-1767043.cms"/></item><item><title>Barron Trump's former 'girlfriend' says the reason for their breakup was...</title><description>&lt;img border="0" hspace="10" align="left" style="margin-top:3px;margin-right:5px;" src="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/114192408.cms" /&gt;Though Barron's life is kept under the wraps, he's been linked to three women -- mostly through speculations.

"He feels the walls have closed in on him. That he faces potential jail time with criminal cases.

Even President Joe Biden spoke about the issue as he said, "That wealthiest man in the world turned out to be an illegal worker here when he was here." “He was supposed to be in school when he came on a student visa. He wasn’t in school. He was violating the law.

Trump’s remarks focused on condemning violence against Hindus in Bangladesh, opposing California’s caste bill, and promising stronger ties with Indian PM Narendra Modi. This approach contrasts with Kamala Harris, who has faced criticism for her perceived lack of connection to her Indian heritage. With influential figures like Vivek Ramaswamy supporting Trump, there’s a growing interest among Hindu Americans in the GOP. This election cycle reflects the increasing significance of Indian American voters as both parties vie for their support.</description><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-election-top-10-decoding-donald-trumps-massive-hindu-outreach-on-diwali/articleshow/114854005.cms</link><guid>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-election-top-10-decoding-donald-trumps-massive-hindu-outreach-on-diwali/articleshow/114854005.cms</guid><pubDate>2024-11-01T20:15:29+05:30</pubDate><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Nirmalya Dutta</dc:creator><enclosure type="image/jpeg" url="https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-114854174,imgsize-1698950.cms"/></item><item><title>Nate Silver says pollsters lying about Trump-Harris close race: 'F**king finger on the scale'</title><description>&lt;img border="0" hspace="10" align="left" style="margin-top:3px;margin-right:5px;" src="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/114853887.cms" /&gt;In his final prediction, Silver said his forecasts are extremely stable.

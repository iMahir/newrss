While the attack demonstrated Hamas’s military capability, it overextended Iran’s resources and triggered widespread retaliatory campaigns by Israel. Key proxies, including Hezbollah and Hamas, faced severe setbacks due to depleted resources and loss of territorial control. The Assad regime in Syria collapsed under diminished support. Regionally, Gulf states and Egypt aligned with Israel, and the US intensified sanctions against Iran. This chain reaction weakened Iran’s influence, reshaping Middle Eastern geopolitics and highlighting the consequences of overreach.</description><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-hamas-oct-7-attack-smashed-irans-axis-of-resistance/articleshow/116219729.cms</link><guid>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-hamas-oct-7-attack-smashed-irans-axis-of-resistance/articleshow/116219729.cms</guid><pubDate>2024-12-11T20:56:29+05:30</pubDate><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">TOI World Desk</dc:creator><enclosure type="image/jpeg" url="https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-116219870,imgsize-1648649.cms"/></item><item><title>Luigi Mangione's notebook reveals he considered bombing Brian Thompson but...</title><description>&lt;img border="0" hspace="10" align="left" style="margin-top:3px;margin-right:5px;" src="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/116219922.cms" /&gt;​In his notebook, Mangione deliberated: "What do you do?

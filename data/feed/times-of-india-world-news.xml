The decision, split along conservative-liberal lines, sends Trump’s election interference case back to lower courts, likely delaying it until after the 2024 election. If Trump wins, he can quash the case; if Biden wins, he might gain similar powers. The ruling could reshape presidential immunity, with critics arguing it undermines the principle that no one is above the law.</description><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-entitled-to-absolute-immunity-for-clearly-official-acts-us-supreme-court/articleshow/111412845.cms</link><guid>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-entitled-to-absolute-immunity-for-clearly-official-acts-us-supreme-court/articleshow/111412845.cms</guid><pubDate>2024-07-01T23:58:25+05:30</pubDate><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chidanand Rajghatta</dc:creator><enclosure type="image/jpeg" url="https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-111412849,imgsize-23906.cms"/></item><item><title>Air Europa Flight makes emergency landing after severe turbulence, over 20 passengers injured</title><description>&lt;img border="0" hspace="10" align="left" style="margin-top:3px;margin-right:5px;" src="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/111411072.cms" /&gt;</description><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/air-europa-flight-makes-emergency-landing-in-brazil-after-severe-turbulence-injures-over-20-passengers/articleshow/111411072.cms</link><guid>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/air-europa-flight-makes-emergency-landing-in-brazil-after-severe-turbulence-injures-over-20-passengers/articleshow/111411072.cms</guid><pubDate>2024-07-01T23:22:04+05:30</pubDate><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">TOI World Desk</dc:creator><enclosure type="image/jpeg" url="https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-111412513,imgsize-3264775.cms"/></item><item><title>Donald Trump has presumptive immunity for official acts: Supreme Court</title><description>&lt;img border="0" hspace="10" align="left" style="margin-top:3px;margin-right:5px;" src="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/111410344.cms" /&gt;"Big win for our constitution and democracy.

For half that time, the popemobile has been based on <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/23/24134951/mercedes-g-wagen-electric-eqg-price-specs-photos\">Mercedes’ G-Class wagon</a>. And now, for the first time, it wil be operating without any pollution, powered by the company’s EV technology. </p>\n<p id=\"wPFI0S\">“With the new Popemobile, Pope Francis is the first pope to be traveling in a fully electric Mercedes-Benz when making public appearances,” CEO Ola Kallenius, who personally delivered the vehicle to Pope Francis this week. “This is a special honor for our company, and I would like to thank His Holiness for his trust. With this Popemobile, we are also sending out a clear call for electromobility and decarbonisation.”</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"npMutQ\"><q>“With this Popemobile, we are also sending out a clear call for electromobility and decarbonisation”</q></aside></div>\n<p id=\"xtZGED\">The vehicle was modified to utilize four individual motors at each wheel for low-speed travel as the Pope greets visitors in St. Peter’s Square in Vatican City, for example. In the rear, the bench seat was replaced by an elevated, swiveling single seat, so the pope can face his followers from all sides. Two other seats were included behind the pope’s spot for additional passengers. </p>\n<div id=\"8PRnpi\"><div data-anthem-component=\"gallery:12499135\"></div></div>\n<p id=\"aRUSzz\">This is the first all-electric popemobile, but it isn’t Pope Francis’ first experience with zero-emission transportation. The Vatican was gifted <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-19508637\">a Renault Kangoo electric van in 2012</a>, but it wasn’t used for official transport. Pope Francis was driven around in a hydrogen-powered Toyota Mirai in Japan in 2019. And Mercedes-Benz has even made hybrid popemobiles for his holiness.</p>\n<p id=\"S4vO1s\">The possibility of an electric popemobile has been floating around for years.

For half that time, the popemobile has been based on Mercedes’ G-Class wagon. And now, for the first time, it wil be operating without any pollution, powered by the company’s EV technology. \n“With the new Popemobile, Pope Francis is the first pope to be traveling in a fully electric Mercedes-Benz when making public appearances,” CEO Ola Kallenius, who personally delivered the vehicle to Pope Francis this week. “This is a special honor for our company, and I would like to thank His Holiness for his trust. With this Popemobile, we are also sending out a clear call for electromobility and decarbonisation.”\n“With this Popemobile, we are also sending out a clear call for electromobility and decarbonisation”\nThe vehicle was modified to utilize four individual motors at each wheel for low-speed travel as the Pope greets visitors in St. Peter’s Square in Vatican City, for example. In the rear, the bench seat was replaced by an elevated, swiveling single seat, so the pope can face his followers from all sides. Two other seats were included behind the pope’s spot for additional passengers. \n\n\nThis is the first all-electric popemobile, but it isn’t Pope Francis’ first experience with zero-emission transportation. The Vatican was gifted a Renault Kangoo electric van in 2012, but it wasn’t used for official transport. Pope Francis was driven around in a hydrogen-powered Toyota Mirai in Japan in 2019. And Mercedes-Benz has even made hybrid popemobiles for his holiness.\nThe possibility of an electric popemobile has been floating around for years.

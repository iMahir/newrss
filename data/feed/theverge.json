    "summary": "Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge\n    \n\n  \nAmazon has announced a series of new AI foundation models under a new “Nova” branding that will be available as part of the Amazon Bedrock model library in AWS.\nThere are three “understanding” models available now, Amazon says in a blog post:\nAmazon Nova Micro, a text model that’s “optimized for speed and cost.”\nAmazon Nova Lite, a “very low-cost” multimodal model that can take in images, video, and text to generate text.\nAmazon Nova Pro, a “highly capable” multimodal model.\nThe company is also training a model called Amazon Nova Premier, which it says will be “our most capable multimodal model for complex reasoning tasks.” Amazon aims to make Nova Premier available in “early 2025.”\nAmazon is releasing content generation models, too: Amazon Nova Canvas, an image generation model, and Amazon Nova Reel, a video generation model. The company says that these models have “watermarking capabilities” to “promote responsible AI use.” As an example of what’s possible with Nova Reel, Amazon has shared this mock ad for a fake pasta brand.\n\n\nLater in 2025, Amazon plans to release a speech-to-speech model and “a native multimodal-to-multimodal” model, according to a blog post.\nAmazon announced these new models at its AWS re:Invent conference, which is happening now in Las Vegas. At the show, the company also said that it’s building a huge AI compute cluster that relies on its Trainium 2 chips in partnership with Anthropic (which it has invested $8 billion in). “When completed, it is expected to be the world’s largest AI compute cluster reported to date available for Anthropic to build and deploy its future models on,” according to Amazon.\n\n\nThe company, like many other big tech players, is racing to release new AI products and features to stay ahead of newer companies like OpenAI.

The alleged image of the unreleased OnePlus 13 was <a href=\"https://weibo.com/6048569942/OC7uJaxV5?pagetype=profilefeed\">posted to Weibo</a> and has been since removed, but not before it was <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2024/10/18/oneplus-13-design-leak/\">spotted by <em>9to5Google</em></a>. It shows the phone with flat sides rather than the curved edges featured by recent OnePlus phones. It’s a small shift, but it would make OnePlus the latest in a long list of phone makers to adopt the (arguably more comfortable) flat edge design.</p>\n<p id=\"i2m5b9\">The current trend dates back to 2020 when Apple released the iPhone 12 with flat sides, calling on an older design from the iPhone 4 and 5.

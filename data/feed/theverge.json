The main difference is that the Combo j9 Plus offers longer batter life and can refill its own mop tank; it also features a new dirt detection feature. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23489768/irobot-roomba-combo-j7-plus-robot-vacuum-mop-review\">Read our review</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<div id=\"SF5FAS\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:12376304\"></div></div>\n<ul>\n<li id=\"YxlTUH\">The <strong>Roborock Q8 Max </strong>is on sale for $259.99 ($340 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/roborock-Q8-Max-Navigation-Multi-Level/dp/B0C7VBXHS8?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> for Prime members, <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FRoborock-Q8-Max-Robot-Vacuum-and-Mop-with-Obstacle-Avoidance-LiDAR-Navigation-5500Pa-Suction-Power-and-App-Control-White%2F5101658049&amp;sharedid=theverge.com\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Walmart</a>, and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.roborock.com%2Fproducts%2Froborock-q8-max-robot-vacuum-and-mop&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F24311578%2Fbest-cyber-monday-deals-2024-tech-gadgets-gift-ideas\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Roborock’s store</a>, which is a record low price.

    "summary": "Image: Elen Winata for The Verge\n    \n\n\n  \nIt’s actually Tuesday, but that doesn’t mean all the deals have suddenly vanished. We’re rounding up the best of the rest that you can still shop.\n We hope you had a chance between holiday festivities to get some shopping done, but if not, you may not be out of luck. While some of the best deals have expired, many others from the long Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend are still holding on — and a handful are even cheaper. Today might be your very last chance to snag a great deal, but you’re not in it alone. We’re sorting through them all to make sure you can find a great deal on something and get through checkout before the gates fully close. \n\n\nSince this time last week, we’ve been sifting through what feels like endless discounts on everything under the sun, but especially things that delight techies, tinkerers, gamers, and fidgeters. There are still great Cyber Monday deals on TVs, earbuds, laptops, Apple devices, smart home gadgets, and far too many more tech things to name here. And everything we highlight has been tried, tested, or vouched for in some way by Verge staffers, so you don’t have to guess whether any of the deals are too good to be true.\nBelow, we’ve included navigation links that you can use to jump between categories that interest you most, or just scroll at your leisure until you see something you like. Don’t worry if you missed out on something specific you’ve had your eye on — many products typically go on sale at least once more throughout the holiday season, although there’s no guarantee they’ll be as cheap.\n\n\n\n\n//this line summons a table of contents. use as follows!\n\n//initiateTOC takes the arguments \"header\", \"subheader\", \"collapsible\"\n\n//for whatever header type (\"h2\", \"h3\" etc) you want to be the main header, type it in quotes in the function call. \n\n//if you don't want subheads, set to false in the function call (no quotes)\n\n//collapsible is a true/false toggle\n\n//if you want a specific, unlinked title just add a string at the end in double quotes, e.g. false, \"h3\", false, \"This is the title\"\n\n//see graham if you have any questions/issues\n\n// note that all the header types are off by one: an h1 in the CMS is an h2 in the actual code. If you just want h2 and h3 to show up in the TOC you need to call them h3 and h4. \n\n\nwindow.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', (event) => {\n\tinitiateTOC(\"h2\", \"h3\", false, \"The best Cyber Monday deals\")\n});\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured deals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best Apple deals\n\n\n\nYou can buy the last-gen iPad with Wi-Fi and 64GB of storage for its all-time low of $199.99 ($129 off) at Best Buy. The 2021 tablet features a smaller 10.2-inch screen than the newer model, a slower A13 Bionic chip, and a Lightning charging port. However, it’s still snappy enough for streaming, browsing the web, sending emails, and performing other typical tablet tasks, making it great for kids or anybody looking for an affordable tablet. It even features a 3.5mm headphone jack — a welcome rarity.\nIf you want the latest and greatest, the new iPad Mini is available at Amazon or Best Buy for $469 ($30 off). Apple’s 8.3-inch tablet is pretty similar to the outgoing model from 2021, only it features faster Wi-Fi speeds and support for the newer Apple Pencil Pro. It also leverages the new Apple A17 Pro chip, which allows for various AI-based Apple Intelligence features. Read our review.\n\n\n\nVerizon is offering up to $1,000 off an iPhone 16 Pro or iPhone 16 Pro Max and up to $830 off an iPhone 16 when you trade in any phone in any condition, provided you’re signed on to a “select Unlimited plan.” AT&T is also offering $1,000 off the iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max or $830 off an iPhone 16 with trade-in. You can get the same Verizon and AT&T deals through Best Buy, in which case you’ll get a $100 Best Buy gift card with your purchase.\nYou can buy Apple’s official iPhone 16 Clear Case with MagSafe from Amazon starting at $37 ($12 off), which is its best price yet. Apple designed the polycarbonate case so that it works well with the iPhone 16’s new Camera Control button. The company also added a “glossy scratch-resistant coating,” likely after many complained about how last year’s FineWoven cases scratched easily.\nIf you prefer to buy first-party, through December 2nd, Apple is hosting its own rare sales event. You can get up to $200 on select MacBook Airs, while certain iPads will net you $100 in credit. Apple will also give you anywhere between $25–$75 in credit when you purchase select iPhones, AirPods, styli, streaming devices, and more.\nThe best wireless earbuds and headphone deals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJabra may have stopped selling consumer earbuds, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t discounts available on the existing models. Right now, for instance, you can purchase the Jabra Elite 10 Gen 2 for an all-time low of $199.99 ($80 off) at Amazon and Best Buy. In addition to noise cancellation, the semi-open Elite 10 come with an LE Audio charging case, which lets you wirelessly transmit audio from an external device. They also feature physical buttons and support other essentials, including multipoint Bluetooth connectivity.\nYou can also pick up Jabra’s Elite 8 Active Gen 2 for $169.99 ($60 off) at Amazon and Best Buy, which is one of the better prices we’ve seen. The fitness-focused earbuds offer a robust IP68 water resistance rating that can withstand sweaty workouts, along with a secure fit and adaptive ANC. They also support multipoint pairing and wireless charging, and like the Elite 10, come with an LE Audio charging case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe WH-1000XM4, Sony’s last-gen flagship headphones, are on for $198 ($152 off) at Amazon. That’s not the shockingly low $130 they dropped to earlier this year, but it’s still a great price for a pair of cans that offer some of the best sound quality and noise cancellation performance around. They offer 30 hours of battery life, a foldable design, and flexible ambient audio modes, including a speak-to-chat feature that reduces volume while you’re talking. Read our review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also buy Amazon’s newer Echo Buds for just $24.99 ($25 off) at Amazon. The wireless earbuds lack noise cancellation, but they support multipoint pairing and integrate well with Amazon Alexa for hands-free control. They also feature a semi-open design that makes it easier to hear your surroundings. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best speaker and smart display deals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want a smart alarm clock with a great display and zero mics / cameras, the latest Echo Spot is on sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target for $44.99 ($60 off), matching its lowest price to date. The 2.83-inch touchscreen can’t display videos or double as a digital photo frame, but it can tell you the weather when you wake up and allows you to control various smart home devices via Alexa. Read our review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Echo Show 8 (third-gen), the latest version of Amazon’s midsize smart display, is down to $84.99 ($65 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target. You can also buy it with an Amazon Basics Smart Color Bulb for $97.98 ($65 off) at Amazon in black. The eight-inch device looks a lot like previous models, but it’s got widget support for added versatility, a more responsive touchscreen, and nice-sounding speakers. Just don’t expect to take any Zoom meetings on it, as only Alexa video calls are currently supported. Read our review.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best e-reader deals\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best laptop and desktop deals\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft’s base version of its 13.8-inch Surface Laptop 7 is on sale for $899.99 ($300 off) at Best Buy with a Snapdragon X Plus processor, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. The Arm-based laptop offers excellent MacBook Air-like battery life that easily lasts through a day of work. It performs well, though Windows on Arm does have some compatibility issues with some games and software — so be sure what you need to work is supported.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe MSI Stealth A16 AI Plus is on sale at Best Buy with a new Ryzen AI 9 chip, an RTX 4070 GPU, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD for $1,699.99 ($300 off), matching its best price to date. The mid-tier Stealth is one of MSI’s best-selling gaming laptops, as it balances a whole lot of gaming performance without the eye-watering prices of higher-end models. The 16-inch laptop isn’t exactly small, but it’s thin enough to take places, and its QHD panel supports up to a speedy 240Hz refresh rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best robot vacuum / mop deals\n\n\n\n\nThe Roomba Combo 10 Max is down to a new all-time low of $979 ($420 off) at Amazon, or matching its all-time low of $999 ($400 off) at Best Buy and iRobot’s store. The new flagship model from iRobot has all the same features as the j9 Combo, plus a new dock that can clean and dry the robot’s mop, refill its water tank, and empty its bin.   \nThe iRobot Roomba Combo j7 Plus is on sale starting around $679 ($320 off) at Amazon and $699 ($300 off) at Best Buy, which is one of its better prices to date. The j7 Plus is similar to the Roomba Combo j9 Plus, as it offers AI obstacle avoidance and a mop that automatically lifts to keep your carpets dry. The main difference is that the Combo j9 Plus offers longer batter life and can refill its own mop tank; it also features a new dirt detection feature. Read our review.\n\n\n\nThe Roborock Q8 Max is on sale for $259.99 ($340 off) at Amazon for Prime members, Walmart, and Roborock’s store, which is a record low price. It offers better object avoidance and mopping than the Q5 Pro for its additional cost. The trade-off is a smaller dustbin that makes room for a bigger water tank for mopping. If you’re cleaning spills more frequently than your carpets need vacuuming, it may be worth the jump. You can also get the Q8 Max Plus on sale for an all-time low $419.99 ($400 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target, which adds a self-emptying base to help save time between cleanings.\nThe Roborock Q Revo is down to a new all-time low $539.99 ($360 off) at Amazon for Prime members. It’s not our favorite mid-range robot vacuum that doubles as a mopper as it lacks AI for obstacle avoidance, and there’s no heat-assisted drying. That said, it’s a solid alternative to the Eufy X10 Pro Omni mentioned above in case that deal goes away.\nOur pick for the best budget robot vacuum and mop, the Dreame D10 Plus, is on sale at Dreame’s online storefront for $279.99 ($120 off), which is $20 more than the all-time low. It’s a solid vacuum that can also mop and self-empty. The lidar-equipped bot can also map your home and lets you add keep-out zones, which is a rare feature at this price point.\nIf you really want to save money, the budget-friendly Roomba Combo Essential vacuum and mop is on sale for $157 ($117 off) at Amazon and for $3 more directly from iRobot. The robovac / mop hybrid is the successor to the Roomba 694, with iRobot claiming it offers 20 times more suction power and longer battery life. Unlike pricier robovac / mop hybrids, however, there’s no option for an auto-empty dock.\nThe Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1, a previous pick for best midrange auto-empty vacuum and mop, is selling for $350 off at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target — down to $349.99. The Matrix mops very well, doing a swingy, scrubbing movement with its rear end, and it can auto empty, but it only self-empties in vacuum mode — you have to manually fill and attach the mop reservoir and empty the bin when it mops.\n\n\nThe best smart home deals\n\n\n\n\n\nGovee’s Permanent Outdoor Lights 2 with 72 smart LEDs across 100 feet of wire is $199.99 ($100 off) direct from Govee. The bright LEDs are meant to be permanently adhered and screwed into the eaves of your roof, creating a down-lighting effect that’s bright and colorful on the front of your home. You can use Govee’s app to customize the colors and light effects, easily changing up your home’s look for any holiday without trudging out into the cold every season to put up holiday string lights.\n\n\n\nThe lovely Aqara Ceiling Light T1M light fixture is $40 off at Amazon, down to $109.99 from $149.99 when you apply the onpage coupon. You can add ambiance and function to a room with this dual addressable LED ceiling light. For easier control, pick up this Aqara smart switch for $28.79 ($7 off) at Amazon. An Aqara Zigbee hub is also required. Read our review.\nGovee’s Christmas String Lights 2 are on sale in a 66-foot configuration for $63.99 ($36 off) at Amazon when clicking the onpage coupon, which is their best price yet. The smart string lights offer more than 130 preset lighting effects, though you can also create your own custom displays. The IP65-rated lights also work with Matter, so you can connect them to any major smart home platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best smart security deals\n\nArlo’s new Wired Floodlight Camera is seeing its first sale at $99.99 ($50 off) at The Home Depot. Arlo’s battery-powered Arlo Pro 3 Floodlight Cam is one of our top picks for a floodlight camera, and the wired version means no more worrying about recharging it. However, Arlo’s monthly subscription plan for recorded video is expensive, starting at $8 a month. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur favorite video doorbell, the wired Nest Doorbell, is around $98 ($81 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and the Google Store, which is by far the lowest price we’ve seen. It may not offer 1080p resolution like other video doorbells in its range (it’s limited to 960 x 1280), but it still produces a clear picture and is one of the few options that can manage 24/7 recording. It also supports facial recognition with smart alerts. Read our review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best fitness tracker and smartwatch deals\n\n\n\nThe Fitbit Inspire 3 is available from Amazon, Best Buy, and the Google Store for $69.95 ($30 off), matching its all-time low. The minimalist band lacks built-in GPS and doesn’t offer as many health and fitness features as the Charge 6, but it packs a bright OLED display and does a good job with the basics. It supports both irregular heart rate notifications and advanced sleep tracking, along with several stress management features. Read our hands-on impressions.\nThe Fitbit Ace LTE is down to $179.95 ($50 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Google’s online storefront. Designed for kids, its bubbly design is a bit more playful than most Fitbits. You can play games on it and even take care of a Tamagotchi-like pet, and the tracker periodically pauses the fun until your child has gotten more steps in. Parents can also use it to exchange messages with their children and monitor their real-time location, assuming they opt for the $9.99-a-month Ace Pass data plan.\n\n\n\nIf you’re looking for a terrific Fitbit alternative, the Garmin Venu Sq 2 is a great pick that’s $149.99 ($100 off) at Amazon, Walmart, and Garmin’s online storefront. It’s a shame it lacks built-in GPS, but it does offer a lot of health features not found on rivals like the Fitbit Sense 2 and Versa 4, including hydration tracking and access to Garmin Coach, which provides marathon training plans. These features aren’t locked behind a paywall, either, making the wearable an even better deal. Read our review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best TV, streaming device, and soundbar deals\n\n\n\nThe LG B4 OLED is another solid gaming TV, and you can get a 48-inch model for $699.99 ($100 off) at Best Buy or a 55-inch model for $999.99 ($300 off). It has an older processor and a dimmer screen than the costlier “Evo” models, but it’s a fine option if you’re looking for a relatively affordable way to experience 4K 120Hz gaming on an OLED panel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether you’re outfitting a bathroom or need some sensory stimulation for a newborn’s nursery, there’s still a bit of room in the world for 32-inch, 720p TVs like the Insignia F20 —which is on sale for only $79.99 ($50 off) at Best Buy. You won’t get many tricks, but it has HDMI Arc and it’s a Fire TV, meaning you have the convenience of voice-activated content discovery across hundreds of apps via the included Alexa Voice Remote.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best streaming deals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best smartphone and mobile accessory deals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy A35 5G is matching its all-time low of $299.99 ($100 off) at Samsung’s online storefront. It comes with a robust IP67 rating for dust and water resistance, meaning it should survive a brief swim in a puddle or... you know. Coupled with a strong software support policy with five years of promised security updates, it’s a great deal in the under-$500 class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best charger deals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re not ready to pony up for a Qi2 charger, Ugreen’s Magnetic Wireless Charging Station is just $3 more than the all-time low, now down to $26.99 ($13 off) at Amazon for Prime members. Unlike the newer Qi2 offerings that provide 15W charging speeds, Ugreen’s charger can only supply 7.5W of power to MagSafe-compatible devices, or 5W to a pair of wireless earbuds or any Qi-ready device if you’re using the integrated charging stand located on the bottom.\nIf transparent electronics are your thing, you can pick up the Shargeek 170 Power Bank at Amazon and directly from Sharge for $159 ($20 off). The handsome prism-shaped charger features a 24,000mAh capacity and a maximum output of 170 watts, allowing you to fast-charge most everything you own. It even offers a color display so you can see the remaining battery life, output, and other helpful info at a glance.\n\n\n\n\nThe best gaming deals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Hori Split Pad Pro, our favorite Nintendo Switch controller for handheld mode, is on sale for $38.99 ($11 off) at Walmart and Target. The comfortable Joy-Con alternative is outfitted with large triggers, analog sticks, and a set of easy-to-reach buttons, along with more than enough grip that it shouldn’t pose any problems over long gaming sessions.\nIf you have a wireless mouse that supports it, Logitech’s G PowerPlay Wireless Charging System is on sale at Amazon for an all-time low of $86.62, down from $119.99. Mice like the G502 X Lightspeed support the wireless charging pad, as does the Logitech G Pro X Superlight 2, both of which will grant you infinite playtime without a single second of tethering.\nThe Logitech G203 Lightsync is on sale at Amazon for an all-time low of $18.99 ($21 off) or at Best Buy and Newegg for $19.99. The no-frills gaming mouse offers two side-mounted thumb buttons, an accurate sensor, and a scroll wheel for less than $20, along with some tasteful LEDs around the palm that don’t scream “gamer” the way most RGB accessories do.\nMicrosoft’s official Xbox Wireless Controller is on sale at Target in a variety of colors starting at $39.99 ($20 off). You can save on the special edition models, including the translucent ghost cipher and blue cipher models, which start at $45 (about $25 off) at Target. They’re compatible with the Xbox One and Series X / S, too, or with Windows PCs and mobile devices using Bluetooth or USB-C.\n\n\n\nIf you enjoyed HBO’s fantastic adaptation of The Last of Us, The Last of Us Part I is on sale for the PlayStation 5 at Best Buy, Target, and GameStop starting at $29.99 ($40 off), an all-time low. It’s a remarkable remake of the classic title from 2013, with faster load times, better visuals, and other welcome tweaks. Read our review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsomniac’s Wolverine could be years away; however, if you have yet to play the studio’s other superhero title, Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 has fallen to a new low of $39.99 ($30 off) at GameStop. It’s a terrific sequel to the 2018 open-world title, with new mechanics, more baddies, and the ability to play as two — count ‘em, two — spider-men. Read our review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe PS5 version of Gran Turismo 7 has dropped to $29.99 ($40 off) at Best Buy, nearly matching its best price to date. The sim racer has elegance and reverential regard for racing culture. It features hundreds of cars that you can deeply customize with fully tunable vehicles and unique liveries. You can also race in virtual reality with a PlayStation VR2 headset. Read our review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best location tracker deals\n\n\n\nThe 2024 Tile Mate is available for an all-time low from Amazon and Tile, where you can grab it starting at $19.98 ($5 off). The platform-agnostic Bluetooth tracker helps you keep track of your personal belongings from up to 350 feet away, which is 100 feet wider than its predecessor’s range. It also now can send SOS alerts to your loved ones and even emergency services if you pay for the $14.99-a-month Life360 Gold subscription. \nEufy’s new SmartTrack Card E30 is on sale for $23.99 ($11 off) at Amazon for Prime members only, and directly from Eufy (with promo code WS24T87B1). Unlike its predecessor, the Eufy Security SmartTrack Card, Eufy’s latest tracker is rechargeable and should last you up to a year before you need to charge it again. It also sports a slim design — which makes it ideal for a wallet — and compatibility with Apple’s vast Find My network. \n\n\nThe best Cyber Monday deals on Verge favorites\n\n\n\nIf you’re the crafty type, you can get the Cricut Explore 3 for $199 ($100 off) at Target and direct from Cricut. The printer-like automated cutting machine can create stickers and decals, make precision cuts on various materials, and even print out digitally-created artwork by drawing it out for you with an actual pen or marker.\nThe Fnirsi USB Fast Charge Tester is on sale for $38.99 ($50 off) directly from Fnirsi. The small device is an easy and effective way to test the charging rates of your various USB cables and power adapters. It’s especially handy when you want to ensure a gadget is getting the adequate power it needs.\n\n\n\nA number of other Ember smart mugs are also on sale right now — including the 12-ounce Travel Mug 2 Plus, which you can buy from Ember for $139.96 ($60 off) when you apply promo code BLACKFRIDAY24. Unlike the Mug 2, the Travel Mug 2 Plus supports Apple’s Find My network, so you can keep tabs on it using an iPhone or Mac. It also comes with onboard controls and LED status lights.\nLogitech’s Litra Glow is currently on sale at Amazon for $49.99 ($10 off). The compact LED light has controllable brightness and a simple foot for mounting atop a laptop or monitor, making it a solid option for Twitch streamers, YouTubers, and other content creators.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The EcoFlow Wave 2 is a heat pump that is uniquely powered by both a battery and solar power, one that’s available for $749 ($250 off) at Wellbots or for $799 ($200 off) at Ecoflow’s website and Amazon (with a coupon). The highly portable device combines an air conditioner and heater, and while it struggles with more extreme climates, it does a particularly good job of cooling and heating small spaces in temperate ones. Read our review.\n\n\n\nIf you’re looking for a more nefarious Lego set, the 834-piece replica of Darth Vader’s helmet is on sale at Walmart for $48.98 (about $31 off). That’s the lowest price we’ve seen on the collectible bust, which features a brick-ified life-support system on the inside and a display stand for showcasing the iconic helmet in all its sith-y glory.\nGrovemade makes some truly excellent desk accessories, many of which use metal, wood, and felt for a more premium touch. They’re definitely pricey, but thankfully, Grovemade is running a holiday sale until December 4th, allowing you to save on shelving, succulent planters, and other gear. Some of us at The Verge personally use the Wood Laptop Stand (now $160), which can elevate the look of any workstation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAzul, a four-player puzzle game that challenges you to tile mosaics in a palace, is down to $19.99 (50 percent off) at Amazon, which isn’t far from the all-time low. It’s easy to learn and suitable for ages eight and older, but it has just the right amount of depth and competitiveness to keep family and friends coming back for more.\nTicket to Ride is another classic board game that’s on sale for $25 ($19 off) at Target. That’s one of the better prices lately on a cutthroat card game, which challenges you to build the longest locomotive route across classic America before your other tycoon opponents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHappy Salmon is on sale for just $6.49 (about $6 off) at Target. It’s one of the best icebreakers at social gatherings, for both adults and parents alike, and it takes just minutes to learn and play this card game. Up to eight players can get in on the action, which gets you out of your seats and has you doing fun stuff like giving each other high-fives and “fish bumps.”\nWildfire season might be behind us (for now), but you can still pick up the Coway Airmega AP-1512HH Mighty from Amazon and Coway for around $141 ($99 off), which matches its second-best price to date. The compact HEPA air purifier features a four-stage filtration system, and though we don’t do a ton of dedicated air purifier testing here at The Verge, we can personally attest to the effectiveness of this midrange model for smaller rooms.\nYou can currently grab a gorgeous illustrated edition of The Hobbit for $28.85 (about $49 off) at Amazon. That’s the lowest price we’ve seen on the 432-page hardcover edition of J.R.R. Tolkien’s 1937 classic, which brings together more than 50 of the author’s original sketches, drawings, paintings, and maps.",

The 2021 tablet features a smaller 10.2-inch screen than the newer model, a slower A13 Bionic chip, and a Lightning charging port. However, it’s still snappy enough for streaming, browsing the web, sending emails, and performing other typical tablet tasks, making it great for kids or anybody looking for an affordable tablet.

The latest round of iPad Pros are incredibly thin and sleek, making them easier to hold during note-taking, drawing, or if you’re using one as a laptop replacement with added accessories.

That’s matching the lowest price we’ve seen for Apple’s larger Air, which sports an excellent display and a couple of extra speakers over the 13-inch model that sound great.</li>\n<li id=\"DUq7VO\">The <strong>M4-powered iMac</strong> is on sale starting at $1,149 ($150 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2024-Desktop-Computer-8-core/dp/B0DL76BQ5N?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> with an 8-core CPU, 8-core GPU M4 chip, 16GB of memory, and 256GB of storage when you clip the onpage coupon. It’s a shame the base model only comes with four ports, but otherwise, the iMac is a good desktop computer that offers minor upgrades over its predecessor, including faster performance and a better 12MP webcam with support for Apple’s Center Stage feature. And of course, the 24-inch display continues to come in a number of fun colors. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24303351/apple-imac-m4-review-expensive-beautiful-niche\">Read our review</a>.</li>\n<li id=\"2VsJC8\">You can buy <strong>Apple’s official iPhone 16 Clear Case with MagSafe</strong> from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-Silicone-MagSafe-Control/dp/B0DGHH9WMX?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> starting at $37 ($12 off), which is its best price yet.

    "summary": "Image: Elen Winata for The Verge\n    \n\n\n  \nThere’s still some time to save on a wide range of Verge-approved goods, including streaming services, iPads, and ebook readers.\n Editor’s note: Many of the offers below have expired, but there’s still time to catch many tech gadgets on sale in our roundup of last-chance Cyber Monday deals.\nIf it wasn’t already apparent that Cyber Monday functions as a glorified extension of Black Friday, it should be by now. Many of the items on sale today are the same ones that popped up over the long weekend, though some of the best deals are set to expire in just a couple of hours.\n\n\nFortunately, if you’re a procrastinator in the market for something special, we have your back. Below, you’ll find a detailed list of the best Cyber Monday deals on a host of our favorite gadgets, from robot vacuums and beefy battery packs to gift-friendly stocking suffers for under $30. Every recommendation on our list comes from one of our writers and editors, many of whom have spent years testing products and offering their advice in the form of expert reviews and buying guides. Our deal hunters then cross-check those prices with historical sales trends, helping us determine whether the discounts Amazon and other retailers are slinging are actually worthwhile.\nWe suggest you use the jump links to dig into your category of choice — or not. After all, what’s the harm in a little digital window shopping?\n\n\n\n\n//this line summons a table of contents. use as follows!\n\n//initiateTOC takes the arguments \"header\", \"subheader\", \"collapsible\"\n\n//for whatever header type (\"h2\", \"h3\" etc) you want to be the main header, type it in quotes in the function call. \n\n//if you don't want subheads, set to false in the function call (no quotes)\n\n//collapsible is a true/false toggle\n\n//if you want a specific, unlinked title just add a string at the end in double quotes, e.g. false, \"h3\", false, \"This is the title\"\n\n//see graham if you have any questions/issues\n\n// note that all the header types are off by one: an h1 in the CMS is an h2 in the actual code. If you just want h2 and h3 to show up in the TOC you need to call them h3 and h4. \n\n\nwindow.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', (event) => {\n\tinitiateTOC(\"h2\", \"h3\", false, \"The best Cyber Monday deals\")\n});\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured deals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best Apple deals\n\n\n\n\nYou can buy the last-gen iPad with Wi-Fi and 64GB of storage for its all-time low of $199.99 ($129 off) at Best Buy. The 2021 tablet features a smaller 10.2-inch screen than the newer model, a slower A13 Bionic chip, and a Lightning charging port. However, it’s still snappy enough for streaming, browsing the web, sending emails, and performing other typical tablet tasks, making it great for kids or anybody looking for an affordable tablet. It even features a 3.5mm headphone jack — a welcome rarity.\nIf you want the latest and greatest, the new iPad Mini is available at Amazon or Best Buy for $469 ($30 off). Apple’s 8.3-inch tablet is pretty similar to the outgoing model from 2021, only it features faster Wi-Fi speeds and support for the newer Apple Pencil Pro. It also leverages the new Apple A17 Pro chip, which allows for various AI-based Apple Intelligence features. Read our review.\n\n\n\nThe latest 11-inch iPad Pro with M4 processor, 256GB of storage, and that lovely OLED display is $849 ($150 off) at Amazon when you click the on-page coupon. And if you prefer the larger model, the 12.9-inch M4 iPad Pro is $1,099 ($200 off) at Amazon. The latest round of iPad Pros are incredibly thin and sleek, making them easier to hold during note-taking, drawing, or if you’re using one as a laptop replacement with added accessories. Of course, they don’t do much more than previous generations, but they certainly look great doing it. Read our review.\nVerizon is offering up to $1,000 off an iPhone 16 Pro or iPhone 16 Pro Max and up to $830 off an iPhone 16 when you trade in any phone in any condition, provided you’re signed on to a “select Unlimited plan.” AT&T is also offering $1,000 off the iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max or $830 off an iPhone 16 with trade-in. You can get the same Verizon and AT&T deals through Best Buy, in which case you’ll get a $100 Best Buy gift card with your purchase.\n\n\n\n\nIf you want a larger laptop from Apple, the 15-inch M3 MacBook Air with base 256GB storage and 16GB of RAM is going for $1,044 ($255 off) at Amazon. That’s matching the lowest price we’ve seen for Apple’s larger Air, which sports an excellent display and a couple of extra speakers over the 13-inch model that sound great.\nThe M4-powered iMac is on sale starting at $1,149 ($150 off) at Amazon with an 8-core CPU, 8-core GPU M4 chip, 16GB of memory, and 256GB of storage when you clip the onpage coupon. It’s a shame the base model only comes with four ports, but otherwise, the iMac is a good desktop computer that offers minor upgrades over its predecessor, including faster performance and a better 12MP webcam with support for Apple’s Center Stage feature. And of course, the 24-inch display continues to come in a number of fun colors. Read our review.\nYou can buy Apple’s official iPhone 16 Clear Case with MagSafe from Amazon starting at $37 ($12 off), which is its best price yet. Apple designed the polycarbonate case so that it works well with the iPhone 16’s new Camera Control button. The company also added a “glossy scratch-resistant coating,” likely after many complained about how last year’s FineWoven cases scratched easily.\nIf you prefer to buy first-party, through December 2nd, Apple is hosting its own rare sales event. You can get up to $200 on select MacBook Airs, while certain iPads will net you $100 in credit. Apple will also give you anywhere between $25–$75 in credit when you purchase select iPhones, AirPods, styli, streaming devices, and more.\nThe best wireless earbuds and headphone deals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJabra may have stopped selling consumer earbuds, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t discounts available on the existing models. Right now, for instance, you can purchase the Jabra Elite 10 Gen 2 for an all-time low of $199.99 ($80 off) at Amazon and Best Buy. In addition to noise cancellation, the semi-open Elite 10 come with an LE Audio charging case, which lets you wirelessly transmit audio from an external device. They also feature physical buttons and support other essentials, including multipoint Bluetooth connectivity.\nYou can also pick up Jabra’s Elite 8 Active Gen 2 for $169.99 ($60 off) at Amazon and Best Buy, which is one of the better prices we’ve seen. The fitness-focused earbuds offer a robust IP68 water resistance rating that can withstand sweaty workouts, along with a secure fit and adaptive ANC. They also support multipoint pairing and wireless charging, and like the Elite 10, come with an LE Audio charging case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nothing Ear (a) are on sale for $69 ($30 off) directly from Nothing and at Amazon, if you’re a Prime member. The noise-canceling earbuds are our favorite pair for under $100, with surprisingly good sound for the price. They also offer an impressive feature set that includes multipoint Bluetooth pairing, a decent IP54 dust and water resistance rating, and even a low-latency mode for gaming. Read our hands-on impressions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe WH-1000XM4, Sony’s last-gen flagship headphones, are on sale starting at $198 ($152 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target. That’s not the shockingly low $130 they dropped to earlier this year, but it’s still a great price for a pair of cans that offer some of the best sound quality and noise cancellation performance around. They offer 30 hours of battery life, a foldable design, and flexible ambient audio modes, including a speak-to-chat feature that reduces volume while you’re talking. Read our review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also buy Amazon’s newer Echo Buds for just $24.99 ($25 off) at Amazon. The wireless earbuds lack noise cancellation, but they support multipoint pairing and integrate well with Amazon Alexa for hands-free control. They also feature a semi-open design that makes it easier to hear your surroundings. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best speaker and smart display deals\n\n\n\n\nThe Sonos Roam 2 is available for $139 ($40 off) from Amazon, Best Buy, and Sonos. The compact smart speaker is far easier to set up than the prior model, thanks to a dedicated Bluetooth button, meaning you can start listening to tunes without first setting it up in the Sonos app. It also lasts 10 hours per charge and features support for both AirPlay 2 and Amazon Alexa, not to mention an IP67 rating for dust and water protection. You can even sync it with other Sonos speakers like most other Sonos products.\nIf you want a portable Sonos speaker with bigger sound and substantially longer battery life, the Sonos Move 2 is on sale for $359 ($90 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Sonos’ online storefront. It packs multiple speakers for stereo sound, and it supports USB-C line-in in addition to the usual wireless streaming options. It’s not exactly small or light (it’s chunky at 6.61 pounds), but the Move 2 can be ideal if you want a single Sonos device to enjoy outdoors or move from room to room in your home Read our review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want a smart alarm clock with a great display and zero mics / cameras, the latest Echo Spot is on sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target for $44.99 ($60 off), matching its lowest price to date. The 2.83-inch touchscreen can’t display videos or double as a digital photo frame, but it can tell you the weather when you wake up and allows you to control various smart home devices via Alexa. Read our review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Echo Show 8 (third-gen), the latest version of Amazon’s midsize smart display, is down to $79.99 ($70 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target. You can also buy it with an Amazon Basics Smart Color Bulb for the same price at Amazon in black and white. The eight-inch device looks a lot like previous models, but it’s got widget support for added versatility, a more responsive touchscreen, and nice-sounding speakers. Just don’t expect to take any Zoom meetings on it, as only Alexa video calls are currently supported. Read our review.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best tablet deals\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re looking for a basic tablet for under $100, Amazon is also discounting many of the cheaper models. The latest Amazon Fire HD 8 tablet is on sale at Amazon and Best Buy with ads and 32GB of storage starting at $54.99 ($45 off), an all-time low. The 8-inch Fire HD 8 is a decent entertainment device for playing games, streaming, and other basic tasks, even if it’s not anywhere near as capable as the higher-end alternatives from Apple and Google.\nThe latest Fire HD 10 is down to its all-time low of $74.99 ($65 off) with ads and 32GB of storage at Amazon and Best Buy. The Fire HD 10 offers a sharper 1080p display than the Fire HD 8, along with support for both the Made for Amazon Stylus Pen and Amazon’s handwriting recognition technology.\n\n\nThe best e-reader deals\n\n\n\n\nYou can get Amazon’s newest Kindle with lockscreen ads for $84.99 ($25 off) at Amazon and Best Buy, or without lockscreen ads at Amazon for $104.99 ($25 off). The 2024 ebook reader is more of an iterative update compared to previous models, with a backlight that’s 25 percent brighter. It’s also a touch lighter, a bit faster, and lasts a bit longer (up to eight weeks).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best laptop and desktop deals\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft’s base version of its 13.8-inch Surface Laptop 7 is on sale for $899.99 ($300 off) at Best Buy with a Snapdragon X Plus processor, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. The Arm-based laptop offers excellent MacBook Air-like battery life that easily lasts through a day of work. It performs well, though Windows on Arm does have some compatibility issues with some games and software — so be sure what you need to work is supported.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe much cheaper 2024 Asus ROG Strix G16 laptop is down to $1,099.99 ($300 off) at Amazon. The more modest Strix is configured with a slightly older Intel Core i7 13650HX processor, RTX 4060 GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB SSD. Its 16-inch display is only 1920 x 1200 resolution, but it supports a fairly speedy 165Hz refresh. And it just wouldn’t be a Strix without a whole load of RGB lighting.\n\n\n\nThe MSI Stealth A16 AI Plus is on sale at Best Buy with a new Ryzen AI 9 chip, an RTX 4070 GPU, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD for $1,699.99 ($300 off), matching its best price to date. The mid-tier Stealth is one of MSI’s best-selling gaming laptops, as it balances a whole lot of gaming performance without the eye-watering prices of higher-end models. The 16-inch laptop isn’t exactly small, but it’s thin enough to take places, and its QHD panel supports up to a speedy 240Hz refresh rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best robot vacuum / mop deals\n\n\n\n\nThe Roomba Combo 10 Max is matching its all-time low of around $999 ($400 off) directly from Amazon, iRobot, and Best Buy. The new flagship model from iRobot has all the same features as the j9 Combo, plus a new dock that can clean and dry the robot’s mop, refill its water tank, and empty its bin.   \nThe iRobot Roomba Combo j7 Plus is on sale for around $699 ($300 off) at Amazon and Best Buy, which is one of its better prices to date. The j7 Plus is similar to the Roomba Combo j9 Plus, as it offers AI obstacle avoidance and a mop that automatically lifts to keep your carpets dry. The main difference is that the Combo j9 Plus offers longer batter life and can refill its own mop tank; it also features a new dirt detection feature. Read our review.\nAmazon and Narwal are selling Narwal Freo X Ultra for $799.99 ($600 off), which is the best price we’ve seen on the terrific mopping bot to date. The vac’s anti-tangle brush and 8,200Pa suction do a nice job on most carpets, but where it excels is on hard floors. In fact, the X Ultra is smart enough that it will go back and re-mop areas it deems as dirty. It touts relatively quiet operation, too, thanks in part to an onboard compression bin that only needs to be emptied every 60 days or so.\n\n\n\nThe Roborock Q8 Max is on sale for $259.99 ($340 off) at Amazon, Walmart, and Roborock’s store, which is a record low price. It offers better object avoidance and mopping than the Q5 Pro for its additional cost. The trade-off is a smaller dustbin that makes room for a bigger water tank for mopping. If you’re cleaning spills more frequently than your carpets need vacuuming, it may be worth the jump. You can also get the Q8 Max Plus on sale for an all-time low $419.99 ($400 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target, which adds a self-emptying base to help save time between cleanings.\nThe Roborock Q Revo is down to a new all-time low $539.99 ($360 off) at Amazon. It’s not our favorite mid-range robot vacuum that doubles as a mopper as it lacks AI for obstacle avoidance, and there’s no heat-assisted drying. That said, it’s a solid alternative to the Eufy X10 Pro Omni mentioned above in case that deal goes away.\n\n\n\nOur pick for the best budget robot vacuum and mop, the Dreame D10 Plus, is on sale at Amazon and Dreame’s online storefront for $259.99 ($140 off), an all-time low. It’s a solid vacuum that can also mop and self-empty. The lidar-equipped bot can also map your home and lets you add keep-out zones, which is a rare feature at this price point.\nIf you really want to save money, the budget-friendly Roomba Combo Essential vacuum and mop is on sale for $157 ($117 off) at Amazon and for $3 more directly from iRobot. The robovac / mop hybrid is the successor to the Roomba 694, with iRobot claiming it offers 20 times more suction power and longer battery life. Unlike pricier robovac / mop hybrids, however, there’s no option for an auto-empty dock.\nThe Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1, a previous pick for best midrange auto-empty vacuum and mop, is selling for $350 off at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target — down to $349.99. The Matrix mops very well, doing a swingy, scrubbing movement with its rear end, and it can auto empty, but it only self-empties in vacuum mode — you have to manually fill and attach the mop reservoir and empty the bin when it mops.\n\n\nThe best smart home deals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGovee’s Permanent Outdoor Lights 2 with 72 smart LEDs across 100 feet of wire is $199.99 ($100 off) direct from Govee. The bright LEDs are meant to be permanently adhered and screwed into the eaves of your roof, creating a down-lighting effect that’s bright and colorful on the front of your home. You can use Govee’s app to customize the colors and light effects, easily changing up your home’s look for any holiday without trudging out into the cold every season to put up holiday string lights.\nIf you’re looking for a budget-friendly thermostat, the Amazon Smart Thermostat offers a lot for the price. It’s currently down to $51.99 ($28 off) at Amazon and Best Buy, which is its second-best price to date. The thermostat integrates well with Amazon Alexa and is capable of adapting to your habits and preferences over time, much like pricier models. However, bear in mind you can’t control it using voice assistants other than Alexa, and it lacks native temperature sensors. Read our review.\n\n\n\nThe lovely Aqara Ceiling Light T1M light fixture is $40 off at Amazon, down to $109.99 from $149.99 when you apply the onpage coupon. You can add ambiance and function to a room with this dual addressable LED ceiling light. For easier control, pick up this Aqara smart switch for $28.79 ($7 off) at Amazon. An Aqara Zigbee hub is also required. Read our review.\nGovee’s Christmas String Lights 2 are on sale in a 66-foot configuration for $63.99 ($36 off) at Amazon, which is their best price yet. The smart string lights offer more than 130 preset lighting effects, though you can also create your own custom displays. The IP65-rated lights also work with Matter, so you can connect them to any major smart home platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEero’s Pro 6E mesh router is available for an all-time low of $159.99 ($90 off) at Amazon and Best Buy, or as part of a two-pack for $259.99 (Amazon, Best Buy), or a three-pack for $349.99 (Amazon, Best Buy). It doesn’t support Wi-Fi 7 like the newer Eero Max, but it does support the 6GHz Wi-Fi band with speeds of up to 1.3Gbps. It also can cover up to 2,000 square feet per unit and conveniently features a pair of ethernet ports. Read our review.\n\n\n\n\nMill is offering $200 off its high-tech smart bin, which grinds and dehydrates kitchen scraps overnight into a compost-like material. You can buy the bin outright for $799, down from $999, at Mill’s website. It’s a great way to keep stinky odors out of your kitchen, reduce food waste, and cut down on how much trash you generate. Read our review.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best smart security deals\n\n\n\n\n\nArlo’s new Wired Floodlight Camera is seeing its first sale at $99.99 ($50 off) at The Home Depot. Arlo’s battery-powered Arlo Pro 3 Floodlight Cam is one of our top picks for a floodlight camera, and the wired version means no more worrying about recharging it. However, Arlo’s monthly subscription plan for recorded video is expensive, starting at $8 a month. \n\n\n\nThe svelte retrofit August Wi-Fi (4th-gen) smart lock is just $110.04 right now at Amazon, down from $229.99. This is a great price for this excellent retrofit lock that works with all the major smart home platforms and doesn’t require a separate bridge or hub to connect to Wi-Fi. Pro tip: pick up a value pack of these CR123A batteries that are on sale for $32 at Amazon, as it eats through batteries, and they’re expensive. Read our review. \n\n\n\nRing’s Stick Up Cam Battery is on sale for an all-time low of $49.99 ($50 off) at Wellbots or $54.99 ($45 off) at Amazon and Best Buy. The battery-powered 1080p camera offers weatherproofing, so you can mount and use it outside and inside, but you’ll have to pay for a Ring Protect plan to record video. Thankfully, basics like two-way audio, night video, and motion alerts are available for free.\nThe second-gen Ring Indoor Cam is available at Amazon and Best Buy for $29.99 ($30 off), which matches its best price to date. Unlike its predecessor, the indoor security camera features color night vision and a physical privacy cover, allowing you to turn off video and audio recording. The wired camera is similar to its predecessor otherwise and features sharp 1080p HD resolution, a built-in siren, and two-way audio. \n\n\n\nYou can buy Google’s wired Nest Cam for $69.99 ($30 off) at Amazon and Best Buy, which matches its all-time low. The indoor 1080p camera offers snappy performance and free smart alerts for people and pets. It also comes with 24/7 recording and other useful features, including a Familiar Faces tool that lets you know who is in a room. However, you’ll have to pay for Google’s Nest Aware plan to enable those features. Read our review.\nOur favorite video doorbell, the wired Nest Doorbell, is around $98 ($81 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and the Google Store, which is by far the lowest price we’ve seen. It may not offer 1080p resolution like other video doorbells in its range (it’s limited to 960 x 1280), but it still produces a clear picture and is one of the few options that can manage 24/7 recording. It also supports facial recognition with smart alerts. Read our review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best fitness tracker and smartwatch deals\n\n\n\n\nThe Fitbit Inspire 3 is available from Amazon, Best Buy, and the Google Store for $69.95 ($30 off), matching its all-time low. The minimalist band lacks built-in GPS and doesn’t offer as many health and fitness features as the Charge 6, but it packs a bright OLED display and does a good job with the basics. It supports both irregular heart rate notifications and advanced sleep tracking, along with several stress management features. Read our hands-on impressions.\nThe Fitbit Ace LTE is now at a fresh all-time low of $160.95 ($60 off) at Amazon, or you can get it for $179.95 ($50 off) at Best Buy and Google’s online storefront. Designed for kids, its bubbly design is a bit more playful than most Fitbits. You can play games on it and even take care of a Tamagotchi-like pet, and the tracker periodically pauses the fun until your child has gotten more steps in. Parents can also use it to exchange messages with their children and monitor their real-time location, assuming they opt for the $9.99-a-month Ace Pass data plan.\n\n\n\nIf you’re looking for a terrific Fitbit alternative, the Garmin Venu Sq 2 is a great pick that’s $149.99 ($100 off) at Amazon, Walmart, and Garmin’s online storefront. It’s a shame it lacks built-in GPS, but it does offer a lot of health features not found on rivals like the Fitbit Sense 2 and Versa 4, including hydration tracking and access to Garmin Coach, which provides marathon training plans. These features aren’t locked behind a paywall, either, making the wearable an even better deal. Read our review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Garmin Fenix 7S Pro, one of the best fitness trackers you can buy, is on sale exclusively for Verge readers. Now through Cyber Monday, you can get the multi-sport fitness watch for just $529.99 ($270 off) at Wellbots with promo code VERGEBF270. In addition to a smorgasbord of health sensors and workout tracking, it has reliable multiband GPS, solar charging, military-grade durability, and weekslong battery life. Read our review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best TV, streaming device, and soundbar deals\n\n\n\n\nLG’s G4 OLED TV is on sale in the 55-inch configuration starting at $1,796.99 (about $803 off) at Amazon and Best Buy, which is its best price yet. The 4K TV sports many of the C4’s standout features — including a 144Hz refresh rate — but it offers brighter picture quality and more accurate colors.\nThe LG B4 OLED is another solid gaming TV, and you can get a 48-inch model for $599.99 ($200 off) at Best Buy or a 55-inch model for $999.99 ($400 off). It has an older processor and a dimmer screen than the costlier “Evo” models, but it’s a fine option if you’re looking for a relatively affordable way to experience 4K 120Hz gaming on an OLED panel.\n\n\n\n\nYou can get the 65-inch Samsung S90D OLED starting at $1,397.99 ($800 off) from Amazon, Best Buy, and Samsung, which is the lowest price we’ve seen on the 4K TV. It’s just a small step down from the S95D OLED, as it doesn’t have a glare-reduction panel, but you still get sharp picture quality and a slew of gaming features, including a 120Hz variable refresh rate. Unfortunately, Samsung TVs still exclude Dolby Vision, so you’ll have to look elsewhere if that’s important to you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether you’re outfitting a bathroom or need some sensory stimulation for a newborn’s nursery, there’s still a bit of room in the world for 32-inch, 720p TVs like the Insignia F20 —which is on sale for only $69.99 ($60 off) at Best Buy. You won’t get many tricks, but it has HDMI Arc and it’s a Fire TV, meaning you have the convenience of voice-activated content discovery across hundreds of apps via the included Alexa Voice Remote.\n\n\n\nThe Sonos Ray is available for just $169 ($110 off) from Amazon, Best Buy, and the Sonos storefront. The compact soundbar isn’t as powerful as other models in the brand’s lineup, but it should easily best your TV’s built-in speakers. It’s not our first choice for a soundbar — it lacks HDMI (and thus doesn’t support the helpful eARC tech) — but it’s an affordable way to add a Sonos piece to your home theater setup if you don’t mind using optical. Read our review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best streaming deals\n\n\n\nNow until 3AM ET on December 2nd, you can get an entire year of ad-supported Peacock Premium for $19.99 or six months for $1.99 a month. The streaming service is great for sports fans, featuring live broadcasts for NFL Sunday Night Football games, college basketball, Premier League soccer, WWE premium live events, golf, and more. It features scores of other programming, too, including on-demand movies and original shows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best smartphone and mobile accessory deals\n\n\n\n\n\nMoft is taking up to $60 off a variety of cases, stands, and other accessories. The ongoing promo includes Moft’s Invisible Phone Stand and Wallet, which is capable of holding up to three cards and was our favorite adhesive phone grip in 2022. To get the $60 discount, you’ll have to order over $200 and apply the code BF60. However, you can also spend much less and still save, with Moft offering $10 off if you spend over $50 (with code BF10); $20 off if you spend more than $100 (using code BF20); and $37 off if you spend over $150 (with code BF37).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy A35 5G is matching its all-time low of $299.99 ($100 off) at Best Buy and Samsung’s online storefront. It comes with a robust IP67 rating for dust and water resistance, meaning it should survive a brief swim in a puddle or... you know. Coupled with a strong software support policy with five years of promised security updates, it’s a great deal in the under-$500 class.\nThe OnePlus Open is going for $1,199.99, down from $1,699.99, which is an excellent price for a great folding phone. It’s a year old at this point, but it should still receive another four years of security updates. You can get an extra $100 off with a trade-in if you go through OnePlus directly, but the discounted price is also available from Amazon and Best Buy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best charger deals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re not ready to pony up for a Qi2 charger, Ugreen’s Magnetic Wireless Charging Station has fallen to an all-time low of $23.99 ($16 off) at Amazon. Unlike the newer Qi2 offerings that provide 15W charging speeds, Ugreen’s charger can only supply 7.5W of power to MagSafe-compatible devices, or 5W to a pair of wireless earbuds or any Qi-ready device if you’re using the integrated charging stand located on the bottom.\nIf transparent electronics are your thing, you can pick up the Shargeek 170 Power Bank at Amazon for $134.90 ($64 off) or directly from Sharge for $129.90 ($69 off). The handsome prism-shaped charger features a 24,000mAh capacity and a maximum output of 170 watts, allowing you to fast-charge most everything you own. It even offers a color display so you can see the remaining battery life, output, and other helpful info at a glance.\nBelkin’s BoostCharge Dual Wall Charger 42W has dropped to a new low of $19.99 ($10 off) at Amazon. It has one USB-C and one USB-A port for simultaneous charging and folding prongs that make it easier to slip into a bag or pocket while traveling. Its USB-C Power Delivery port meets the fast charging speeds of most smartphones, but you can also use it to charge tablets and laptops at a respectable rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best gaming deals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Xbox Series S is down to around $249 ($50 off) at Best Buy and Target. It’s the most affordable option in Microsoft’s latest console generation, namely because it features less processing power and caps gaming at 1440p resolution. It also lacks a disc drive and only has 512GB of storage instead of 1TB. However, it’s still capable of playing all the same games as the Series X. Read our review.\nOne of Best Buy’s doorbusters is the Asus ROG Ally, which is matching its all-time low of $499.99 ($150 off) with a Z1 Extreme processor and 512GB of storage. (My Best Buy Plus and Total members can save another $50.) The handheld lets you play PC games on the go, thanks to its seven-inch 1080p display, and while there are faster alternatives, it’s still serviceable for esports shooters, indie gems, and other lightweight titles. Read our review.\nAnbernic is selling its RG35XXSP handheld for $57.19 ($10 off) when you use code BF2024 at checkout. The little clamshell emulation machine is inspired by Nintendo’s GameBoy Advance SP and it can emulate all kinds of classic systems from the original NES to the PlayStation Portable.\n\n\n\nThe Hori Split Pad Pro, our favorite Nintendo Switch controller for handheld mode, is on sale for $38.99 ($11 off) at Walmart and Target. The comfortable Joy-Con alternative is outfitted with large triggers, analog sticks, and a set of easy-to-reach buttons, along with more than enough grip that it shouldn’t pose any problems over long gaming sessions.\nIf you have a wireless mouse that supports it, Logitech’s G PowerPlay Wireless Charging System is on sale at Amazon for an all-time low of $86.62, down from $119.99. Mice like the G502 X Lightspeed support the wireless charging pad, as does the Logitech G Pro X Superlight 2, both of which will grant you infinite playtime without a single second of tethering.\nThe Logitech G203 Lightsync is on sale at Amazon for an all-time low of $18.99 ($21 off) or at Best Buy and Newegg for $19.99. The no-frills gaming mouse offers two side-mounted thumb buttons, an accurate sensor, and a scroll wheel for less than $20, along with some tasteful LEDs around the palm that don’t scream “gamer” the way most RGB accessories do.\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft’s official Xbox Wireless Controller is on sale at Amazon Best Buy and Target in a variety of colors starting at $39.99 ($20 off). You can save on the special edition models, including the translucent ghost cipher and blue cipher models, which start at $45 (about $25 off) at Amazon, Target, and Best Buy. All of them are compatible with the Xbox One and Series X / S, too, or with Windows PCs and mobile devices using Bluetooth or USB-C.\nAmazon’s Luna wireless controller has reached an all-time low of $39.99 ($30) at Amazon. The gamepad is designed for the retailer’s cloud gaming service, exclusively enabling features like server-side low-latency control and automatic screen switching on Amazon Fire TVs and devices. That said, you can use the controller with other games and platforms, including Windows, macOS, and mobile devices via Bluetooth and USB-C.\n\n\n\n\nIf you enjoyed HBO’s fantastic adaptation of The Last of Us, The Last of Us Part I is on sale for the PlayStation 5 at Best Buy, Target, and GameStop starting at $29.99 ($40 off), an all-time low. It’s a remarkable remake of the classic title from 2013, with faster load times, better visuals, and other welcome tweaks. Read our review.\nFinal Fantasy VII Rebirth is on sale for the PS5 at Amazon and Best Buy for $39.99 ($30 off), an all-time low. The sophomore game in Square Enix’s reboot trilogy is arguably better than the original, with added gameplay tweaks, improved visuals, and welcome character development that deftly expands upon the classic PS1 RPG. It’s all killer, no filler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsomniac’s Wolverine could be years away; however, if you have yet to play the studio’s other superhero title, Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 has fallen to a new low of $39.99 ($30 off) at GameStop. It’s a terrific sequel to the 2018 open-world title, with new mechanics, more baddies, and the ability to play as two — count ‘em, two — spider-men. Read our review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe PS5 version of Gran Turismo 7 has dropped to $29.99 ($40 off) at Best Buy, nearly matching its best price to date. The sim racer has elegance and reverential regard for racing culture. It features hundreds of cars that you can deeply customize with fully tunable vehicles and unique liveries. You can also race in virtual reality with a PlayStation VR2 headset. Read our review.\nSony’s InZone Buds for PC and PlayStation have dropped to a new low of around $168 ($32 off) at Amazon and Best Buy. The gaming-centric wireless earbuds come with a USB-C dongle and deliver great sound, namely because they use the same drivers and offer the same noise cancellation capabilities as Sony’s WF-1000XM5 — our pick for the best wireless earbuds; they also offer robust customization via Sony’s InZone Hub software.\n\n\n\n\nThe 2TB WD_Black SN850P SSD is on sale with a PS5-ready heatsink for $159.99 ($100 off) at Best Buy and SanDisk’s online store. While it misses the all-time low mark by $30, it’s still a good price for a package that makes it easy to add storage to your PS5. With traditional external SSDs and hard drives, you’d still need to transfer games to the PS5’s internal storage. You can also slot it into an available M.2 slot in your gaming PC.\nNeed some affordable but sizable storage for your Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck? The SanDisk 512GB Extreme microSD card is just $35.99 (around $7 off) at Amazon. It’s been slightly cheaper before but remains one of the most affordable ways to fit many more digital games onto a handheld.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best location tracker deals\n\n\n\nThe 2024 Tile Mate is available for an all-time low from Amazon and Tile, where you can grab it starting at $19.98 ($5 off). The platform-agnostic Bluetooth tracker helps you keep track of your personal belongings from up to 350 feet away, which is 100 feet wider than its predecessor’s range. It also now can send SOS alerts to your loved ones and even emergency services if you pay for the $14.99-a-month Life360 Gold subscription. \nEufy’s new SmartTrack Card E30 is on sale for $23.99 ($11 off) at Amazon and directly from Eufy (with promo code WS24T87B1). Unlike its predecessor, the Eufy Security SmartTrack Card, Eufy’s latest tracker is rechargeable and should last you up to a year before you need to charge it again. It also sports a slim design — which makes it ideal for a wallet — and compatibility with Apple’s vast Find My network. \nIf you’re really tight on cash, the last-gen Eufy Security SmartTrack Card is also on sale for $16.88 ($14 off) at Amazon, which is nearly its best price to date. Just bear in mind it doesn’t have a replaceable battery, though the one it does should last for up to three years.\n\n\nThe best Cyber Monday deals on Verge favorites\n\n\n\nIf you’re the crafty type, you can get the Cricut Explore 3 for $199 ($100 off) at Target and direct from Cricut. The printer-like automated cutting machine can create stickers and decals, make precision cuts on various materials, and even print out digitally-created artwork by drawing it out for you with an actual pen or marker.\nThe Fnirsi USB Fast Charge Tester is on sale for $38.99 ($50 off) directly from Fnirsi, or if you’re a Prime subscriber, you can get it faster from Amazon for $46.01. The small device is an easy and effective way to test the charging rates of your various USB cables and power adapters. It’s especially handy when you want to ensure a gadget is getting the adequate power it needs.\n\n\n\n\nA number of other Ember smart mugs are also on sale right now — including the 12-ounce Travel Mug 2 Plus, which you can buy from Ember for $139.96 ($60 off) through December 2nd when you apply promo code BLACKFRIDAY24. Unlike the Mug 2, the Travel Mug 2 Plus supports Apple’s Find My network, so you can keep tabs on it using an iPhone or Mac. It also comes with onboard controls and LED status lights.\nLogitech’s Litra Glow is currently on sale at Amazon for $47.49 (about $13 off), matching its second-best price to date. The compact LED light has controllable brightness and a simple foot for mounting atop a laptop or monitor, making it a solid option for Twitch streamers, YouTubers, and other content creators.\nThe Solo Stove Bonfire + Stand 2.0 is selling for $195.99 ($149 off) at Amazon. The Bonfire 2.0 makes a great backyard addition for outdoor gatherings, and it also travels well if you want to light up some marshmallows at the beach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can buy the Hatch Restore 2 directly from Hatch for an all-time low of $139.99 ($30 off) when you use promo code BFCM30 (you can also buy it for $5 more at Amazon and Best Buy). The TikTok-famous smart clock, which also functions as a sunrise lamp and sound machine, is one of our favorite sleep gadgets. It offers a simulated sunrise, peaceful alarms, guided meditation exercises, and a selection of white noise so you gently wake up and fall asleep more easily. Read our review.\nThe Te-Rich Weighted Jump Rope is on sale for an all-time low of $13.48 (about $4 off) at Amazon for Prime subscribers. The adjustable smart rope isn’t particularly fancy, but it does offer a built-in LCD display with a reliable jump counter and timer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Ordilend All-in-one Keyboard Cleaning Kit is $13.58 (around $3 off) at Amazon when you click the on-page coupon. The handy multi-tool has a large brush for cleaning around keys and keyboard switches, a built-in wipe for your screen, and various other small tools built into its chassis.\nCagiwiru’s Cordless Air Blower / Duster is $18.97 ($7 off) at Amazon. It may not be quite as powerful as a can of compressed air, but it’s close, and it’s much more versatile with its swappable tips, built-in light, and ability to recharge via USB-C.\nAs part of its ongoing Black Friday promo, Oaky is taking up to 25 percent off several desks, chargers, docks, and other wooden accessories. Right now, for instance, you can buy its attractive Laptop Stand for $120 ($30 off) or an 80 x 19-inch Floating Shelf for $195.50 ($35 off), both of which are available with either oak or walnut construction.\n The EcoFlow Wave 2 is a heat pump that is uniquely powered by both a battery and solar power, one that’s available for $749 ($250 off) at Wellbots or for $799 ($200 off) at Ecoflow’s website and Amazon (with a coupon). The highly portable device combines an air conditioner and heater, and while it struggles with more extreme climates, it does a particularly good job of cooling and heating small spaces in temperate ones. Read our review.\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re looking for a more nefarious Lego set, the 834-piece replica of Darth Vader’s helmet is on sale at Walmart for $48.98 (about $31 off). That’s the lowest price we’ve seen on the collectible bust, which features a brick-ified life-support system on the inside and a display stand for showcasing the iconic helmet in all its sith-y glory.\nGrovemade makes some truly excellent desk accessories, many of which use metal, wood, and felt for a more premium touch. They’re definitely pricey, but thankfully, Grovemade is running a holiday sale until December 4th, allowing you to save on shelving, succulent planters, and other gear. Some of us at The Verge personally use the Wood Laptop Stand (now $160), which can elevate the look of any workstation.\n\n\n\nIf you’re looking for a more “innovative” way to eat cereal, the CrunchCup is on sale at Amazon for an all-time low of $17.56 (about $6 off). The absurd, two-cup contraption takes some getting used to, but once you get it down, it’s a handy way to consume breakfast on the go. Just pick your cereal wisely — not everything Kellogg’s makes is spout-friendly.\nThe Joseph Joseph Garlic Rocker is one of the easiest ways to crush or mince the greatest-tasting plant known to humanity, and it’s on sale for $9.99 (about $10 off) at Amazon. The simple design makes cleaning it much easier than more complicated garlic presses with tiny holes that easily get clogged.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAzul, a four-player puzzle game that challenges you to tile mosaics in a palace, is down to $13.19 (about $27 off) at Amazon thanks to an on-page coupon, which is a new low. It’s easy to learn and suitable for ages eight and older, but it has just the right amount of depth and competitiveness to keep family and friends coming back for more.\nTicket to Ride is another classic board game that’s on sale for $16.99 (about $38 off) at Amazon when you click the on-page coupon and $25.49 at Target. That’s one of the better prices lately on a cutthroat card game, which challenges you to build the longest locomotive route across classic America before your other tycoon opponents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHappy Salmon is on sale for just $6.49 (about $6 off) at Amazon and Target. It’s one of the best icebreakers at social gatherings, for both adults and parents alike, and it takes just minutes to learn and play this card game. Up to eight players can get in on the action, which gets you out of your seats and has you doing fun stuff like giving each other high-fives and “fish bumps.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWildfire season might be behind us (for now), but you can still pick up the Coway Airmega AP-1512HH Mighty from Amazon and Coway for around $141 ($99 off), which matches its second-best price to date. The compact HEPA air purifier features a four-stage filtration system, and though we don’t do a ton of dedicated air purifier testing here at The Verge, we can personally attest to the effectiveness of this midrange model for smaller rooms.\nYou can currently grab a gorgeous illustrated edition of The Hobbit for $28.85 (about $49 off) at Amazon. That’s the lowest price we’ve seen on the 432-page hardcover edition of J.R.R. Tolkien’s 1937 classic, which brings together more than 50 of the author’s original sketches, drawings, paintings, and maps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate, December 2nd: Updated to reflect current pricing and availability.",

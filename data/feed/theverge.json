That deadline now falls one day before President-elect Donald Trump will be inaugurated for the second time — thanks in part to donations from <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-06-24/jeff-yass-how-tiktok-billionaire-became-a-top-influence-in-2024-election\">ByteDance investor Jeff Yass</a>. Though Trump sought to ban TikTok during his first term, he changed his tune on the campaign trail this year, saying a ban would just <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/8/24094587/republicans-ignore-trump-criticism-and-plan-to-vote-next-week-on-a-bill-that-could-ban-tiktok\">help a different target of his ire</a>: Meta.</p>\n<p id=\"VdQ14r\">While Trump allies <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/11/12/trump-tiktok-ban-sale/\">reportedly expected him to try to halt the ban</a>, the options for recourse are somewhat limited. The law allows for a 90 day extension at the president’s discretion, but only if progress is being made toward a spin-out. Trump could direct the Department of Justice not to enforce the bill, but that still leaves app store companies like Google and Apple — tasked with being the gatekeepers to the app — in a precarious spot, should Trump change his mind or a future administration decide to enforce the law.</p>\n<p id=\"thK3tp\">The court decided that the law could survive even strict scrutiny under the First Amendment, and did not find TikTok’s arguments that it violates equal protections under the Fifth Amendment compelling. “We emphasize from the outset that our conclusion here is fact-bound,” Judge Douglas Ginsburg writes in <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cadc.40861/gov.uscourts.cadc.40861.1208687460.0_3.pdf\">the opinion for the court</a>. “The multi-year efforts of both political branches to investigate the national security risks posed by the TikTok platform, and to consider potential remedies proposed by TikTok, weigh heavily in favor of the Act. The Government has offered persuasive evidence demonstrating that the Act is narrowly tailored to protect national security.” These risks included both fears that China could use TikTok for data collection and that it could covertly manipulate the recommendation algorithms.</p>\n<p id=\"HX6zV7\">Despite Trump’s opposition, many Republicans in Congress voted to pass the bill earlier this year. It received overwhelming bipartisan support in <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/20/24135163/tiktok-ban-divest-bytedance-house-foreign-aid-package\">both</a> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/23/24137638/senate-passes-tiktok-ban-bill-divest-bytedance-foreign-aid\">chambers</a>, before <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/24/24139036/biden-signs-tiktok-ban-bill-divest-foreign-aid-package\">President Joe Biden signed it into law</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/15/24102472/house-tiktok-ban-bill-staffers-calls-congress\">Proponents of the law</a> say that it’s necessary protect the privacy of Americans and protect them from foreign influence campaigns.

    "summary": "Cath Virginia / The Verge | Photos from Getty Images\n    \n\n  \nA bill that could ban TikTok from the US unless its Chinese parent company divests it is constitutional, a panel of judges for the DC Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously ruled. \nThe decision comes soon before ByteDance’s January 19th deadline to sell the popular video app, or face its expulsion from the US. That deadline now falls one day before President-elect Donald Trump will be inaugurated for the second time — thanks in part to donations from ByteDance investor Jeff Yass. Though Trump sought to ban TikTok during his first term, he changed his tune on the campaign trail this year, saying a ban would just help a different target of his ire: Meta.\nWhile Trump allies reportedly expected him to try to halt the ban, the options for recourse are somewhat limited. The law allows for a 90 day extension at the president’s discretion, but only if progress is being made toward a spin-out. Trump could direct the Department of Justice not to enforce the bill, but that still leaves app store companies like Google and Apple — tasked with being the gatekeepers to the app — in a precarious spot, should Trump change his mind or a future administration decide to enforce the law.\nThe court decided that the law could survive even strict scrutiny under the First Amendment, and did not find TikTok’s arguments that it violates equal protections under the Fifth Amendment compelling. “We emphasize from the outset that our conclusion here is fact-bound,” Judge Douglas Ginsburg writes in the opinion for the court. “The multi-year efforts of both political branches to investigate the national security risks posed by the TikTok platform, and to consider potential remedies proposed by TikTok, weigh heavily in favor of the Act. The Government has offered persuasive evidence demonstrating that the Act is narrowly tailored to protect national security.” These risks included both fears that China could use TikTok for data collection and that it could covertly manipulate the recommendation algorithms.\nDespite Trump’s opposition, many Republicans in Congress voted to pass the bill earlier this year. It received overwhelming bipartisan support in both chambers, before President Joe Biden signed it into law. Proponents of the law say that it’s necessary protect the privacy of Americans and protect them from foreign influence campaigns.

    "summary": "Photo by Eugene Gologursky/Getty Images for The New York Times\n    \n\n  \nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman has been saying for years — years! — that artificial general intelligence, or AGI, would be something like a singularity. When we achieve AGI, Altman and others have said, it will fundamentally reshape society.\nAt the New York Times DealBook Summit this week in New York City, Altman said never mind. AGI is coming really soon, he said, but it’s not going to be a huge deal. Also this week: OpenAI began its “12 days of shipmas” campaign with a new $200 monthly subscription for its latest model. The stakes are lower, the prices are higher. Strange times in the AI race.\n\nOn this episode of The Vergecast, The Verge’s Kylie Robison joins the show to talk about Altman’s about-face, shipmas, and everything else happening in the AI world this week. Google CEO Sundar Pichai had a spicy take on Gemini, Amazon launched some models of its own, and the models just keep making mistakes.\nBut before we get to AI, Nilay and David spend some time talking about the world of subscriptions. Starting with ours! We launched a subscription for The Verge this week, and we’re grateful to everyone who has signed up to support us and be part of our community. Thanks also to everyone who has offered feedback, found bugs, and asked for ad-free podcasts. We’re still new at this whole subscription thing, but we’re learning fast. (And if you have questions, you have a little more time to get them in for next week’s episode! Email vergecast@theverge.com or call 866-VERGE11 to get them in.)\nThat takes us into a conversation about the ongoing cable-ification of the streaming world, which this week included Disney bundling ESPN into Disney Plus and Max launching always-on channels for HBO content. You know, like cable. \nAfter all that it’s AI time. And finally, in the lightning round, we talk about bitcoin, AI browsers, the fediverse, Intel, Spotify Wrapped, and much more. It may be December, but there’s still an awful lot going on.\n\n\n\nIf you want to know more about everything we discuss in this episode, here are some links to get you started, beginning with streaming and cable:\nESPN is coming to the Disney Plus app starting today\nMax is testing always-on HBO channels\nStreaming is cable now\nWalmart bought Vizio \nAnd in AI news:\nOpenAI’s 12 days of ‘shipmas’ include Sora and new reasoning model\nSam Altman says AGI will “matter much less” than people expect\nChatGPT’s search results for news are ‘unpredictable’ and frequently inaccurate\nStop using generative AI as a search engine\nMisinformation expert admits ChatGPT added fake details to his anti-deepfake court filing\nAmazon announces its own set of Nova AI models\nFrom The New York Times: Sundar Pichai Hits Back at Criticism of Company’s A.I.

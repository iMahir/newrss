That’s not a huge sum for Google, which reportedly made $258 billion in sales in 2021. But it was enough to give the company some clout with other potential military and intelligence customers.   </p>\n<p id=\"1sq27k\">Google didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from <em>The Verge</em>. But in April, it said in an <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/17/24133056/google-protests-project-nimbus-no-tech-for-apartheid\">emailed statement</a> that “the Nimbus contract is for workloads running on our commercial cloud by Israeli government ministries, who agree to comply with our Terms of Service and Acceptable Use Policy.

BSR reportedly recommended “due diligence” on Google’s part to make sure its services weren’t being misused and that Google add its AI principles that prohibit surveillance or weapons to the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"i1NWq0\">Ultimately, the contract reportedly didn’t reflect those recommendations. The contract did, however, include a right to suspend customers for breaching Google’s <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://cloud.google.com/terms\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">terms of service</a> and <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://cloud.google.com/terms/aup?hl=en\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">acceptable use policy</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"9e8Mla\">Before signing the deal, the <em>Times </em>says, Google had additional concerns about the company itself potentially running into legal quandaries because of the contract: </p>\n<blockquote><p id=\"EEp5qd\">The company also worried that it would be forced to accept “onerous” risks, such as the possibility that it could run into conflicts with foreign or international authorities if they sought Israeli data and that it might have to “breach international legal orders” under the deal terms, according to the documents.</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"dOsdGA\">Project Nimbus has become an even bigger flashpoint within the company since the Israel-Hamas war, which has killed more than <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-iran-news-11-20-2024-5da3ce43df8662fe9eeab4ad804bdc0f\">44,000 people in Gaza</a>.

    "summary": "Image: Elen Winata for The Verge\n    \n\n\n  \nIt’s actually Tuesday, but that doesn’t mean all the deals have suddenly vanished. We’re rounding up the best of the rest that you can still shop.\n We hope you had a chance between holiday festivities to get some shopping done, but if not, you may not be out of luck. While some of the best deals have expired, many others from the long Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend are still holding on — and a handful are even cheaper. Today might be your very last chance to snag a great deal, but you’re not in it alone. We’re sorting through them all to make sure you can find a great deal on something and get through checkout before the gates fully close. \n\n\nSince this time last week, we’ve been sifting through what feels like endless discounts on everything under the sun, but especially things that delight techies, tinkerers, gamers, and fidgeters. There are still great Cyber Monday deals on TVs, earbuds, laptops, Apple devices, smart home gadgets, and far too many more tech things to name here. And everything we highlight has been tried, tested, or vouched for in some way by Verge staffers, so you don’t have to guess whether any of the deals are too good to be true.\nBelow, we’ve included navigation links that you can use to jump between categories that interest you most, or just scroll at your leisure until you see something you like. Don’t worry if you missed out on something specific you’ve had your eye on — many products typically go on sale at least once more throughout the holiday season, although there’s no guarantee they’ll be as cheap.\n\n\n\n\n//this line summons a table of contents. use as follows!\n\n//initiateTOC takes the arguments \"header\", \"subheader\", \"collapsible\"\n\n//for whatever header type (\"h2\", \"h3\" etc) you want to be the main header, type it in quotes in the function call. \n\n//if you don't want subheads, set to false in the function call (no quotes)\n\n//collapsible is a true/false toggle\n\n//if you want a specific, unlinked title just add a string at the end in double quotes, e.g. false, \"h3\", false, \"This is the title\"\n\n//see graham if you have any questions/issues\n\n// note that all the header types are off by one: an h1 in the CMS is an h2 in the actual code. If you just want h2 and h3 to show up in the TOC you need to call them h3 and h4. \n\n\nwindow.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', (event) => {\n\tinitiateTOC(\"h2\", \"h3\", false, \"The best Cyber Monday deals\")\n});\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured deals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best Apple deals\n\n\n\nYou can buy the last-gen iPad with Wi-Fi and 64GB of storage for its all-time low of $199.99 ($129 off) at Best Buy. The 2021 tablet features a smaller 10.2-inch screen than the newer model, a slower A13 Bionic chip, and a Lightning charging port. However, it’s still snappy enough for streaming, browsing the web, sending emails, and performing other typical tablet tasks, making it great for kids or anybody looking for an affordable tablet. It even features a 3.5mm headphone jack — a welcome rarity.\nIf you want the latest and greatest, the new iPad Mini is available at Amazon or Best Buy for $469 ($30 off). Apple’s 8.3-inch tablet is pretty similar to the outgoing model from 2021, only it features faster Wi-Fi speeds and support for the newer Apple Pencil Pro. It also leverages the new Apple A17 Pro chip, which allows for various AI-based Apple Intelligence features. Read our review.\n\n\n\nVerizon is offering up to $1,000 off an iPhone 16 Pro or iPhone 16 Pro Max and up to $830 off an iPhone 16 when you trade in any phone in any condition, provided you’re signed on to a “select Unlimited plan.” AT&T is also offering $1,000 off the iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max or $830 off an iPhone 16 with trade-in. You can get the same Verizon and AT&T deals through Best Buy, in which case you’ll get a $100 Best Buy gift card with your purchase.\nYou can buy Apple’s official iPhone 16 Clear Case with MagSafe from Amazon starting at $37 ($12 off), which is its best price yet. Apple designed the polycarbonate case so that it works well with the iPhone 16’s new Camera Control button. The company also added a “glossy scratch-resistant coating,” likely after many complained about how last year’s FineWoven cases scratched easily.\nIf you prefer to buy first-party, through December 2nd, Apple is hosting its own rare sales event. You can get up to $200 on select MacBook Airs, while certain iPads will net you $100 in credit. Apple will also give you anywhere between $25–$75 in credit when you purchase select iPhones, AirPods, styluses, streaming devices, and more.\nThe best wireless earbuds and headphone deals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJabra may have stopped selling consumer earbuds, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t discounts available on the existing models. Right now, for instance, you can purchase the Jabra Elite 10 Gen 2 for an all-time low of $199.99 ($80 off) at Amazon and Best Buy. In addition to noise cancellation, the semi-open Elite 10 come with an LE Audio charging case, which lets you wirelessly transmit audio from an external device. They also feature physical buttons and support other essentials, including multipoint Bluetooth connectivity.\nYou can also pick up Jabra’s Elite 8 Active Gen 2 for $169.99 ($60 off) at Amazon and Best Buy, which is one of the better prices we’ve seen. The fitness-focused earbuds offer a robust IP68 water resistance rating that can withstand sweaty workouts, along with a secure fit and adaptive ANC. They also support multipoint pairing and wireless charging, and like the Elite 10, come with an LE Audio charging case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe WH-1000XM4, Sony’s last-gen flagship headphones, are on sale for $198 ($152 off) at Amazon. That’s not the shockingly low $130 they dropped to earlier this year, but it’s still a great price for a pair of cans that offer some of the best sound quality and noise cancellation performance around. They offer 30 hours of battery life, a foldable design, and flexible ambient audio modes, including a speak-to-chat feature that reduces volume while you’re talking. Read our review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also buy Amazon’s newer Echo Buds for just $24.99 ($25 off) at Amazon. The wireless earbuds lack noise cancellation, but they support multipoint pairing and integrate well with Amazon Alexa for hands-free control. They also feature a semi-open design that makes it easier to hear your surroundings. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best speaker and smart display deals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want a smart alarm clock with a great display and zero mics / cameras, the latest Echo Spot is on sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target for $44.99 ($60 off), matching its lowest price to date. The 2.83-inch touchscreen can’t display videos or double as a digital photo frame, but it can tell you the weather when you wake up and allows you to control various smart home devices via Alexa. Read our review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Echo Show 8 (third-gen), the latest version of Amazon’s midsize smart display, is down to $84.99 ($65 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target. You can also buy it with an Amazon Basics Smart Color Bulb for $97.98 ($65 off) at Amazon in black. The eight-inch device looks a lot like previous models, but it’s got widget support for added versatility, a more responsive touchscreen, and nice-sounding speakers. Just don’t expect to take any Zoom meetings on it, as only Alexa video calls are currently supported. Read our review.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best e-reader deals\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best laptop and desktop deals\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft’s base version of its 13.8-inch Surface Laptop 7 is on sale for $899.99 ($300 off) at Best Buy with a Snapdragon X Plus processor, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. The Arm-based laptop offers excellent MacBook Air-like battery life that easily lasts through a day of work. It performs well, though Windows on Arm does have some compatibility issues with some games and software — so be sure what you need to work is supported.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe MSI Stealth A16 AI Plus is on sale at Best Buy with a new Ryzen AI 9 chip, an RTX 4070 GPU, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD for $1,699.99 ($300 off), matching its best price to date. The mid-tier Stealth is one of MSI’s best-selling gaming laptops, as it balances a whole lot of gaming performance without the eye-watering prices of higher-end models. The 16-inch laptop isn’t exactly small, but it’s thin enough to take places, and its QHD panel supports up to a speedy 240Hz refresh rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best robot vacuum / mop deals\n\n\n\n\nThe Roomba Combo 10 Max is down to a new all-time low of $979 ($420 off) at Amazon, or matching its all-time low of $999 ($400 off) at Best Buy and iRobot’s store. The new flagship model from iRobot has all the same features as the j9 Combo, plus a new dock that can clean and dry the robot’s mop, refill its water tank, and empty its bin.   \nThe iRobot Roomba Combo j7 Plus is on sale starting around $679 ($320 off) at Amazon and $699 ($300 off) at Best Buy, which is one of its better prices to date. The j7 Plus is similar to the Roomba Combo j9 Plus, as it offers AI obstacle avoidance and a mop that automatically lifts to keep your carpets dry. The main difference is that the Combo j9 Plus offers longer batter life and can refill its own mop tank; it also features a new dirt detection feature. Read our review.\n\n\n\nThe Roborock Q8 Max is on sale for $259.99 ($340 off) at Amazon for Prime members, Walmart, and Roborock’s store, which is a record low price. It offers better object avoidance and mopping than the Q5 Pro for its additional cost. The trade-off is a smaller dustbin that makes room for a bigger water tank for mopping. If you’re cleaning spills more frequently than your carpets need vacuuming, it may be worth the jump. You can also get the Q8 Max Plus on sale for an all-time low $419.99 ($400 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target, which adds a self-emptying base to help save time between cleanings.\nThe Roborock Q Revo is down to a new all-time low $539.99 ($360 off) at Amazon for Prime members. It’s not our favorite mid-range robot vacuum that doubles as a mopper as it lacks AI for obstacle avoidance, and there’s no heat-assisted drying. That said, it’s a solid alternative to the Eufy X10 Pro Omni mentioned above in case that deal goes away.\nOur pick for the best budget robot vacuum and mop, the Dreame D10 Plus, is on sale at Dreame’s online storefront for $279.99 ($120 off), which is $20 more than the all-time low. It’s a solid vacuum that can also mop and self-empty. The lidar-equipped bot can also map your home and lets you add keep-out zones, which is a rare feature at this price point.\nIf you really want to save money, the budget-friendly Roomba Combo Essential vacuum and mop is on sale for $157 ($117 off) at Amazon and for $3 more directly from iRobot. The robovac / mop hybrid is the successor to the Roomba 694, with iRobot claiming it offers 20 times more suction power and longer battery life. Unlike pricier robovac / mop hybrids, however, there’s no option for an auto-empty dock.\nThe Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1, a previous pick for best midrange auto-empty vacuum and mop, is selling for $350 off at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target — down to $349.99. The Matrix mops very well, doing a swingy, scrubbing movement with its rear end, and it can auto empty, but it only self-empties in vacuum mode — you have to manually fill and attach the mop reservoir and empty the bin when it mops.\n\n\nThe best smart home deals\n\n\n\n\n\nGovee’s Permanent Outdoor Lights 2 with 72 smart LEDs across 100 feet of wire is $199.99 ($100 off) direct from Govee. The bright LEDs are meant to be permanently adhered and screwed into the eaves of your roof, creating a down-lighting effect that’s bright and colorful on the front of your home. You can use Govee’s app to customize the colors and light effects, easily changing up your home’s look for any holiday without trudging out into the cold every season to put up holiday string lights.\n\n\n\nThe lovely Aqara Ceiling Light T1M light fixture is $40 off at Amazon, down to $109.99 from $149.99 when you apply the onpage coupon. You can add ambiance and function to a room with this dual addressable LED ceiling light. For easier control, pick up this Aqara smart switch for $28.79 ($7 off) at Amazon. An Aqara Zigbee hub is also required. Read our review.\nGovee’s Christmas String Lights 2 are on sale in a 66-foot configuration for $63.99 ($36 off) at Amazon when clicking the onpage coupon, which is their best price yet. The smart string lights offer more than 130 preset lighting effects, though you can also create your own custom displays. The IP65-rated lights also work with Matter, so you can connect them to any major smart home platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best smart security deals\n\nArlo’s new Wired Floodlight Camera is seeing its first sale at $99.99 ($50 off) at The Home Depot. Arlo’s battery-powered Arlo Pro 3 Floodlight Cam is one of our top picks for a floodlight camera, and the wired version means no more worrying about recharging it. However, Arlo’s monthly subscription plan for recorded video is expensive, starting at $8 a month. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur favorite video doorbell, the wired Nest Doorbell, is around $98 ($81 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and the Google Store, which is by far the lowest price we’ve seen. It may not offer 1080p resolution like other video doorbells in its range (it’s limited to 960 x 1280), but it still produces a clear picture and is one of the few options that can manage 24/7 recording. It also supports facial recognition with smart alerts. Read our review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best fitness tracker and smartwatch deals\n\n\n\nThe Fitbit Inspire 3 is available from Amazon, Best Buy, and the Google Store for $69.95 ($30 off), matching its all-time low. The minimalist band lacks built-in GPS and doesn’t offer as many health and fitness features as the Charge 6, but it packs a bright OLED display and does a good job with the basics. It supports both irregular heart rate notifications and advanced sleep tracking, along with several stress management features. Read our hands-on impressions.\nThe Fitbit Ace LTE is down to $179.95 ($50 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Google’s online storefront. Designed for kids, its bubbly design is a bit more playful than most Fitbits. You can play games on it and even take care of a Tamagotchi-like pet, and the tracker periodically pauses the fun until your child has gotten more steps in. Parents can also use it to exchange messages with their children and monitor their real-time location, assuming they opt for the $9.99-a-month Ace Pass data plan.\n\n\n\nIf you’re looking for a terrific Fitbit alternative, the Garmin Venu Sq 2 is a great pick that’s $149.99 ($100 off) at Amazon, Walmart, and Garmin’s online storefront. It’s a shame it lacks built-in GPS, but it does offer a lot of health features not found on rivals like the Fitbit Sense 2 and Versa 4, including hydration tracking and access to Garmin Coach, which provides marathon training plans. These features aren’t locked behind a paywall, either, making the wearable an even better deal. Read our review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best TV, streaming device, and soundbar deals\n\n\n\nThe LG B4 OLED is another solid gaming TV, and you can get a 48-inch model for $699.99 ($100 off) at Best Buy or a 55-inch model for $999.99 ($300 off). It has an older processor and a dimmer screen than the costlier “Evo” models, but it’s a fine option if you’re looking for a relatively affordable way to experience 4K 120Hz gaming on an OLED panel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether you’re outfitting a bathroom or need some sensory stimulation for a newborn’s nursery, there’s still a bit of room in the world for 32-inch, 720p TVs like the Insignia F20 —which is on sale for only $79.99 ($50 off) at Best Buy. You won’t get many tricks, but it has HDMI Arc and it’s a Fire TV, meaning you have the convenience of voice-activated content discovery across hundreds of apps via the included Alexa Voice Remote.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best streaming deals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best smartphone and mobile accessory deals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy A35 5G is matching its all-time low of $299.99 ($100 off) at Samsung’s online storefront. It comes with a robust IP67 rating for dust and water resistance, meaning it should survive a brief swim in a puddle or... you know. Coupled with a strong software support policy with five years of promised security updates, it’s a great deal in the under-$500 class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best charger deals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re not ready to pony up for a Qi2 charger, Ugreen’s Magnetic Wireless Charging Station is just $3 more than the all-time low, now down to $26.99 ($13 off) at Amazon for Prime members. Unlike the newer Qi2 offerings that provide 15W charging speeds, Ugreen’s charger can only supply 7.5W of power to MagSafe-compatible devices, or 5W to a pair of wireless earbuds or any Qi-ready device if you’re using the integrated charging stand located on the bottom.\nIf transparent electronics are your thing, you can pick up the Shargeek 170 Power Bank at Amazon and directly from Sharge for $159 ($20 off). The handsome prism-shaped charger features a 24,000mAh capacity and a maximum output of 170 watts, allowing you to fast-charge most everything you own. It even offers a color display so you can see the remaining battery life, output, and other helpful info at a glance.\n\n\n\n\nThe best gaming deals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Hori Split Pad Pro, our favorite Nintendo Switch controller for handheld mode, is on sale for $38.99 ($11 off) at Walmart and Target. The comfortable Joy-Con alternative is outfitted with large triggers, analog sticks, and a set of easy-to-reach buttons, along with more than enough grip that it shouldn’t pose any problems over long gaming sessions.\nIf you have a wireless mouse that supports it, Logitech’s G PowerPlay Wireless Charging System is on sale at Amazon for an all-time low of $86.62, down from $119.99. Mice like the G502 X Lightspeed support the wireless charging pad, as does the Logitech G Pro X Superlight 2, both of which will grant you infinite playtime without a single second of tethering.\nThe Logitech G203 Lightsync is on sale at Amazon for an all-time low of $18.99 ($21 off) or at Best Buy and Newegg for $19.99. The no-frills gaming mouse offers two side-mounted thumb buttons, an accurate sensor, and a scroll wheel for less than $20, along with some tasteful LEDs around the palm that don’t scream “gamer” the way most RGB accessories do.\nMicrosoft’s official Xbox Wireless Controller is on sale at Target in a variety of colors starting at $39.99 ($20 off). You can save on the special edition models, including the translucent ghost cipher and blue cipher models, which start at $45 (about $25 off) at Target. They’re compatible with the Xbox One and Series X / S, too, or with Windows PCs and mobile devices using Bluetooth or USB-C.\n\n\n\nIf you enjoyed HBO’s fantastic adaptation of The Last of Us, The Last of Us Part I is on sale for the PlayStation 5 at Best Buy, Target, and GameStop starting at $29.99 ($40 off), an all-time low. It’s a remarkable remake of the classic title from 2013, with faster load times, better visuals, and other welcome tweaks. Read our review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsomniac’s Wolverine could be years away; however, if you have yet to play the studio’s other superhero title, Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 has fallen to a new low of $39.99 ($30 off) at GameStop. It’s a terrific sequel to the 2018 open-world title, with new mechanics, more baddies, and the ability to play as two — count ‘em, two — spider-men. Read our review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe PS5 version of Gran Turismo 7 has dropped to $29.99 ($40 off) at Best Buy, nearly matching its best price to date. The sim racer has elegance and reverential regard for racing culture. It features hundreds of cars that you can deeply customize with fully tunable vehicles and unique liveries. You can also race in virtual reality with a PlayStation VR2 headset. Read our review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best location tracker deals\n\n\n\nThe 2024 Tile Mate is available for an all-time low from Amazon and Tile, where you can grab it starting at $19.98 ($5 off). The platform-agnostic Bluetooth tracker helps you keep track of your personal belongings from up to 350 feet away, which is 100 feet wider than its predecessor’s range. It also now can send SOS alerts to your loved ones and even emergency services if you pay for the $14.99-a-month Life360 Gold subscription. \nEufy’s new SmartTrack Card E30 is on sale for $23.99 ($11 off) at Amazon for Prime members only, and directly from Eufy (with promo code WS24T87B1). Unlike its predecessor, the Eufy Security SmartTrack Card, Eufy’s latest tracker is rechargeable and should last you up to a year before you need to charge it again. It also sports a slim design — which makes it ideal for a wallet — and compatibility with Apple’s vast Find My network. \n\n\nThe best Cyber Monday deals on Verge favorites\n\n\n\nIf you’re the crafty type, you can get the Cricut Explore 3 for $199 ($100 off) at Target and direct from Cricut. The printer-like automated cutting machine can create stickers and decals, make precision cuts on various materials, and even print out digitally-created artwork by drawing it out for you with an actual pen or marker.\nThe Fnirsi USB Fast Charge Tester is on sale for $38.99 ($50 off) directly from Fnirsi. The small device is an easy and effective way to test the charging rates of your various USB cables and power adapters. It’s especially handy when you want to ensure a gadget is getting the adequate power it needs.\n\n\n\nA number of other Ember smart mugs are also on sale right now — including the 12-ounce Travel Mug 2 Plus, which you can buy from Ember for $139.96 ($60 off) when you apply promo code BLACKFRIDAY24. Unlike the Mug 2, the Travel Mug 2 Plus supports Apple’s Find My network, so you can keep tabs on it using an iPhone or Mac. It also comes with onboard controls and LED status lights.\nLogitech’s Litra Glow is currently on sale at Amazon for $49.99 ($10 off). The compact LED light has controllable brightness and a simple foot for mounting atop a laptop or monitor, making it a solid option for Twitch streamers, YouTubers, and other content creators.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The EcoFlow Wave 2 is a heat pump that is uniquely powered by both a battery and solar power, one that’s available for $749 ($250 off) at Wellbots or for $799 ($200 off) at Ecoflow’s website and Amazon (with a coupon). The highly portable device combines an air conditioner and heater, and while it struggles with more extreme climates, it does a particularly good job of cooling and heating small spaces in temperate ones. Read our review.\n\n\n\nIf you’re looking for a more nefarious Lego set, the 834-piece replica of Darth Vader’s helmet is on sale at Walmart for $48.98 (about $31 off). That’s the lowest price we’ve seen on the collectible bust, which features a brick-ified life-support system on the inside and a display stand for showcasing the iconic helmet in all its sith-y glory.\nGrovemade makes some truly excellent desk accessories, many of which use metal, wood, and felt for a more premium touch. They’re definitely pricey, but thankfully, Grovemade is running a holiday sale until December 4th, allowing you to save on shelving, succulent planters, and other gear. Some of us at The Verge personally use the Wood Laptop Stand (now $160), which can elevate the look of any workstation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAzul, a four-player puzzle game that challenges you to tile mosaics in a palace, is down to $19.99 (50 percent off) at Amazon, which isn’t far from the all-time low. It’s easy to learn and suitable for ages eight and older, but it has just the right amount of depth and competitiveness to keep family and friends coming back for more.\nTicket to Ride is another classic board game that’s on sale for $25 ($19 off) at Target. That’s one of the better prices lately on a cutthroat card game, which challenges you to build the longest locomotive route across classic America before your other tycoon opponents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHappy Salmon is on sale for just $6.49 (about $6 off) at Target. It’s one of the best icebreakers at social gatherings, for both adults and parents alike, and it takes just minutes to learn and play this card game. Up to eight players can get in on the action, which gets you out of your seats and has you doing fun stuff like giving each other high-fives and “fish bumps.”\nWildfire season might be behind us (for now), but you can still pick up the Coway Airmega AP-1512HH Mighty from Amazon and Coway for around $141 ($99 off), which matches its second-best price to date. The compact HEPA air purifier features a four-stage filtration system, and though we don’t do a ton of dedicated air purifier testing here at The Verge, we can personally attest to the effectiveness of this midrange model for smaller rooms.\nYou can currently grab a gorgeous illustrated edition of The Hobbit for $28.85 (about $49 off) at Amazon. That’s the lowest price we’ve seen on the 432-page hardcover edition of J.R.R. Tolkien’s 1937 classic, which brings together more than 50 of the author’s original sketches, drawings, paintings, and maps.",

Apple has recently shaken up the starting RAM for several models, creating more options than ever before and resulting in steeper discounts on older models.</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><div id=\"bQleYo\"><div data-anthem-component=\"aside:11906226\"></div></div></div>\n<p id=\"7QDx7u\">Although Macs may not experience perpetual discounts, it’s not uncommon to see various models discounted by as much as $400. Alternatively, purchasing refurbished options directly from Apple is another way to save money without waiting for the changing deal winds to blow your way. It’s also the only option to find certain SKUs of older models as Apple continues to move forward on newer releases. <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fmac&amp;subid1=vergedeals030724\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Apple’s refurbished store</a> provides a one-year warranty on all products and generally offers discounts of up to 15 to 20 percent off the price of a new unit.</p>\n<p id=\"W2m23B\">But if you want to buy new and you’re looking to save whatever you can, here are the best MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini deals available.</p>\n<div><aside id=\"bbKdr5\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Here are the best iPad deals right now\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple\"},{\"title\":\"How does the Microsoft Surface Laptop stack up to the MacBook Air?\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/24161123/microsoft-surface-vs-macbook-air-comparison\"},{\"title\":\"All of Apple’s Macs now start with 16GB of RAM \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24270669/apple-macbook-pro-mac-mini-imac-16gb-ram-doubled-apple-intelligence-ai\"}]}'></div></aside></div>\n<h2 id=\"EVXzol\">The best MacBook Air deals</h2>\n<h3 id=\"pEzsTQ\">M1 MacBook Air</h3>\n<p id=\"FJU3RG\">The<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon\"><strong>M1 MacBook Air</strong></a> was considered Apple’s entry-level laptop before the M3 model’s arrival prompted Apple to stop selling it directly in its online and brick-and-mortar stores. But while the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/laptop-review/23207440/apple-macbook-air-m2-2022-review\">redesigned M2 version of the MacBook Air</a> (which has been with us for a while as well) seems poised to take over as the top value choice, the 2020 version with an M1 processor and fanless design remains available at some retailers as a solid budget option. It’s best suited for typical productivity work, with a comfortable keyboard, an excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. For many people, the M1 Air still ticks the right boxes when it comes to performance and price, even if it’s long enough in the tooth to have been fully dethroned in our <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops\">guide to the best laptops</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"yzeZSS\">The base MacBook Air with the M1 chip comes with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. It’s becoming harder to find in new condition, but Walmart has <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/15/24101727/apple-m1-macbook-air-laptop-walmart\">committed to keeping it around</a> for the foreseeable future and is currently <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-MacBook-Air-13-3-inch-Laptop-Silver-M1-Chip-8GB-RAM-256GB-storage%2F609040889&amp;subid1=vergedeals040224\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">discounting it to $649</a> ($350 off) — a special sale price that’s hung around since the retailer ran its counter-Prime Day promotions in July. The M1 Air may be a few years old now, but it’s still hard to beat in terms of value, especially when it comes to everyday performance and battery life. </p>\n<div id=\"iF2kto\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:9737407\"></div></div>\n<h3 id=\"3VqFgR\">M2 MacBook Air</h3>\n<p id=\"OFnopX\">The M2 MacBook Air is a super slim, lightweight laptop with a 1080p webcam and a handy magnetic charger that frees up one of its two USB-C ports. Although its M2 processor didn’t kick-start a revolution like the M1 generation, it’s a great performer for any user, including more demanding creatives.</p>\n<p id=\"8wY2P7\">It does have some slight downsides, though, including <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/1/23191141/apple-macbook-pro-13-m2-base-model-slow-device\">slower storage in the base 256GB configuration</a> and a notch cutout in its otherwise excellent screen. But even so, Apple hasn’t offered a more travel-friendly laptop since the days of the polarizing 12-inch MacBook, and this prior-gen model was once good enough to top our list of the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops\">best laptops</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"Tzj5E0\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"The MacBook Air gets a surprise upgrade to 16GB of RAM \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24282981/apple-macbook-air-m2-m3-16gb-ram-minimum-price-unchanged\"},{\"title\":\"The Mac turns 40 —&amp;nbsp;and keeps on moving\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/24048479/apple-mac-40-anniversary\"},{\"title\":\"How to configure and use hot corners on macOS\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/24025728/hot-corners-macos-how-to\"}]}'></div></aside></div>\n<p id=\"sfB6ZF\">The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/laptop-review/23207440/apple-macbook-air-m2-2022-review\"><strong>M2-powered MacBook Air 13</strong></a> from 2022 seems to be on its way out, with availability for the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23757441/apple-macbook-air-15-inch-2023-review\">15-inch version</a> waning. But, outside of opting for the newer M3 models (see further below), you can at least get the 13-inch M2 model with 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and an eight-core GPU at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/2022-Apple-MacBook-Laptop-chip/dp/B0DLHT9VXW?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://howl.link/wu6vd863qyqe0\">Best Buy</a> for $799 ($200 off).

Apple’s updated entry-level laptops arrived in both 13- and 15-inch variants simultaneously this time, bringing with them slightly faster performance and a slate of minor upgrades. Apple added Wi-Fi 6E, for one, along with an additional Thunderbolt port that allows you to use two external displays when the lid is closed. They also continue to offer 18 hours of battery life and a MagSafe charging port, though the M3 Air starts at a slightly higher price than its predecessor at $1,099. That said, Apple recently discontinued the M3 MacBook Air with 8GB of RAM and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24282981/apple-macbook-air-m2-m3-16gb-ram-minimum-price-unchanged\">now considers the 16GB / 256GB model as the starting configuration</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"NNsbFs\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Apple MacBook Air M3 review: small upgrades\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/24114684/apple-macbook-air-m3-13-15-inch-2024-review\"},{\"title\":\"Apple is preparing an M4 MacBook Air update for early next year \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/23/24277876/apple-m4-macbook-air-update\"},{\"title\":\"How to set the default apps in macOS\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/24153045/macos-default-apps-email-browser-how-to\"}]}'></div></aside></div>\n<p id=\"u6YpSQ\">Right now, the entry-level model with 16GB RAM and 256GB of storage is on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLHY19N3?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://howl.link/fkbhg5fixyrqc\">Best Buy</a> for $899 ($200 off).

Apple followed the M3 models up with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24270706/apple-macbook-pro-m4-pro-max-14-16-announcement-specs\">M4-based machines in October</a>, and we’re already starting to see the discounts on them.

However, it starts with just 8GB of RAM and lacks the third USB-C / Thunderbolt port found on the M3 Pro and M3 Max models (as well as Thunderbolt 4 speeds).</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"3gSH4q\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Apple MacBook Pro 14 (2023) review: entry-level enigma\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/23944344/apple-macbook-pro-14-2023-review-m3-specs-battery-ports\"},{\"title\":\"A bigger iMac is apparently still a possibility\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/11/24217908/a-bigger-imac-is-apparently-still-a-possibility\"},{\"title\":\"The Flexbar resurrects the MacBook Pro’s Touch Bar as a standalone device \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24311935/flexbar-touchscreen-apple-macbook-pro-touch-bar-kickstarter\"}]}'></div></aside></div>\n<p id=\"0Pe67E\">The M3 MacBook Pro may be a bit of an odd middle child in some ways, but it’s still a very good laptop — especially if you can find a deal that puts more price distance between the M3 model and the M3 Pro version. Availability for the base model with 8GB and 512GB of storage seems to be waning as Apple standardizes 16GB of RAM across its lineup, though, thankfully, <a href=\"https://howl.link/8o3j4fcipypuc\">Best Buy</a> is now selling the step-up configuration with 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage for $1,399.99 ($300 off).

Now starting with the M3 Pro chip (or the speedier M3 Max) and 18GB of base RAM instead of 16GB, the new models remain targeted at creatives doing content work like video editing, photo processing, and other graphical work. Like their predecessors and the M1 Pro generation before that, they offer MagSafe charging, three USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 ports, HDMI-out, and a full-size SD card slot, with prices starting at $1,999 for the 14-inch and $2,499 for the 16-inch. You can, of course, spec them up the wazoo if you’re willing to pay more, as exhibited by <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23949207/apple-macbook-pro-16-m3-max-review-price-specs\">the review unit Apple sent us of the 16-inch model</a>, which cost an eye-watering $7,199.</p>\n<p id=\"np8SQE\">But rest assured, versions that actual humans buy now receive regular discounts. For instance, the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 Pro (11-core CPU / 14-core GPU), 18GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD is going for $1,699 ($200 off) at <a href=\"https://howl.me/cmASCPqqqqX\">Best Buy</a> and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1793624-REG%2Fapple_mrx33ll_a_14_macbook_pro_with.html&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22399419%2Fapple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">B&amp;H Photo</a>.

It also picks up a third Thunderbolt 4 port, which is positioned on the right side and supports dual external monitors while the lid is opened. Also new this year is an upgraded 12-megapixel webcam that supports Center Stage and a new Desk View feature, plus the option to add a nano-texture display for an extra $150.

While the total port selection hasn’t changed compared to their respective M3 Pro and M3 Max counterparts, you’ll get faster Thunderbolt 5 ports on these more substantial models.

    "summary": "Apple’s last-gen Macs are still a great deal, particularly when you can find them at a steep discount. | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge\n    \n\n  \nApple currently sells MacBooks equipped with its own M-series chips in a wide range of sizes and price points. It discontinued the M1 MacBook Air to make room for the latest models, but some retailers are still selling the last-gen laptop starting at $649 — a far cry from the $2,499 starting price of the latest 16-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro. Purchasing a new MacBook can certainly be a pricey endeavor, but thankfully, finding a deal on more recent models is actually not that difficult. Apple has recently shaken up the starting RAM for several models, creating more options than ever before and resulting in steeper discounts on older models.\n\n\n\nAlthough Macs may not experience perpetual discounts, it’s not uncommon to see various models discounted by as much as $400. Alternatively, purchasing refurbished options directly from Apple is another way to save money without waiting for the changing deal winds to blow your way. It’s also the only option to find certain SKUs of older models as Apple continues to move forward on newer releases. Apple’s refurbished store provides a one-year warranty on all products and generally offers discounts of up to 15 to 20 percent off the price of a new unit.\nBut if you want to buy new and you’re looking to save whatever you can, here are the best MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini deals available.\n\n\nThe best MacBook Air deals\nM1 MacBook Air\nThe M1 MacBook Air was considered Apple’s entry-level laptop before the M3 model’s arrival prompted Apple to stop selling it directly in its online and brick-and-mortar stores. But while the redesigned M2 version of the MacBook Air (which has been with us for a while as well) seems poised to take over as the top value choice, the 2020 version with an M1 processor and fanless design remains available at some retailers as a solid budget option. It’s best suited for typical productivity work, with a comfortable keyboard, an excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. For many people, the M1 Air still ticks the right boxes when it comes to performance and price, even if it’s long enough in the tooth to have been fully dethroned in our guide to the best laptops.\nThe base MacBook Air with the M1 chip comes with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. It’s becoming harder to find in new condition, but Walmart has committed to keeping it around for the foreseeable future and is currently discounting it to $649 ($350 off) — a special sale price that’s hung around since the retailer ran its counter-Prime Day promotions in July. The M1 Air may be a few years old now, but it’s still hard to beat in terms of value, especially when it comes to everyday performance and battery life. \n\n\nM2 MacBook Air\nThe M2 MacBook Air is a super slim, lightweight laptop with a 1080p webcam and a handy magnetic charger that frees up one of its two USB-C ports. Although its M2 processor didn’t kick-start a revolution like the M1 generation, it’s a great performer for any user, including more demanding creatives.\nIt does have some slight downsides, though, including slower storage in the base 256GB configuration and a notch cutout in its otherwise excellent screen. But even so, Apple hasn’t offered a more travel-friendly laptop since the days of the polarizing 12-inch MacBook, and this prior-gen model was once good enough to top our list of the best laptops.\n\n\nThe M2-powered MacBook Air 13 from 2022 seems to be on its way out, with availability for the 15-inch version waning. But, outside of opting for the newer M3 models (see further below), you can at least get the 13-inch M2 model with 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and an eight-core GPU at Amazon and Best Buy for $799 ($200 off). You can also get the same model with 8GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for as low as $899 ($300 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo; however, that’s a significant premium for a configuration that offers less RAM than the base model. \nIf you’re looking for a bigger display, Best Buy is still selling the 15-inch MacBook Air M2 in its base 8GB / 256GB configuration for $999 ($300 off). Again, keep in mind that Apple now sells the 15-inch Air with an upgraded 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage for $1,299.\n\n\nM3 MacBook Air\nThe M1 Air and its wedge had to perish for the M3 MacBook Air to exist. Apple’s updated entry-level laptops arrived in both 13- and 15-inch variants simultaneously this time, bringing with them slightly faster performance and a slate of minor upgrades. Apple added Wi-Fi 6E, for one, along with an additional Thunderbolt port that allows you to use two external displays when the lid is closed. They also continue to offer 18 hours of battery life and a MagSafe charging port, though the M3 Air starts at a slightly higher price than its predecessor at $1,099. That said, Apple recently discontinued the M3 MacBook Air with 8GB of RAM and now considers the 16GB / 256GB model as the starting configuration.\n\n\nRight now, the entry-level model with 16GB RAM and 256GB of storage is on sale at Amazon and Best Buy for $899 ($200 off). You can also find a $200 discount on the 16GB RAM / 512GB model, which drops it to $1,099 in select colors at Amazon and Best Buy.\nAs for the 15-inch MacBook Air M3, you can currently grab it with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage for $1,099 ($200 off) at Amazon and Best Buy. You can also get it in the 16GB / 512GB configuration at Amazon and Best Buy starting at $1,299 ($200 off).\n\n\n\n\nThe best MacBook Pro deals\nDuring its “Scary Fast” event last year, Apple announced new MacBook Pros that use M3 processors — including a new 14-inch model that replaced the 13-inch M2 model. Apple followed the M3 models up with M4-based machines in October, and we’re already starting to see the discounts on them. That being said, the last-gen M3 models are often the better bargain, as they’re still relatively easy to find and receive steeper discounts.\nM3 and M3 Pro MacBook Pro\nThe entry point into the MacBook Pro world is a MagSafe-equipped MacBook Pro that uses the existing 14-inch design and slightly pares it down. The 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro has the same 3024 x 1964 resolution display and 120Hz refresh rate as its pricier siblings, and in addition to a MagSafe charging port, it has an SD card slot and HDMI port. However, it starts with just 8GB of RAM and lacks the third USB-C / Thunderbolt port found on the M3 Pro and M3 Max models (as well as Thunderbolt 4 speeds).\n\n\nThe M3 MacBook Pro may be a bit of an odd middle child in some ways, but it’s still a very good laptop — especially if you can find a deal that puts more price distance between the M3 model and the M3 Pro version. Availability for the base model with 8GB and 512GB of storage seems to be waning as Apple standardizes 16GB of RAM across its lineup, though, thankfully, Best Buy is now selling the step-up configuration with 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage for $1,399.99 ($300 off). That’s what the base model regularly sold for before the newer MacBooks arrived, and that’s the same price that 8GB / 1TB models are currently retailing for at Best Buy and Amazon. \n\n\nThe 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros of late 2023 are another round of spec-bump models, much like their previous 2022 incarnations. Now starting with the M3 Pro chip (or the speedier M3 Max) and 18GB of base RAM instead of 16GB, the new models remain targeted at creatives doing content work like video editing, photo processing, and other graphical work. Like their predecessors and the M1 Pro generation before that, they offer MagSafe charging, three USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 ports, HDMI-out, and a full-size SD card slot, with prices starting at $1,999 for the 14-inch and $2,499 for the 16-inch. You can, of course, spec them up the wazoo if you’re willing to pay more, as exhibited by the review unit Apple sent us of the 16-inch model, which cost an eye-watering $7,199.\nBut rest assured, versions that actual humans buy now receive regular discounts. For instance, the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 Pro (11-core CPU / 14-core GPU), 18GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD is going for $1,699 ($200 off) at Best Buy and B&H Photo. It was $500 off not long ago, making the current discount good but not that good. As for the base 16-inch Pro — which comes with an M3 Pro chip, 18GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD — it’s on sale starting at $1,999  ($400 off) at Best Buy.\n\n\n\n\nM4 and M4 Pro MacBook Pro\nApple released the M4-series MacBook Pro on November 8th. Notably, the base 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro is the first to launch with 16GB of RAM — double the previous generation’s starting memory — and 512GB of storage for the same $1,599 starting price as the last-gen model. It also picks up a third Thunderbolt 4 port, which is positioned on the right side and supports dual external monitors while the lid is opened. Also new this year is an upgraded 12-megapixel webcam that supports Center Stage and a new Desk View feature, plus the option to add a nano-texture display for an extra $150. It’s also available in space black.\n\n\nThe 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M4 Pro and M4 Max chips also received additional RAM, bringing them up to 24GB. They start with 512GB of storage, too, and retail for $1,999 and $2,499, respectively. While the total port selection hasn’t changed compared to their respective M3 Pro and M3 Max counterparts, you’ll get faster Thunderbolt 5 ports on these more substantial models. That’s in addition to the SD slot, dedicated full-sized HDMI port, and 3.5mm jack. They also have the upgraded 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam with Desk View and the optional nano-texture display option.\nDeals for the M4 MacBook Pro have already started to roll in. Right now, for example, the base 14-inch MacBook Pro M4 with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD is down to $1,449 ($150 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo, while the 24GB / 512GB variant with an M4 Pro chip (12-core CPU / 16-core GPU) is down to $1,799 ($200 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo. The base 16-inch MacBook Pro is also on sale with an M4 Pro chip, 24GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage for $2,249 ($250 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best Mac Mini deals\nThere’s a new Mac Mini in town, as M4-based models arrived earlier this year. Apple increased the starting RAM from 8GB to 16GB, as it did with the 2024 MacBook Pro and 2024 iMac. That makes Apple’s newest desktop an excellent value, even if you factor in the more aggressive discounts we’ve recently seen on the M2 Mac Mini.\nM2 and M2 Pro Mac Mini\nThe 2023 Mac Mini comes in a base configuration with Apple’s M2 processor or a more powerful configuration with the M2 Pro, both of which have proven to be some of Apple’s most value-packed computers to date. The M4 version is poised to take that crown, but the M2 Mac Mini is still kicking around and starts with 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD for $599, while the M2 Pro model features a superior processor, gigabit ethernet, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage for $1,299. \nThe latter model also features an expanded port selection, from two USB-C ports to four. It’s almost like getting an M2 Pro-powered MacBook Pro 14 but in desktop form. However, keep in mind that buying any Mac Mini means you have to provide your own mouse, keyboard, and monitor. Right now, the base model with an M2 chip, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD is on sale for $499 ($100 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo. \n\n\nM4 and M4 Pro Mac Mini\nDeals on the last-gen Mac Mini are still available, sure, but we’re also starting to see discounts on the newest models. The M4 Mac Mini starts with an M4 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage for $599. That’s an incredible value for a tiny desktop computer that can rival the Mac Studio and Mac Pro when it comes to certain tasks, including light gaming, 4K video editing, and 3D modeling. Vertically, the M4 Mac Mini is a fair bit thicker than the M2 model at 2 inches tall, yet it measures a mere 5 inches wide and 5 inches deep.\nIn addition to the odd decision to place the power button on its underside, Apple moved the 3.5mm headphone jack and two of its five USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 ports to the front. The rear features an additional three thunderbolt ports, HDMI-out, and a gigabit ethernet port. You can also get the Mac Mini with an M4 Pro chipset starting at $1,399, which comes with faster Thunderbolt 5 storage and the option to upgrade to 10-gigabit ethernet for another $100.\n\n\nRight now, you can get the base Mac Mini at Amazon with an M4 chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD for $579 ($20 off). Stepping up to the version with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD, meanwhile, will currently run you $744 ($55 off) at Amazon. The M4 Pro model is also a bit cheaper at Amazon, where you can pick it up for $1,369.99 (about $29 off).",

Numerous products now work with Matter,  which in many cases means it’s now easier to buy a connected gadget like a smart light or smart lock and get it set up in your home.  </p>\n<p id=\"GIKPwK\">Matter is an industry standard developed by Apple, Google, Amazon, Samsung, and many others to enable easier, more secure, and more reliable communications between IoT devices. It also allows manufacturers to build to one standard — Matter, while still working within any ecosystem — including Apple Home, Google Home, Amazon Alexa, and Samsung SmartThings. </p>\n<p id=\"xdRfuV\">To help you navigate this brave new world, we’ve compiled a list of all the Matter-compatible products you can buy now, along with details on how they will work in your smart home and whether they work with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23165855/thread-smart-home-protocol-matter-apple-google-interview\">Thread</a> — one of the two main wireless protocols Matter runs on (the other being Wi-Fi). </p>\n<p id=\"KRR6rc\">We also have information on the smart home platforms that support Matter, which devices work with them, and what you need to get started.

Additionally, energy management — a compelling reason to connect your devices if you want to reduce energy use and save money — is also now part of the standard.</p>\n<p id=\"OkGRXU\">However, just because you build it doesn’t mean they’ll come. While Matter provides the building blocks for a smarter home, as of December 2024, not all smart home manufacturers have added Matter support to their devices.

For example, an Apple HomePod or Apple TV for Apple Home, a Google Nest Hub for Google Home, a SmartThings hub for Samsung, an Amazon device for Alexa, etc. </p>\n<p id=\"lvcgYC\">Every major smart home platform has updated its existing hubs and smart speakers to make them Matter controllers. You’ll also need that platform’s smartphone or tablet app. These act as Matter commissioners and connect the Matter device to the Matter controller.</p>\n<p id=\"0rC1KL\">Some Matter controllers are also <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/19/23269460/thread-1-3-0-matter-border-routers-homepod-mini-echo-nest\">Thread border routers</a>. You need a border router to add Thread devices to your home. (Apple users can <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/18/24246581/ios18-matter-smart-home-devices-hub-thread-border-router\">use an iPhone with Thread</a> in it to onboard Thread devices to their home network.) </p>\n<p id=\"81upbv\">If your Matter controller is not a Thread border router, you can add a Thread border router-capable device from any manufacturer to your network, and it should provide the connectivity you need — it doesn’t have to be from the platform you are using. (Multiple Thread border routers from different companies <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235097/thread-1-4-spec-launch-matter-smart-home-problems\">can cause some issues</a>, so keep

    "summary": "Image: The Verge\n    \n\n\n  \nAll the Matter-compatible devices you can buy, plus the latest on the smart home standard backed by Apple, Amazon, Google, and Samsung. \n Two years after its launch, the Matter smart home standard is still plugging away at its mission to create a smart home that is easy to use, works with every ecosystem, and operates locally and securely in your home. Numerous products now work with Matter,  which in many cases means it’s now easier to buy a connected gadget like a smart light or smart lock and get it set up in your home.  \nMatter is an industry standard developed by Apple, Google, Amazon, Samsung, and many others to enable easier, more secure, and more reliable communications between IoT devices. It also allows manufacturers to build to one standard — Matter, while still working within any ecosystem — including Apple Home, Google Home, Amazon Alexa, and Samsung SmartThings. \nTo help you navigate this brave new world, we’ve compiled a list of all the Matter-compatible products you can buy now, along with details on how they will work in your smart home and whether they work with Thread — one of the two main wireless protocols Matter runs on (the other being Wi-Fi). \nWe also have information on the smart home platforms that support Matter, which devices work with them, and what you need to get started. We’ll keep this article updated as new information comes out.\n\n\n\n\n//this line summons a table of contents. use as follows!\n\n//initiateTOC takes the arguments \"header\", \"subheader\", \"collapsible\"\n\n//for whatever header type (\"h2\", \"h3\" etc) you want to be the main header, type it in quotes in the function call. \n\n//if you don't want subheads, set to false in the function call (no quotes)\n\n//collapsible is a true/false toggle\n\n//if you want a specific, unlinked title just add a string at the end in double quotes, e.g. false, \"h3\", false, \"This is the title\"\n\n//see graham if you have any questions/issues\n\n// note that all the header types are off by one: an h1 in the CMS is an h2 in the actual code. If you just want h2 and h3 to show up in the TOC you need to call them h3 and h4. \n\n\nwindow.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', (event) => {\n\tinitiateTOC(\"h3\", \"h4\", true, \"Matter smart home devices\")\n});\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich device types does Matter support?\nFollowing the release of the newest Matter spec (1.4) in November 2024 by the Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA, the organization that runs Matter), Matter now supports most of the common device types you might want to use in your smart home (with some notable exceptions, including security cameras and security systems). \nMost gadgets can now theoretically work with the new standard — including lighting, locks, appliances, TVs, robot vacuums, routers, thermostats, and sensors.  Additionally, energy management — a compelling reason to connect your devices if you want to reduce energy use and save money — is also now part of the standard.\nHowever, just because you build it doesn’t mean they’ll come. While Matter provides the building blocks for a smarter home, as of December 2024, not all smart home manufacturers have added Matter support to their devices. Additionally, not all platforms support all the device types.\n\n\nThis can make getting set up with Matter confusing and is partly why Matter is still not ready to be the main way to connect all your devices in your smart home. But if you’re eager to get started with Matter and want to see some of the promised benefits — local control, improved device security, and being able to control your gadgets with any smart home platform you’d like — then read on for a list of every gadget you can buy today that works with Matter and what you need to get started. \nPhoto by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge\n      The HomePod Mini is both a Matter controller and a Thread border router.\n  \nGetting started: Matter controllers\nTo use Matter devices, you will need a Matter controller from the smart home platform you plan to use. For example, an Apple HomePod or Apple TV for Apple Home, a Google Nest Hub for Google Home, a SmartThings hub for Samsung, an Amazon device for Alexa, etc. \nEvery major smart home platform has updated its existing hubs and smart speakers to make them Matter controllers. You’ll also need that platform’s smartphone or tablet app. These act as Matter commissioners and connect the Matter device to the Matter controller.\nSome Matter controllers are also Thread border routers. You need a border router to add Thread devices to your home. (Apple users can use an iPhone with Thread in it to onboard Thread devices to their home network.) \nIf your Matter controller is not a Thread border router, you can add a Thread border router-capable device from any manufacturer to your network, and it should provide the connectivity you need — it doesn’t have to be from the platform you are using. (Multiple Thread border routers from different companies can cause some issues, so keep that in mind as you add devices to your home.)\nList of Matter controllers \n(These Matter controllers are all also Thread border routers unless indicated as Wi-Fi only)\nApple Home\nApple HomePod (second-gen) \nApple HomePod Mini\n\n\nApple TV 4K Wi-Fi + Ethernet (2022 version)\nApple TV 4K (2021 version)\nApple HomePod (first-gen, Wi-Fi only)\nApple TV 4K Wi-Fi (2022 version, Wi-Fi only)\nGoogle Home \nNest Hub (second-gen)\n\n\nNest Hub Max\n\nGoogle TV Streamer 4K\nGoogle Nest Wifi Pro\n\nGoogle Nest Wifi Router / Point\nThe following Google devices are Wi-Fi-only Matter controllers: Nest Audio, Nest Mini, Nest Hub (first-gen), Google Home (original smart speaker), Google Home Mini\nSamsung SmartThings\nAeotec SmartThings Smart Home Hub\nSamsung SmartThings Station \nSamsung SmartThings Hub Dongle \nSamsung SmartThings Hub v3\nSamsung Smart TVs (2023 and newer), Smart Monitor M80C (2023 and newer), and Q-Series Soundbars (2023 and newer) \nSamsung Bespoke Family Hub refrigerator (2023 and newer)\nThe following Samsung devices are Wi-Fi-only Matter controllers: Samsung SmartThings Hub v2, Samsung Family Hub fridge (2017 and newer, can add Thread with a dongle), Samsung Smart Monitors 2022 models, Samsung smart TVs 2022 models, Samsung Music Frame\n\n\nAmazon Alexa\nEcho Hub\nEcho (fourth-gen) \nEero Pro 6E, Pro 6, 6 Plus, 6, PoE 6, and PoE Gateway\n\nEcho Show 8 (third-gen)\nEcho Show 15 (second-gen)\nEcho Show 21 (second-gen)\nEero 6 devices and newer, including Eero Max 7\n\nThe following Echo devices are Wi-Fi-only Matter controllers: Echo Dot and Echo Dot with Clock (third-gen and newer), Echo Pop, Echo Spot, Echo Studio, Echo Show 5, Echo Show 8 (second-gen), Echo Show 10 (third-gen), Echo Show 15, Echo Input, Flex, and Plus (v2)\nOther platforms with Matter controllers\nAqara Hub M3 \nNabu Casa Home Assistant Yellow\nHome Assistant Green with Home Assistant Connect ZBT-1 dongle\nComcast xFi Advanced Gateway \nHubitat Elevation Model C-8 hub \nHomey Pro hub (beta)\nHOOBS Pro (Thread / Matter update announced)\nLG ThinQ ON hub (announced)\nFlic Hub LR and Flic Hub Mini (Wi-Fi only)\nLG smart TVs (webOS 22 and 23, Wi-Fi only)\nMui Board 2.0 (Wi-Fi only)\nWhich platforms support which device types?\nMatter now supports over 40 device types — you can see a full list through Matter 1.3 here, and the new Matter 1.4 device types here. However, the Matter specification does not require that each platform support all device types. This means that while your smart air purifier may work through Matter with Amazon Alexa, it may not work with Google Home. \nHere is a rundown of which platforms currently support which Matter devices: \nMatter devices supported by Apple Home\nApple Home supports lighting devices, air conditioners (air purifiers and air quality monitors), buttons, bridges, locks, smart plugs / outlets, thermostats, blinds and shades, and sensors (motion, ambient light, contact, temperature, and humidity). The company has said it will add support for robot vacuums to Apple Home with iOS 18 in early 2025.\nMatter devices supported by Amazon Alexa\nAmazon Alexa supports lighting devices, smart plugs, door locks, bridges, blinds and shades, fans, sensors (including motion, contact, ambient light, humidity, and temperature), generic buttons and switches, room air conditioners, dishwashers, robotic vacuums, smoke and carbon monoxide alarms, air quality sensors, and air purifiers.\nMatter devices supported by Google Home\nGoogle Home supports all lighting devices, smart plugs, door locks, bridges, blinds, fans, thermostats, and sensors (including motion, contact, occupancy, ambient light, humidity, temperature, pressure, and flow). \nMatter devices supported by Samsung SmartThings\nSamsung SmartThings supports all Matter device types through Matter 1.3.\nMatter device types supported by Home Assistant\nHome Assistant supports all Matter device types through Matter 1.3.\nAll the smart home devices that work with Matter\nWhat follows are lists of all the smart home devices we know of that currently work with Matter. \nMost Matter-compatible products can be identified by a Matter logo on the packaging and a Matter QR code on the device itself. However, some older devices have been updated to Matter with over-the-air firmware updates. Others (such as Philips Hue lights) can be added to Matter through a proprietary hub or bridge.\nPhoto by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge\n      The Aqara U100 is one of only a handful of smart locks that support Matter.\n  \nSmart door locks\nAll the major platforms support smart door locks through Matter, but only a handful of locks currently work with Matter.  \nI’ve written more about how Matter works with smart locks here, but the biggest thing to know is that if you use a lock through Matter, the only guaranteed support is the ability to lock and unlock it. Features such as adding PINs and using auto-lock depend on the platform you are using. For example, Apple Home and SmartThings support PINs through Matter, but Google and Amazon Alexa don’t. \nRecently, Apple added support for Home Key to Matter locks using its platform. However, this only works on locks that are NFC enabled and connect to Apple Home directly via Matter, not through a bridge or hub. \nAqara Smart Lock U100 (with Aqara hub)\nAqara Smart Lock U50 (with Aqara hub)\nAqara Smart Lock U200 (Thread)\nAqara Smart Lock U300 (Thread)\nEufy Smart Lock E30 (Thread)\nKwikset Halo Select (Thread)\nLevel Lock Plus (Matter)\nSwitchBot Lock (with SwitchBot Hub)\nSwitchBot Lock Pro (with SwitchBot Hub) \nYale Assure Lock SL (with Matter module)\nNuki fourth-gen (Europe only)\nPhoto by Owen Grove / The Verge\n      The new Nest Learning Thermostat (4th gen) will work with Matter.\n  \nSmart thermostats, heating and cooling / air purifying equipment\nMatter 1.4 added support for scheduling and preset modes like vacation and home / away settings, in addition to temperature adjustment and mode changes. However, there are only three thermostats that support Matter in the US: Google’s Nest Thermostat (2020), its Nest Learning Thermostat (4th gen), and the Meross Matter Smart Thermostat. \nSmart thermostat company Ecobee has said it’s committed to Matter but hasn’t shared a timeline for when its thermostats will support the standard. There are a few other climate control devices designed for European heating systems that work with Matter.\nAqara Radiator Thermostat E1 (through Aqara hub)\nBosch Radiator Thermostat II (Thread, UK and EU)\nBig Ass Fans (OTA update for select Haiku models)\nEve Thermo (Thread)\nGoogle Nest Thermostat \nGoogle Nest Learning Thermostat (4th gen)\nGoveeLife Smart Tower Fan 2 Max\nMeross Matter Smart Thermostat\nMidea U window air conditioning unit\nSwitchBot Battery Circulator Fan (through SwitchBot Hub)\nSwitchBot Evaporative Humidifier (through SwitchBot Hub)\nTado X (UK and EU only)\nAir purifiers\nAir purifiers arrived with Matter 1.2 and are now supported by all platforms except Google Home.\nIkea Starkvind air purifier (through Dirigera bridge)\nMidea 2-in-1 fan / heater air purifier\n\n\nWelov Air Purifier P200 (AiDot)\nPhoto by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge\n      The Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra is one of the first robot vacuums to be Matter-certified.\n  \nRobot vacuums\nFor robot vacuums, the Matter spec supports functions including remote start and progress notifications, switching cleaning modes (i.e., from dry vacuum to wet mopping), and status details such as brush and charging status and error reporting. \nMatter does not support room mapping, so you will still need to use the manufacturer’s app for that. However, based on Apple’s plans to implement robovac support in Matter, it appears you can control room-specific cleaning through Matter.\nSamsung SmartThings and Amazon Alexa currently support robot vacuums, and Apple has said support will come early next year. However, no robot vacuums have Matter support fully enabled. Most on this list have said it will be available on these models via an OTA upgrade later this year.\nEcovacs Deebot X2 Combo\nDreame X40 Ultra\nRoborock S8 MaxV Ultra \nRoomba Combo 10 Max \nSwitchBot K10 Plus, K10 Plus Pro, and S10 \nRead more about Matter support for robot vacuums in my robot vacuum buying guide.\nHome appliances \nFridges / freezers, dishwashers, washers, dryers, microwaves, and ovens are all supported Matter device types, but so far, actual on-sale appliances with Matter support are few and far between. \nManufacturers Whirlpool (which owns KitchenAid and Maytag), Bosch, Midea, Hisense, Toshiba, LG, Samsung, and Haier (which owns GE Appliances) are all members of Matter. But only Midea and Bosch have implemented the standard. \nMidea has added it to a dishwasher and microwave, neither of which you can buy yet. Bosch has Matter in its Siemens / Bosch XXL built-in fridge freezer and its Bosch 100 Series French Door fridge, but the update won’t be live until March 2025.\nSome Samsung refrigerators and TVs are Matter controllers but not Matter devices . Notably, Samsung has not committed to making any of its appliances Matter devices. \n\nTelevisions and media streaming devices\nSeveral TV manufacturers, including TCL, Hisense, Toshiba, and Universal Electronics have said their products will support Matter. LG and Samsung have enabled their newer TVs as Matter controllers, but not Matter devices.\nAs a Matter-enabled device, a TV should be controllable through your smart home app, including adjusting volume, changing inputs, powering on and off, and changing channels.\nAmazon has added Matter support to its Fire TVs and Fire Sticks (running Fire OS 7 or higher), which enables Matter Casting. This feature of Matter lets you cast content from an app on your phone to an app on a TV or display. So far, only Amazon supports Matter Casting, and only for Prime Video. \nIn Matter 1.4, the CSA has added set-top boxes as a type that could be Matter-certified if the device includes a Wi-Fi access point, a Thread border router, and Matter-specific software functions. We’ve yet to see any companies release a device like this.\nSmart shades, blinds, and shutters\nControlling shades is fairly simple: they can be up or down, open or closed, or partly open. Matter support is available for all those features, plus tilting for blinds, so if you are looking for smart shades, those with Matter support will work as expected with all the big platforms.\nAqara Roller Shade Driver E1 (through Aqara hub) \nAqara Curtain Driver E1 (through Aqara hub)\nAqara Roller Shade Controller (through Aqara hub)\nEve MotionBlinds (Thread)\nEve MotionBlinds Upgrade Kit (Thread)\nIkea smart blinds (through Dirigera bridge)\nSwitchBot Curtain Motor (through SwitchBot Hub 2) \nSwitchBot Blind Tilt (through SwitchBot Hub 2)\n\n\nSmartWings (Thread)\nZemismart Roller Shade Motor (Thread)\nZemismart Curtain Motor (Thread)\nImage: Nanoleaf\n      There are lots of Matter-compatible smart bulbs, switches, and lamps available now — including this Nanoleaf x Umbra Cono lamp.\n  \nSmart lighting\nThere are many smart lighting options available in Matter, from bulbs, switches, and smart plugs to a lamp or two and a couple of outlets. If you want to control your smart lights with basic on / off, dimming, and color control, then any of the options below will work well for you. \nThe benefit of Matter here is that the lights will connect directly to your platform of choice without needing a third-party app and will work locally in your home without relying on the cloud for commands, meaning they should respond more quickly and reliably. \nHowever, if you want to take advantage of additional features offered by some smart lighting companies (Philips Hue, Wiz, and Nanoleaf, for example), you’ll need their apps to control those. This includes dynamic lighting scenes, security lighting, or circadian rhythm lighting.\nWith iOS 18, Apple’s Adaptive Lighting feature now works with Matter smart lights (as long as the lights have enabled the feature).

Support for more advanced presence sensing technologies such as mmWave and vision (through a camera) arrived with 1.4.

If you have devices that work through a bridge and that bridge has been updated to Matter, the devices connected to it will work in a Matter platform.  \nHowever, some features specific to the manufacturer’s app, such as dynamic lighting or precise sensor settings, may not be available on the Matter platform. Additionally, some Matter-specific features, such as Apple’s Home Key for Matter locks, won’t work with devices that have been bridged to Matter. \nPhilips Hue Bridge\nAqara Hub M2 (OTA update)\nAqara Hub M1S Gen 2 (OTA update)\nAqara Hub E1 (OTA update)\nAqara Hub M3 \nAqara Camera Hub G3 (OTA update)\nIkea Dirigera hub\nSwitchBot Hub 2\nSwitchbot Hub Mini Matter Enabled\nZemismart M1 Hub\nPhoto by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge\n      The Google Nest Wifi Pro works with Matter and Thread.\n  \nWi-Fi routers in Matter\nWith 1.4, Matter added official support for Wi-Fi routers, modems, access points, and set-top boxes, known collectively as HRAP (Home Routers and Access Points).\nTo be Matter-certified, an HRAP device needs to be both a Wi-Fi access point and a Thread border router. It also needs to run specific Matter software that supports storing and sharing Thread network credentials and provides other infrastructure support for Matter in your home. \nImportantly, HRAP devices don’t have to be Matter controllers (although they can be), so they can be a platform-agnostic piece of Matter infrastructure in your home. This means all you would need in addition would be a Matter controller from your platform of choice, and you’d have all you need to start building a Matter smart home. \nComcast, a major player in developing Matter, made its xFi gateway Matter-compatible, but it doesn’t have Thread and doesn’t currently work with any smart home platforms. With the arrival of 1.4, there could be some movement here, potentially from companies like AT&T, Verizon, and others. \nCurrently, Google Nest’s Wi-Fi routers are Thread-enabled Matter controllers for Google Home, and Amazon (which owns Eero) has added Matter controller support to its Eero 6 devices and newer. Whether either company will adopt the new HRAP spec on its routers remains to be seen, but if you use Alexa or Google Home, their respective router is a great foundation for a Matter setup.  \nUltimately, a future where all Wi-Fi routers have Thread and Matter built-in could finally make setting up a smart home easy. What would make it even easier is if these new HRAP devices could also be Matter controllers for any platform, but that’s probably asking too much.\nUpdate, December 10th, 2024: Streamlined the explanation section of the article, added a section outlining which platforms support which device types, included newly announced products, and made updates throughout.",

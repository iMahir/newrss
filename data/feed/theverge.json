On its face, Google’s version, which doesn’t have the summaries or bullet points, isn’t as immediately informative as Reddit Answers. But personally, I’m pretty skeptical of AI summaries anyway — they can make some pretty bad errors! — so for me, the Google results are still perfectly fine as a way to explore some potentially useful posts on Reddit. \nScreenshot by Jay Peters / The Verge\n      My Reddit site search on Google.\n  \nReddit Answers can also pick up on things happening on Reddit within minutes, according to spokesperson Tim Rathschmidt, so there’s also a chance responses to your queries will have timely results. I haven’t had much luck with that; on Friday, for example, I asked “who won yesterday’s NFL game,” and instead of pulling up answers about Thursday’s Packers-Lions game, it included details on the Eagles-Ravens game that happened on December 1st.\nThat might have just been a quirk of the product not being fully ready yet. In my testing, though, Reddit Answers has been much more useful as a jumping off point to dig into a more general topic on Reddit rather than an up-to-the-minute search tool. And while Reddit Answers is useful, I’m not sure yet if it’s good enough for me to change my habits around using Google to search for things on Reddit.",

    "summary": "Rand (Joshua Stradowski) and Moiraine (Rosamund Pike). | Screenshot: YouTube\n    \n\n  \nAmazon announced at CCXP in Brazil yesterday that season three of Prime Video fantasy series The Wheel of Time will start streaming on March 13th, 2025, writes Deadline. The company also released a new teaser trailer, setting stakes that include the life of at least one main character. \nThe trailer opens with Rand al’Thor (Joshua Stradowski) and others standing on a hill overlooking a fog-shrouded city. Rand and Moiraine Damodred (Rosamund Pike) are headed to the Aiel Waste “to uncover the true fate of the Dragon Reborn” in this season, according to the trailer’s description. If you haven’t watched the show or read Robert Jordan’s book series by the same name, Rand is the Dragon Reborn, a prophecied being who could save the world — or destroy it if he succumbs to the Dark.\nWe’ve seen a thousand, thousand futures, and in every one of them, The Wheel of Time returns March 13. Behold the official Season 3 teaser trailer. pic.twitter.com/ULZiKjWEHy\n— THE WHEEL OF TIME (@TheWheelOfTime) December 7, 2024\n\n\n\n\n“I have seen a thousand thousand futures. In every future where I lived, Rand dies,” says Moiraine Damodred (Rosamund Pike). “And the only way he lives is if I don’t,” she adds before she’s seen being carried, unconscious, by Rand at the end of the trailer.\nBesides Stradowski and Pike, season 3 will see the return of several characters, including Perrin Aybara (Marcus Rutherford), Nynaeve al’Meara (Zoë Robbins), Mat Cauthon (Dónal Finn), and al-Lan Mandragoran (Daniel Henney).",

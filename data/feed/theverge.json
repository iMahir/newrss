Each wearable has its own pros and cons, as does the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23369207/apple-watch-se-2022-review-smartwatch\">second-gen Apple Watch SE</a>, but the recent introduction of the new wearables also means there are now more Apple Watch models on the market than ever before — and a lot more deals to be had.</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><div id=\"CWUc7k\"><div data-anthem-component=\"aside:11906226\"></div></div></div>\n<p id=\"sHcaqK\">But with all of those options, which one should you pick? Generally speaking, you want to buy the newest watch you can afford so that it continues to receive software updates from Apple. The latest update, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/25/24253366/watch-os-11-apple-watch-smartwatch\">watchOS 11</a>, launched in September on the Apple Watch Series 6 and newer, ultimately leaving those still using an older Series 4 or Series 5 behind.</p>\n<p id=\"C0aQBE\">Picking up a watch from the latest (or a recent) generation ensures you’re getting a smartwatch with an updated design, a robust number of features, and plenty of sensors.

It features the new S10 SiP chip, faster charging, and a wide-angle OLED display that’s brighter, larger, and easier to read than that of previous models. It weighs half as much as the Ultra, too, and is about 30 percent thinner despite its new 42mm and 46mm sizing. Other upgrades include an added depth and water temperature sensor, as well as a new FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection feature, the latter of which is also available on the last-gen Series 9 and Ultra 2.</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"rPKDmW\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Apple Watch sleep apnea detection gets FDA clearance\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/16/24246150/apple-watch-sleep-apnea-detection-fda-approval\"},{\"title\":\"The Apple Watch is now a better TV remote\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/19/24249074/apple-watch-watchos-11-tv-remote\"},{\"title\":\"Here’s how the new Apple Watch Series 10 stacks up to other models\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/24240412/apple-watch-series-10-vs-ultra-2-se-comparison-specs-price\"}]}'></div></aside></div>\n<p id=\"PS4qua\">While the improvements are certainly welcome, the Series 10 isn’t a vast departure from the prior model, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23878981/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-review-double-tap-precision-finding-siri\">Series 9</a>.

    "summary": "The latest Apple Watch SE is an entry-level smartwatch if there ever was one. | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n    \n\n  \nIn September, Apple launched its latest smartwatch, introducing the Apple Watch Series 10 alongside a black rendition of the Apple Watch Ultra 2. Each wearable has its own pros and cons, as does the second-gen Apple Watch SE, but the recent introduction of the new wearables also means there are now more Apple Watch models on the market than ever before — and a lot more deals to be had.\n\n\n\nBut with all of those options, which one should you pick? Generally speaking, you want to buy the newest watch you can afford so that it continues to receive software updates from Apple. The latest update, watchOS 11, launched in September on the Apple Watch Series 6 and newer, ultimately leaving those still using an older Series 4 or Series 5 behind.\nPicking up a watch from the latest (or a recent) generation ensures you’re getting a smartwatch with an updated design, a robust number of features, and plenty of sensors. Now, let’s get to the deals.\n\n\nThe best Apple Watch Series 10 deals\n\n\n\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 represents the latest wearable in Apple’s flagship Series lineup. It features the new S10 SiP chip, faster charging, and a wide-angle OLED display that’s brighter, larger, and easier to read than that of previous models. It weighs half as much as the Ultra, too, and is about 30 percent thinner despite its new 42mm and 46mm sizing. Other upgrades include an added depth and water temperature sensor, as well as a new FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection feature, the latter of which is also available on the last-gen Series 9 and Ultra 2.\n\n\nWhile the improvements are certainly welcome, the Series 10 isn’t a vast departure from the prior model, the Series 9. That being said, you can already pick up Apple’s latest wearable at Amazon in the 42mm sizing with GPS starting at $329.99 (about $69 off) thanks to an on-page coupon. The GPS-equipped model is also on sale at Amazon in the 46mm variant for $359.99 (about $69 off), while the LTE models can be had at Amazon starting at $429.99 (about $69 off). Both of the latter discounts also require you to clip the on-page coupon.\nRead our Apple Watch Series 10 review.\nThe best Apple Watch Series 9 deals\n\n\n\n\nIn 2023, Apple introduced the Apple Watch Series 9 alongside the second-gen Ultra. It uses Apple’s last-gen S9 SiP chip and a second-gen ultra wideband chip, which allow for onboard Siri processing and precision finding with select iPhone models. It also features a brighter, 2,000-nit display and support for Apple’s nifty “double tap” feature — two minor additions that are also present on the Series 10.\n\n\nThe Series 9 has been out for more than a year, but certain configurations have become increasingly difficult to find with the arrival of Apple’s latest watch. Luckily, the GPS-equipped Series 9 is still on sale at Target in the 41mm sizing starting at $299.99 ($100 off), or in the 45mm configuration at Walmart and Target starting at $329 ($100 off). There are also a handful of deals to be had on the LTE models with cellular connectivity, though none of them undercut the current price of the LTE-equipped Series 10 model by much, hence their exclusion here.\nRead our Apple Watch Series 9 review.\nThe best Apple Watch SE deals\n\n\n\n\nThe Apple Watch SE received a refresh in late 2022.

    "summary": "Deals on Apple’s latest slates are finally worth springing for. | Screenshot: Apple\n    \n\n  \nWhile the best iPad deals usually land during major sale events like Black Friday and Amazon Prime Day, many great iPad deals are attainable outside those times. The day-to-day discounts may come and go like changing winds, but there’s often something to be saved, particularly on the more affordable iPads. The most recent iPad Pro and iPad Air are also starting to see substantial price reductions, and now that Apple has a new iPad Mini, we’re seeing regular discounts on the last-gen Mini as well.\n\n\n\nIt’s difficult to know where exactly you can find the most notable iPad deals unless you’re scouring the major retailers on a daily basis. But that’s often what our deal hunters at The Verge are doing each and every day, so let us help you out. Below, we’ve listed the best deals you can get on each iPad model that is currently available, from the cheapo ninth-gen iPad of 2021 to the latest models equipped with Apple’s powerful M2 and M4 chips.\n\n\nThe best iPad (2021) deals\nAnnounced alongside the iPhone 13 way back in 2021, the ninth-gen iPad is Apple’s aging entry-level tablet, one that’s still great at carrying out everyday tasks despite having been discontinued. The ninth-gen model originally started at $329 with Wi-Fi and 64GB of storage, which arguably makes the newer 10th-gen model the better deal if you don’t need a home button or a headphone jack, as it now starts at $349 and is often on sale for even less.\nThe last-gen iPad has been receiving a steep discount for quite a while, but it’s becoming increasingly difficult to find in most configurations. That being said, Walmart is still selling the 64GB base model with Wi-Fi for $249 ($80 off), which is about $50 shy of its all-time low. As for the step-up 256GB variant, Amazon has it in silver for $359 ($120 off), which is $10 more than its lowest price to date.\nA last-gen model is still worth considering\nThe last-gen iPad uses an A13 Bionic processor and a 12MP wide-angle camera with Center Stage, a feature designed to keep you framed up and centered while on video calls. The tablet also carries over a number of features from its predecessor, such as the 10.2-inch display, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor built into the home button, and a smart connector for connecting a smart keyboard.\n\n\nThe best iPad (2022) deals\nAlthough the newer 10th-gen iPad came out in late 2022, it’s still an excellent tablet — one we consider to be the best value for most people (once Apple dropped its price). The latest iPad modernizes the design with a switch to USB-C, uniform bezels with no home button, a side power button with a fingerprint sensor, and a larger display, but it eliminates the 3.5mm headphone jack.\nIn the past, you could often buy Apple’s latest entry-level iPad for $349 ($100 off its initial launch price) — which is now the MSRP. Right now, however, the base model with 64GB of storage is on sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart for $279 ($70 off), which is about $30 more than its lowest price to date. Amazon and Best Buy are also selling the 256GB model starting at $429 ($70 off), which nearly matches its all-time low. \n\n\nThe best iPad Mini (2021) and iPad Mini (2024) deals\nThe new iPad Mini is similar to the outgoing 2021 model but comes with faster Wi-Fi and USB-C speeds, support for the Apple Pencil Pro, and a newer processor that supports Apple Intelligence. That said, the sixth-gen iPad Mini could still be worth a look if prices continue to drop. It has an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display, an A15 Bionic processor, a USB-C port, and options for 5G.

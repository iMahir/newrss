Yet while we may never see a<strong> </strong>Pixel Tablet 2, luckily the original slate is still around and receiving a steep discount. Normally $399, right now the base Google Pixel Tablet with 128GB of storage has returned to its Black Friday price of $279 at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Tablet-Extra-Long-Porcelain/dp/B0CZMFZ84J?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://howl.link/hb6vyghwauykp\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://store.google.com/config/pixel_tablet\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">directly from Google</a>.

    "summary": "Google’s Pixel Tablet uniquely turns into a smart display of sorts when you buy the charging speaker dock. | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge\n    \n\n  \nGoogle might soon stop selling tablets altogether, which is a shame, because we were fans of the Google Pixel Tablet when it was released last year. Yet while we may never see a Pixel Tablet 2, luckily the original slate is still around and receiving a steep discount. Normally $399, right now the base Google Pixel Tablet with 128GB of storage has returned to its Black Friday price of $279 at Amazon, Best Buy, and directly from Google. You can buy it with a charging speaker dock starting at $459 ($140 off) from the Best Buy and Google.\n\n\nIf you’re looking for an Android tablet that’s great for watching movies, web browsing, video chatting, and other basic tasks, the Pixel Tablet remains an excellent option. Powered by Google’s Tensor G2 chip, it’s a snappy entertainment device. Its sharp 11-inch LCD display offers wide viewing angles ideal for streaming, while its four speakers provide clear audio.\nIt’s the optional magnetic charging speaker dock that really makes the Pixel Tablet stand out, though. The dock effectively turns the Pixel Tablet into smart display similar to the Nest Hub Max, allowing it to deliver a full, room-filling sound quality that outperforms the tablet’s built-in speakers. That means you can also enjoy some Nest Hub Max capabilities, using the tablet to control smart home devices with just your voice via Google Assistant, for example.\nRead our Google Pixel Tablet review.\n\n\nA few more deals worth a look\nThe UE Wonderboom 4 is on sale at an all-time low price of $59.99 ($40 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo.

Now, following days of widespread outrage at the health insurance industry generally, Anthem is walking that policy back, the insurer <a href=\"https://providernews.anthem.com/connecticut/articles/update-to-anesthesia-billed-time-units-policy-23311\">announced</a> on Thursday.</p>\n<p id=\"nvJ5E5\">In mid-November, the American Society of Anesthesiologists <a href=\"https://www.asahq.org/about-asa/newsroom/news-releases/2024/11/anthem-blue-cross-blue-shield-will-not-pay-complete-duration-of-anesthesia-for-surgical-procedures\">issued a press release</a> about the policy, which was set to take effect in February in states like Connecticut, New York, and Missouri. </p>\n<p id=\"8veL0d\">“If an anesthesiologist submits a bill where the actual time of care is longer than Anthem’s limit, Anthem will deny payment for the anesthesiologist’s care,” they group writes. “With this new policy, Anthem will not pay anesthesiologists for delivering safe and effective anesthesia care to patients who may need extra attention because their surgery is difficult, unusual or because a complication arises.”</p>\n<p id=\"nsxL5v\">The letter appears to have garnered little public attention until this week when <a href=\"https://x.com/MorePerfectUS/status/1864363128584130774\">several</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/GovKathyHochul/status/1864495315362926753\">posts</a> on social media about the policy change began circulating. The posts gained traction after the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, Brian Thompson, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/05/us/unitedhealthcare-ceo-killed-what-we-know-hnk/index.html\">was shot and killed in New York</a> on Wednesday in what police say was a targeted attack.</p>\n<div id=\"GzJmHI\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\" align=\"center\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Outrageous.

    "summary": "Beginning in February, health insurer Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield was planning to set a time limit for anesthesia coverage during surgeries and procedures. Now, following days of widespread outrage at the health insurance industry generally, Anthem is walking that policy back, the insurer announced on Thursday.\nIn mid-November, the American Society of Anesthesiologists issued a press release about the policy, which was set to take effect in February in states like Connecticut, New York, and Missouri. \n“If an anesthesiologist submits a bill where the actual time of care is longer than Anthem’s limit, Anthem will deny payment for the anesthesiologist’s care,” they group writes. “With this new policy, Anthem will not pay anesthesiologists for delivering safe and effective anesthesia care to patients who may need extra attention because their surgery is difficult, unusual or because a complication arises.”\nThe letter appears to have garnered little public attention until this week when several posts on social media about the policy change began circulating. The posts gained traction after the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, Brian Thompson, was shot and killed in New York on Wednesday in what police say was a targeted attack.\nOutrageous.

    "summary": "Image: Alex Parkin / The Verge\n    \n\n  \nChatGPT launched roughly two years and two weeks ago. Now, as we near the end of 2024, the AI race is... well, where is it, exactly? It’s more competitive than ever, there’s more money being poured into new models and products than ever, and it’s not at all clear when or even whether we’re going to get products that make it all worthwhile.\nOn this episode of The Vergecast, we talk about a lot of different AI news, all along a single trend line: the tech industry trying desperately to build a killer app for AI. (Ideally, for them, also one that makes money.) The Verge’s Richard Lawler joins us as we discuss Google Gemini 2.0, Project Astra and Project Mariner, and everything else Google is doing to put AI in the products you already use every day. We also talk through the new Android XR announcement, and Google’s renewed commitment to making headsets and smart glasses that work. It’s all an AI story, no matter how you look at it.\n\nAfter that... more AI! We talk about the launch and near-immediate disappearance of OpenAI’s Sora, what’s new in iOS 18.2, Reddit’s clever-but-primitive new Answers feature, and more.\nFinally, in the lightning round, it’s a smorgasbord of tech news. YouTube is big on TVs; Instagram is testing a way for you to test your posts; the TikTok ban is coming, but a sale sounds like the answer; Sonos once again made a great soundbar; and what the heck happened to Cruise? The year’s almost over, but the news keeps coming.\n\n\n\nIf you want to know more about everything we discuss in this episode, here are some links to get you started, beginning with Google:\nGoogle’s AI enters its ‘agentic era’ \nGemini 2.0: what’s new in Google’s new flagship AI model\nGoogle’s AI-powered smart glasses are a little closer to being real \nGoogle’s new Jules AI agent will help developers fix buggy code\nGoogle is testing Gemini AI agents that help you in video games\nGoogle built an AI tool that can do research for you\nI saw Google’s plan to put Android on your face\nAnd in other AI news:\nOpenAI has finally released Sora\niOS 18.2 is out now, adding ChatGPT integration and more Apple Intelligence tools\nFrom The Wall Street Journal: iOS 18.2 Review: The AI Apple Promised Us\n\nChatGPT’s side-by-side ‘Canvas’ view is now available to everyone. \nReddit’s new AI search tool helps you find Reddit answers without Google\nAnd in the lightning round:\nYouTube is still growing fast on TVs in the living room\nInstagram will let creators test experimental reels on random people\nAdam Mosseri’s post on trial reels\nIt sure sounds like Trump would be okay with a TikTok sale\nSonos Arc Ultra review: don’t call it a comeback (yet)\nCruise’s robotaxi service will likely shut down as GM pulls its funding\nAmazon’s online car ‘dealership’ with Hyundai is now live",

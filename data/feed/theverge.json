They’re a little more durable, a little lighter, and come with a handful of tiny upgrades. Even so, both models <a href=\"https://howl.me/cmDKOyRtZR8\">got a boost</a> of a certain kind: higher prices, with the Galaxy Z Fold 6 now starting at $1,899 and the Z Flip 6 at $1,099. </p>\n<p id=\"WjhfvK\">Both phones use a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset specially tuned for Samsung, and like the S24 series, they both include seven years of OS and security update support. They’re both a little bit sturdier, claiming better resistance to drops thanks to improvements to the hinge design and materials.

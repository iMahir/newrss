Released back in 2019, these wireless earbuds (and their signature ear hooks) have sat in the company’s product lineup ever since with no meaningful hardware changes. But the time has finally come for an all-new model. Today, Beats released a teaser for the Powerbeats Pro 2, which will be released sometime in 2025. \nIn the clip, we see the in-ear fit of the revamped design showcased by baseball sensation Shohei Ohtani. Fans of the ear hooks will be happy to see that they haven’t gone anywhere; if you want a hook-free design, Beats offers plenty of other options, including the Beats Fit Pro, Studio Buds Plus, and Solo Buds.\n  \n \n  \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n View...\n\n\nContinue reading…",

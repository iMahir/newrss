That means higher price tags on key materials needed to make solar panels at a time when solar is the <a href=\"https://emp.lbl.gov/sites/default/files/2024-04/Queued%20Up%202024%20Edition_1.pdf\">fastest growing source</a> of electricity in the US. </p>\n<p id=\"iz3Jsh\">Polysilicon is used to make solar wafers, which are the semiconductors in solar panels. Tungsten — the same material in old-school incandescent lightbulbs — has many uses in electronics because of its high melting point. The metal is also part of supply chains for the aerospace, automotive, defense, medical, and oil and gas industries.</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"WMMSN2\"><q>That means higher price tags on key materials needed to make solar panels at a time when solar is the fastest growing source of electricity in the US</q></aside></div>\n<p id=\"4aXLjy\">It’s the latest instance of the Biden administration hiking up tariffs on goods from China — which dominates solar manufacturing — as part of its plan to build up domestic supply chains for clean energy. </p>\n<p id=\"uKwvsm\">Solar products from the Xinjiang region in particular also face <a href=\"https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/china-solar-companies-linked-to-forced-labour-allegations/\">accusations of forced labor and human rights abuses</a>. The Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) also said that the decision to raise tariffs follows an investigation into <a href=\"https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/05.14.2024%20Four%20Year%20Review%20of%20China%20Tech%20Transfer%20Section%20301%20(Final).pdf\">cyber theft and economic espionage</a> by China.</p>\n<p id=\"X0rmDV\">“The tariff increases announced today will further blunt the harmful policies and practices by the People’s Republic of China,” ambassador Katherine Tai said in a <a href=\"https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2024/december/ustr-increases-tariffs-under-section-301-tungsten-products-wafers-and-polysilicon-concluding\">statement</a>. “These actions will complement the domestic investments made under the Biden-Harris Administration to promote a clean energy economy, while increasing the resilience of critical supply chains.”</p>\n<p id=\"zziJ1A\">Starting next year, tariffs on polysilicon and solar wafers will <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/china-us-tariffs-tungsten-solar-a9653d4b14051d78314c2bd8111510e7\">double</a> from 25 to 50 percent. Tariffs on certain tungsten products will go <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/china-us-tariffs-tungsten-solar-a9653d4b14051d78314c2bd8111510e7\">from zero</a> to 25 percent. Chinese companies <a href=\"https://cen.acs.org/energy/solar-power/US-solar-polysilicon-supply-problem/100/i33\">produce more than 75 percent of the world’s polysilicon</a>. Considering all the <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/solar-pv-global-supply-chains/executive-summary\">manufacturing stages for solar panels</a>, which includes polysilicon and wafers, China holds <a href=\"https://www.woodmac.com/press-releases/china-dominance-on-global-solar-supply-chain/\">more than 80 percent</a> of global capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"m7plug\">American manufacturers welcomed the changes. “These trade measures will begin to counter the pervasive Chinese government subsidies in solar manufacturing. It is a step in the right direction,” Mike Carr, executive director of the Solar Energy Manufacturers for America (SEMA) Coalition, said in an emailed statement. </p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"LdhoQk\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"What does Trump’s election mean for EVs, Tesla, and Elon Musk? \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289494/trump-election-electric-vehicle-tax-credit-tesla-elon-musk\"},{\"title\":\"What a second Trump presidency means for tech \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/8/24291333/second-trump-tech-policy-antitrust-ai-crypto\"},{\"title\":\"US to raise tariffs on EVs, batteries, solar cells, and computer chips from China \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/14/24156249/us-biden-china-tariffs-ev-solar-battery-semiconductor-critical-minerals\"}]}'></div></aside></div>\n<p id=\"KyVtcs\">To be sure, Chinese policies aimed at boosting solar manufacturing have led to economies of scale that have <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/solar-pv-global-supply-chains/executive-summary\">allowed prices for solar panels to plummet around the world</a>. Chinese companies also make much <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/10/24153830/biden-china-ev-tariff-quadruple-trade\">more affordable electric vehicles</a> than US manufacturers.

Tungsten — the same material in old-school incandescent lightbulbs — has many uses in electronics because of its high melting point. The metal is also part of supply chains for the aerospace, automotive, defense, medical, and oil and gas industries.\nThat means higher price tags on key materials needed to make solar panels at a time when solar is the fastest growing source of electricity in the US\nIt’s the latest instance of the Biden administration hiking up tariffs on goods from China — which dominates solar manufacturing — as part of its plan to build up domestic supply chains for clean energy. \nSolar products from the Xinjiang region in particular also face accusations of forced labor and human rights abuses. The Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) also said that the decision to raise tariffs follows an investigation into cyber theft and economic espionage by China.\n“The tariff increases announced today will further blunt the harmful policies and practices by the People’s Republic of China,” ambassador Katherine Tai said in a statement. “These actions will complement the domestic investments made under the Biden-Harris Administration to promote a clean energy economy, while increasing the resilience of critical supply chains.”\nStarting next year, tariffs on polysilicon and solar wafers will double from 25 to 50 percent. Tariffs on certain tungsten products will go from zero to 25 percent. Chinese companies produce more than 75 percent of the world’s polysilicon. Considering all the manufacturing stages for solar panels, which includes polysilicon and wafers, China holds more than 80 percent of global capacity.\nAmerican manufacturers welcomed the changes. “These trade measures will begin to counter the pervasive Chinese government subsidies in solar manufacturing. It is a step in the right direction,” Mike Carr, executive director of the Solar Energy Manufacturers for America (SEMA) Coalition, said in an emailed statement. \n\n\nTo be sure, Chinese policies aimed at boosting solar manufacturing have led to economies of scale that have allowed prices for solar panels to plummet around the world. Chinese companies also make much more affordable electric vehicles than US manufacturers. EVs from China have been similarly subject to soaring tariffs during the Biden administration to 100 percent from 25 percent this year. In May, Biden also announced that tariffs on battery parts and lithium-ion batteries would rise to 25 percent from 7.5 percent. In addition, he increased the tarifff rate on solar cells from 25 percent to 50 percent. And by 2025, the rate on semiconductors from China will double to 50 percent.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has said he plans to hike tariffs on imported goods from China even more than his predecessor, which is expected to increase prices on everything from cars to electronics.",

Google Glass crashed and burned with the public more than 10 years ago before being <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/20/18632689/google-glass-enterprise-edition-2-augmented-reality-headset-pricing\">repurposed for enterprise users</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/15/23641872/google-glass-enterprise-edition-discontinued-support\">eventually discontinued</a>. But things are different now. Apple has the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24054862/apple-vision-pro-review-vr-ar-headset-features-price\">Vision Pro</a>. Meta has the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23922425/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review\">Ray-Ban smart glasses</a>, and their <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/23/24138090/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-ai-wearables\">AI features</a> have garnered positive buzz. That’s why Google is jumping back into the fray with Android XR.</p>\n<p id=\"CLrByG\">Google wants everyone to know the time is finally right for XR, and<strong> </strong>it’s pointing to Gemini as its north star. Adding Gemini enables multimodal AI and natural language — things it says will make interactions with your environment richer. In a demo, Google had me prompt Gemini to name the title of a yellow book sitting behind me on a shelf. I’d briefly glanced at it earlier but hadn’t taken a photo. Gemini took a second, and then offered up an answer. I whipped around to check — it was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"6xEfYG\">On top of that, the platform will work with any mobile and tablet app from the Play Store out of the box. Today’s launch is aimed at developers so they can start building out experiences. The average person won’t be able to buy anything running Android XR right now, but in 2025, Samsung will be launching its long-rumored XR headset. Dubbed Project Moohan (Korean for infinity), the headset will be the first consumer product to ship with Android XR. Technically, it’s running the same software as the glasses I tried, but Project Moohan will also be capable of VR and immersive content — stuff that wouldn’t be suited to a pair of smart glasses. It’s essentially a showcase for everything that <em>could</em> be possible. Hence why Google is going with XR — a catch-all term that stands for “extended reality” and encompasses AR, VR, and mixed reality.</p>\n<div class=\"c-wide-block\">\n<figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"Render of Project Moohan\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1MY6-5d8W4L5s0McaHf8XBaZ_TY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25786842/Project_Moohan_Side.jpg\">\n      <cite>Image: Google, Samsung</cite>\n      <figcaption><em>Project Moohan felt like a mix between a Meta Quest 3 and Vision Pro headset.</em></figcaption>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n<p id=\"DXEkHC\">Samsung’s headset feels like a mix between a Meta Quest 3 and the Vision Pro.

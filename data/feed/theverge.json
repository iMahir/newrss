(It won’t work with old ones.) Here’s how, <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/google-labs/notebooklm-new-features-december-2024/\">according to a blog post</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"Xo3rtx\">Create a new Audio Overview.</p>\n<p id=\"KVWkxE\">Tap the new Interactive mode (BETA) button.</p>\n<p id=\"ipusmC\">While listening, tap “Join.” A host will call on you.</p>\n<p id=\"IC7isI\">Ask your question. The hosts will respond with a personalized answer based on your sources.</p>\n<p id=\"VGbWlq\">After answering, they’ll resume the original Audio Overview.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"32XpIu\">The ability to actually talk with NotebookLM seems like a potentially useful way to learn more about what you’ve collected in the app. But Google cautions that it’s an “experimental feature” and that “hosts may also pause awkwardly before responding or occasionally introduce inaccuracies,” so it may not be a totally polished experience to start. </p>\n<p id=\"rcczNm\">In addition to the interactive Audio Overviews, Google is introducing a new interface for NotebookLM that organizes things into three areas: a “sources” panel for your information, a “chat” panel to talk with an AI chatbot about the sources, and a “studio” panel that lets you make things like Audio Overviews and Study Guides.

That very cool-looking <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24226288/the-lord-of-the-rings-war-of-the-rohirrim-anime-trailer\"><em>Lord of the Rings</em> anime</a> hits US theaters on the 13th; <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24228966/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-trailer-keanu-reeves\">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a> follows on the 20th; and I’m deeply excited to see <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/2/24311195/thank-goodness-robert-eggers-saw-nosferatu-1922-on-a-bootlegged-vhs\"><em>Nosferatu</em></a> on December 25th. (If you’re not with me on that last one, give Matt Zoller Seitz’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/13/24295480/y2slay\">RogerEbert.com review</a> of it a read and get back to me.)</p>\n<p id=\"iopXfc\">While I’m waiting to go be unnerved by Robert Eggers’ new spooky vampire movie, let’s take a look at some good trailers from the last week. </p>\n<h2 id=\"crZLiJ\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/7/24315722/star-trek-section-31-official-movie-trailer-michelle-yeoh-paramount-plus-streaming\">Star Trek: Section 31</a></h2>\n<div id=\"QCPjxq\"><div style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/63k1Otp9qtM?rel=0\" style=\"top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;\"></iframe></div></div>\n<p id=\"lDd5YR\">I’ll admit that the biggest appeal for me about this straight-to-streaming spy movie spinoff of <em>Star Trek: Discovery</em> is Michelle Yeoh as Emperor Philippa Georgiou. She’s just having so much <em>fun</em> in this trailer. The trailers haven’t revealed yet what threat she’ll be facing, other than being forced to do teamwork, but it seems like it’ll be pretty heavy on the rag-tag team of antiheroes action thing.</p>\n<p id=\"4N6mx8\">The Olatunde Osunsanmi-directed movie also stars Omari Hardwick, Kacey Rohl, Sven Ruygrok, Humberly Gonzalez, Rob Kazinsky, and Sam Richardson. It premieres on Paramount Plus starting January 24th.</p>\n<h2 id=\"vBMz5J\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/7/24314837/severance-season-2-trailer-goats-apple-tv-plus\">Severance</a></h2>\n<div id=\"DPw7N5\"><div style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_UXKlYvLGJY?rel=0\" style=\"top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;\"></iframe></div></div>\n<p id=\"QCkxq9\">I was late to the <em>Severance </em>party, having finally finished it a few months ago, so I can only imagine how eager people who saw its cliffhanger ending have been to see the story continue. Well, the second season of creator Dan Erickson’s bizarro sci-fi drama is almost here, and it looks like it’s probably going to bring answers, with even more mystery heaped on top of it. </p>\n<p id=\"9BLP7z\">All of the first season’s main characters, including Mark (Adam Scott), Dylan (Zach Cherry), Helly (Britt Lower), and Irving (John Turturro) are returning, and they’ll be joined by characters played by the likes of Alia Shawkat, Gwendoline Christie, and Bob Balaban. Season two of <em>Severance</em> premieres January 17th on Apple TV Plus.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dkyCkN\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/8/24316383/invincible-season-3-trailer-amazon-prime-video\">Invincible</a></h2>\n<div id=\"z9gD82\"><div style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rbHUhCcSXEM?rel=0\" style=\"top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;\"></iframe></div></div>\n<p id=\"5iv07T\">The third season of <em>Invincible</em> will see a stronger, older Mark Grayson (Steven Yeun) tell off GDA director Cecil Stedman (Walton Goggins) and episodes that show creator Robert Kirkman hopes will each feel like a finale. And there’s no season break this time around.</p>\n<p id=\"s8a1Iu\">The show debuts with three episodes February 6th on Amazon Prime, with new episodes releasing every Thursday after until March 13th.</p>\n<h2 id=\"IBLEie\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/8/24316339/wheel-of-time-season-3-streaming-premiere-amazon-prime-trailer-release-date\">The Wheel of Time</a></h2>\n<div id=\"vvcKHt\"><div style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/erxeLAg85fg?rel=0\" style=\"top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;\"></iframe></div></div>\n<p id=\"LOmNiw\"><em>The Wheel of Time</em> continues its retelling of the Robert Jordan fantasy epic on March 13th next year. In its third season, the show follows Joshua Stradowski’s Rand al’Thor — the “Dragon Reborn” — and Moiraine Damodred (Rosamund Pike) as they go into the Aiel Waste. It’s been more than two decades since I read the book series, so I couldn’t spoil what happens there for you if I wanted to, but I seem to recall this was a fairly dark time in the series. </p>\n<h2 id=\"sAhqs7\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/7/24315769/whats-in-the-gorge-stays-in-the-gorge\">The Gorge</a></h2>\n<div id=\"L97o1w\"><div style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rUSdnuOLebE?rel=0\" style=\"top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;\"></iframe></div></div>\n<p id=\"NoVTgP\">Who knows what evil is in <em>The Gorge</em>’s, uh, gorge, but it’s apparently contained well enough that humanity only needs two snipers — who aren’t allowed to interact with each other — stationed on either side of it to make sure it stays there.

    "summary": "Michelle Yeoh in Star Trek: Section 31. | Image: Paramount Plus\n    \n\n  \nIt’s the first week of December, and the end of the year is coming in fast and with a lot to look forward to at theaters this month. That very cool-looking Lord of the Rings anime hits US theaters on the 13th; Sonic the Hedgehog 3 follows on the 20th; and I’m deeply excited to see Nosferatu on December 25th. (If you’re not with me on that last one, give Matt Zoller Seitz’s RogerEbert.com review of it a read and get back to me.)\nWhile I’m waiting to go be unnerved by Robert Eggers’ new spooky vampire movie, let’s take a look at some good trailers from the last week. \nStar Trek: Section 31\n\n\nI’ll admit that the biggest appeal for me about this straight-to-streaming spy movie spinoff of Star Trek: Discovery is Michelle Yeoh as Emperor Philippa Georgiou. She’s just having so much fun in this trailer. The trailers haven’t revealed yet what threat she’ll be facing, other than being forced to do teamwork, but it seems like it’ll be pretty heavy on the rag-tag team of antiheroes action thing.\nThe Olatunde Osunsanmi-directed movie also stars Omari Hardwick, Kacey Rohl, Sven Ruygrok, Humberly Gonzalez, Rob Kazinsky, and Sam Richardson. It premieres on Paramount Plus starting January 24th.\nSeverance\n\n\nI was late to the Severance party, having finally finished it a few months ago, so I can only imagine how eager people who saw its cliffhanger ending have been to see the story continue. Well, the second season of creator Dan Erickson’s bizarro sci-fi drama is almost here, and it looks like it’s probably going to bring answers, with even more mystery heaped on top of it. \nAll of the first season’s main characters, including Mark (Adam Scott), Dylan (Zach Cherry), Helly (Britt Lower), and Irving (John Turturro) are returning, and they’ll be joined by characters played by the likes of Alia Shawkat, Gwendoline Christie, and Bob Balaban. Season two of Severance premieres January 17th on Apple TV Plus.\nInvincible\n\n\nThe third season of Invincible will see a stronger, older Mark Grayson (Steven Yeun) tell off GDA director Cecil Stedman (Walton Goggins) and episodes that show creator Robert Kirkman hopes will each feel like a finale. And there’s no season break this time around.\nThe show debuts with three episodes February 6th on Amazon Prime, with new episodes releasing every Thursday after until March 13th.\nThe Wheel of Time\n\n\nThe Wheel of Time continues its retelling of the Robert Jordan fantasy epic on March 13th next year. In its third season, the show follows Joshua Stradowski’s Rand al’Thor — the “Dragon Reborn” — and Moiraine Damodred (Rosamund Pike) as they go into the Aiel Waste. It’s been more than two decades since I read the book series, so I couldn’t spoil what happens there for you if I wanted to, but I seem to recall this was a fairly dark time in the series. \nThe Gorge\n\n\nWho knows what evil is in The Gorge’s, uh, gorge, but it’s apparently contained well enough that humanity only needs two snipers — who aren’t allowed to interact with each other — stationed on either side of it to make sure it stays there. The snipers, Levi (Miles Teller) and Drasa (Anya Taylor-Joy), do interact and fall for eachother, then end up in the gorge. Oops! \nScott Derrickson directs the movie, which also stars Sigourney Weaver, Sope Dirisu, and William Houston. It premieres February 14th on Apple TV Plus.\nMobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX\n\n\nGiant robot anime fans rejoice: there’s a new Mobile Suit Gundam coming next year. It’s called Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX, and it’s produced by Khara, the studio behind the Rebuild of Evangelion films.\nThe weird name references a Gundam called the gMS-Ω GQuuuuuuX. The show will follow a highschooler — named Yuzuriha “Machu” Amate (Tomoyo Kurosawa) — who learns to co-pilot the building-sized, sword-wielding robot with pilot Shuji Ito (Shimba Tsuchiya).

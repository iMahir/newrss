    "content": "Derived from renewable resources such as biomass and agricultural waste, biofuels provide a cleaner alternative to conventional fossil fuels in our energy palettes, for meeting needs, whether it is surface mobility, aviation, shipping, or even power production. Today, it is possible to leverage bioenergy to fuel each of these energy needs and that also with lower permanent emissions. India has achieved an avoidance of as much as 1.5 tonnes of GHG emissions per kilolitre of bio-ethanol replacing petrol in our cars, amounting to more than 40 million tonnes of savings in GHG emissions over the last decade.",

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump, the former US president and presumptive presidential nominee of the Republican Party, has attacked Vice President Kamala Harris, raising questions on her competence and describing her as an "insurance policy" for incumbent President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>His attack against Kamala Harris, who is of Indian and African heritage, came amid chatter in the Democratic Party about whether President Biden should remain the nominee in the November 5 presidential election.</p>

<p>Joe Biden, 81, has faced calls from some Democrats to step aside as the nominee following his disastrous performance during a June 27 debate with Trump in which he struggled to complete sentences or land any significant blows against his opponent.</p>

<p>"Whatever else can be said about crooked Joe Biden, you have to give him credit for one brilliant decision, probably the smartest decision he ever made. He picked Kamala Harris as his vice president. No, it was brilliant. Because it was an insurance policy. Maybe the best insurance policy I've ever seen," Donald Trump, 78, told his supporters in Florida.</p>

<p>"If Joe had picked someone even halfway competent, they would have bounced him from office years ago, but they can't because she's gotta be their second choice," he said as he repeatedly mispronounced her name.</p>

<p>Trump said as vice president, Harris was given two very important tasks - border security and to deter Russia from attacking Ukraine.</p>

<p>"First, she was put in charge of the U.S. border security. She never showed up. She's never gone. She never went there once. And the border is the worst border in the history of the world," he alleged.</p>

<p>"We have the best border in history because she has the worst border in the history of the world. Then, she was sent to Europe to deter Russia from attacking Ukraine. How did that work out? Not too good. Both times, the result was a deadly failure. Since Kamala was made border czar, the Biden-Harris administration has lost track of an estimated 150,000 children, many of whom have undoubtedly been raped, trafficked, killed, or horribly abused," Trump said.</p>

<p>Trump accused Harris, 59, of being a socialist.</p>

<p>"I don't think Kamala Harris' California socialism is going to go down well with the people of Doral, the people of Miami, or the people of Florida. Because in Florida, we don't like socialism. We want our freedom, right? We want our freedom," he said.</p>

<p>"Joe, Kamala and the entire Democrat establishment have been caught red-handed in the thick of the biggest scandal and the biggest coverup…it's a cover-up. It's the biggest cover-up in political history. As you know, they are all co-conspirators in the sinister plot to defraud the American public about the cognitive abilities of the man in the Oval Office," alleged Trump.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Any night now, a “new star” or nova will appear in the night sky. While it won't set the sky ablaze, it's a special opportunity to see a rare event that's usually difficult to predict in advance.</p>

<p>The star in question is T Coronae Borealis (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13668">T CrB</a>, pronounced “T Cor Bor”). It lies in the constellation of the <a href="https://earthsky.org/tonight/corona-borealis-the-northern-crown-2/">northern crown</a>, prominent in the Northern Hemisphere but also visible in the northern sky from Australia and Aotearoa New Zealand over the next few months.</p>

<p>Most of the time T CrB, which is 3,000 light years away, is much too faint to be seen. But once every 80 years or so, it brightly erupts.</p>

<p>A brand new star suddenly seems to appear, although not for long. Just a few nights later it will have rapidly faded, disappearing back into the darkness.</p>

<h2>A burst of life</h2>

<p>During the prime of their lives, stars are powered by nuclear fusion reactions deep inside their cores. Most commonly, hydrogen is turned into helium creating enough energy to keep the star stable and shining for billions of years.</p>

<p>But T CrB is well past its prime and is now a stellar remnant known as a <a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/white-dwarf/">white dwarf</a>. Its internal nuclear fire has been quenched, allowing gravity to dramatically compress the dead star.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="A white dwarf is about the same size as Earth but around 300,000 times more massive, generating a mighty gravitational field. ESA/NASA." id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-07/0up7bk4o_white-dwarf-esanasa_625x300_10_July_24.jpg" title="A white dwarf is about the same size as Earth but around 300,000 times more massive, generating a mighty gravitational field. ESA/NASA." /></div>

</div>

<p>T CrB also has a stellar companion – a red giant that has puffed up as it enters old age. The white dwarf mops up the swollen red giant's gas, and this forms what's known as an accretion disc around the dead star.</p>

<p>The matter keeps piling up on a star that's already compressed to its limit, forcing a continual rise in pressure and temperature. Conditions become so extreme, they mimic what once would've been found inside the star's core. Its surface ignites in a runaway thermonuclear reaction.</p>

<p>When this happens, the energy released makes T CrB shine 1,500 times brighter than usual. Here on Earth, it briefly appears in the night sky. With this dramatic reset, the star has then expelled the gas and the cycle can begin all over again.</p>

</figure>

<h2>How do we know it's due?</h2>

<p>T CrB is the brightest of a rare class of <a href="https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2013IAUS..281..154A">recurrent novae</a> that repeat within a hundred years – a time scale that allows astronomers to detect their recurrent nature.</p>

<p>Only ten recurrent novae are currently known, although more novae may be recurrent – just on much greater timescales that aren't as easily tracked.</p>

<p>The earliest known date of T CrB erupting is from the year 1217, based on observations recorded in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13668">medieval monastic chronicle</a>. It's remarkable that astronomers can now predict its eruptions so precisely as long as the nova follows its usual pattern.</p>

<p>The star's two most recent eruptions – in 1866 and 1946 – showed the exact same features. About ten years prior to the eruption, T CrB's brightness increased a little (known as a high state) followed by a short fading or dip about a year out from the explosion.</p>

<p>T CrB entered its high state in 2015 and the pre-eruption dip was spotted in March 2023, setting astronomers on alert. What causes these phenomena are just some of the current mysteries surrounding T CrB.</p>

<h2>How can I see it?</h2>

<p>Start stargazing now! It's a good idea to get used to seeing <a href="https://earthsky.org/tonight/corona-borealis-the-northern-crown-2/">Corona Borealis</a> as it is now, so that you get the full impact of the “new” star.</p>

<p>Corona Borealis currently reaches its best observing position (known as a <a href="https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/M/Meridian+Transit">meridian transit</a>) around 8:30pm to 9pm local time across Australia and Aotearoa. The farther north you are located, the higher the constellation will be in the sky.</p>

</div>

<p>The nova is expected to be a reasonable brightness (magnitude 2.5): about as bright as Imai (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Crucis">Delta Crucis</a>), the fourth brightest star in the <a href="https://earthsky.org/constellations/crux-the-southern-cross-jewel-box/">Southern Cross</a>. So it will be easy to see even from a city location, if you know where to look.</p>

</div>

<h2>We won't have much time</h2>

<p>We won't have long once it goes off. The maximum brightness will only last a few hours; within a week T CrB will have faded and you'll need binoculars to see it.</p>

<p>It almost certainly will be an amateur astronomer that alerts the professional community to the moment when T CrB outbursts.</p>

<p>These dedicated and knowledgeable people routinely monitor stars from their backyards on the chance of “what if” and therefore fill an important gap in night sky observations.</p>

<p>The American Association of Variable Star Observing (<a href="https://www.aavso.org/">AAVSO</a>) has a log of over 270,000 submitted observations on T CrB alone. Amateur astronomers are collaborating here and around the world to continually monitor T CrB for the first signs of eruption.</p>

<p>Hopefully the nova will erupt as expected sometime before October, because after that Corona Borealis leaves our evening sky in the Southern Hemisphere.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anyone expecting Joe Biden to step aside from the US presidential race without a fight had not fully considered the life story of a proud but often stubborn man.</p>

<p>From playground punch-ups to terrible tragedies and multiple White House bids, Biden has long seen his life as a series of comebacks against impossible odds.</p>

<p>And as a Democratic revolt over his debate debacle against Donald Trump appears to sputter for now, the 81-year-old seems determined to win the fight of his political life.</p>

<p>Unless a major shift occurs, it will likely fall to US voters to decide whether Biden stages another turnup for the books -- or whether hubris condemns him and his party to a historic defeat by Trump.</p>

<p>Biden has repeatedly returned to the image of himself as an underdog since the debate, repeating his family's mantra that "when you get knocked down, you get back up."</p>

<p>"What we've seen the last 10 to 12 days is certainly fundamental to the Joe Biden story," his spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre said from the White House podium on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"He is someone that is certainly counted out many, many times in his career. People tend to knock him down, and you hear him say he gets back up.</p>

<p>"This is the story of him standing up for himself, standing up for millions of Americans."</p>

<h3><strong>'Punch the guy'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>That outlook was formed by a hardscrabble childhood in the American rust-belt, as part of a close-knit Irish Catholic family known for its intense pride.</p>

<p>His mother Jean told the young Joey and his siblings every day that "nobody was better than a Biden," Ben Cramer wrote in his book "What It Takes," about the 1988 US election campaign.</p>

<p>He was also known for never backing down.</p>

<p>"Most guys who got into a fight, they'd square off... Joey didn't do that," Cramer wrote. "He decided to fight... BANGO -- he'd punch the guy in the face."</p>

<p>One affliction Biden famously had to battle was a childhood stutter.</p>

<p>Repeatedly humiliated at school, the young Biden ended up teaching himself how to speak smoothly by sheer determination, repeating phrases again and again into the mirror.</p>

<p>But Biden's biggest test was yet to come.</p>

<p>In 1972, he was only 29 and had just been elected senator for Delaware when his wife Neilia and their one-year-old daughter Naomi were killed in a car crash, while their young sons Beau and Hunter were left badly injured.</p>

<p>Tragedy struck again in 2015 when Beau died of brain cancer aged 46.</p>

<p>Biden also had to deal with the agony of Hunter's severe drug addiction and legal problems.</p>

<p>"Sometimes I marvel at Joe's strength. His life has been marked by cruel losses," First Lady Jill Biden, whom Biden married in 1977, said in her memoir "Where the Light Enters."</p>

<p><strong>'Psychological prison'&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>With his family close around him, Biden has also ridden out a series of political humiliations.</p>

<p>In 1988 he was forced to abandon his first presidential bid following a plagiarism scandal.</p>

<p>His next bid in 2008 ended in heavy defeat in the Democratic primaries, before Barack Obama picked him as his running mate.</p>

<p>Yet in the current crisis over Biden's age and health, the very things that have previously brought Biden strength could also bring about his downfall.</p>

<p>It's common knowledge that he will only really listen to family members and a few aides he's known for decades, but as he ages that bubble has become increasingly insular.</p>

<p>His long-standing belief that he's been underestimated and mocked by the media means he's even less likely to listen to outside voices.</p>

<p>Moreover, Biden's lifelong image as someone who always bounces back means he may not be able to envisage a graceful exit this time around.</p>

<p>Franklin Foer, author of a book on the early Biden presidency, wrote recently in The Atlantic magazine that "humiliation -- and its transcendence -- is Biden's origin story."</p>

<p>"Right now it is his psychological prison, a mental habit that might doom American democracy."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The unusual condition was proposed by an attorney representing Anthony Borges, 21, who was shot five times during the attack.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nikolas Cruz, the Florida mass shooter, has agreed to donate his brain to science as part of a "unique" civil settlement with one of his victims, according to court documents and experts. Cruz used an AR-15 assault rifle to kill 17 students and staff members at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland on February 14, 2018, one of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The unusual condition was proposed by an attorney representing Anthony Borges, 21, who was shot five times during the attack, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/09/us-news/parkland-shooter-nikolas-cruz-agrees-to-donate-his-brain-to-science-in-shocking-settlement/"><em>New York Post</em></a> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I figured if scientists studied his brain they might be able to figure out what created this monster," Borges' lawyer, Alex Arreaza, told<em> Fox News Digital.</em> "Maybe there was some kind of imbalance that caused this that we can prevent in the future."</p>

<p>Scott Herndon, a Berkeley-based attorney who has represented victims of mass shootings, described the settlement as unprecedented.</p>

<p>"I've never heard of anything like this before. It's pretty unique," he told Fox News Digital. "It underscores the feeling of those left behind that whatever can be done to avoid these massacres in the future should be done."</p>

<p>The new settlement agreement also grants Borges the right to use Cruz's name in movies, books, and other media. The 25-year-old murderer, currently serving a life sentence, is prohibited from profiting from his crime and must obtain Borges' permission before participating in any interviews.</p>

<p>"We didn't want him to be able to continue torturing the families," said Arreaza, referencing O.J. Simpson's book "If I Did It" as a cautionary tale.</p>

<p>Herndon mentioned that it is not unusual for a perpetrator to give up the rights to their name as part of a settlement. The agreement was finalized during a Zoom meeting involving Borges' father, Rory Borges, Cruz, and Arreaza. Anthony Borges, who is dealing with PTSD, did not feel comfortable participating in the discussions, according to Arreaza.</p>

<p>"You could see what a psychopath he is," Arreaza noted. "He looked at Rory when we were all done and asked if he could apologize, and Nikolas apologized to him like they had been in a car accident together. It was just very cold and weird."</p>

<p>At 15, Borges was among the 17 victims who narrowly survived the brutal attack. He used his body to barricade a door, preventing Cruz from entering the classroom where he and other terrified students were hiding.</p>

<p>The former promising soccer player sustained severe injuries to his legs and torso, requiring over a dozen surgeries.</p>

<p>The settlement also allocates $430,000 to Anthony Borges, which Cruz is expected to receive from a relative's life insurance policy.</p>

<p>Previously, the Broward County Public School District paid $26 million to the victims of the shooting, with $1.25 million going to Borges. Additionally, Borges received an undisclosed settlement from the FBI for their failure to prevent Cruz's rampage.</p>

<p>Borges, along with other victims, has pending lawsuits against School Resource Officer Scot Peterson and the Broward County Sheriff's Office, the New York Post reported.</p>

<p>The shooting continues to haunt the young man, who's happy the site of the massacre is being torn down. "Every time he drove by there, it brought back memories," Arreaza told the media outlet.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden on Tuesday announced a historic donation of air-defence equipment for Ukraine and said Russia is failing in this war.</p>

<p>Welcoming leaders of NATO member countries for the historic summit on the occasion of its 75th anniversary, Biden said the United States, Germany, the Netherlands, Romania and Italy will provide Ukraine with the equipment for five additional strategic air-defence systems.</p>

<p>In the coming months, the US and its partners intend to provide Ukraine with dozens of additional tactical air-defence systems, he said, adding that the US will make sure that when "we export critical air-defence interceptors, Ukraine goes to the front of the line".</p>

<p>"They will get this assistance before anyone else gets it. All told, Ukraine will receive hundreds of additional interceptors over the next year, helping protect Ukrainian cities against Russian missile and Ukrainian troops facing air attacks on their front lines," Biden said.</p>

<p>"Make no mistake, Russia is failing in this war.&nbsp; More than two years into (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's war of choice, his losses are staggering. More than 350,000 Russian troops dead or wounded, nearly one million (10 lakh) Russians, many of them young people, have left Russia because they no longer see a future in Russia," he said.</p>

<p>"Kiev, remember fellas and ladies, was supposed to fall in five days? Remember? Well, it is still standing two and a half years later and will continue to stand. All of the allies knew that before this war, Putin thought NATO would break. Today, NATO is stronger than it has ever been in its history. When this senseless war began, Ukraine was a free country. Today, it is still a free country," the US president said.</p>

<p>Reiterating that Putin's war of aggression against Ukraine continues, he said the Russian president wants nothing less than Ukraine's total subjugation to end that country's democracy, to destroy its culture and to wipe it off the map.</p>

<p>"We know Putin will not stop at Ukraine, but make no mistake, Ukraine can and will stop Putin," Biden said.</p>

<p>He said the war will end with Ukraine remaining a free and independent country. "Russia will not prevail. Ukraine will prevail. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a pivotal moment for Europe, for the transatlantic community and I might add, for the world. Let us remember, the fact that NATO remains the bulwark of global security did not happen by accident," he said.</p>

<p>"NATO is stronger, smarter and more energised than when you began. And a billion people across Europe or North America, indeed the whole world, will reap the rewards of your labour for years to come in the form of security, opportunity and greater freedom," the president said.</p>

<p>In his remarks, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said there are no cost-free options with an aggressive Russia as a neighbour.</p>

<p>"There are no risk-free options in a war. And remember -- the biggest cost and the greatest risk will be if Russia wins in Ukraine. We cannot let that happen. Not only would it embolden President Putin, it would also embolden other authoritarian leaders in Iran, North Korea and China," he said.</p>

<p>He acknowledged that NATO's enduring success has never been a given, but is rather "the result of deliberate choices and difficult decisions" -- from the alliance's creation to arms control negotiations, and from NATO's enlargement at the end of the Cold War to its support to Ukraine today.</p>

<p>"The time to stand for freedom and democracy is now, the place is Ukraine," he said.</p>

<p>Stoltenberg concluded by saying that the alliance will continue to face difficult questions in the future, but that "we are stronger and safer together in NATO".</p>

<p>Biden presented Stoltenberg with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the United States' highest civilian honour, in recognition of his decade of service at the helm of the alliance.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina arrived here on Tuesday on a four-day visit for talks with China's top leadership, including President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Qiang to further cement the bilateral strategic ties.</p>

<p>In her separate meetings with Xi and Li on Wednesday, the entire gamut of the bilateral relations alongside the regional and international matters will come for discussion, the official BSS news agency reported.</p>

<p>This visit of the Bangladesh premier to China is taking place within 15 days after her last visit to India from June 21 to 22, the Bangladeshi news agency reported.</p>

<p>Hasina had her last discussions with President Xi in a recent meeting on the sidelines of the 15th BRICS Summit in Johannesburg, South Africa.</p>

<p>Hasina will also hold a delegation-level bilateral meeting with her Chinese counterpart Li Qiang at the Great Hall of the People. Following the meeting, Bangladesh and China are likely to sign and renew 20 to 22 Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs), the report said.</p>

<p>"The MoUs on cooperation in the economic and banking sector, trade and investment, digital economy, infrastructure development, assistance in disaster management, construction of 6th and 9th Bangladesh-China friendship bridges, export of agricultural products from Bangladesh and people to people connectivity are likely to be signed," Foreign Minister Dr Hasan Mahmud said on Sunday at a curtain raiser press conference at the Foreign Ministry in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>During the visit, Dr Hasan said the inauguration of several projects of the two countries will also be announced.</p>

<p>The issues like Rohingya, and cooperation on business, trade, commerce and development will dominate the discussions.</p>

<p>This is Hasina's fourth visit to China and the trip is expected to elevate the relations between Bangladesh and China to "comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership" from "strategic partnership", the report said.</p>

<p>The two countries would celebrate the golden jubilee of their diplomatic relations next year.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, China's top political advisor Wang Huning met with Prime Minister Hasina on Tuesday in Beijing.</p>

<p>Wang, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said that under the strategic guidance of the two countries' leaders, China and Bangladesh have respected and treated each other with equality, setting a good example of friendly coexistence and mutually beneficial cooperation between countries.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian American Republican leader Nikki Haley on Tuesday released the several dozen delegates she had won during the party's presidential primaries early this year for the presumptive nominee, Donald Trump.</p>

<p>The move by Haley comes ahead of the Republican National Convention (RNC) in Milwaukee, Wisconsin wherein Trump would formally be nominated as the party's presidential candidate for the November 5 general election.</p>

<p>"The nominating convention is a time for Republican unity. Joe Biden is not competent to serve a second term and Kamala Harris would be a disaster for America. We need a president who will hold our enemies to account, secure our border, cut our debt and get our economy back on track. I encourage my delegates to support Donald Trump next week in Milwaukee," Haley said in a statement.</p>

<p>Haley had won 97 delegates, as against Biden's 2,265. A candidate needs 1,215 delegates to win the GOP's presidential nomination. She had suspended her campaign in March.</p>

<p>The former US ambassador to the United Nations and South Carolina governor is not attending the RNC.</p>

<p>"She was not invited and she is fine with that. Trump deserves the convention he wants. She has made it clear she is voting for him and wishes him the best," Haley's spokesperson Chaney Denton said.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oleh Holubchenko's team was in the middle of surgery on five-month-old Taras when an explosive wave sent the medics flying across the room.</p>

<p>Shards of glass tore into Holubchenko's back and his colleague Ihor Kolodka's face. The baby remained in place on the table, surrounded by shattered equipment and five bleeding adults.</p>

<p>"Is everyone alive?" Holubchenko recalls shouting.</p>

<p>Anaesthesiologist Yaroslav Ivanov grabbed the manual resuscitator to keep the baby breathing after the ventilator broke. Worried the ceiling would collapse, some members of the team ran to the basement with Taras.</p>

<p>These were the dramatic moments after a missile struck Okhmatdyt Children's Hospital in central Kyiv on Monday, an assault that shocked Ukrainians and prompted angry condemnation from Kyiv and its Western allies.</p>

<p>The U.N. said on Tuesday there was a "high likelihood" the hospital took a direct hit from a Russian missile during a series of airstrikes on Ukrainian cities that have killed at least 44 people. The Kremlin has said, without providing evidence, that it was Ukrainian anti-missile fire, not Russia, that hit the hospital, large parts of which were reduced to rubble.</p>

<p>Two adults were killed at Okhmatdyt and dozens were wounded. Many patients, relatives and staff had fled to basements in time to avoid the worst of the blast.</p>

<p>"For me, Okhmatdyt was the safest place for kids and adults. On that day, I realized there are no safe spaces left anywhere," Ivanov, 39, told Reuters over the telephone on Tuesday as he recovered from concussion and cuts.</p>

<p>When they reached the basement, Ivanov and his colleagues found a room free of smoke and away from the screams of the injured.</p>

<p>There they brought the baby back to consciousness and handed him over to a team of doctors to continue the surgery at another hospital.</p>

<h3><strong>STRAIGHT BACK TO WORK</strong></h3>

<p>As Holubchenko and Ivanov took care of Taras, Kolodka took out shards of glass from his face and then rushed outside to see how he could help. He saw that the toxicology department had been flattened.</p>

<p>"Since I was not bleeding anymore, I went outside to keep helping the injured and deal with the aftermath of the missile strike," Kolodka said.</p>

<p>"In the moment, we didn't think about whether it was easy or difficult - we were just doing our job and trying to help."</p>

<p>After helping rescue workers and soldiers sift through the rubble for the rest of the day in the dust and heat, he returned home to find there was no power. Electricity outages are now common across the country as Russia targets the energy system.</p>

<p>Kolodka woke up at 5 a.m. to take a shower before heading back to work. Holubchenko also returned to the hospital on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"I had to go because there was a meeting with colleagues, to see what was happening with the department and check all the equipment," Holubchenko said. "I ... connected with colleagues from the other hospital to ask about the state of the baby."</p>

<p>Taras was doing fine after his surgery, he was told.</p>

<p>The team was heartened by support and gratitude from patients and the broader community as they battled exhaustion.</p>

<p>Work to repair the hospital was underway within hours of the blast as hundreds of volunteers joined the effort to clear broken glass, rubble and damaged equipment.</p>

<p>"It is nice to see how united our people are," said Kolodka.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Canadian government is being sued for allegedly violating migrants' rights by detaining them alongside criminal suspects while awaiting processing of their status, lawyers for the migrants said Tuesday.</p>

<p>One of the migrants described his time in detention as a "living hell." Another described a traumatic atmosphere in prison, with drug use and fights among inmates.</p>

<p>Migrants were at times shackled and subjected to strip searches, the lawyers said.</p>

<p>"Immigration detention is administrative detention and should not be punitive in nature," said the plaintiffs' lawyers, who are seeking C$100 million ($73.4 million) in damages.</p>

<p>These allegations of harsh treatment are contained in a ruling handed down Friday by the Superior Court of Ontario province, which authorized a class action suit by 8,360 people detained by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) between 2016 and 2023 in 87 prisons.</p>

<p>Foreign nationals -- including asylum seekers -- who were not accused of a crime "encountered the same conditions as criminal inmates, including co-mingling with violent offenders, use of restraints such as shackles and handcuffs, strip searches, and severe restrictions on contact and movement," wrote Justice Benjamin Glustein.</p>

<p>Border agents can detain migrants if there is fear that they will not show up for an immigration hearing, if their identity is in doubt or if they pose a danger to public safety.</p>

<p>But having them held in provincial jails instead of immigration facilities violates their rights, the lawsuit claims.</p>

<p>One party to the suit with the surname Garcia Paez, who was incarcerated for 13 days in 2021, described his time in jail in a sworn statement as traumatic, with a violent atmosphere, drug use and physical assaults involving other detainees.</p>

<p>The Canadian government, which can still appeal, has said it has not yet decided its next step.</p>

<p>"It was important to me to bring this lawsuit not just for myself but for the thousands of other immigration detainees who, like me, were incarcerated in provincial prisons and treated as if they were criminals despite not even being accused of a crime," said another of the plaintiffs, Tyron Richard.</p>

<p>"I felt an overwhelming sense of helplessness during the 18 months I spent in a maximum-security prison. It was a living hell. I am proud that I am now able to stand up and fight back."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Europe's new Ariane 6 rocket successfully blasted off for the first time on Tuesday, releasing satellites into orbit and restoring the continent's independent access to space.</p>

<p>European space efforts have suffered a series of blows, including four years of delays to Ariane 6, that have robbed the continent of its own way to launch missions into space for the past year. But with the successful inaugural flight of Europe's most powerful rocket yet, European space chiefs were keen to move on from recent setbacks.</p>

<p>"It's a historic day for Europe," European Space Agency head Josef Aschbacher said.</p>

<p>"Europe is back," announced Philippe Baptiste, head of France's CNES space agency.</p>

<p>Surrounded by jungle on the South American coast, the rocket launched from Europe's spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana at 4 pm local time (1900 GMT).</p>

<p>Initially delayed for an hour by a small problem that was noticed in the morning, the rocket lifted off into clear skies.</p>

<p>The mission faced a slight setback as the rocket deviated from its trajectory towards the end of the flight, failing to carry out its planned re-entry into the earth's atmosphere and landing in the Pacific.</p>

<p>But that did not dampen the spirits of European space chiefs, whose objective was to put satellites into orbit.</p>

<p>"It's a great success despite the slight disappointment" at the end, said Walther Pelzer, head of Germany's DLR space agency.</p>

<h3><strong>'Not yet complete'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The crew in the Jupiter control room, located 17 kilometres (10 miles) from the launch site, portrayed calm at first.</p>

<p>Then head of operations Raymond Boyce announced "propulsion nominal", meaning that the launch was going as planned.</p>

<p>Applause rang out in the room.</p>

<p>Even louder applause came a little over an hour later when the rocket successfully delivered microsatellites into orbit.</p>

<p>NASA chief Bill Nelson on X welcomed the "giant leap forward" for the ESA.</p>

<p>But Martin Sion, the CEO of the rocket's manufacturer ArianeGroup, emphasised that "the mission is not yet complete".</p>

<p>It will only be fully completed when the reusable Vinci engine in the rocket's upper stage has fallen back into Earth's atmosphere.</p>

<p>That was expected around three hours after liftoff.</p>

<h3><strong>'Magical'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>When it launched, Ariane 6 carried with it the hopes of European sovereignty in space.</p>

<p>Since the last flight of its workhorse predecessor, Ariane 5, a year ago, Europe has had to rely on rivals such as Elon Musk's US firm SpaceX.</p>

<p>Selected by the ESA back in 2014, Ariane 6 will able to place satellites in geostationary orbit 36,000 kilometres above Earth, as well as satellite constellations a few hundred kilometres up.</p>

<p>The first flight was carrying a payload of university microsatellites, various experiments and two atmospheric re-entry capsules that will be jettisoned near the end of the mission.</p>

<p>The last of three ignitions of the Vinci engine will be to shoot the Vinci engine back down into the Pacific Ocean, so it does not contribute to the space debris cluttering Earth's orbit.</p>

<p>Successful inaugural flights are by no means guaranteed.</p>

<p>Historically, nearly half of the first launches of new rockets have ended in failure. That includes Ariane 5, which exploded moments after liftoff in 1996.</p>

<p>But out of 117 launches over nearly 20 years, only one other Ariane 5 flight completely failed.</p>

<p>On the other side of the world, thousands of people in the French city of Toulouse watched the lift-off on a big screen while sitting on a lawn at the Cite de l'Espace museum.</p>

<p>Catherine Gerard, 56, said she was delighted to witness "something a bit magical".</p>

<h3><strong>Skyrocketing competition&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Space has become big business and competition is soaring, particularly from SpaceX's fully re-usable Falcon 9 rockets, which now launch around twice a week.</p>

<p>Yet Europe has recently found itself without an independent way to give lucrative satellites a ride into space.</p>

<p>Russia pulled its Soyuz rockets, long used for European launches at Kourou after Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022.</p>

<p>Later that year, Europe's Vega-C light launcher was grounded after a launch failure. Ariane 6 delays compounded the crisis.</p>

<p>After months of analysing the rocket's inaugural launch, the first commercial flight is expected before the end of the year.</p>

<p>The next challenge will be to "successfully ramp up" the number of flights, ESA space transportation director Toni Tolker-Nielsen said.</p>

<p>Six launches are scheduled for next year and eight for 2026.</p>

<p>The rocket has an order book of 29 missions, many of which are to deploy some of Amazon's Kuiper constellation of internet satellites.</p>

<p>But just weeks before the launch, the programme suffered a surprise setback. Europe's weather satellite operator EUMETSAT cancelled plans to use Ariane 6 in favour of SpaceX's Falcon 9, citing "exceptional circumstances".</p>

<p>ESA chief Josef Aschbacher said the European operator's decision to ditch the European rocket was "difficult to understand".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The US wants India to use its "special partnership" with Russia to put "pressure" on Moscow to stop the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and work for a durable peace in the region, US State Department Hindustani spokesperson, Margaret MacLeod said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States wants India to use its "special partnership" with Russia to put "pressure" on Moscow to stop the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and work for a durable peace in the region, US State Department Hindustani spokesperson, Margaret MacLeod said.</p>

<p>The US official also reiterated Prime Minister Narendra Modi's famous quote "This is not an era of war" which the PM had told Russian President Vladimir Putin during the SCO Summit in Bali in 2022.</p>

<p>Speaking to ANI on Tuesday, MacLeod said, "The US is urging all its partners, including India to pressurise Russia for lasting peace in Ukraine. Russia should get out of Ukraine, This is not the era of war, as Prime Minister (PM Modi) has said. "</p>

<p>"India and Russia share a very special partnership. We wish India use this special partnership to pressurise Russia (against the war)...Russia's war in Ukraine is a violation of the UN Charter," she added.</p>

<p>Being asked about how the US and the West view India's stand on the Ukraine conflict, the US official said, "It would be better if you ask the Indian government about India's stand."</p>

<p>"But from America's perspective, Russia is violating the sovereignty of Ukraine. It is attacking the civilian infrastructure. Just yesterday, we saw the attack on children's hospital, where there were no Ukrainian soldiers...this is against the UN Charter and international law," she added.</p>

<p>Over 40 children were killed in missile strikes at a children's hospital in the Ukrainian capital on Monday. Kyiv has blamed Moscow for the attack.</p>

<p>Regarding the ongoing NATO Summit in Washington DC, MacLeod said the alliance aims to discuss the vision for the next 75 years in this meeting. She also said that announcements of relief packages for Ukraine will be made during the summit.</p>

<p>"At this NATO Summit, we are celebrating 75 years of peace, unity, development and innovation, and will discuss on the preparations for the next 75 years," the US official said.</p>

<p>"Most NATO members are in Europe, right where the Russia-Ukraine war is ongoing, because of which it is a very serious issue for them (European NATO members)...A big relief package for Ukraine will be announced. We will also get an announcement by Germany for setting up a coordination cell," she added.</p>

<p>The NATO Summit is being held from July 9-11 in Washington DC.</p>

<p>The summit has come at a crucial time when the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which started in February 2022, has intensified and also when some cracks have emerged in NATO amid scepticism among some European partners and comments by former US President Donald Trump against the alliance.</p>

<p>This is also the first NATO Summit after the inclusion of two new member states -- Finland and Sweden.</p>

<p>Speaking on the USD 60 dollar price cap put on the purchase of Russian crude oil, the US official said that the price cap has helped in "reducing" Russia's earnings and it wants to further lessen the resources at Moscow's disposal.</p>

<p>"We want to want as less resources as possible to reach Russia because it is using the same earnings to attack Ukraine. The price cap has impacted Russia's earnings, but as long as it (Russia) is able to earn, it will continue to attack Ukraine...so we want to reduce its gains as much as possible," MacLeod further said.</p>

<p>Notably, despite pressure from Western countries, India has continued to purchase crude oil from Russia under the price cap, which several government ministers and officials have said, has helped in keeping domestic prices of petrol and diesel stable.</p>

<p>Further, speaking on India-US ties, the US official said that the ties between the two countries is very strong, and added that Washington wants to strengthen its ties with New Delhi further.</p>

<p>"We see there are deep relations between India and the US, we are engaging on so many issues...sometimes we have differences in perspectives, but we have a free, frank and open dialogue with each other. We are very positive about our relationship...our government wants to strengthen our bilateral relationship further," she said.</p>

<p>Being asked where the India-US relations are headed as it is an election year in the US, MacLeod said she can't comment on her country's domestic politics but affirmed that "historically, both parties (Republican and Democrat) have worked to strengthen relations with India."</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi went on a state visit to the US in June last year. Following this, President Joe Biden came to India for the G20 Summit last year.</p>

<p>The Quad Summit between the two nations is also expected to be held later this year in India.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Palestinian sources said at least 29 people were killed Tuesday in a strike on a school being used to shelter displaced people in Gaza, the fourth such incident in four days, with Hamas blaming Israel for the deaths.</p>

<p>Israel's military told AFP it had carried out a strike in the area and was reviewing the incident. It has acknowledged carrying out three other strikes since Saturday on Gaza schools being used as shelters.</p>

<p>The strike hit the entrance to Al-Awda school in Abasan, said a source at Nasser hospital in the nearby southern city of Khan Yunis, where victims were taken, adding that 29 were killed and dozens wounded.</p>

<p>The Hamas-run government media office accused Israel of carrying out a "terrible massacre" and also gave the death toll as 29, saying the "majority" were women and children.</p>

<p>"We were sitting at the entrance of the school... suddenly and without warning, rockets were fired," a witness, Mohammed Sukkar, told AFP about Tuesday's strike.</p>

<p>The Israel military said the air force had used "precise munition" to strike a "terrorist from Hamas' military wing" near the school.</p>

<p>"The incident is under review," the military said in a statement.</p>

<p>Officials in the Hamas-run territory said at least 20 people were killed in the earlier attacks on the schools.</p>

<p>Israel said all three of those strikes had targeted militants hiding in the schools.</p>

<p>On Saturday, an Israeli strike hit the UN-run Al-Jawni school in Nuseirat, central Gaza, killing 16 people, according to the health ministry.</p>

<p>The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said 2,000 people were sheltering there at the time.</p>

<p>The following day a strike on the Holy Family school in Gaza City killed four, according to Gaza's civil defence agency.</p>

<p>The Latin Patriarchate, owners of the school, said hundreds of people had packed the grounds at the time.</p>

<p>Another UNRWA-run school in Nuseirat was hit on Monday. A local hospital said several people were taken in for treatment.</p>

<p>Israel said it had targeted "several terrorists" using the school for cover.</p>

<p>Hamas has denied Israeli claims that it uses schools, hospitals and other civilian facilities for military aims.</p>

<p>According to UNRWA, more than 500 people have been killed in schools and</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cybersecurity firms backed by the Chinese authorities have been accused of stealing passwords and usernames from unnamed Australian networks in 2022, the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) reported on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The investigation against the CCP-backed hacker group titled APT40 involved Australian Cyber Security Centre, the United States Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the United States National Security Agency (NSA), the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the United Kingdom National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-UK), the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS), the New Zealand National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-NZ), the German Federal Intelligence Service (BND) and Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the Republic of Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIIS) and NIS' National Cyber Security Center, and Japan's National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity (NISC) and National Police Agency (NPA), calling them authoring agencies.</p>

<p>The ACSA claimed that APT40 had conducted several cyber security operations for the PRC Ministry of State Security (MSS).</p>

<p>ACSA also claimed that "The activity and techniques overlap with the groups tracked as Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) 40" quoting the inputs from leading cyber security agencies from the US, Britain, Canada, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea and Germany.</p>

<p>According to the Activity summary section of the report by ACSA APT40 has repeatedly targeted Australian networks as well as government and private sector networks in the region, and the threat they pose to our networks is ongoing.</p>

<p>The tradecraft described in this advisory is regularly observed against Australian networks. Additionally, APT40 possesses the capability to rapidly transform and adapt exploit proof-of-concept(s) (POCs) of new vulnerabilities and immediately utilise them against target networks possessing the infrastructure of the associated vulnerability.</p>

<p>APT40 regularly conducts reconnaissance against networks of interest, including networks in the authoring agencies' countries, looking for opportunities to compromise its targets.<br />
The same report also claimed that the Hacker group also prefers to exploit vulnerable, public-facing infrastructure, using techniques that require user interaction, it puts high priority on obtaining valid credentials to enable a range of follow-on activities using web shells.</p>

<p>The investigative report of the ACSC claimed that in August 2022, a confirmed malicious IP address believed to be connected with the cyber group had interacted with the organisation's computer networks between at least July and August. The compromised device probably belonged to a small business or home user.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"Yes," White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said when asked during a daily briefing if the Democrat pledged to serve another four years should he beat Donald Trump in the 2024 election.</p>

<p>The spokeswoman said she believed Democrats were now "absolutely" united behind Biden, as the party's lawmakers held critical talks on whether he should step aside as candidate in November.</p>

<p>"We do want to turn the page... We want to get to the other side of this," Jean-Pierre said when asked if Biden now believed the crisis was behind him.</p>

<p>"He wants to move forward, unite the party," she said. "The president's going to move forward."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least eight people were killed in the southern United States after storm Beryl felled trees and caused heavy flooding, before being downgraded to a post-tropical cyclone on Tuesday.</p>

<p>In Texas, where Beryl entered as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday, at least seven people were killed, while another person died in neighboring Louisiana, authorities said.</p>

<p>Beryl's death toll is now at least 18 after it tore through the Caribbean last week -- at one point as a Category 5 hurricane, the highest recordable strength.</p>

<p>Some 2.2 million households in Texas were without electricity Tuesday due to damaged power grids, even as temperatures were forecast to reach 41C (106F) with humidity factored in.</p>

<p>Another 14,000 homes were also without power in Louisiana.</p>

<p>Air-conditioned shelters for residents were set up while crews worked to restore service.</p>

<p>Beryl weakened Tuesday and was heading northeast towards Canada with 30 miles (45 kilometers) per hour winds, the US National Hurricane Center said, warning it could still generate flooding and tornadoes.</p>

<p>The sprawling city of Houston, home to 2.3 million people, was badly battered by hurricane-strength winds and flooding.</p>

<p>Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said on X that a 53-year-old man and 74-year-old woman had died in separate incidents of trees falling on houses.</p>

<p>Later, Houston Mayor John Whitmire told a press conference that one person died after a lightning strike possibly ignited a fire, while a police department employee died in floodwaters on his way to work.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in Louisiana, one death was announced by the Bossier Parish sheriff's office, also caused by a tree falling on a home.</p>

<h3><strong>'Very rare'</strong></h3>

<p>Rose Michalec, 51, told AFP that Beryl blew down fences in her south Houston neighborhood.</p>

<p>"It's quite a bit of damage... It's more than we expected," she said.</p>

<p>In downtown Houston, several areas were inundated, including the park where 76-year-old Floyd Robinson usually walks.</p>

<p>"I'm seeing more of this kind of damaging water than I've ever seen before," the lifelong Houston resident told AFP.</p>

<p>"This is just the beginning of July and for us to have a storm of this magnitude is very rare."</p>

<p>Along the Texas coastline, several waterfront homes and buildings had their roofs torn off by the wind.</p>

<h3><strong>Path across Caribbean</strong></h3>

<p>Beryl first slammed Grenada and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines as a Category 4 storm, before plowing past the Cayman Islands and Jamaica, and at one point strengthening to Category 5.</p>

<p>It hit Mexico on Friday, flattening trees and lampposts and ripping off roof tiles.</p>

<p>Beryl left a deadly toll with three deaths in Grenada, two in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, three in Venezuela and two in Jamaica.</p>

<p>It is the first hurricane since NHC record-keeping began to reach the Category 4 level in June, and the earliest to hit the highest Category 5 in July.</p>

<p>Beryl is also the earliest hurricane to make landfall in Texas in a decade, according to expert Michael Lowry.</p>

<p>It is extremely rare for such a powerful storm to form this early in the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from early June to late November.</p>

<p>Scientists say climate change likely plays a role in the rapid intensification of storms such as Beryl because there is more energy in a warmer ocean for them to feed on.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Saudi Arabia has sentenced a teacher to 20 years in prison over critical social media posts, Human Rights Watch and the convicted man's brother said Tuesday.</p>

<p>Asaad al-Ghamdi, 47, was arrested in November 2022, in a nighttime raid on his home in the Saudi city of Jeddah, according to HRW.</p>

<p>He was convicted on May 29 by Saudi Arabia's Specialised Criminal Court, which was established in 2008 to try suspects accused of terrorism, the New York-based rights group said.</p>

<p>He was sentenced "to 20 years in prison on charges related to his peaceful social media activity", HRW added, calling it "yet another escalation in the country's ever-worsening crackdown on freedom of expression".</p>

<p>Court documents reviewed by HRW showed that Ghamdi was charged with "challenging the religion and justice of the King and the Crown Prince" and "publishing false and malicious news and rumors".&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to HRW, the posts used as evidence against him criticised projects related to the Vision 2030 reform agenda.</p>

<p>One post mourned Abdallah al-Hamed, a leading Saudi human rights figure who died in prison following his conviction on charges relating to his activism.</p>

<p>Ghamdi faces the same charges as his brother Mohammad, a government critic who denounced alleged corruption and human rights abuses on social media.</p>

<p>Mohammad was sentenced to death last year based on his social media activity.</p>

<p>Their third brother, Saeed, an Islamic scholar and government critic living in exile in the United Kingdom, condemned the latest move by Saudi authorities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The accusations are arbitrary and unjust because they are all based on tweets," Saeed told AFP, commenting on the verdict against Asaad.</p>

<p>"Maybe I am the target," he added.</p>

<p>Over the past two years, the Saudi judiciary has convicted and handed down lengthy prison terms to dozens of individuals for their social media posts, according to rights groups.</p>

<p>They include Nourah al-Qahtani, who was sentenced to 45 years in prison in 2022, largely over social media posts criticising the government</p>

<p>Salma al-Shehab, a member of the Sunni-ruled kingdom's Shiite minority, was sentenced to 34 years behind bars in 2022 for aiding dissidents seeking to "disrupt public order" in the kingdom by relaying their tweets.</p>

<p>Manahel al-Otaibi, a 29-year-old blogger and fitness instructor, was arrested in November 2022 for challenging Saudi male guardianship laws and requirements for women to wear the customary body-shrouding abaya robe.</p>

<p>The Specialised Criminal Court sentenced her to 11 years in prison on January 9, but the sentence was only made public later in a Saudi submission to United Nations special rapporteurs enquiring about the case.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Gaza hospital source said at least 10 people were killed and dozens wounded Tuesday in a strike on a school turned shelter for displaced Palestinians, the fourth such attack in four days.</p>

<p>The strike hit the gate at the Al-Awda school in Abasan, near the southern city of Khan Yunis, said the source at Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis where victims were taken.</p>

<p>There was no immediate comment from Israel, which has acknowledged carrying out three other strikes since Saturday on Gaza schools used as displacement shelters.</p>

<p>At least 20 people were killed in these attacks, according to officials in the Hamas-run territory.</p>

<p>Israel said all three strikes targeted operatives hiding in the schools.</p>

<p>On Saturday, an Israeli strike hit the UN-run Al-Jawni school in Nuseirat, central Gaza, killing 16 people, according to the territory's health ministry.</p>

<p>The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said 2,000 people were sheltering there at the time.</p>

<p>The following day a strike on the church-run Holy Family school in Gaza City killed four, according to the civil defence agency.</p>

<p>The Latin Patriarchate, owners of the school, said hundreds of people had packed the grounds.</p>

<p>Another UNRWA-run school in Nuseirat was hit on Monday, with a local hospital saying several people were taken for treatment.</p>

<p>Israel said it targeted "several terrorists" using the school for cover.</p>

<p>Hamas has denied Israeli claims that it uses schools, hospitals and other civilian facilities for military aims.</p>

<p>According to UNRWA, more than 500 people have been killed in schools and other shelters it runs in Gaza since the war started on October 7 with the Hamas attack on Israel.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived at the Bandar Seri Begawan Airport this afternoon as he began a two-day visit to Brunei Darussalam - the first ever bilateral trip by an Indian PM to the southeast Asian nation - at the invitation of Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah.</p>

<p>"As we celebrate the 40 years of our diplomatic relations, I look forward to my meetings with His Majesty Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah and other esteemed members of the Royal family to advance our historical relationship to new heights," said PM Modi in his departure statement ahead of his visit to Brunei Darussalam and Singapore.</p>

<p>During his visit, the Prime Minister will engage in bilateral discussions focusing on exploring new areas for cooperation in multiple areas like defence, trade and investment, energy, space technology, health, capacity building, culture and vibrant people-to-people exchanges.</p>

<p>Last month, External Affairs Minister (EAM) S Jaishankar had met Erywan Pehin Yusof, Foreign Minister of Brunei on the sidelines of ASEAN meetings in Vientiane and jointly launched the logo celebrating 40 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Brunei Sultan met for the first time on the sidelines of 25th ASEAN Summit at Nay Pyi Taw in November 2014. They met once again during the 2017 East Asia Summit held in Manila.</p>

<p>In January 2018, the Brunei Sultan, along with the 10 ASEAN Heads of State and Government, visited India for the ASEAN-India Commemorative Summit. The leaders were also 'Guests of Honour' at India's 69th Republic Day celebrations on January 26, 2018.</p>

<p>In 2013, then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh visited Brunei Darussalam to participate in the 11th ASEAN-India Summit and the 8th EAS Summit.</p>

<p>Crowned as the 29th Sultan and Yang Di-Pertuan of Brunei Darussalam in August 1968, Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah undertook his first State Visit to India in September, 1992. His second State Visit to India came in May, 2008.</p>

<p>According to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), Brunei Darussalam government has been supportive of India's 'Look East' and 'Act East' policies for expansion and deepening of cooperation with ASEAN.</p>

<p>"Brunei is an important partner for India's Act East Policy and our vision for the Indo-Pacific, and as we mark a decade of our 'Act East' Policy this year, the visit assumes additional significance. Brunei has been our country coordinator in ASEAN from 2012 to 2015 and played a key role in our further engagements with ASEAN and continues to do so today," Jaideep Mazumdar, MEA Secretary (East), said ahead of the PM's landmark visit.</p>

<p>Indian naval and coast guard ships have also regularly visited Brunei and two Indian defence companies - Bharat Electronics Ltd and MKU Limited - participated in the Defence Industry Exposition organised by Brunei Armed Forces in June 2024 for the first time. Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah and Crown Prince Al-Muhtadee Billah visited the Indian stalls during the expo and appreciated the Indian companies' participation.</p>

<p>There are currently around 14,500 Indians living in Brunei Darussalam out of the total population of about 450,500 with more than half of the Indian expatriates being semi and unskilled workers, who work in oil and gas industries construction, retail businesses, etc. There is also a substantial number of Indian doctors and teachers working in Brunei.</p>

<p>After Brunei, PM Modi will travel to Singapore - a country with which India is exploring enhanced cooperation in digital, skill development, sustainability, healthcare, connectivity and advanced manufacturing areas.</p>

<p>In his departure statement on Tuesday, PM Modi said that he is looking forward to meeting Singapore President Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, Senior Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong besides the leaders of Singapore's vibrant business community.</p>

<p>"I look forward to my discussions to deepen our Strategic Partnership with Singapore, particularly in new and emerging areas of advanced manufacturing, digitalization, and sustainable development. Both countries are important partners in our Act East Policy and the Indo-Pacific Vision. I am confident that my visits would further strengthen our partnership with Brunei, Singapore and the larger ASEAN region," said Prime Minister Modi.</p>

<p>Last week, External Affairs Minister (EAM) S Jaishankar, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal and Railways Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw led the Indian delegation at the second India-Singapore Ministerial Roundtable (ISMR) held in Singapore on Monday.</p>

<p>During their visit, the Indian ministerial delegation also jointly called on Singapore Prime Minister and Minister for Finance Lawrence Wong who had led the Singapore delegation for the first ISMR held in New Delhi in September 2022.</p>

<p>"Glad that progress has been made on several fronts since our last meeting. And new ideas for cooperation are being pursued, including in advanced manufacturing and connectivity. These initiatives will pave the way for closer strategic cooperation and partnership between India and Singapore," the Singapore PM said after his meeting with the visiting Indian ministers on Monday.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Humanity's fascination with gold stretches back thousands of years. Gold mining is described in ancient Greek and Roman sources, and gold rushes – especially in the 19th century – played a powerful role in shaping the modern world.</p>

<p>The dense, yellow metal is often found in the veins of the rocky mineral quartz. This is because the two condense together from hot fluids underground as a result of changes in temperature, pressure and chemistry.</p>

<p>Geologists understand this process quite well, but large gold nuggets have been a bit of a mystery. Gold is only dissolved in natural fluids at around one part per million, so how does it concentrate into lumps that weigh tens or even hundreds of kilograms?</p>

<p>As we report today in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-024-01514-1">Nature Geoscience</a>, the answer likely has to do with the unusual electrical properties of quartz – and what happens when an earthquake puts it under pressure.</p>

<h3><strong>Quartz under pressure</strong></h3>

<p>Quartz is what is called a piezoelectric material. There aren't many minerals like this on Earth, and quartz is by far the most abundant.</p>

<p>Piezoelectric materials generate an instantaneous electric charge when put under stress – when there is a physical force compressing or stretching them. The bigger the force, the bigger the charge.</p>

<p>Not only did we see gold deposited onto the quartz surface, we also saw it clumping together into nanoparticles. What's more, once the process began, gold was more likely to be deposited onto existing grains of gold than on quartz.</p>

<p>This actually makes a lot of sense, as quartz is an electrical insulator and gold conducts electricity. The existing gold grains adopt the electric potential from the nearby quartz and become the focus of reactions that deposit gold.</p>

<p>Industrial gold-plating works in much the same way, only here we are gold-plating other gold.</p>

<h3><strong>Back to nuggets</strong></h3>

<p>Now we know how quartz and gold behave this way in the lab, we can think about geology again.</p>

<p>Some of the most impressive gold nuggets ever found have been in quartz veins where gold-bearing fluids flow through faults in earthquake-prone rock.</p>

<p>During seismic activity, the stress on quartz can generate piezoelectric voltages capable of drawing gold from these fluids. Once deposited, gold becomes the focus of further piezoelectric plating as fluid infiltration continues – so the gold deposits grow bigger over time.</p>

<p>Over millions and millions of years, this process will be repeated again and again. Is this the reason we see such large gold nuggets in this kind of quartz vein? We think it must be at least part of the picture.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 52-year-old Indian national has been sentenced to 14 months of jail for molesting a teenage girl from a known family.</p>

<p>For molesting a child below 14 years old, an offender can be jailed for up to five years, fined, caned, or receive any combination of such punishments. The man cannot be caned as he is over 50.</p>

<p>The man, who cannot be named due to a gag order to protect the girl's identity, pleaded guilty to a molestation charge, The Straits Times newspaper said.</p>

<p>The 13-year-old girl trusted him enough to go on a motorcycle ride with him one evening in October 2022 when he molested her near a playground in Sembawang, northern Singapore, Deputy Public Prosecutor Suriya Prakash told the court.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Record-breaking temperatures and prolonged drought in Greece have exposed a sunken village in Athens' main reservoir for the first time in 30 years.</p>

<p>The village of Kallio was submerged in the late 1970s when the Mornos dam was built 200 kilometres (124 miles) west of the capital, the artificial lake fed by the Mornos and Evinos rivers.</p>

<p>With lake levels down by 30 percent in recent months according to state water operator EYDAP, the ruins of a school and houses have reappeared.</p>

<p>"The level of Lake Mornos has dropped by 40 metres (131 feet)," said Yorgos Iosifidis, a 60-year-old pensioner who had to leave his home as a young man along with the other villagers when the area was flooded.</p>

<p>"You see the first floor that remains of my father-in-law's two-storey house... and next to it you can see what's left of my cousins' house," Iosifidis, who now lives higher up the hill, told AFP.</p>

<p>Drought worsened this year in the Mediterranean country that is well accustomed to summer heat waves.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After the mildest winter on record, Greece had its hottest July on record, according to preliminary weather data from the National Observatory. This came after similarly record-breaking temperatures in June.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nearly 80 houses in Kallio, in addition to the church and school, were "sacrificed" to supply Athens with water, Kallio village chairman Apostolis Gerodimos told state agency ANA.</p>

<p>This is the second time Kallio has reappeared, after another period of drought in the early 1990s, said Iosifidis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"If it doesn't rain soon, the level will drop further and the problem will be more acute than it was then," he said.</p>

<p>Anastasis Papageorgiou, 26, a doctor who lives in Amygdalia, a village near Mornos, said the area has seen very little rain or snow in the last two years.</p>

<p>"The situation is difficult at the moment, so we have to be careful with water," he said.</p>

<p>The Greek authorities called on the 3.7 million inhabitants of Attica, the region surrounding Athens and home to a third of the Greek population, not to waste water.&nbsp;</p>

<p>EYDAP has also tapped into additional reservoirs near the capital.</p>

<p>On a visit to neighbouring Thessaly on Monday to discuss reconstruction works after last year's destructive floods, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said Greece had to improve its water management.</p>

<p>"We don't have the luxury to wastewater... at a time when we know with certainty that we will have less water, we must protect water resources more methodically than we have done so far," Mitsotakis said.</p>

<p>Greece uses 85 per cent of its water for irrigation and needs to build more dams, the prime minister said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi is currently on a visit to Brunei and Singapore to strengthen India's bilateral ties with Southeast Asian nations. His first stop is Brunei, where he will spend two days and meet Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah. The Brunei visit is the first-ever by an Indian Prime Minister.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/pm-narendra-modi-to-meet-with-the-sultan-of-brunei-who-boasts-world-s-largest-car-collection-worth-5b-6478680#pfrom=home-ndtv_topstories" target="_blank">Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah</a>, the second-longest reigning monarch in the world after the late Queen Elizabeth II, will host the Indian PM. He is renowned for his extravagant lifestyle and vast wealth. With an estimated net worth of around $30 billion, he was once recognised as the world's richest person.<br />
<br />
His primary home, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/pm-narendra-modi-to-meet-brunei-sultan-at-istana-nurul-iman-the-worlds-largest-palace-6478971#pfrom=home-ndtv_topstories" target="_blank">Istana Nurul Iman Palace</a>, is the world's largest residential palace according to the Guinness Book of World Records. Covering over 2,00,000 square metres, the palace has 1,700 rooms, 257 bathrooms, and five swimming pools. The palace was completed in 1984 for $1.4 billion. It also features 110 garages.<br />
<br />
Hassanal Bolkiah is also known for his impressive car collection. He owns over 7,000 vehicles, including 600 Rolls-Royces, 450 Ferraris and 380 Bentleys. His collection includes rare and custom-made vehicles such as a gold-coated Rolls-Royce and a Ferrari 456 GT Venice, one of only seven in the world. This collection is valued at over $5 billion.<br />
<br />
His private aviation fleet is equally remarkable. The Sultan owns a Boeing 747-400, a Boeing 767-200, and an Airbus A340-200. His Boeing 747-400, known as the “flying palace,” is lavishly decorated with gold and Lalique crystal. The aircraft is said to have cost around $400 million.<br />
<br />
His art collection includes significant pieces like Pierre-Auguste Renoir's 1892 masterpiece ‘Young Girls At The Piano', which he purchased for $70 million.<br />
<br />
Known for his extravagant personal indulgences, Hassanal Bolkiah reportedly spends up to $20,000 per haircut. He flies his favourite barber from London to Brunei for grooming sessions.<br />
<br />
He graduated from the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, the same institution attended by British Royals Princes William and Harry.<br />
<br />
Beyond his lavish lifestyle, he has also been involved in various charitable activities and governance reforms.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A cold case that baffled authorities and intrigued locals for nearly half a century has finally come to a close. The mystery surrounding the frozen body found in a Pennsylvania cave in 1977, known for decades only as "Pinnacle Man," is over. The remains have been identified as those of Nicholas Paul Grubb, a 27-year-old man from Fort Washington, Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The long-awaited breakthrough was announced by the Berks County Coroner's Office at a press conference on Tuesday, reported CNN. The key to unlocking this cold case was some good old-fashioned detective work. &nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>The discovery</strong></h3>

<p>On a chilly day in January 1977, hikers exploring a cave near the Pinnacle, a peak in the Appalachian Mountains in Albany Township, stumbled upon a grisly discovery. The frozen body of a man was found inside the cave, triggering an investigation that would last decades.</p>

<p>The initial investigation, led by George Holmes, then the chief deputy coroner of Berks County, hit a dead end quickly. The man, unable to be identified based on his appearance, clothing, or belongings, became a mystery known simply as the "Pinnacle Man."&nbsp;</p>

<p>An autopsy revealed that the cause of death was a drug-induced overdose, with no signs of trauma or foul play. Dental records and fingerprints were collected, but the fingerprint card soon disappeared, leaving investigators with little to go on.</p>

<h3><strong>A break in the case</strong></h3>

<p>For more than four decades, the Pinnacle Man's true identity remained unknown. Then, in 2019, authorities decided to revisit the cold case, exhuming the body in hopes that advancements in forensic science might finally provide answers.</p>

<p>Berks County forensic experts performed an examination and took DNA samples, which were entered into the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs). However, the samples did not match any known cases, and the identity of Pinnacle Man remained a mystery.</p>

<p>Fast-forward to early August of this year, when a Pennsylvania State Police detective, Ian Keck, stumbled upon a crucial piece of evidence that had been missing for decades - the lost fingerprint card from Grubb's 1977 autopsy.</p>

<p>Recognising its significance, Mr Keck immediately submitted the card to NamUs. Within just an hour, an FBI fingerprint expert confirmed a match - the fingerprints belonged to Nicholas Paul Grubb.</p>

<h3><strong>Closing the book on a 50-year mystery</strong></h3>

<p>With Mr Grubb's identity finally confirmed, Berks County Coroner John Fielding was relieved. "This identification brings a long-awaited resolution to his family, who have been notified and expressed their deep appreciation for the collective efforts that made it possible," Mr Fielding said during a press conference. "It is moments like these that remind us of the importance of our work, to provide answers, to bring closure, and to give the unidentified a name and a story."</p>

<p>One of Mr Grubb's relatives, who was informed of the discovery, requested that his remains be placed in the family plot, finally bringing him home after all these years.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday sought forgiveness for not being able to save the lives of six Iseraeli hostages, whose bodies were found in a tunnel in Gaza.</p>

<p>The Israel's military had on Saturday said they recovered the bodies of six hostages "from an underground tunnel in the Rafah area" in southern Gaza.</p>

<p>The bodies were identified as that of Carmel Gat, who was taken from a kibbutz community near the Gaza border, as well as Eden Yerushalmi, Almog Sarusi, Ori Danino, US-Israeli Hersh Goldberg-Polin and Russian-Israeli Alexander Lobanov, who were kidnapped from a music festival site.and held captive by militants.</p>

<p>"I ask for your forgiveness for not bringing them back alive," Prime Minister Netanyahu said at a press conference. "We were close but we didn't succeed. Hamas will pay a very heavy price for this," he said.</p>

<p>Daniel Hagari, a military spokesperson, said all six "were abducted alive on the morning of October 7 and brutally murdered by Hamas terrorists shortly before we reached them".</p>

<p>Speaking to Lobanov's parents on Sunday, Prime Minister Netanyahu had said: "I would like to tell you how much I regret and request forgiveness for not succeeding in bringing Sasha back alive."</p>

<p>The families of Israeli hostages whose bodies were recovered from Gaza sobbed as they laid their relatives to rest on Sunday at funerals that featured heartfelt eulogies alongside expressions of frustration with the government.</p>

<p>Critics in Israel have accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of prolonging the war for political gain.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of Israelis took to the streets across the country on Sunday afternoon and evening.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden has also said that "It is time this war ended." The United States has been involved in ceasefire mediation efforts along with Qatar and Egypt.</p>

<p>Of 251 people taken hostage during the October 7 attack, 97 remain in Gaza, including 33 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 129 people were killed during a weekend prison break attempt at the largest jail in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the interior minister said on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The provisional human toll is 129 dead, including 24 who were shot after warnings," minister Jacquemain Shabani said in a video message, adding that at least 59 others had been wounded at the Makala prison in the capital, Kinshasa. &nbsp;</p>

<p>His ministry said several people had been crushed or suffocated and a number of women had been raped.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Witnesses told AFP gunfire had started at the prison at around 2:00 am on Monday morning and lasted for several hours.</p>

<p>Daddi Soso, an electrician in his 40s living in the capital, reported seeing security force vehicles taking bodies away in the early hours.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The authorities did not indicate as to how many inmates had escaped or attempted to do so, but at mid-morning on Monday government spokesman Patrick Muyaya told national television the situation was "under control".&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has confirmed he wants to work with former President Donald Trump in auditing US agencies to identify programmes for cuts. The billionaire responded to a report by The Washington Post on X, saying, "I can't wait. There is a lot of waste and needless regulation in government that needs to go."&nbsp;</p>

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1830829538118381574?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 3, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Ahead of the 2024 Presidential elections, the Republican nominee is set to create a commission to audit US agencies and identify areas for cost-cutting. The proposed commission will include other business leaders such as Fred Smith, former CEO of FedEx, and Robert Nardelli, former CEO of Home Depot, as per the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/09/02/trump-elon-musk-commission-doge/ ">Washington Post</a>.</p>

<p>Mr Musk's interest in such an initiative is not new. Last month, he shared an AI-generated image of himself at a “Department of Government Efficiency” lectern, signalling his desire to contribute to the cause.</p>

<p>Donald Trump has previously acknowledged the Tesla CEO's potential value as a consultant. However, ethics experts are concerned that Mr Musk's involvement may lead to conflicts of interest between his business and the commission's objectives.</p>

<p>Drawing inspiration from past initiatives by Ronald Reagan and Tom Coburn, Trump advisers are seeking to recruit prominent business leaders to identify areas of federal waste. The potential appointment of Mr Musk to a government efficiency commission comes as the Tesla CEO increases his political engagement. Recently, Mr Musk hired a Republican strategist to guide his political activities.</p>

<p>Mr Musk's growing political influence was further highlighted by his recent poll on X, which asked voters to choose between Trump and Kamala Harris as their preferred president. He also sat down with the former president last month for a live interview, which was aired on his platform X. Donald Trump has also publicly praised Mr Musk, calling him "fantastic" and "brilliant.”</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Brazilian supreme court judge ordered Monday the immediate imprisonment of four people convicted for their role in a nightclub fire that killed 242 people more than a decade ago.</p>

<p>The ruling overturned decisions by two lower courts in 2022 and 2023 that annulled the jail sentences, which ranged from 18 to 22 years, over apparent irregularities in the trial.</p>

<p>The four defendants will have one further chance to appeal at Brazil's supreme court, which could ratify or deny Judge Jose Antonio Dias Toffoli's decision, a judiciary representative told AFP.</p>

<p>The 2013 fire at the nightclub in the southern town of Santa Maria started when members of a band playing that night lit flares that set fire to the ceiling.</p>

<p>A police investigation concluded the fire started when sparks from a flare ignited insulating material, releasing lethal fumes.</p>

<p>While some burned to death, many of the mostly young victims died from asphyxiation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A probe found the venue had no functioning fire extinguishers, only two doors for evacuating people from an overcrowded dance floor, and poor emergency signage.</p>

<p>Two owners of the Kiss nightclub and two members of the Gurizada Fandangueira band were found guilty in December 2021 of murder and attempted murder of the victims, mostly young university students.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korea's famous kimchi is falling victim to climate change, with scientists, farmers and manufacturers saying the quality and quantity of the napa cabbage that is pickled to make the ubiquitous dish is suffering due to rising temperatures.</p>

<p>Napa cabbage thrives in cooler climates and is usually planted in mountainous regions where temperatures during the key growing summer season once rarely rose above 25 Celsius (77 Fahrenheit).</p>

<p>Studies show that warmer weather brought about by climate change is now threatening these crops, so much so that South Korea might not be able to grow napa cabbage one day due to the intensifying heat.</p>

<p>"We hope these predictions don't come to pass," plant pathologist and virologist Lee Young-gyu said.</p>

<p>"Cabbage likes to grow in cool climates and adapts to a very narrow band of temperatures," Lee said. "The optimal temperatures are between 18 and 21 Celsius."</p>

<p>In the fields and in kitchens - both commercial and domestic - farmers and kimchi makers are already feeling the change.</p>

<p>Spicy, fermented kimchi is made from other vegetables such as radish, cucumber and green onion, but the most popular dish remains cabbage-based.</p>

<p>Describing the effect of higher temperatures on the vegetable, Lee Ha-yeon, who holds the designation of Kimchi Master from the Agriculture Ministry, said the heart of the cabbage "goes bad, and the root becomes mushy."</p>

<p>"If this continues, then in the summer time we might have to give up cabbage kimchi," said Lee, whose title reflects her contribution to food culture.</p>

<p>Data from the government statistics agency shows the area of highland cabbage farmed last year was less than half of what it was 20 years ago: 3,995 hectares compared to 8,796 hectares.</p>

<p>According to the Rural Development Administration, a state farming think tank, climate change scenarios project the farmed area to shrink dramatically in the next 25 years to just 44 hectares, with no cabbage grown in the highlands by 2090.</p>

<p>Researchers cite higher temperatures, unpredictable heavy rains and pests that become more difficult to control in the warmer and longer summers as the cause for the crop shrinkage.</p>

<p>A fungal infection that wilts the plant has also been particularly troublesome for farmers because it only becomes apparent very close to harvest.</p>

<p>Climate change adds to the challenges facing South Korea's kimchi industry, which is already battling lower-priced imports from China, which are mostly served in restaurants.</p>

<p>Customs data released on Monday showed kimchi imports through the end of July were up 6.9% at $98.5 million this year, almost all of it from China and the highest ever for the period.</p>

<p>So far, the government has relied on massive climate-controlled storage to prevent price spikes and shortages. Scientists are also racing to develop crop varieties that can grow in warmer climates and that are more resilient to large fluctuations in rainfall and infections.</p>

<p>But farmers like Kim Si-gap, 71, who has worked in the cabbage fields of the eastern region of Gangneung all his life, fear these varieties will be more expensive to grow in addition to not tasting quite right.</p>

<p>"When we see the reports that there will come a time in Korea when we can no longer grow cabbage, it was shocking on the one hand and also sad at the same time," Kim said.</p>

<p>"Kimchi is something we cannot not have on the table. What are we going to do if this happens?"</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NASA has responded to reports claiming "strange noises" being heard by astronauts Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore aboard the International Space Station (ISS). The issue was first noted when Mr Wilmore reported hearing pulsating sounds through the speakers of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The spacecraft is currently docked at the ISS and scheduled to return on September 7. NASA has since clarified that the sounds were the result of an audio configuration issue between the space station and Starliner.</p>

<p>In a statement, NASA explained that the ISS audio system is a complex network designed to interconnect multiple spacecraft and modules, making occasional noise and feedback not uncommon. The agency reassured that the feedback reported had no technical impact on the crew, the Starliner spacecraft, or station operations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"A pulsing sound from a speaker in Boeing's Starliner spacecraft heard by NASA astronaut Butch Wilmore aboard the International Space Station has stopped. The feedback from the speaker was the result of an audio configuration between the space station and Starliner. The space station audio system is complex, allowing multiple spacecraft and modules to be interconnected, and it is common to experience noise and feedback," NASA said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following its undocking, the Starliner will perform an autonomous landing at White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico, approximately six hours after departure. Astronauts Wilmore and Williams, who arrived at the ISS on June 5 as part of Boeing's Crew Flight Test mission, will return to Earth in a SpaceX Dragon capsule in February 2025.<br />

<p>It's not a thaw yet, but there are certainly signs of some warming in the India-China relationship. Of late, there has been an uptick in dialogue to resolve outstanding issues along two friction points in Eastern Ladakh. At the same time, there is a fresh debate underway within India on economic engagement with China.</p>

It said that both sides had "agreed to work together to turn over a new leaf in the border situation at an early date". It further added: "The two sides exchanged in-depth views on relevant issues in border areas, further narrowed differences, expanded consensus, and agreed to strengthen dialogue and consultation, accommodate each other's legitimate concerns, and reach a mutually acceptable solution at an early date."</p>

It said that "the two sides had a frank, constructive and forward-looking exchange of views on the situation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) to narrow down the differences and find early resolution of the outstanding issues". The impact of these meetings on actual resolution of the issues in Depsang and Demchok remains to be seen.</p>

<h2><strong>The Question Of Chinese Investments</strong></h2>

<p>Meanwhile, the Economic Survey released before the new NDA government's budget in July indicated that India could be more open to Chinese investments in the future. Investments from China have had to face government scrutiny since the issuance of Press Note 3 in April 2020. The notification was seen as an effort by the government to direct Chinese capital in desirable domains. However, the standoff in Ladakh and the subsequent killing of Indian soldiers during the clashes in the Galwan Valley in June 2020 extinguished any appetite for Chinese investments. That situation seems to be changing now.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, it was<a data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="10" href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/investment-proposals-from-border-nations-201-denied-124-approved/articleshow/109443275.cms" id="OWA584d0861-d3f4-3561-260f-8a4e21cc9d99" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a><u><a data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="11" href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/investment-proposals-from-border-nations-201-denied-124-approved/articleshow/109443275.cms" id="OWA584d0861-d3f4-3561-260f-8a4e21cc9d99" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a></u>&nbsp;that since April 2020, the Indian government has approved 124 investment proposals from bordering countries and rejected 201. Around 200 proposals are said to be pending with the government. A large number of these proposals were from China. While the scrutiny under Press Note 3 remains active, there has been some easing.</p>

<h2><strong>The MG Motor-JSW Deal</strong></h2>

<p>For instance, in March, the long-discussed joint venture between MG Motor India and JSW Group was finally sealed. It entailed Chinese auto giant SAIC Motor divesting a 51% stake.</p>

<p>Subsequently, in May,<a data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="12" href="https://www.business-standard.com/india-news/india-may-permit-chinese-electronic-firms-to-invest-on-a-select-basis-124050200186_1.html" id="OWA6528e4a8-7a34-45a5-a8eb-c28b769eafcd" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a><u><a data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="13" href="https://www.business-standard.com/india-news/india-may-permit-chinese-electronic-firms-to-invest-on-a-select-basis-124050200186_1.html" id="OWA6528e4a8-7a34-45a5-a8eb-c28b769eafcd" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a></u>&nbsp;emerged that the government had begun moving on approving Chinese investment proposals with Indian firms on a case-by-case basis. In July, it was<a data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="14" href="https://www.outlookbusiness.com/news/indian-government-to-fast-track-approvals-for-chinese-investments-in-electronics-automobiles" id="OWAdba9dc58-47be-d924-d52f-bbc84bfd6ab4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a><u><a data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="15" href="https://www.outlookbusiness.com/news/indian-government-to-fast-track-approvals-for-chinese-investments-in-electronics-automobiles" id="OWAdba9dc58-47be-d924-d52f-bbc84bfd6ab4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a></u>&nbsp;that the government had notified electronics and automobile manufacturers about plans to establish an inter-ministerial panel to accelerate the approval process for investment proposals from Chinese firms in Indian companies. The assessment would require the proposals to meet certain conditions, such as the significance of investment and technology for enhancing the local manufacturing supply chain, exclusion of Chinese nationals from the management and board of the investee firm and the Indian entity holding a majority stake in any joint venture.</p>

<p>At the same time,<a data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="16" href="https://www.business-standard.com/india-news/india-to-fast-track-china-visas-after-businesses-complain-of-delays-124071700088_1.html" id="OWA43fe70ac-1a05-8a10-90db-79263d0bf9fc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a><u><a data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="17" href="https://www.business-standard.com/india-news/india-to-fast-track-china-visas-after-businesses-complain-of-delays-124071700088_1.html" id="OWA43fe70ac-1a05-8a10-90db-79263d0bf9fc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a></u>&nbsp;indicated that the Indian government was looking to fast-track visas for Chinese technicians and engineers, given that delays were hurting Indian industry. Then in late August, the&nbsp;<i>Economic Times</i><a data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="18" href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/foreign-trade/forbidden-no-more-india-begins-oking-chinese-proposals/articleshow/112691334.cms" id="OWAe45a4f37-1eea-97b6-a351-200ec76aae59" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a><u><a data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="19" href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/foreign-trade/forbidden-no-more-india-begins-oking-chinese-proposals/articleshow/112691334.cms" id="OWAe45a4f37-1eea-97b6-a351-200ec76aae59" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a></u>&nbsp;that the inter-ministerial panel had approved five to six investment proposals involving Chinese entities in the electronics manufacturing sector.</p>

<h2><strong>A Good Approach, But Not Without Perils</strong></h2>

<p>Being open to Chinese capital and talent, particularly those that aid the development of India's manufacturing sector and deepen linkages with global value chains, is a pragmatic and prudent approach. It is, in fact, in India's larger strategic interest to do so. This is not to argue that there isn't any need for scrutiny. The External Affairs Minister is<a data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="20" href="https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2024/Aug/31/jaishankar-says-chinese-investments-should-come-under-thorough-scrutiny-2" id="OWAc7e54619-15da-ad89-12f4-3cb1a86ca563" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a><u><a data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="21" href="https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2024/Aug/31/jaishankar-says-chinese-investments-should-come-under-thorough-scrutiny-2" id="OWAc7e54619-15da-ad89-12f4-3cb1a86ca563" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">right to argue</a></u>, as he did at a public forum last week, that given the current geopolitical scenario and India's peculiar challenges with China, it is "common sense that investments from China should be scrutinised". However, this should not be an ad hoc process. It is imperative to establish a new investment review mechanism with clear guidelines, conditions and timelines. This will engender greater predictability for industry, and ensure adequate democratic oversight. Such a process should also entail delineating a narrow set of sub-sectors as critical from a national security perspective and therefore walled off from Chinese entities. This list can evolve dynamically following periodic reviews.</p>

<p>That said, from the perspective of Indian industry, working with Chinese entities and being reliant on Chinese capital is likely to always remain a perilous endeavour. Politics and security have always come first in the India-China dynamic. Events over the past seven years since the Doklam stand-off have only further entrenched this trend. In addition, given the structural fault lines between the two sides, volatility is likely to remain a feature of the India-China relationship. The risks for industry, therefore, are always likely to remain high.</p>

<h2><strong>India Must Know What It Wants</strong></h2>

<p>Finally, while we are in a moment of policy churn, it is imperative for India's political elite and strategic affairs community to deliberate on what it is that we desire in our relationship with China. Many have talked about the need for a new&nbsp;<i>modus vivendi</i>. But what are the contours of this new, desirable state of affairs that we wish to arrive at? And what does India need to do to get there? These are questions that need deeper yet urgent reflection, for policy to proceed with purpose and pragmatism rather than being reactive.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Hustle culture glorifies relentless work, often at the expense of mental well-being. The constant pressure to be productive can lead to burnout, anxiety, and depression.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In today's world, when many youngsters aim to create billion-dollar unicorns - and some become successful - mental health and physical well-being have taken a backseat. Psychiatrists and leading voices from the industry blame "hustle culture", the mantra for ambition, as the reason behind it and warn youngsters against following it. Hustle culture is again in focus after Kritarth Mittal, who tasted success at the age of 25 with Soshals app, landed in hospital for a health scare. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://x.com/abhagsain/status/1830545635956949453">In a post on X</a>, the 25-year-old blamed poor lifestyle choices and unhealthy diet and urged his followers and other social media users to take care of their health.</p>

<h3><strong>Tech Leaders Who Challenge Hustle Culture</strong></h3>

<p>Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, is often celebrated as the embodiment of hustle culture. However, his own experiences have served as a cautionary tale. In a candid interview with <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/16/business/elon-musk-interview-tesla.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, Mr Musk revealed the toll that overwork has taken on his health and well-being. He admitted to working 120-hour weeks and relying on Ambien to sleep, a practice he described as "not wise". His admission sparked discussions on whether the relentless pursuit of success is sustainable or worth the cost to personal health.</p>

<p>David Heinemeier Hansson, co-founder of Basecamp and creator of Ruby on Rails, is a vocal critic of hustle culture. Mr Hansson has spoken out against the glorification of overwork in the tech industry, arguing that it leads to burnout and diminishes creativity. In his book, It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work, co-authored with Jason Fried, he advocates for a calmer, more sustainable work environment. Hansson has repeatedly emphasized the importance of work-life balance, stating in The Guardian that "work should not be your life".</p>

<p>Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian has also been vocal about the dangers of hustle culture. After stepping down from his role at Reddit, Mr Ohanian has focused on promoting mental health awareness and work-life balance, particularly in the tech industry. He has spoken at length about how hustle culture can lead to burnout and has encouraged entrepreneurs to prioritise their well-being. Speaking to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/always-on-work-culture-creating-broken-people-says-reddit-co-founder-11558464608"><em>The Wall Street Journal (WSJ)</em></a>, Mr Ohanian said the so-called "hustle porn" online perpetuates an unhealthy culture of posturing in the tech industry.</p>

<h3><strong>The Hidden Costs of Hustle Culture</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Mental health strain:</strong> Hustle culture glorifies relentless work, often at the expense of mental well-being. The constant pressure to be productive can lead to burnout, anxiety, and depression. According to Forbes, the obsession with work can create a toxic environment where employees feel guilty for resting.</p>

<p><strong>Impact on relationships:</strong> <em>The Guardian</em> said in an article that hustle culture can strain personal relationships, as time with loved ones is sacrificed for work. The pursuit of success often leads to isolation, eroding social connections and increasing stress.</p>

<p><strong>Long-term consequences:</strong> While short-term gains may be celebrated, the long-term effects of overworking include chronic health issues and diminished life satisfaction.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pope Francis arrived in Muslim-majority Indonesia on Tuesday to kick off a four-nation tour of the Asia-Pacific that will be the longest and farthest of the 87-year-old's papacy.</p>

<p>The head of the world's 1.3 billion Catholics touched down in Jakarta for a three-day visit devoted to inter-religious ties, and will then travel to Papua New Guinea, East Timor and Singapore.</p>

<p>The 12-day tour will test the pontiff's increasingly fragile health, but he is often energised by being among his flock and he emerged from the 13-hour flight smiling and waving.</p>

<p>"I thank you for coming on this journey, thank you for the company. I think it is the longest one (flight) I have done," he told reporters aboard his chartered plane after landing, according to an AFP journalist.</p>

<p>He disembarked in Jakarta in a wheelchair to an honour guard, greetings by Indonesian officials, including the religious affairs minister, and a traditional bouquet from two children.</p>

<p>The pontiff was then picked up from the red carpet by a civilian Toyota car, choosing a modest vehicle over one of the luxury typically used by world leaders. He smiled and waved as he left for the Vatican's diplomatic mission in Jakarta.</p>

<p>The pope was due to have a relaxing day in Jakarta on Tuesday following the long flight from Rome, then meet President Joko Widodo on Wednesday in the first major set piece of his visit to the world's most populous Muslim-majority country.</p>

<p>Catholics currently represent fewer than three per cent of the population of Indonesia -- about eight million people, compared with the 87 per cent, or 242 million, who are Muslim.</p>

<p>But they are one of six officially recognised religions or denominations in the secular nation, including Protestantism, Buddhism, Hinduism and Confucianism.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Francis will meet representatives of all six at Istiqlal Mosque, the largest in Southeast Asia and a symbol of religious co-existence.</p>

<p>It is linked via a "tunnel of friendship" to the cathedral across the road, where Christians in recent days have been taking selfies with a life-sized cutout of the pope.</p>

<p>He will then host a mass and deliver a sermon at Indonesia's 80,000-seater national football stadium.</p>

<h3><strong>Joint declaration&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Despite Indonesia's official recognition of different faiths, there are concerns about growing discrimination, including against Christians, with local Catholics hoping the pope will speak out.</p>

<p>But Michel Chambon, a theologian and anthropologist at the National University of Singapore, said the pope would press a wider message he had already delivered in other Muslim-majority countries, from Iraq to Bahrain, Turkey and Morocco.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The visit "is not really aimed at Catholics in Indonesia" but is intended to highlight the global importance of Islamic-Christian dialogue, he told AFP.</p>

<p>That message was already being felt by some in Jakarta.</p>

<p>"When there's an event like this, we enjoy it because when it's our religious events, they (Catholics) also show tolerance to us," said Ranggi Prathita, a 34-year-old Muslim who has been selling customised Pope t-shirts.</p>

<p>"We all respect each other."</p>

<p>The country's religious affairs ministry has also hailed the visit as a symbol of Indonesia's religious diversity.</p>

<p>At the Istiqlal Mosque, Pope Francis will sign a joint declaration with its grand imam that will focus on "dehumanisation", notably the spread of violence and conflict, as well as environmental degradation, according to the Indonesian bishops' Conference.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Francis has repeatedly urged the world to do more to combat climate change and mitigate its effects -- including rising sea levels, which threaten Jakarta.</p>

<p>Indonesia has experienced terrorist attacks over recent decades, including bombings on the resort island of Bali by Islamist militants in 2002 that left 202 people dead.</p>

<p>Security has been stepped up for the pope's visit, with roads around key sites where he is scheduled to visit being re-routed or closed.</p>

<h3><strong>Fragile health</strong></h3>

<p>His trip to Indonesia is the third ever by a pope and the first since John Paul II in 1989.</p>

<p>Originally planned for 2020 but postponed due to the Covid pandemic, the visit takes place just three months before his 88th birthday.</p>

<p>The Argentine now routinely uses a wheelchair to move around, underwent hernia surgery last year and has been plagued by respiratory issues.</p>

<p>He has not travelled abroad since visiting Marseille in France in September last year, having cancelled a planned address at United Nations climate talks in Dubai two months later.</p>

<p>He will be travelling to Indonesia with his personal doctor and two nurses, but Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said this is normal, saying no extra precautions were in place.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The death of a junior doctor in Indonesia has reignited debate over the issue of bullying prevalent in medical schools across the country.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The death of a junior doctor in Indonesia has reignited debate over the issue of bullying prevalent in medical schools across the country. According to the <em>South China Morning Post (SCMP)</em>, 30-year-old Aulia Risma Lestari, resident in the anaesthesia specialist programme at Diponegoro University in Semarang, was found dead in her living quarters on August 12. It is reported that she may have injected herself with a lethal dose of an anaesthetic. Police are still investigating her death as a possible suicide, and are looking into whether bullying documented in her diary may have contributed to her depression.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following her death, several WhatsApp conversations between the 31-year-old and several senior residents at Kardinah Hospital in Tegal revealed troubling claims. According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3276739/indonesia-junior-doctors-death-exposes-bullying-scourge-medical-schools" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>SCMP</em></a>, they suggested that the junior doctor faced pressures from senior doctors to cover expenses beyond her tuition and living costs, including demands for food, entertainment and even car rentals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Reacting to the incident, Indonesia's Health Ministry suspended the hospital's anesthesiology residency programme until a police investigation is concluded. Separately, Indonesia's Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin called bullying an "open secret" in the country's medical institutions and labelled it a "huge phenomenon".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I will push for legal action to ensure maximum punishment for the perpetrators and to create a deterrent effect," Mr Sadikin said, vowing to implement better monitoring and reporting measures.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Diponegoro University's rector, Professor Suharnomo, has refuted allegations of bullying. He asserted that the junior doctor faced health issues that affected her studies. The professor also stated that the university would cooperate with the police in their investigations. He added that the school has already implemented a zero-bullying policy, actively monitored by the Bullying and Sexual Violence Prevention and Management Team since August 2023.</p>

<p>However, in the wake of the tragic incident, other junior doctors across the country have opened up about their ordeals. &nbsp;Agung Purnama, a 29-year-old medical student specialising in oncology surgery during his residency at a hospital in Bandung, West Java, said that he had experienced pressure from senior doctors to work long hours.</p>

<p>"Or else they would say we will not get a good grade, or we are not worthy of becoming doctors," the medical student said. "You feel like (you) have no choice but to do as they say ... I spent so much time and money to get to this point (in my studies) so it feels like you don't want to do anything to risk that," he added.</p>

<p>"I think there is a tendency to normalise and see bullying as being natural because of the high amounts of pressure and demands of specialised medical education ... but this shouldn't be normalised or tolerated," founder and chief executive of advocacy group Centre for Indonesia's Strategic Development Initiatives, Diah Satyani Saminarsih, said, reported SCMP.</p>

<p>"The more junior you are, the higher the risk is that you will be exposed to bullying," she added.<br />
Meanwhile, citing the health ministry, the outlet reported that it had received 356 formal complaints related to bullying between July 2023 and August this year. Out of these, authorities investigated 156 cases, resulting in suspension or dismissal. The complaints by the victims contained details of physical abuse, financial coercion, verbal abuse, and even intimidation.</p>

<p>"The Health Ministry will always take stern action against the bullies. Their names will also be flagged in the system as perpetrators," health ministry's spokesman Mohammad Syahril told the outlet.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A school bus ploughed into a crowd of people outside a middle school in eastern China on Tuesday, killing 11 parents and students, state media reported.</p>

<p>State broadcaster CCTV said the driver "lost control" of the vehicle as it approached the school in Shandong province's Tai'an city at 7:27 am (2327 GMT Monday).</p>

<p>The bus ran into a group of parents and children on the side of the road, according to CCTV.</p>

<p>"As of now, (the incident) has caused the deaths of 11 people, of whom six were parents and five were students," the broadcaster reported in an update just after 11:30 am.</p>

<p>It said one other person was in a "critical" condition, while the vital signs of another 12 people were "stable".</p>

<p>Photos and videos circulating on social media showed people in blood-soaked clothes lying in the road near a hulking grey bus.</p>

<p>Several adults knelt over children sprawled unmoving on the ground, while other people could be heard screaming in the background.</p>

<p>"They're all dead, it's so heartbreaking," a woman's voice could be heard saying off-camera in one clip of the aftermath of the crash.</p>

<p>"I'd have been killed too if I'd stood there, but luckily I ran away fast," she said.</p>

<p>AFP was able to geolocate several of the social media photos and videos to the school in Shandong where the crash took place.</p>

<p>The driver was being held by local police and the cause of the incident was "under investigation", CCTV said.</p>

<p>Many public schools in China reopened for the new academic year this week.</p>

<p>Deadly traffic accidents occur frequently in the country due to lax safety standards and widespread disorderly driving.</p>

<p>In July, police said a vehicle crashed into pedestrians in the central city of Changsha, killing eight people and injuring five.</p>

<p>A 55-year-old suspect living in the area was detained pending an investigation, but it was not clear if the incident was intentional or not.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of Venezuela's newest news anchors sits on a stool, dressed in a flannel shirt and chinos as he delivers the day's headlines.</p>

<p>He goes by "El Pana," Venezuelan slang for "friend."</p>

<p>Only, he's not real.</p>

<p>El Pana, and his colleague "La Chama," or "The Girl," are generated using artificial intelligence, though they look, sound and move realistically.</p>

<p>They were created as part of an initiative dubbed "Operation Retweet" by Colombia-based organization Connectas, led by director Carlos Huertas, to publish news from a dozen independent media outlets in Venezuela and in the process protect reporters as the government has launched a crackdown on journalists and protesters.</p>

<p>"We decided to use artificial intelligence to be the 'face' of the information we're publishing," Huertas said in an interview, "because our colleagues who are still out doing their jobs are facing much more risk."</p>

<p>At least 10 journalists have been arrested since mid-June and eight remain imprisoned on charges including terrorism, according to Reporters Without Borders.</p>

<p>"Here, using artificial intelligence is... almost like a mix between technology and journalism," Huertas said, explaining the project looked to "circumvent the persecution and increasing repression" from the government as there would be no one who could face arrest.</p>

<p>The country's opposition and human rights groups have said recent arrests of protesters, opposition figures and journalists are part of a government crackdown meant to quiet a sometimes violent, month-long election dispute.</p>

<p>Venezuela's communications ministry did not respond to a request for comment about the AI journalism initiative. No official has responded to repeated requests for comment by Reuters about the arrests of journalists in recent weeks.</p>

<p>Both the opposition and President Nicolas Maduro claimed victory in the July 28 election.</p>

<p>Maduro, in power since 2013, is backed by the Supreme Court and the electoral authority, which has not published full vote tallies because of what it says was a cyber-attack.</p>

<p>The opposition has shared what it says are more than 80% of vote tallies, showing a resounding win for its candidate Edmundo Gonzalez. Some international observers and many Western countries have said election conditions were unfair and demanded full tallies.</p>

<p>Protests since the vote have led to at least 27 deaths and 2,400 arrests, and detentions of opposition figures and protesters have continued as part of the government's "Operation Knock Knock."</p>

<p>Maduro and his administration have called protesters fascists and said they are inciting hate at the behest of countries like the United States, which Washington denies.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hamas' armed wing said on Monday that since June the group has been operating under new instructions on how to handle hostages should Israeli forces approach their locations in Gaza.</p>

<p>The announcement comes days after the Israeli military recovered the bodies of six hostages from a tunnel in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, saying they had been shot dead by their captors as Israeli forces got close.</p>

<p>Abu Ubaida, spokesperson for Hamas' al-Qassam Brigades, did not provide details on what the instructions were. He said his group holds Israel responsible for the hostages' deaths.</p>

<p>The new instructions, Ubaida said, were given to guards of hostages after a rescue operation by Israel in June. At that time, Israeli forces freed four hostages in a raid in which dozens of Palestinians, including women and children, were killed.</p>

<p>"Netanyahu's insistence to free prisoners through military pressure, instead of sealing a deal, means they will be returned to their families in shrouds. Their families must choose whether they want them dead or alive," he said.</p>

<p>Later on Monday, the Hamas armed wing published a pre-recorded video of one of the six dead hostages. It was unclear when the video was made.</p>

<p>Netanyahu said in a press conference on Monday that the hostages had been shot in the back of the head, and promised that Hamas would pay a heavy price.</p>

<p>Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri said Netanyahu's accusations against Hamas were an attempt to escape responsibility for their deaths.</p>

<p>"Netanyahu killed the six prisoners and he is determined to kill the remaining ones. The Israelis should choose between Netanyahu or the deal," Abu Zuhri said.</p>

<p>Similarly, Ezzat El Rashq, a member of the Hamas political bureau, said in a statement published by the group on Monday: "The resistance's hostages can immediately return to their families, the [one] stalling their return and responsible for their lives is Netanyahu."</p>

<p>Israel and Hamas have failed to reach a deal that would end the war and see the release of Israeli and foreign hostages held by Hamas in Gaza in return for many Palestinians jailed by Israel.</p>

<p>Hamas wants an agreement to end the war and get Israeli forces out of Gaza while Netanyahu says the war can only end once Hamas is defeated.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

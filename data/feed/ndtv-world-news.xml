       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan's Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that lawmakers can vote separately from their parties on major issues, allowing parliamentary horse-trading as the government tries to rally support for constitutional reform.</p>

<p>Elections in February were marred by allegations of rigging that favoured Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who heads a shaky coalition lacking the two-thirds majority needed to change the constitution.</p>

<p>He is reportedly planning to give the executive more power over the judiciary, where dozens of cases are playing out against jailed opposition leader Imran Khan.</p>

<p>Thursday's ruling allows his government to court individual MPs for their votes and pressure lawmakers loyal to Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party for their support.</p>

<p>"This has cleared the way for them for the constitutional amendment," political analyst Zahid Hussain told AFP. "This is also being used by the ruling party to weaken PTI."</p>

<p>A 2022 Supreme Court decision said MPs crossing the aisle would have their ballots discounted on major votes including constitutional amendments, no-confidence votes and the election of prime ministers.</p>

<p>However, Thursday's ruling "unanimously" backtracked that ruling, Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa said in court, adding that a detailed verdict would be released later.</p>

<p>Opposition parties say the amendments proposed by Sharif's government would create a new court to rule on the constitution, with a head judge picked by the prime minister.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court and other Pakistani tribunals would be beholden to the new court's rulings.</p>

<p>"Not only would this constitutional amendment weaken the judiciary but also democracy and the constitution itself," said PTI lawyer Ali Zafar.</p>

<p>Khan was barred from contesting February's election and sidelined in jail on charges he says are politically motivated.</p>

<p>Candidates loyal to the former international cricket star became the biggest bloc in parliament after that election but fell short of the majority needed to rule.</p>

<p>Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) party sealed a deal to rule with other parties also considered close to the powerful military establishment.</p>

<p>However, PTI has been a vocal opposition force, holding regular street protests and needling the government in parliament.</p>

<p>Khan has seen his cases, many alleging corruption, ping-pong through different courts, one of which has openly alleged intimidation by state intelligence agencies.</p>

<p>The 71-year-old has been jailed for more than a year and PTI has called for fresh protests in the capital Islamabad on Friday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon's health minister said Thursday more than 40 rescuers and firefighters were killed by Israeli fire in three days, with 97 killed overall since Hezbollah and Israel began clashing last October.<br />
Firass Abiad told reporters that in three days 40 people "among those working in ambulances and fire trucks" were killed.</p>

<p>He said 97 "paramedics and firefighters" had been killed and 188 wounded since fighting began.</p>

<p>The toll includes rescuers in organisations affiliated with Hezbollah or other Lebanese parties.</p>

<p>Since the clashes began, 1,974 people have been killed by Israeli fire, including 127 children, he said, adding that more than 9,350 have been wounded.</p>

<p>After nearly a year of low-intensity cross-border fighting, Israel has shifted the focus of its operation from Gaza to Lebanon, where heavy bombing has forced hundreds of thousands to flee.</p>

<p>This week, Israel announced that its troops had started ground raids into parts of southern Lebanon, a stronghold of Hezbollah.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Swedish intelligence agency Sapo said Thursday that Iran may have been involved in explosions and gunfire around Israeli embassies in Sweden and Denmark this week.</p>

<p>In Denmark, police said they arrested three Swedish nationals on Wednesday after two blasts, likely caused by hand grenades, close to the Israeli embassy in Copenhagen.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the Israeli embassy in Stockholm was targeted in a shooting, according to Swedish police.</p>

<p>Asked about reports of links to Iran, Fredrik Hallstrom, head of operations at the Sapo agency, told a press conference that "there are some things that could point in that direction."</p>

<p>"In part due to the choice of targets and modus operandi, but that is an assumption rather than pure knowledge," Hallstrom said.</p>

<p>In May, Sapo said that Iran was recruiting members of Swedish criminal gangs to commit "acts of violence" against Israeli and other interests in Sweden - a claim Iran denied.</p>

<p>Swedish broadcaster SVT on Wednesday reported that it had received information that the two latest embassy attacks had been ordered by the Swedish criminal network Foxtrot -- at the behest of Iran.</p>

<p>A Danish court on Thursday remanded two of the arrested Swedes -- aged 16 and 19 -- in custody for 27 days.</p>

<p>Copenhagen police said that the third Swede, arrested near the crime scene, had been released.</p>

<p>Since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war in October 2023, several incidents apparently targeting Israeli interests in Sweden have been reported.</p>

<p>In February, police found a grenade on the grounds of the Israeli embassy compound, which the ambassador said was an attempted attack.</p>

<p>In May, gunshots were fired outside the Israeli embassy, which prompted the country to boost security measures around Israeli interests and Jewish community institutions.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Britain today said it will give up sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, but will keep its strategic joint military base with the US in Diego Garcia.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain today said it will give up sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, but will keep its strategic joint military base with the US in Diego Garcia.</p>

<p>"Following two years of negotiation, this is a seminal moment in our relationship and a demonstration of our enduring commitment to the peaceful resolution of disputes and the rule of law," the UK and Mauritius said in a joint statement today.</p>

<p>Negotiations have been conducted in a constructive and respectful manner, as equal sovereign states, on the basis of international law, and with the intention of resolving all outstanding issues between the United Kingdom and Mauritius concerning the Chagos Archipelago, including those relating to its former inhabitants, they said in the statement.</p>

<p>The political agreement is subject to the finalisation of a treaty and supporting legal instruments, which both sides have committed to complete as quickly as possible. Under the terms of this treaty, the UK will agree that Mauritius is sovereign over the Chagos Archipelago, including Diego Garcia.</p>

<p>"In resolving all outstanding issues between the United Kingdom and Mauritius, the treaty will open a new chapter in our shared history, one which will continue to be based on mutual respect and trust as close Commonwealth partners committed to the security and prosperity of the Indian Ocean Region. In reaching today's political agreement, we have enjoyed the full support and assistance of our close partners, the United States of America and the Republic of India," the joint statement said.</p>

<p>Britain has been under pressure for decades to hand over the Indian Ocean islands but has resisted because of the Diego Garcia base, a key installation used to help US operations across the Indian Ocean and Gulf regions.</p>

<p>"For the first time in more than 50 years, the status of the base will be undisputed and legally secure," the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden hailed the continuation of the Diego Garcia base on the largest island in the chain and was used during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>

<p>"I applaud the historic agreement and conclusion of the negotiations," President Biden said in a White House statement, adding that the site "plays a vital role in national, regional, and global security".</p>

<p>Britain decided in 1965 to separate the islands from its then colony of Mauritius and set up a military base there, which it leased to the US. In doing so, it evicted thousands of Chagos islanders who have since mounted a series of legal claims for compensation in the British courts.</p>

<p>Mauritius has claimed the archipelago -- renamed British Indian Ocean Territory -- since its independence in 1968. Mauritius Foreign Minister called the announcement of the accord "a day to remember" and a "seminal moment" in his country's relationship with Britain.</p>

<p>International calls for Britain to hand over one of its last remaining overseas territories have grown in recent years.</p>

<p>In 2019, the International Court of Justice asked Britain to hand over the remote islands. The same year, the UN General Assembly also voted for Britain to withdraw.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Young women from poor backgrounds in Indonesia are entering into short-term marriages with male tourists, primarily from the Middle East, in exchange for money.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A disturbing practice in Indonesian villages has sparked widespread condemnation online. According to the<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/article/3279641/short-term-us500-pleasure-marriage-practice-among-poor-rural-indonesia-women-condemned" rel="nofollow, noindex"> South China Morning Post</a></em>, young women from impoverished backgrounds are entering into short-term marriages with male tourists, primarily from the Middle East, in exchange for money. This phenomenon is prevalent in Puncak, a popular destination in West Indonesia, that attracts&nbsp;Arab tourists. Several visitors are exploiting local women through temporary marriages arranged by agencies in the mountain resort of Kota Bunga.</p>

<p>The arrangement involves the agencies introducing tourists to local women. Once both parties agree, they hold a quick, informal wedding ceremony, after which the man pays a bride price to the woman. In return, the woman provides sexual and domestic services during the tourist's stay. When the tourist departs, the marriage is dissolved.</p>

<p>According to a report by the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-09-11/indonesia-divorce-village-contract-marriage-sex-tourism">Los Angeles Times</a></em>, this&nbsp;controversial practice known as "pleasure marriages" has emerged as a lucrative industry, bolstering tourism and the local economy.&nbsp;Initially, family members or acquaintances facilitated introductions between tourists and local women. However, the growth of agencies specialising in these arrangements has institutionalised the practice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cahaya, a young Indonesian woman, shared her harrowing experience as a temporary wife. She told the <em>LA Times</em> that she has been married over 15 times to Middle Eastern tourists. Her first husband, a 50-year-old Saudi Arabian man, paid a bride price of $850 (Rs 71,412), but after agents and officials took their share, she received only half.&nbsp;Five days after the wedding, the man flew back home and they were ''divorced''. Cahaya revealed that she earns between $300 and $500 per marriage, which barely covers her rent and supports her ailing grandparents.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another woman, Nisa, broke free from this cycle after at least 20 temporary marriages. She met an Indonesian immigration officer, married him, and started a new life with two sons. Nisa vowed never to return to her past.</p>

<p>These temporary marriages, also known as nikah mut'ah are rooted in Shia Islam culture. However, the majority of scholars called such marriages ''unacceptable''. These temporary arrangements are also not recognised by Indonesian law, as they undermine the fundamental purpose of marriage.</p>

<p>This practice raises serious concerns about the exploitation of vulnerable women, sex tourism, and the lack of protection for women's rights. Critics and people on the internet slammed the practice, arguing that it perpetuates human trafficking, abuse, and exploitation, taking advantage of poverty-stricken communities.</p>

</div>

<p>The last two weeks have seen the Middle East teetering on a knife's edge. While tensions have been high since the Hamas attacks last October, the developments in the previous two weeks have been particularly concerning. Tensions began to rise on September 17 when the pagers used by Hezbollah members exploded all of a sudden, followed by similar explosions of other communication devices.</p>

<p>These events took place at a time when Israel shifted its attention towards its northern border with Lebanon. Since then, tensions have mounted with the killing of Hassan Nasrallah and other top Hezbollah commanders. Iran's airstrikes directly targeting Israel mark a dangerous point of escalation.<br />
As the threat of a larger regional war looms, is there a way out of this crisis? Negotiations for a ceasefire have been taking place for the past several months. Despite the efforts, we are nowhere close to a negotiated settlement. The heart of the matter is that Iran - along with its proxies and Israel - has taken a maximalist position on the negotiating table. This makes it far more difficult to arrive at a negotiated settlement.</p>

<h2><strong>Hezbollah Can't Take A U-Turn</strong></h2>

<p>Hezbollah entered the conflict almost immediately after the October 7 attacks last year. The group has aimed to put pressure on Israel by opening up another front alongside Gaza. It has linked negotiations with Israel to the ongoing situation there. Any peace settlement along Israel's northern frontiers will be dependent on a similar settlement in Gaza. Hezbollah and its leadership have pushed themselves into a corner by taking such a maximalist position on the issue. The Israeli leadership knows this and has steadily pushed the Hezbollah up an escalator ladder. From Hezbollah's point of view, any negotiation or compromise would mean a U-turn unless it is part of a larger settlement involving Gaza.</p>

<h2><strong>Iran In A Bind</strong></h2>

<p>Iran is also in a very delicate position. Like Hezbollah, the Iranian state has also linked negotiations with Israel to the ongoing situation in Gaza. More importantly, the developments over the last two weeks have significantly weakened Iran's larger strategic and security position. Militarily, Iran cannot match up to Israel. Hence, a conventional war against Israel is not in Iranian interests. Over the years, Iran has tried to overcome this challenge by building a network of proxies like Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen. While Hamas has been weakened significantly since the October 7 attacks, the last two weeks have also seen the Hezbollah being dealt a major blow. The 'axis of resistance' Iran had carefully built over the past several years has weakened substantially.</p>

<p>This puts the Iranian state in a precarious position. Though it would like to avoid escalation, it has little choice. The killing of Ismail Haniyeh on Iranian soil and the successful operation to take out Hassan Nasrallah came as major blows to Iranian prestige. Therefore, as many predicted, the regime had little choice but to launch a direct attack on Israel. With a weakened network of proxies, the Iranian regime would be cautious when approaching negotiations.</p>

<h2><strong>Why Israel Is Willing To Go Further</strong></h2>

<p>Israel has shown a greater willingness to escalate the conflict. Over the last two weeks, it has almost entirely taken out Hezbollah's top leadership and launched a ground operation in Lebanon. There are two factors why the Israeli state is taking a more maximalist stance. Firstly, Netanyahu's political future is precarious. Before the Hamas attack on October 7, there were clear indications of Netanyahu's falling popular support. From January to October last year, there were widespread protests against his government's proposed judicial reforms. These protests subsided only after the Hamas attacks.</p>

<p>Netanyahu faces an uncertain future once the conflict comes to an end. Continued conflict and further escalation would benefit him as they would preserve his authority. His popularity ratings have slowly risen as the war has dragged on. Therefore, from Netanyahu's perspective, there is little incentive to actively negotiate.</p>

<p>Secondly, over the last two weeks, Israel has gained the upper hand. With the Hezbollah and Hamas severely weakened, escalation would force Iran to get directly involved. This is in Israel's interests. Recent statements by former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett underscored Israel's stance. With Iran's proxies severely weakened, he views this as the ideal opportunity to change the Middle East's power balance. Given these realities, Israel is not likely to make a major compromise on the negotiating table.</p>

<h2><strong>Negotiation Is Difficult, But Possible</strong></h2>

<p>With all sides taking a maximalist position, does this mean a negotiated settlement is impossible? Not really. While it may be difficult, it is within the realm of possibility. The key will be to find off-ramps for the various parties involved. The US, in particular, will have a crucial role to play. In April this year, when Iran launched a similar attack on Israel, the US played a decisive role in convincing Israel to tone down its retaliation. Can the Biden administration pull off something similar? That would then offer a good starting point to begin the negotiations. The next few days are going to be crucial for the region. If further escalation is averted, bringing all parties to the negotiating table is possible.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon's state-run media said three Israeli air strikes hit Hezbollah's south Beirut stronghold on Thursday, the latest raids following a night of intense bombardment.</p>

<p>"Enemy aircraft launched three strikes on (Beirut's) southern suburbs," the official National News Agency (NNA) reported.</p>

<p>A source close to the group told AFP the strike "targeted a building housing Hezbollah's media relations office," which had already been "evacuated".</p>

<p>This week, Israel announced that its troops had started "ground raids" into parts of southern Lebanon, a stronghold of Hezbollah, after days of heavy bombardment of areas across the country where the militant group holds sway.</p>

<p>After nearly a year of low-intensity cross-border fighting, Israel has shifted the focus of its operation from Gaza to Lebanon, where heavy bombing has killed more than 1,000 people and forced hundreds of thousands to flee.</p>

<p>Last week, Israel killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in the group's southern Beirut bastion, a densely packed residential area before residents fled the violence.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Palestinians fear the crisis in Lebanon is diverting the world's attention from Gaza, where Israeli strikes killed dozens more people this week, and diminishing already dim prospects for a ceasefire a year into a war that has shattered the enclave.</p>

<p>An escalation in the conflict between Israel and Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah over the past two weeks has led to clashes between Israeli and Hezbollah forces inside Lebanon and fueled fears of a wider regional war.</p>

<p>Both Israel and its Hamas foes in Gaza say the Lebanon conflict could help end the Gaza conflict, but some analysts, officials from mediating countries, and Gazans, are sceptical.</p>

<p>"The focus is on Lebanon, which means the war in Gaza isn't ending anytime soon," Hussam Ali, a 45-year-old Gaza City resident who said his family had been displaced seven times since the conflict between Israel and Hamas began on Oct. 7 last year, told Reuters via a chat app.</p>

<p>When Iran launched ballistic missiles at Israel late on Tuesday, provoking an Israeli promise of a "painful" response, some Gazans welcomed the salvo visible in the skies overhead as a sign Tehran was fighting for their cause.</p>

<p>Sami Abu Zuhri, a senior Hamas official, said prospects for a Gaza ceasefire deal, which would see the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza and Palestinians jailed by Israel, were distant before the escalation in Lebanon. A regional conflagration could lead to pressure on Israel to strike a deal in Gaza, he said.</p>

<p>But with attention swinging to Lebanon, the war in Gaza risked being prolonged, said Ashraf Abouelhoul, managing editor of state-owned newspaper Al-Ahram in Egypt, which has helped to mediate months of ceasefire negotiations.</p>

<p>"The most dangerous thing isn't that the media attention is going somewhere else, it is the fact that no one in the world is now talking about a deal or a ceasefire, and that frees Israel's hand to continue its military offensive and plans in Gaza," he said.</p>

<p><strong>STALLED TALKS</strong></p>

<p>Inside Gaza there has been no sign of a let-up in Israel's offensive against Hamas. On Thursday, local medics reported at least 99 Palestinian deaths in the past 24 hours.</p>

<p>Egypt, which has been alarmed by the Israeli offensive on the other side of its border with Gaza and has lost billions of dollars in Suez Canal revenues during the war, is frustrated that its mediation efforts have failed to secure a truce.</p>

<p>US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters that the US remained focused on securing a ceasefire though Hamas had for weeks "refused to engage".</p>

<p>Hamas officials and Western diplomats said in August that negotiations had stalled due to new Israeli demands to keep troops in Gaza.</p>

<p>"Whereas Israel has been saying since Oct. 7 that military force and putting pressure on Hamas and Hezbollah will help to bring the hostages home we have seen that the exact opposite is true," said Nomi Bar-Yaacov, an expert on Middle East diplomacy at London-based think-tank Chatham House.</p>

<p>Israel's escalated campaign against Hezbollah "is putting the ceasefire in Gaza on the back burner, given that the focus is now on trying to dismantle as much of Hezbollah's military arsenal as possible," she said.</p>

<p>An official briefed on the Gaza ceasefire talks told Reuters nothing would happen until after the US presidential election on Nov. 5, "because nobody can effectively pressure (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu, which is the key impediment to a Gaza ceasefire deal".</p>

<p>The official said that during UN General Assembly meetings last week Hezbollah wanted a proposal for a 21-day ceasefire with Israel to be linked to a ceasefire deal in Gaza, but Israel rejected this and the plan was dropped. Top Israeli officials publicly dismissed the idea of a quick ceasefire with Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Israel's killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah last week complicated chances for mediation, two Egyptian security sources said. Egypt's efforts became limited to containing any further escalation, the sources said.</p>

<p><strong>ROCKETS</strong></p>

<p>Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel at the start of the Gaza war in support of Hamas, causing the evacuation of tens of thousands of residents whom Israel says need to return home.</p>

<p>In Lebanon, nearly 1,900 people have been killed and more than 9,000 wounded in Lebanon in nearly a year of cross-border fighting, with most of the deaths occurring in the past two weeks, according to Lebanese government statistics.</p>

<p>More than a million Lebanese have been forced to flee their homes.</p>

<p>The casualty figures are still a fraction of those in Gaza, where the health ministry says at least 41,788 Palestinians have been killed and 96,794 wounded since Oct. 7 last year.</p>

<p>The Gaza war began after Hamas led a shock incursion into Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostage, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>"We feel for the people of Lebanon and we don't want them to go through the devastation and starvation we are enduring," said Ghada, a 50-year-old mother of five living in a tent in the central Gaza city of Deir Al-Balah, where a million people are sheltering.</p>

<p>"I am afraid the world has become less interested in what happens to us here."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A massive sinkhole suddenly appeared on a main road in Johar Town, Lahore, swallowing three vehicles - a car and two motorcycles - and causing major traffic disruptions. Two people, who were trapped inside the car when the sinkhole suddenly formed, sustained injuries but were rescued with the help of nearby residents, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.geo.tv/latest/566765-watch-massive-lahore-sinkhole-swallows-three-vehicles">Geo News</a></em> reported. They were taken to a hospital. According to the Lahore Development Authority (LDA), the sinkhole was caused by an underground sewer line leakage, which weakened the road over time.</p>

<p>Pictures and<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://x.com/ShirazHassan/status/1840764018845245451/video/1"> videos </a>of the incident have gone viral on social media, showing locals helping the trapped commuters.&nbsp;</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The incident prompted swift action from the Chief Traffic Officer (CTO) of Lahore, who diverted traffic from the affected area, leading to increased congestion on alternative routes. A traffic response unit was also deployed to mitigate the situation.</p>

<p>This is not an isolated incident, as Johar Town has experienced multiple sinkholes in recent months, causing injuries and damage. Notably, the area's infrastructure has been severely impacted by record-breaking rains in August, damaging drainage systems and roads, particularly in Khayaban-i-Firdausi. Residents and commuters are urging authorities to address the recurring infrastructure issues and improve road safety.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“The road has become extremely dangerous for motorists, as sinkholes can emerge at any time, putting lives at risk. Look at this incident – the car fell in, injuring the driver and his friend,” a witness told&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1862231/three-injured-as-car-bike-fall-into-sinkhole" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dawn</a>.</em></p>

<p>A sinkhole is a depression or hole in the ground that forms when a layer of soil or rock is removed or collapses, often suddenly and without warning. This phenomenon can occur due to various natural or human-induced reasons, including karst terrain, groundwater, weathering, and earthquakes, as well as mining, drilling, construction, and water leakage. Sinkholes can vary greatly in size, from small depressions to massive craters, and can extend hundreds of feet in depth, posing significant risks to structures, infrastructure, and human life.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US teenager has been arrested on charges of using a hidden camera in a mall toilet to record numerous women and at least four minors. The incident occurred at the Newport Centre Mall in Jersey City, where officials reported that the 18-year-old, Andy Cardenas, now faced a charge of invasion of privacy.</p>

<p>“On Friday, August 9, 2024, an adult female discovered a black device while using the family restroom located on the first floor of JC Penney,” the Hudson County prosecutor's office said in a press release.</p>

<p>Upon discovering the concealed device, she promptly handed it to the authorities, leading to an investigation by the Hudson County prosecutor's office.</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>According to a report by a <a href="https://www.nj.com/hudson/2024/10/dozens-of-women-and-4-girls-filmed-by-hidden-camera-inside-bathroom-at-nj-mall-teen-is-arrested.html">local news outlet</a>, authorities reviewed the footage obtained through a communications data warrant and discovered “approximately 35 videos of adult women who were exposed using the restroom, approximately four videos of female minors who were exposed using the restroom, and one video of a male and woman in the restroom together engaging in sexual acts,” as stated in Cardenas' criminal complaint.</p>

<p>Crucially, the footage also captured a male figure — later identified as Cardenas — setting up the hidden camera inside the JC Penney toilet. This led to his identification and arrest.</p>

<p>Authorities are still piecing together the timeline of the suspect's activities, as the footage lacks any dates or timestamps. They are also uncertain about the locations where all the videos were filmed. To identify more potential victims, the prosecutor's office has released images of four unrecognised restrooms.</p>

<p>The Hudson County prosecutor's office said, “Multiple electronic/digital files were recovered from the recording device, which contained images from several unidentified restrooms. The Special Victims Unit is seeking the public's help identifying the location of the restrooms in the attached photos. It is not yet known how long the recording device was being utilised.”<br />
<br />
Cardenas was arrested on October 1 and released on a summons pending his first court appearance, which is tentatively scheduled for October 22, stated the press release.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Avida Bachar runs his hands across the steel surface of a door that is pierced with bullet holes and is still stained by his son Carmel's blood, nearly a year after the 15-year-old was killed during Hamas' October 7 attack on southern Israel.</p>

<p>Bachar also lost his wife Dana that day, when the operatives stormed through their home at Kibbutz Be'eri, setting fire to houses and killing or kidnapping men, women and children. In all, the kibbutz, a tight-knit community just three miles (five km) from Gaza, lost about a tenth of its roughly 1,000 residents.</p>

<p>Bachar's family, like most others on the kibbutz, took shelter in the safe room when Hamas started firing rockets from Gaza into Israel that morning.</p>

<p>But kibbutz safe rooms were built to protect residents against rockets - not a ground assault by dozens of heavily armed men who shot through the steel door, threw grenades through the window and set Bachar's home ablaze.</p>

<p>"I miss them endlessly," 51-year-old Bachar said of his wife and son. "(The pain) doesn't fade or subside. It's strong, all the time."</p>

<p>But Bachar, who lost a leg in the attack, remains hopeful that Kibbutz Be'eri can still heal in time. He is sustained in his optimism by his daughter Hadar, now 14, who was wounded in the attack.</p>

<p>"Hadar is okay. Hadar is 10 times stronger than me. Kids see the here and now. I imagine Hadar getting married in a few years without her mother by her side and I fall apart," he added.</p>

<p>Bachar returned to Be'eri after a six-month hospitalisation and is now busy overseeing the jojoba harvest and getting used to his prosthetic leg. "In two weeks we start to harvest the avocado," he said, donning an 'I Love Be'eri' T-shirt.</p>

<p><strong>SAFE HAVEN</strong></p>

<p>Be'eri was established in 1946 with the aim of creating a collective, egalitarian farming community. Its main source of income these days is its print shop, which was back up and running just weeks after the Hamas attack.</p>

<p>In the aftermath of Oct. 7, most of its surviving residents were evacuated to a hotel by the Dead Sea. A few have now gone back to live on the kibbutz, where many houses still stand damaged by the grenades and gunfire, ransacked, or burnt.</p>

<p>"This place will flourish again and we will recover with it. If I fast-forward three or four years ahead, I have no doubt we will be in a better place," said Bachar.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, his daughter Hadar is staying with her aunt, until Bachar can join her, at the temporary residence being built for the community in Hatzerim, a kibbutz in the Negev desert, around 18 miles (29 km) away.</p>

<p>Close to 70% of Kibbutz Be'eri's surviving population, mostly families, have moved to Hatzerim since the start of the school year in September, said Iftah Celniker, Be'eri's community director.</p>

<p>Keeping the community together while uprooted has been their main challenge, said Celniker. But the ties between the kibbutz members remain strong while the houses in Be'eri are being torn down and rebuilt.</p>

<p>It could take many months before they all go back to Be'eri. "It will take time not only to build Be'eri but to build the confidence of it being a safe haven," said Celniker.</p>

<p>Hamas operatives killed 1,200 people and took some 250 hostages in their Oct. 7 rampage, according to Israeli tallies, prompting an Israeli military offensive in which Gaza health officials say more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed.</p>

<p><strong>'OUR PLACE TO FIGHT FOR'</strong></p>

<p>Anger still smoulders among Be'eri residents towards the Israeli army for failing to protect their kibbutz and towards the government, which many say is not doing enough to bring back the 101 hostages still held in Gaza, at least half of whom are believed to be still alive. The operatives took 10 hostages from Be'eri, of whom at least three are thought to be still alive.</p>

<p>One of the killed hostages from Be'eri is Carmel Gat, 40, whose body was found in a Hamas tunnel in southern Gaza with five other hostages. The gunmen killed the six people when they spotted Israeli soldiers in the vicinity, authorities said.</p>

<p>Gat had survived in captivity until the end of August. Hostages who had been with her and were released during a brief November truce said she had helped them get through their time in captivity with yoga and meditation.</p>

<p>Gat's mother Kinneret was killed by Hamas on Oct. 7 in the kibbutz. Her sister-in-law was kidnapped and released in November.</p>

<p>A banner with a photo of a smiling Carmel hangs over the wreckage of the family home at Be'eri, as her younger brother Or sifts through the family belongings in the ravaged house.</p>

<p>Outside, a pomegranate hangs off a tree with no one to pick it. The fruit is a traditional food of the Jewish new year which begins on Thursday. Despite his family's ordeal, Or can still see a future in which he one day raises a family in Be'eri.</p>

<p>"Our safety will never be the same again but this is the place for all of our life, for the happiest moments and the horrible moments - this is our place to live in, our place to fight for," Or Gat said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thousands of Bank of America customers encountered difficulties accessing their online accounts on Wednesday afternoon, as the bank experienced a large-scale outage. Customers took to social media to report issues, stating they were unable to view their account balances. Even more concerning, some users who managed to access their accounts found their balances displayed as $0, sparking widespread alarm and concern.</p>

<p>Reports of problems spiked around 12:45 pm ET on Downdetector, a platform that tracks outages. Complains about the issue flooded in from major cities like New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Dallas, Phoenix, Houston, and Chicago, according to Downdetector's outage map</p>

<p>Affected customers received error messages stating "accounts temporarily unavailable" or "some accounts and balances are temporarily unavailable".&nbsp;For many, a ''Connection Error'' message popped up while trying to log into the banking app. The message said it was ''unable to complete your request'' and asked the user to ''try again later.''</p>

<p>Customers affected by the Bank of America outage flocked to social media platforms, including X (formerly Twitter) and Reddit, to share their experiences and seek confirmation that others were facing similar issues.&nbsp;Frustrated customers also expressed challenges in reaching Bank of America's customer service, citing long wait times, unsuccessful attempts to contact representatives, and automated messages with no resolution.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Mushtaha was one of Hamas' most senior operatives and had a direct impact on decisions relating to Hamas' force deployment," said the military in a statement.</p>

<p>The military called Mushtaha the "right-hand man" to Hamas's top leader Yahya Sinwar.</p>

<p>In 2015, the US State Department had designated Mushtaha as a "specially designated global terrorist".</p>

<p>The European Council on Foreign Relations described Mushtaha as a member of Hamas's Gaza politburo who also oversaw its financial affairs.</p>

<p>The ECFR said Siraj was a politburo member, while Oudeh was said to be the leader of the group's internal security agency.</p>

<p>Israel's military campaign to wipe out Hamas is believed to have severely weakened the group by killing several of its leaders and thousands of fighters, while also reducing swaths of the territory it rules to rubble.</p>

<p>The Gaza war was sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack, which resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures that include hostages killed in captivity.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 41,788 people in Gaza, the majority of them civilians, according to figures provided by the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. The UN has described the figures as reliable.</p>

<p>"Mushtaha was one of Hamas' most senior operatives and had a direct impact on decisions relating to Hamas' force deployment," said the military in a statement.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The speaker of Georgia's parliament on Thursday signed into law a bill similar to Russian legislation that curbs the rights of LGBTQ people, despite warnings from the EU.</p>

<p>The move came a day after Georgia's pro-Western president Salome Zurabishvili -- at loggerheads with the ruling Georgian Dream party -- refused to sign the bill.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The bill is similar to Moscow's "gay propaganda" law, which also bans gender reassignment and nullifies same-sex marriages performed abroad or on Georgian territory.</p>

<p>"In conformity with the constitution, I signed today the law 'on family values and the protection of minors', which Salome Zurabishvili didn't sign," speaker Shalva Papuashvili said on Facebook.</p>

<p>The ruling Georgian Dream pushed the bill through parliament last month, a vote boycotted by the opposition and which has fuelled tensions ahead of crucial October 26 parliamentary elections.</p>

<p>Papuashvili said the measure "is based on common sense, historical experience and centuries-old Christian, Georgian, and European values, rather than on changeable ideas and ideologies".</p>

<p>He claimed that the "law protects the rights of all citizens".</p>

<p>But rights group and Western countries have said that it is discriminatory and creates a dangerous environment for LGBTQ people.</p>

<p>Last month, a well-known Georgian transgender woman was stabbed to death, an attack that came during the push for the law.</p>

<p>The bill also comes after Tbilisi's recent adoption of an anti-NGO "foreign influence law", which triggered weeks of mass anti-government protests and Western condemnation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Critics accuse the ruling Georgian Dream party of moving closer into the Kremlin's orbit and jeopardising Georgia's bid for EU membership.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba will propose a new happiness index during his first parliamentary policy speech on Friday, local media have reported.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba will propose a new happiness index during his first parliamentary policy speech on Friday, local media have reported.</p>

<p>The index, formulated by the public and private sectors, is expected to be proposed alongside Ishiba's plans for the economy and tackling the country's shrinking population.</p>

<p>Ishiba, 67, became prime minister on Tuesday after winning a tightly contested ruling party leadership vote last week.</p>

<p>He has said he intends to call a snap election for October 27 to shore up his mandate for policies, such as increased support for regional governments and low-income households.</p>

<p>It is unclear how his speech will address foreign policy matters, but public broadcaster NHK and other outlets reported on Thursday that Ishiba will likely renew vows to fight inflation and announce a plan for a new monetary stimulus package.</p>

<p>The yen surged last Friday after the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) voted Ishiba leader, because he had broadly backed the Bank of Japan's exit from its ultra-loose policies.</p>

<p>But Ishiba told reporters late Wednesday that he did not think the environment was right for further interest rate hikes, sending the Japanese currency south again.</p>

<p>The premier will also announce plans to increase Japan's average minimum wage to 1,500 yen ($10.22) by 2030, from the current 1,055 yen, local media reported.</p>

<p>These attempts to shore up per-capita GDP in the world's number-four economy are part of his vision to raise the public's level of happiness, they said.</p>

<p>He is also expected to call the rapidly ageing population a "silent crisis" that "affects the core of our nation", according to NHK.</p>

<p>Ishiba will reportedly discuss plans to launch a new disaster management ministry in the earthquake and flood-prone country, as well as stressing the importance of nuclear energy.</p>

<p>Nuclear power is a divisive topic in Japan, supported by the business lobby but with the public still wary after the 2011 tsunami-triggered catastrophe in Fukushima.</p>

<p>Takahide Kiuchi, executive economist at Nomura Research Institute and a former Bank of Japan board member, said Ishiba's speech would "likely to be made with a strong awareness of the upcoming general election".</p>

<p>"It appears that the Ishiba government is prioritising winning the election and consolidating its base of power," he said.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Elon Musk secretly funded a conservative political group in recent years, according to four people familiar with his donations.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk secretly funded a conservative political group in recent years, according to four people familiar with his donations, illustrating quiet financial support for right-wing causes even before the billionaire entrepreneur in July endorsed former President Donald Trump's bid for re-election.</p>

<p>Two of the people familiar with the donations told Reuters that Musk's contributions to the organization, Building America's Future, had started by 2022. One of those people and a third source said the donations amounted to millions of dollars, significantly boosting a group whose advertisements and social media campaigns have criticized the Biden administration and progressive political platforms of the sort that Musk himself has increasingly denounced.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Reuters was unable to determine a precise amount and timeline for the contributions or identify documentation linking the organization's finances to Musk. Earlier on Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Musk had financed other pro-Republican groups.</p>

<p>Musk didn't respond to emails seeking comment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Building America's Future didn't respond, either.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The magnate behind ventures including carmaker Tesla, space contractor SpaceX and the social media platform X, Musk for many years was careful to avoid suggestions that he favoured either major U.S. political party. As recently as March, months before he publicly backed Trump and announced plans to finance a political action committee to work against Democrats, he wrote on social media: "Just to be super clear, I am not donating money to either candidate for US President."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Donations to Building America's Future, however, would show he was already using his vast resources to fund right-wing causes. As a non-profit 501(c)(4) group, the organization isn't required by federal law to disclose its financial backers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although such groups aren't allowed to finance candidates' political campaigns, they can espouse political causes. As such, they are commonly referred to as "dark money" groups - used by political operatives, Democrats and Republicans alike, to hide the financial origins of influence campaigns.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Musk's case, the four people familiar with his donations told Reuters, the contributions to Building America's Future remained closely guarded. Three of the people were briefed on the donations by executives at or linked to the organization and the fourth was consulted on the matter by a Musk aide.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All spoke with Reuters on the condition that they not be identified by name.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>"STOP CACKLING KAMALA"</strong></h3>

<p>Revenues at Building America's Future, according to government data, climbed from some $11 million in 2021 to about $53 million in 2022, the year two of the people said Musk had already started his donations. The figures are the most recent available from the Internal Revenue Service, which requires tax-exempt organizations to disclose their revenues. &nbsp;</p>

<p>It's unclear whether Musk still funds the organization or how much in total he may have donated.</p>

<p>Over the last two years, Building America's Future has attacked the Biden administration on a host of topics, including illegal immigration, an issue that Musk frequently comments on. One recent anti-immigration video posted online by the group claims that Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump's opponent in the November election, "led the invasion" of migrants across the Mexican border and has always "put illegals first."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Building America's Future also recently launched a $10 million advertising campaign meant to undermine Black support for Harris, according to an August report by NBC News. The campaign criticizes the White House's effort to ban menthol cigarettes. Research shows that cigarettes, long marketed to African Americans, are even more dangerous to smokers' health than regular tobacco.</p>

<p>"Instead of focusing on important issues," one video says, "Biden's priority is banning menthol cigarettes," trying to tell adults "what they can and cannot do."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Musk's political leanings have moved rightward in recent years.</p>

<p>Although he has said he has voted for Democratic presidential candidates including Biden and Hillary Clinton, Musk became an outspoken critic of the current administration, claiming the White House gave a "very cold shoulder" to Tesla and SpaceX. A White House spokesperson declined to comment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Musk, ranked by Forbes as the world's richest individual, has also become a fierce critic of identity politics. He has used his frequent posts on X to propagate demonstrably false conspiracy theories about Jewish people, immigrants and looming "civil war" in Britain.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After Musk's recent embrace of Trump, the former president said if elected he would put Musk in charge of a government efficiency commission.&nbsp;</p>

<p>America PAC, a political action committee Musk recently said he is financing, as of this week has spent $77 million on a get-out-the-vote campaign to encourage infrequent voters to support Trump, according to federal electoral filings. Musk's exact financial contribution to America PAC is unclear.</p>

<p>In addition to their Musk link, America PAC and Building America's Future overlap in terms of personnel, according to electoral filings and people familiar with the operations of both groups. One of those people is Generra Peck, a former campaign manager for Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and now one of the key leaders at America PAC. Peck didn't respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like Building America's Future, America PAC's messaging has featured aggressive personal criticisms of Harris. Flyers distributed by the group in Arizona, reviewed by Reuters, feature photos of the vice president laughing and read: "stop cackling Kamala."&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The moon blotted out most of the sun across the Pacific Ocean on Wednesday afternoon, giving just a few specks of land an impressive annular "ring of fire" eclipse.</p>

<p>Only Easter Island and a small area near the southern tip of Chile and Argentina witnessed an annular eclipse, lasting just a few minutes.</p>

<p>"The ring of fire is a once-in-a-lifetime experience," Rocio Garcia, a tourist on Easter Island told Reuters on Tuesday. "Especially here in Rapa Nui with the Moai in the background it will be spectacular."</p>

<p>An annular eclipse happens when the moon is too far away from Earth to completely blot out the sun, like a total eclipse, creating a dark silhouette surrounded by a bright ring of light called an antumbra, or more casually, a "ring of fire".</p>

<p>As the sun darkened over the island on Wednesday afternoon, people gathered outdoors, chanted, played music, and wore special eyewear to catch a glimpse of the eclipse.</p>

<p>"I got excited when people were shouting. Everybody's fervor made it more exciting," said Alejandra Astudillo, an Easter Island resident.</p>

<p>An estimated 175,000 people live in the path of the eclipse's annularity, giving far-flung residents and eclipse-chasing tourists a stunning view.</p>

<p>"It was an extraordinary phenomenon that's not often seen," said Esteban Sanchez in Las Horquetas, Argentina, one of the few towns in the eclipse's direct path. "This is the first time I've seen that and it was really good."</p>

<p>The southern half of South America, along with parts of Antarctica and Hawaii, saw a partial eclipse according to a map plotted out by NASA.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A month ahead of the US election, with campaigning at a peak, former President Donald Trump's automated messages have sparked a viral reaction with an Indian user receiving an update today.</p>

<p>The tweet, from the former President's X (formerly Twitter) handle, was directed at Roshan Rai, who describes himself as an Indian first and "cricketoholic" in his bio.</p>

<p>"I'll send you IMPORTANT ELECTION UPDATES for North Carolina. Make sure you are ready to VOTE FOR DONALD J. TRUMP by November 5th. Reply #stop to opt-out" it read.</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>To this, Roshan Rai quipped, "Thanks, but you will never be my President. Kamala Harris will never be my President either. &nbsp;Actually, I am from India."</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

— Roshan Rai (@RoshanKrRaii) <a href="https://twitter.com/RoshanKrRaii/status/1841721658496741760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Mr Rai's retort has drawn the attention of several Internet users. It also shows the unexpected reach of Trump's automated messaging system beyond American borders, thereby highlighting the impact of Trump's social media strategy, which has been a hallmark of his political approach since 2015.</p>

<p>The X exchange raises questions about the appropriateness of such outreach to international audiences. A study by the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w24631">National Bureau of Economic Research</a> in 2018, indicated that bots played a critical role in swaying votes during the 2016 elections and Twitter bots may have boosted Donald Trump's votes by a good 3.23%.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As Trump gears up for the upcoming election next month after having survived not one, but two assassination attempts, his reliance on social media continues to draw both criticism and amusement from users worldwide. Earlier this year, in August, Trump had taken to social media to express his approval for pop star Taylor Swift's faux endorsement of himself, using AI-generated images. However, this soon turned into an &nbsp;"I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT" post on social media following Swift's actual endorsement of Trump's rival Kamala Harris.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Months after US Vice President Kamala Harris' husband Douglas Emhoff admitted to having an extra-marital affair during his first marriage, a report has claimed that he allegedly slapped his ex-girlfriend for "flirting" with a valet worker.</p>

<p>The report, published by a British tabloid on Wednesday, said that Second Gentleman allegedly struck the woman, a New York attorney, in the face while waiting in a valet line late at night after the Cannes Film Festival event in France in May 2012.</p>

<p>The report, citing the woman's friends, said the woman had been dating Emhoff, a lawyer, for three months when the incident took place.</p>

<p>Earlier in August, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/kamala-harris-husband-admits-to-cheating-on-1st-wife-with-childs-teacher-6258995" target="_blank">Emhoff</a>, 59, acknowledged that he had an affair during his first marriage (with Kerstin) after the alleged details of the relationship were published by a British tabloid.</p>

<p>"During my first marriage, Kerstin and I went through some tough times on account of my actions. I took responsibility, and in the years since, we worked through things as a family and have come out stronger on the other side," Emhoff said in a statement provided exclusively to CNN.</p>

<p>His acknowledgment came after a British tabloid reported that <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-presidential-election-2024-kamala-harris-husband-says-hes-never-won-a-debate-against-his-wife-6509524" target="_blank">Emhoff</a> had an affair with a teacher who worked at a school his children attended and that resulted in the end of his first marriage.</p>

<p>It was reported that the woman became pregnant and that, according to a close friend, she "did not keep the child."</p>

<p>Emhoff and Kerstin ended their marriage in 2009 and have two children - Cole and Ella.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After Iran's missile attack on Israel on Tuesday, there is speculation that Israel could strike Iran's nuclear facilities as it has long threatened to do.</p>

<p>Below are some of Iran's main nuclear facilities.</p>

<h3><strong>URANIUM ENRICHMENT AT ITS HEART</strong></h3>

<p>Iran's nuclear programme is spread over many locations. While the threat of Israeli airstrikes has loomed for decades, only some of the sites have been built underground.</p>

<p>The United States and the UN nuclear watchdog believe Iran had a coordinated, secret nuclear weapons programme that it halted in 2003. The Islamic Republic denies ever having had one or planning to have one.</p>

<p>Iran agreed to restrictions on its nuclear activities in exchange for relief from international sanctions under a 2015 deal with world powers. That pact fell apart after then-President Donald Trump pulled out of the United States in 2018 and Iran started abandoning the restrictions the next year.</p>

<p>Iran has been expanding its uranium enrichment programme ever since, reducing the so-called "breakout time" it would need to produce enough weapons-grade uranium for a nuclear bomb to a matter of weeks from at least a year under the 2015 accord.</p>

<p>Actually making a bomb with that material would take longer. How long is less clear and the subject of debate.</p>

<p>Iran is now enriching uranium to up to 60% fissile purity, close to 90% of weapons-grade, at two sites, and in theory, it has enough material enriched to that level, if enriched further, for almost four bombs, according to a yardstick of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the U.N. watchdog.</p>

<h3><strong>NATANZ</strong></h3>

<p>A complex at the heart of Iran's enrichment programme on a plain abutting mountain outside the Shi'ite Muslim holy city of Qom, south of Tehran. Natanz houses facilities including two enrichment plants: the vast, underground Fuel Enrichment Plant (FEP) and the above-ground Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant (PFEP).</p>

<p>An exiled Iranian opposition group revealed in 2002 that Iran was secretly building Natanz, igniting a diplomatic standoff between the West and Iran over its nuclear intentions that continues today.</p>

<p>The FEP was built for enrichment on a commercial scale, able to house 50,000 centrifuges. Around 14,000 centrifuges are currently installed there, roughly 11,000 of which are in operation, refining uranium to up to 5% purity.</p>

<p>Diplomats with knowledge of Natanz describe the FEP as being about three floors below ground. There has long been debate about how much damage Israeli airstrikes could do to it.</p>

<p>Damage has been done to centrifuges at the FEP by other means, including an explosion and power cut in April 2021 that Iran said was an attack by Israel.</p>

<p>The above-ground PFEP houses only a few hundred centrifuges but Iran is enriching to up to 60% purity there.</p>

<h3><strong>FORDOW</strong></h3>

<p>On the opposite side of Qom, Fordow is an enrichment site dug into a mountain and therefore probably better protected from potential bombardment than the FEP.</p>

<p>The 2015 deal with major powers did not allow Iran to enrich Fordow at all. It now has more than 1,000 centrifuges operating there, a fraction of them advanced IR-6 machines enriching to up to 60%.</p>

<p>In addition, Iran recently doubled the number of centrifuges installed at Fordow, with all the new ones being IR-6 machines.</p>

<p>The United States, Britain and France announced in 2009 that Iran had been secretly building Fordow for years and had failed to inform the IAEA. US President Barack Obama said then: "The size and configuration of this facility is inconsistent with a peaceful programme."</p>

<h3><strong>ISFAHAN</strong></h3>

<p>Iran has a large nuclear technology centre on the outskirts of Isfahan, its second-largest city.</p>

<p>It includes the Fuel Plate Fabrication Plant (FPFP) and the uranium conversion facility (UCF) that can process uranium into the uranium hexafluoride that is fed into centrifuges.</p>

<p>There is equipment at Isfahan to make uranium metal, a process that is particularly proliferation-sensitive since it can be used to devise the core of a nuclear bomb.</p>

<p>The IAEA has said there are machines for making centrifuge parts at Isfahan, describing it in 2022 as a "new location".</p>

<h3><strong>KHONDAB</strong></h3>

<p>Iran has a partially built heavy-water research reactor originally called Arak and now Khondab. Heavy-water reactors pose a nuclear proliferation risk because they can easily produce plutonium which, like enriched uranium, can be used to make the core of an atom bomb.</p>

<p>Under the 2015 deal, construction was halted, and the reactor's core was removed and filled with concrete to make it unusable. The reactor was to be redesigned "to minimise the production of plutonium and not to produce weapon-grade plutonium in normal operation". Iran has informed the IAEA that it plans to bring the reactor online in 2026.</p>

<h3><strong>TEHRAN RESEARCH CENTRE</strong></h3>

<p>Iran's nuclear research facilities in Tehran include a research reactor.</p>

<h3><strong>BUSHEHR</strong></h3>

<p>Iran's only operating nuclear power plant, on the Gulf Coast, uses Russian fuel that Russia then takes back when it is spent, reducing the proliferation risk.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

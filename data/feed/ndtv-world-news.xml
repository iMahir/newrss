       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A former chief executive officer (CEO) of a US bank has been sentenced to more than 24 years in federal prison for embezzling $47 million in a cryptocurrency fraud scheme. According to <em>CNBC</em>, Shan Hanes, the former Heartland Tri-State Bank CEO, fell for a "pig butchering" scam that had him purchasing crypto "to unlock the supposed returns on his investments," which he never received. The 53-year-old orchestrated a series of wire transfers over just eight weeks last year that led to the collapse and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) takeover of Heartland Tri-State Bank in Elkhart, one of only five US banks that failed in 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pig butchering scams have become increasingly common in recent years. This scam usually involves a scammer finding and contacting a victim through a messaging app, dating app or a social media platform. They then try to form a relationship with their victim before eventually luring them into making a series of crypto investments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/21/cryptocurrency-shan-hanes-pig-butchering-scam.html" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>CNBC</em></a>, Mr Hanes, from May to June 2023, made a series of wire transfers using the bank's funds. He also embezzled money from a local church, an investment club and his daughter's college savings account. The scammers reportedly duped him into buying cryptocurrency, insisting that they needed more funds to unlock the supposed return on his investments. However, the 53-year-old never realised any profit, and lost all of the money he stole, as a result of the scam.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last week, US District Judge John Broomes sentenced Mr Hanes to 24 years in prison - 29 months more than what prosecutors requested after he pleaded guilty in May to a single count of embezzlement by a bank officer.</p>

<p>"Hanes' greed knew no bounds," US Attorney Kate E. Brubacher said in a statement. "He trespassed his professional obligations, his personal relationships, and federal law. Not only did Shan Hanes betray Heartland Bank and its investors, but his illegal schemes also jeopardized confidence in financial institutions," the attorney added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Separately, Brian Mitchell, Mr Hanes' longtime next-door neighbour, called the ex-CEO's actions "pure evil" during the sentencing. He also said that during the sentencing Mr Hanes' showed little remorse for his actions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the outlet, Mr Hanes began stealing after being targeted in a pig-butchering scheme in late 2022. He started making the wire transactions after communicating with the scammers on WhatsApp - whose identities are still unknown. Initially, he used personal funds to buy crypto, but in early 2023 he stole $40,000 from Elkhart Church of Christ and $10,000 from the Santa Fe Investment Club. he then used $60,000 taken from a daughter's college fund, and nearly $1 million in stock from the Elkhart Financial Corporation. In May 2023, he then began to make wire transactions from Heartland Tri-State Bank to accounts controlled by scammers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eventually, Mr Hanes was fired, and the bank was shattered and taken over by the FDIC. the 53-year-old was charged last February and placed under house arrest until his sentencing last week.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A bizarre tale involving Robert Francis Kennedy Jr has resurfaced. The story, first shared by Kick Kennedy -- the daughter of RFK Jr -- with&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/tradition/a924/kick-kennedy-interview/ ">a magazine</a>, sheds light on a childhood memory. According to Ms Kennedy, her father decapitated a whale carcass during a family trip to Hyannis Port, Massachusetts.</p>

<p>The incident gained traction recently after Ms Kennedy was spotted with actor Ben Affleck.</p>

<p>It all started when RFK Jr discovered a whale carcass washed ashore on Squaw Island. The US politician saw it as an opportunity to indulge in what his daughter described as a "peculiar fascination with dead animals".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Armed with a chainsaw, RFK Jr reportedly hurried down to the beach and proceeded to decapitate the whale on the spot. He then attached the massive head to the family's minivan with a bungee cord, determined to bring it back to their home in Mount Kisco, New York, for further study. The family endured a five-hour drive back, with the whale's rotting remains emitting a stench that, according to Kick Kennedy, assaulted every sense.</p>

<p>"Every time we accelerated on the highway, whale juice would pour into the windows of the car, and it was the rankest thing on the planet," Ms Kennedy&nbsp;recalled in the interview. The situation was so unbearable that the family resorted to wearing plastic bags over their heads with mouth holes cut out, which brought out bewildered and disgusted reactions from fellow drivers. "People on the highway were giving us the finger, but that was just normal day-to-day stuff for us," she&nbsp;revealed.</p>

<p>While the whale beheading incident is disturbing, it was not the only such occurrence in the Kennedy household. Earlier this month, RFK Jr admitted in a viral interview with Roseanne Barr that he had <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/04/us-news/rfk-jr-says-he-dumped-dead-bear-in-central-park-after-ditching-plan-to-skin-it-in-bizarre-video/">dumped a dead bear cub</a> in Central Park a decade ago.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He recounted how, during a falconing trip in Goshen, New York, he discovered the cub after it had been hit by a car. Planning to skin the bear and use the meat, he placed it in his van. However, after a night of drinking with friends, they decided it would be amusing to dump the bear in Central Park and make it appear as though it had been hit by a bike.</p>

<p>As these bizarre stories resurface, the spotlight is also on Ms Kennedy, who has recently been seen in the company of recently divorced Ben Affleck, 52. The two have been spotted at various hotspots, including the Polo Lounge at the Beverly Hills Hotel, leading to dating rumours.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tesla chief Elon Musk, who also owns social media platform X, said on Monday he feels California should pass an AI bill that would require tech companies and AI developers to conduct safety testing on some of their own models.</p>

<p>"For over 20 years, I have been an advocate for AI regulation, just as we regulate any product/technology that is a potential risk to the public," Musk said in a post on X, while calling on the state to pass the SB 1047 bill.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>California state lawmakers attempted to introduce 65 bills touching on AI this legislative season, according to the state's legislative database, including measures to ensure all algorithmic decisions are proven unbiased and protect the intellectual property of dead individuals from exploitation by AI companies. Many of the bills are already dead.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, Microsoft backed OpenAI voiced support for another AI bill from California, called AB 3211, that would require tech companies to label AI-generated content, which can range from harmless memes to deepfakes aimed at spreading misinformation about political candidates.</p>

<p>With countries representing a third of the world's population having polls this year, experts are concerned about the role AI-generated content will play, and it has already been prominent in some elections, such as in Indonesia.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Juli Vavilova, a 24-year-old "crypto coach" and video game streamer, has gone missing, fuelling online speculation that she was potentially involved in the arrest of Telegram CEO Pavel Durov in France.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Juli Vavilova, a 24-year-old "crypto coach" and video game streamer, has gone missing, fuelling online speculation that she was potentially involved in the arrest of Telegram CEO Pavel Durov in France.</p>

<p>Durov, who fled Russia in 2014 after refusing to hand over encrypted data to the Kremlin, has long been a target of international law enforcement. French authorities issued a search warrant for Mr Durov as part of an ongoing investigation by the Interior Ministry into alleged crimes against minors, including claims of complicity in global drug trafficking and paedophilia due to Telegram's lack of moderation and the platform's use of cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Vavilova, who was reportedly travelling with Mr Durov before his arrest, has not been heard from since the tech mogul was detained at Le Bourget airport near Paris this past weekend.&nbsp;Ms Vavilova's family has been increasingly concerned, telling AFP that they have been unable to contact her since the incident.&nbsp;</p>

<p>French privacy data researcher Baptiste Robert has noted the potential implications of Ms Vavilova's social media activity. According to Mr Robert, Ms Vavilova's posts, which documented her travels through Azerbaijan with Pavel Durov, may have inadvertently revealed the Telegram founder's movements, leading to his arrest. "It's complicated to say if her posts played a direct role in his arrest, but if you were following her on social media, you could easily track Durov's movements," he told the <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/26/world-news/telegram-ceo-pavel-durovs-mystery-blonde-companion-raises-questions/">NY Post</a>.</p>

<p>Mr Robert's compilation of Juli Vavilova's posts shared on X, shows a striking correlation between her travels and Mr Durov's known itinerary. This includes videos of the duo together in Uzbekistan and also a picture that showed Ms Vavilova in the passenger seat of Mr Durov's car in Azerbaijan on August 21.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The woman who accompanied Pavel Durov on his journey that led to his arrest is Juli Vavilova<br />
<br />
It's <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OSINT?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#OSINT</a> time! <a href="https://t.co/4ejQfRT8lt">https://t.co/4ejQfRT8lt</a> <a href="https://t.co/asJlUG0Ui5">pic.twitter.com/asJlUG0Ui5</a></p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Other posts indicate they visited the same shooting range and hotel in the Azerbaijani capital. Despite their seemingly close relationship, the exact nature of their connection remains unclear. It is unknown when or how they met, but both live in Dubai, where Telegram is headquartered.</p>

<p>However, the timing of her disappearance and the arrest of Mr Durov has fuelled theories that she may have been used as a 'honey-trap' by those seeking to capture the elusive tech billionaire. Despite these speculations, no concrete evidence has emerged linking her to any such plot.</p>

<p>Durov's company has stated that the 39-year-old was not in hiding nor on the run, as he regularly travelled to Europe as a dual-French citizen.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Polaris Dawn mission, organized by billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, was set to lift off early Tuesday from NASA's Kennedy Space Center, but is now targeting early Wednesday after a late technical hitch.</p>

<p>"Teams are taking a closer look at a ground-side helium leak on the Quick Disconnect umbilical," Elon Musk's company wrote on X. Umbilicals connect a tower with a rocket, while helium is a non-flammable gas often used to pressurize fuel lines.</p>

<p>Riding atop a Falcon 9 rocket, the SpaceX Dragon capsule is set to reach a peak altitude of 870 miles (1,400 kilometers) -- higher than any crewed mission in over half a century, since the Apollo era.</p>

<p>Mission commander <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/elon-musk-spacex-us-billionaire-jared-isaacman-billionaire-from-1st-all-civilian-spacex-flight-announces-3-more-missions-2768576" target="_blank">Isaacman</a> will guide his four-member team through the mission's centerpiece: the first-ever commercial spacewalk, equipped with sleek, newly developed SpaceX extravehicular activity (EVA) suits.</p>

<p>Rounding out the team are mission pilot Scott Poteet, a retired US Air Force Lieutenant Colonel; mission specialist Sarah Gillis, a lead space operations engineer at SpaceX; and mission specialist and medical officer Anna Menon, also a lead space operations engineer at SpaceX.</p>

<h3><strong>High radiation zone</strong></h3>

<p>The quartet underwent more than two years of training in preparation for the landmark mission, logging hundreds of hours on simulators as well as skydiving, centrifuge training, scuba diving, and summiting an Ecuadoran volcano.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtvprofit.com/world/elon-musks-spacex-polaris-dawn-mission-launch-date-time-where-to-watch-and-more" target="_blank">Polaris Dawn</a> is set to be the first of three missions under the Polaris program, a collaboration between Isaacman, the founder of tech company Shift4 Payments, and SpaceX.</p>

<p>"The idea is to develop (and) test new technology and operations in furtherance of SpaceX's bold vision to enable humankind to journey among the stars," Isaacman said during a recent press conference.</p>

<p>Isaacman declined to reveal his total investment in the project, though reports suggest he paid around $200 million for the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/sunita-williams-barry-wilmore-boeing-starliner-why-nasa-picked-elon-musks-spacex-to-bring-back-astronauts-from-space-6410789" target="_blank">SpaceX</a> Inspiration4 mission in September 2021, the first all-civilian orbital mission.</p>

<p>Polaris Dawn will reach its highest altitude on its first day, venturing briefly into the Van Allen radiation belt, a region teeming with high-energy charged particles that can pose health risks to humans over extended periods.</p>

<p>The crew will orbit nearly three times higher than the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/indian-astronaut-to-fly-to-the-international-space-station-by-april-2025-union-minister-6385661" target="_blank">International Space Station</a>, yet will remain far short of the record-breaking distance of over 248,000 miles set by the Apollo 13 crew in 1970.</p>

<p>Apollo 13's astronauts journeyed that far to slingshot around the far side of the Moon after an explosion crippled their spacecraft, aborting their planned lunar landing and necessitating a return to Earth without major propulsive maneuvers.</p>

<h3><strong>New spacesuits&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>On day three, the crew will don their state-of-the-art EVA spacesuits -- outfitted with heads-up displays, helmet cameras, and advanced joint mobility systems -- and take turns to venture outside their spacecraft in twos. Each will spend 15 to 20 minutes in space, 435 miles above Earth's surface.</p>

<p>Notably, however, even the pair strapped into their seats will be exposed to the vacuum of space as the Dragon capsule doesn't have an airlock.</p>

<p>The following day will be dedicated to testing laser-based satellite communication between the spacecraft and <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/starlink-satellites-could-be-destroyed-if-what-china-study-says-6160562" target="_blank">Starlink</a>, SpaceX's more than 6,000-strong constellation of internet satellites, in a bid to boost space communication speeds.</p>

<p>The crew is also set to conduct nearly 40 experiments aimed at advancing our understanding of human health during long-duration spaceflights. Among these are tests with contact lenses embedded with microelectronics to continuously monitor changes in eye pressure and shape.</p>

<p>After six days in space, the mission will conclude with a splashdown off the coast of Florida, where a SpaceX recovery ship will await.</p>

<p>The second Polaris mission will also utilize a Dragon capsule, while the third and final mission is slated to be the maiden crewed flight of Starship, SpaceX's prototype next-generation rocket that is key to Musk's vision of one day colonizing Mars.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Dutch judge on Monday ordered a woman to stop spreading a false conspiracy theory that a ring of Satan-worshipping paedophiles had been operating in a small town, or face fines or prison.</p>

<p>Prosecutors in Bodegraven-Reeuwijk in the western Netherlands brought the unidentified woman to court after she refused to stop spreading online information about unfounded rumours that have plagued the town since 2021.</p>

<p>The woman "ignored a request to stop and remove her statements and began to make even more violent statements", the Gelderland District Court said.</p>

<p>As a result, a man entered the Bodegraven municipal offices in an "intimidating way", the town's customer service line was flooded with threatening calls, and its mayor received anonymous threatening messages, the court said in a document posted online.</p>

<p>A judge imposed a ban on further online postings and ordered the woman to remove all previous comments "within 48 hours".</p>

<p>If she continued she would be fined 5,000 euros ($5,600) every time she posted something, running up to a maximum of 400,000 euros.</p>

<p>If that amount is reached and the woman persists with her posts, she faces a 60-day jail sentence.</p>

<p>The saga began in 2021 when three men spread unfounded rumours about a satanic paedophile ring that had abused children in the leafy town around 40 kilometres (25 miles) east of The Hague.</p>

<p>Dozens of people flocked to the municipality of around 34,000 people to lay flowers and messages on the graves of the alleged victims after conspiracy theorists latched on to the claims.</p>

<p>One of the men behind the spreading of the rumours said he had been abused in the 1980s and had since recovered memories of witnessing satanic rituals and the murder of young children.</p>

<p>But the accuser and one of the others were convicted of sedition, threats and defamation by a Dutch court in 2022, which ruled that there was no proof of any satanic paedophile network.</p>

<p>The accuser was later handed a 15-month jail sentence, and neither man has made any further claims since their conviction, the judge said.</p>

<p>But the woman took over from the three men, the judge said.</p>

<p>"Her statements became increasingly systematic in nature, increasingly sharp in tone... mentioning alleged perpetrators, victims, so-called cover-ups and calls for action against them," the judge said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 5-year-old boy in Utah accidentally shot himself to death with a gun he found at home. While playing in his parents' bedroom on August 22, Brooks Thomas Wilson discovered a loaded 9mm pistol and, tragically, it discharged when he picked it up, causing a fatal head wound, the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/26/us-news/5-year-old-utah-boy-dies-after-shooting-himself-with-parents-gun/" rel="nofollow, noindex">New York Post</a></em> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His parents, Bryan and Kristin Wilson were at home at the time and rushed to the room after hearing the gunshot. In a desperate attempt to save their son, Bryan performed&nbsp;Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) as they awaited medical help. Emergency medical crews attempted CPR, but Brooks died from his injuries.</p>

<p>Santaquin Police Department lieutenant Mike Wall said the shooting appeared to be accidental and no foul play was suspected.</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0">The boy's family released a statement and described the incident as "an unimaginable tragedy."</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0">"Losing a cherished member who will be deeply missed. However, through our faith in Jesus Christ, we will get through this trial, as we feel his love so abundantly," they said in a statement obtained by <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://people.com/utah-boy-five-dies-shooting-himself-gun-parents-bedroom-8701150" rel="nofollow, noindex">People.</a></em></p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0">"We extend our heartfelt gratitude to those who responded and the community for their overwhelming support and compassion. This heartbreaking incident has taught us difficult lessons, and we deeply regret that it unfolded this way. Our hearts are shattered, and we hope that our family's loss serves as a poignant reminder of how quickly life can change," the family added.</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0">They continued, "We hope this tragedy serves as a reminder for others to take every precaution to ensure the safety of their children. As we come together to grieve, we kindly ask for privacy during this difficult time as we mourn the loss of our beloved little boy."</p>

<p>Utah law does not require prosecution for people who leave unattended weapons accessible to minors, and also does not require weapons to be secured, according to the Giffords Law Center.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australia will limit the number of foreign students to 270,000 in 2025 as part of a migration crackdown.</p>

<p>Under the policy, the government will cap new international students at 145,000 for universities and 95,000 for the skills training sector, Education Minister Jason Clare said Tuesday. Almost 600,000 student visas were granted in fiscal 2023, a significant jump from previous years.</p>

<p>Universities have repeatedly warned that any moves to limit foreign students could damage the lucrative tertiary education industry.</p>

<p>"This is an important part of our economy, no doubt about it. That hasn't changed," Clare told reporters in Sydney after the announcement. "But as students have come back, it has put pressure on the reputation of the sector."</p>

<p>Overall, there will be about 15% more students allowed for universities and 20% fewer for vocational colleges in 2025, Clare said. The government was writing to individual universities to inform them of their caps on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"To create the impression that this is somehow tearing down international education is absolutely and fundamentally wrong," Clare said. "It is about making sure that we set it up in a sustainable way for the future. We want students to come and study here."</p>

<p>Universities Australia Chair David Lloyd said the student caps would put a "handbrake" on the tertiary education sector.</p>

<p>Migration controls should not be imposed "at the expense of any one sector, particularly one as economically important as education," Lloyd added, saying the limits would cause damage to Australia's research and development capacity.</p>

<p>The Independent Tertiary Education Council Australia said in a statement that universities needed more information about the changes, saying the announcement "creates more questions than answers."</p>

<p>Australia is just the latest country to crack down on international students over migration concerns, with Canada, the Netherlands and the UK all implementing or considering measures targeting the university sector. In Australia, the government has been consulting for months over plans to impose limits on foreign students, part of a broader push to crack down on high post-Covid migration numbers. The surge in migration has coincided with rising voter concerns about a housing squeeze that sent rents soaring, proving politically damaging for the centre-left Labor government.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Support for migration in Australia has fallen to its lowest level in five years, according to a poll released by Essential on Tuesday, with 42% of those surveyed saying it had a negative effect on the country.</p>

<p>International students contributed $48 billion ($32.5 billion) to the Australian economy in 2023, making it the country's top services export.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Property Council of Australia's Student Accommodation Council said the cap of 270,000 student visas was "sustainable" and the government's announcement would give investors in student housing the confidence to keep putting money in the sector.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="theconversation-article-title">When Pavel Durov arrived in France on his private jet last Saturday, he was greeted by police who promptly arrested him. As the founder of the direct messaging platform Telegram, he was accused of facilitating the widespread crimes committed on it.</p>

<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>The following day, a French judge extended Durov's initial period of detention, allowing police to detain him for up to 96 hours.</p>

<p>Telegram has rejected the allegations against Durov. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8ne8r1yy0o">In a statement, the company said</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is absurd to claim that a platform or its owner are responsible for abuse of that platform.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The case may have far-reaching international implications, not just for Telegram but for other global technology giants as well.</p>

<h3><strong>Who is Pavel Durov?</strong></h3>

<p>Born in Russia in 1984, Pavel Durov also has French citizenship. This might explain why he felt free to travel despite his app's role in <a href="https://time.com/6158437/telegram-russia-ukraine-information-war/">the Russia-Ukraine War</a> and its widespread use by <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/27007298?seq=1">extremist groups</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13530">criminals more generally</a>.</p>

<p>Durov started an earlier social media site, VKontakte, in 2006, which remains very popular in Russia. However, a dispute with how the new owners of the site were operating led to him <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/apr/02/founder-pavel-durov-leaves-russian-social-network-site-vkontakte">leaving the company in 2014</a>.</p>

<p>It was shortly before this that Durov created Telegram. This platform provides both the means for communication and exchange as well as the protection of encryption that makes crimes harder to track and tackle than ever before. But that same protection also enables people to resist authoritarian governments that seek to prevent dissent or protest.</p>

<p>Durov also has connections with famed tech figures Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg and enjoys broad support in the vocally libertarian tech community. But his platform is no stranger to <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1369118X.2021.1933562">legal challenges</a> – even in his birth country.</p>

<p>An odd target</p>

<p>Pavel Durov is in some ways an odd target for French authorities.</p>

<p>Meta's WhatsApp messenger app is also encrypted and boasts three times as many users, while X's provocations for hate speech and other problematic content are <a href="https://www.isi.edu/news/55932/new-twitter-now-with-more-hate/">unrepentantly public and increasingly widespread</a>.</p>

<p>There is also no suggestion that Durov himself was engaged with making any illegal content. Instead, he is accused of indirectly facilitating illegal content by maintaining the app in the first place.</p>

<p>However, Durov's unique background might go some way to suggest why he was taken in.</p>

<p>Unlike other major tech players, he lacks US citizenship. He hails from a country with a <a href="https://theconversation.com/kremlin-tightens-control-over-russians-online-lives-threatening-domestic-freedoms-and-the-global-internet-182020">chequered past of internet activity</a> – and a diminished diplomatic standing globally thanks to its war against Ukraine.</p>

<p>His app is large enough to be a global presence. But simultaneously it is not large enough to have the limitless legal resources of major players such as Meta.</p>

<p>Combined, these factors make him a more accessible target to test the enforcement of expanding regulatory frameworks.</p>

<h3><strong>A question of moderation</strong></h3>

<p>Durov's arrest marks another act in the often confusing and contradictory negotiation of how much responsibility platforms shoulder for the content on their sites.</p>

<p>These platforms, which include direct messaging platforms such as Telegram and WhatsApp but also broader services such as those offered by Meta's Facebook and Musk's X, operate across the globe.</p>

<p>As such, they contend with a wide variety of legal environments.</p>

<p>This means any restriction put on a platform ultimately affects its services <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Regulating+Platforms-p-9781509537082">everywhere in the world</a> – complicating and frequently preventing regulation.</p>

<p>On one side, there is a push to either hold the platforms responsible for illegal content or to provide details on the users who post it.</p>

<p>In Russia, Telegram itself was under pressure to provide names of protesters organising through its app to protest the war against Ukraine.</p>

<p>Conversely, freedom of speech advocates have fought against users being banned from platforms. Meanwhile, political commentators cry foul of being “censored” for their political views.</p>

<p>These contradictions make regulation difficult to craft, while the platforms' global nature makes enforcement a daunting challenge. This challenge tends to play in platforms' favour, as they can exercise a relatively strong sense of platform sovereignty in how they decide to operate and develop.</p>

<p>However, these complications can obscure the ways platforms can operate directly as deliberate influencers of public opinion and even publishers of their own content.</p>

<p>To take one example, both Google and Facebook took advantage of their central place in the information economy to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/14614448231166057">advertise politically orientated content</a> to resist the development and implementation of Australia's News Media Bargaining Code.</p>

<p>The platforms' construction also directly influences what content can appear and what content is recommended – and hate speech can mark <a href="https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/INFORMIT.790571095083969">an opportunity</a> for clicks and screen time.</p>

<p>Now, pressure is increasing to hold platforms responsible for how they moderate their users and content. In Europe, recent regulations such as <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20240308IPR19014/media-freedom-act-a-new-bill-to-protect-eu-journalists-and-press-freedom">the Media Freedom Act</a> aim to prevent platforms from arbitrarily deleting or banning news producers and their content, while the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/dsa-impact-platforms">Digital Services Act</a> requires that these platforms provide mechanisms for removing illegal material.</p>

<p>Australia has its own Online Safety Act to prevent harm through platforms, though the recent case involving X reveals that its capacity <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jun/05/x-elon-musk-vs-australia-esafety-commissioner-wakeley-church-stabbing-footage">may be quite limited</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>Future implications</strong></h3>

<p>Durov is currently only being detained, and it remains to be seen what, if anything, will happen to him in the coming days.</p>

<p>But if he is charged and successfully prosecuted, it could lay the groundwork for France to take wider actions against not only tech platforms, but also their owners. It could also embolden nations around the world – in the West and beyond – to undertake their own investigations.</p>

<p>In turn, it may also make tech platforms think far more seriously about the criminal content they host.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a letter to the US Congress, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has alleged that the US government under Joe Biden "repeatedly pressured" Meta to censor certain content on its platforms.</p>

<p>In the letter addressed to US House of Representatives, Mr Zuckerberg said that the platform had to make some changes, that "with the benefit of hindsight and new information," they won't make today. He added that he regrets not being "more outspoken" about it.</p>

<p>"In 2021, senior officials from the Biden Administration, including the White House, repeatedly pressured our teams for months to censor certain COVID-19 content, including humor and satire, and expressed a lot of frustration with our teams when we didn't agree. Ultimately, it was our decision whether or not to take content down, and we own our decisions, including COVID-19-related changes we made to our enforcement in the wake of this pressure. I believe the government pressure was wrong, and I regret that we were not more outspoken about it," the letter read.</p>

<p>Zuckerberg said he felt that Meta should not compromise its content standards due to pressure from any Administration. "We're ready to push back if something like this happens again," he said.</p>

<p>The Meta CEO also spoke of a FBI warning about a "potential Russian disinformation operation about the Biden family and Burisma in the lead up to the 2020 election."</p>

<p>"That fall, when we saw a New York Post story reporting on corruption allegations involving then-Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden's family, we sent that story to fact-checkers for review and temporarily demoted it while waiting for a reply. It's since been made clear that the reporting was not Russian disinformation, and in retrospect, we shouldn't have demoted the story. We've changed our policies and processes to make sure this doesn't happen again for instance, we no longer temporarily demote things in the US while waiting for fact-checkers," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Zuckerberg reiterated his support for the electoral infrastructure ahead of the presidential elections in November. He spoke of he made to strengthen the infrastructure in a non-partisan way. "I know that some people believe this work benefited one party over the other. My goal is to be neutral and not play a role one way or another or to even appear to be playing a role. So I don't plan on making a similar contribution this cycle," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Texas judge on Monday ordered a temporary pause on a policy that would streamline the process for spouses of US citizens to obtain legal status in the country, a blow to one of US President Joe Biden's biggest immigration reform policies.</p>

<p>Judge J. Campbell Barker granted a 14-day administrative stay in a case brought by the Republican attorneys general of 16 US states challenging the Biden administration's policy.</p>

<p>In June, Biden announced the new policy, which streamlined a pathway to citizenship for an estimated half a million immigrants married to US nationals.</p>

<p>The 16 states bringing the lawsuit, however, say the policy is costing them millions of dollars in public services -- including healthcare, education and law enforcement -- used by the immigrants.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The claims are substantial and warrant closer consideration than the court has been able to afford to date," Judge Barker wrote in his order.</p>

<p>"This is just the first step. We are going to keep fighting for Texas, our country, and the rule of law," said Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, whose state is party to the case, in a post on X after the order.</p>

<p>The Biden administration has been struggling to address immigration, a hugely divisive issue for many Americans ahead of November's presidential election, which will see Vice President Kamala Harris take on Republican Donald Trump.</p>

<p>The Democratic Party is walking a fine line of seeking to be tougher on illegal migrants while also introducing reforms to the country's inefficient immigration system.</p>

<p>Trump's campaign for the White House has centred on portraying the United States as under assault by what he calls a migrant "invasion."</p>

<p>The new rules would streamline the process for those who already qualify for permanent residence by removing a requirement that they leave the country as part of the application process.</p>

<p>The rules applied to those present in the country for at least 10 years and married to a US citizen before June 17, 2024, and also applied to an estimated 50,000 stepchildren of US citizens.</p>

<p>Those approved would be granted work authorization and the right to stay in the United States for up to three years while they apply for a green card, which is a pathway to full citizenship.</p>

<p>Monday's ruling suspends the granting of this "parole in place" status, but does not halt the Department of Homeland Security from continuing to accept applications for the status.</p>

<p>Barker wrote that the court did not "express any ultimate conclusions about the success or likely success" of the plaintiffs' case while the stay was in place.</p>

<p>The court announced an expedited hearing schedule in the case, but Barker noted that the two-week stay would likely be extended while proceedings are underway.</p>

<p>"The court thus expects that good cause may exist to extend this administrative stay for additional periods through mid-October," the order read.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Billionaire Elon Musk has reportedly announced that employees at his social media company X (formerly Twitter) will receive their stock options based on their contributions. In an email sent to staff, reported by <em>The Verge</em>, Mr Musk told employees that the company would reward stock options based on employee impact and that workers would need to submit a one-page summary of their contributions to X to get them. Notably, this decision has reportedly created further tension among employees following recently reported delays in promotions and concerns about layoffs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Citing sources, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/23/24226830/elon-musk-email-x-twitter-stock-grants" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>The Verge</em></a> also reported that X employees were still waiting for their annual equity refresher, which was expected in April. The billionaire had assured X staff that they could regularly cash out stock, similar to SpaceX staff, according to two employees. However, he has not yet followed through.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The last stock refresh for X employees was in October 2023, valuing the company at $19 billion - significantly less than the $44 billion Mr Musk paid for it. Employees reportedly received RSUs at a share price of $45 during this refresh, the outlet said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Elon Musk acquired Twitter in October 2022 in a $44 billion deal. He laid off almost half the employees shortly after his takeover of the company and sent a hardcore ultimatum to the remaining staff.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Earlier this month, this controversial ultimatum to employees also resulted in a legal victory for a former X worker. An<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/elon-musks-x-ordered-to-pay-rs-5-crore-to-employee-fired-for-not-responding-to-billionaires-email-6353219"> Irish court </a>ordered the microblogging platform to pay over $602,640 (approximately Rs 5 crore) to Gary Rooney, who was fired in December 2022 after Mr Musk's takeover of the company. Mr Rooney held a senior procurement role at the time of his dismissal. He had been employed by X since September 2013.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ireland's Workplace Relations Commission held Mr Rooney had been unfairly dismissed in 2022 and ordered X to pay him a huge amount - the largest sum the agency has ever awarded. The Commission heard that X maintained that the employee had resigned voluntarily after he failed to tick a box committing to new unspecified working arrangements in an email from the company's new owner Elon Musk.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the Irish Workplace Relations Commission refused to buy this argument and ruled that not clicking "yes" in response to the email did not constitute an act of resignation. "It is not OK for Mr. Musk, or indeed any large company to treat employees in such a manner in this country or jurisdiction. The record award reflects the seriousness and the gravity of the case," the complainant's solicitor Barry Kenny said.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple will host its fall event on Sept. 9 at its headquarters in Cupertino, California, according to an invite on Monday, where it will likely unveil a series of new iPhones and updates to other devices and apps.</p>

<p>The upcoming launches are crucial for Apple as it looks to reverse a global sales slowdown, particularly in China, and lay out its artificial intelligence (AI) roadmap.</p>

<p>At its developers conference in June, Apple announced a slew of AI features under the umbrella "Apple Intelligence", including a revamped Siri and an integration with ChatGPT.</p>

<p>However, these features will be available only on the latest Apple devices and will be rolled out gradually starting later this year.</p>

<p>Apple faces increasing pressure from competitors such as Samsung and Alphabet's Google, who have recently announced AI functionality alongside their new Galaxy and Pixel smartphones, respectively.</p>

<p>While Apple's event invite teases "It's Glowtime," no further details have been provided. The company typically announces new iPhones and watches at the fall event, its biggest product showcase every year.</p>

<p>In recent years, iPhone sales have slowed due to a lack of significant upgrades in newer models and competition from Android-based smartphone brands offering high-end specifications at lower prices.</p>

<p>Apple has said its third-quarter sales were better than expected on the back of iPhone 15, its latest series, which is set to receive the new AI features. Overall sales in China dropped more than expected at 6.5%, pressured by Chinese smartphone brands, chiefly Huawei.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Nvidia stock has gained 3,776% since the start of 2019 as the company benefits from selling the main chip necessary for artificial intelligence work, minting many new multimillionaires in the process.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's a summer day in Santa Clara, California, and an assortment of luxury cars - Porsches, Corvettes, Lamborghinis - take up parking spots previously occupied by humbler models. Some have new paint jobs in the lime green from Nvidia Corp.'s logo. And they are stuck where their owners want to be: at the office.</p>

<p>Nvidia stock has gained 3,776% since the start of 2019 as the company benefits from selling the main chip necessary for artificial intelligence work, minting many new multimillionaires in the process. But the work hours are just as gruelling and high-stress, current and former employees said, leaving little time for the jet-setting, homebuying and leisure many can now afford. A culture problem is brewing, said the 10 people, who asked not to be identified for fear of retribution.</p>

<p>The 31-year-old chipmaker has piled on market cap faster than any other company in history. Founder and Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang has established expectations of scrappiness and overworking, with a chaotic structure where one manager can have dozens of direct reports, the current and former employees said. Rather than firing employees like his competitors, Huang has said he prefers to "torture them into greatness."&nbsp;</p>

<p>One former employee, who worked in technical support for enterprise clients, said he was expected to work 7 days a week, often until 1 a.m. or 2 a.m. He said many of his former colleagues, especially those on engineering teams, worked longer hours. He described the environment as a pressure cooker, noting several company meetings he characterized as yelling fights - but said the pay package made it hard to leave. He left in May and requested anonymity to speak frankly about the company.</p>

<p>Another, who worked in marketing until 2022 and requested anonymity to protect her career, said she often attended 7 to 10 meetings per day, each with more than 30 people involved, often punctuated by bouts of fighting and shouting. But she said she put up with it for two years, because of the "golden handcuffs" - the opportunity for even more wealth.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Nvidia declined to comment.</strong></h3>

<p>Nvidia hasn't had any trouble keeping its employees in recent years, in part because its stock grants typically vest - or become available - over a four-year period, giving workers incentive to stay to earn their whole pay package. In 2023, 5.3% of employees left the company, but after its valuation topped $1 trillion, that same turnover rate dropped by nearly half, to 2.7%, according to its 2024 sustainability report. The overall semiconductor industry's turnover rate is much higher, at 17.7%, according to Nvidia.</p>

<p>The tech industry trope of "resting and vesting" is so common it was ridiculed by Hollywood in HBO's "Silicon Valley" show with a character who squanders away his time playing video games and drinking big sodas waiting for his stock to vest. But it doesn't work at Nvidia. One current employee said it would be embarrassing and even socially difficult to coast.</p>

<p>Those who tried have become the subject of internal critique. During a staff meeting late last year employees complained to Huang that some of their colleagues were in "semiretirement" mode, according to a former employee who attended the meeting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Those who have been at the company for close to a decade would have more than enough money to retire, according to a former engineering employee who left the company in June. Many don't, though, because there are millions more waiting when the next stock grant vests, the person added.</p>

<p>The explosive stock rally also means that many Nvidia employees are sitting on bigger nest eggs than peers at other chipmakers. Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress, who joined the company 11 years ago, owns stock worth about $758.7 million. Her Intel Corp. counterpart Dave Zinsner, who has a larger pay package but has a shorter tenure, owns stock worth just $3.13 million. At Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Nvidia's nearest rival, which has also seen rapid share growth, CFO Jean Hu, who joined in 2023, owns stock worth $6.43 million.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The former engineering employee who asked not to be named said that, throughout 2023 and 2024, working at Nvidia meant encountering frequent expressions of wealth among employees of virtually all seniority levels. He said he regularly saw coworkers surfing Zillow and alluding to new vacation homes in casual conversation. He added that it's become common for employees to attend big-ticket sporting events like the Super Bowl and the NBA Finals.</p>

<h3><strong>How to Turn a Camry Into Two Lamborghinis</strong></h3>

<p>Nvidia staff who put money into purchase plan have big budgets<br />
"It's just always very surprising how much money they have in one stock," said Spencer Hsu, a real estate agent based in Palo Alto, California, who has worked with multiple Nvidia employees this year - on nights and weekends, of course. The clients are making 40% to 60% down payments on multimillion-dollar homes.</p>

<p>Conversations about Nvidia's daily market gain or loss (but usually gain) can be heard in hushed tones at lunchtime, according to several of the recently departed employees. A current Nvidia product manager said that thousands of employees are on a company Slack channel dedicated to exchanging personal finance advice. The group is catered toward employees who have held onto their vested shares - not the many others who sold off much of their stock long before its peak.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's not just about the money. Airan Junior, who was at the chipmaker from 2020 to 2023, said that "working at Nvidia is like Disneyland" because of the many teams solving interesting technical problems. He worked on a sales team based out of Brazil, and said the company's culture, however unconventional, contributed to its massive success. Nvidia now accounts for more than 90 percent of sales in the AI chip market.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Huang, who has 60 direct reports, has no time for bureaucracy, detailed PowerPoint presentations or one-on-one meetings. He'll involve himself in seemingly minor decisions, such as the choice of a photo for a marketing campaign. Huang is well known for making Nvidia employees send a regular email to a centralized email address with a bulleted list of five things they're working on. Huang sometimes responds to these emails directly to ask for more details or dole out directives.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Huang has said his approach to leadership has been shaped by facing "real adversity" running Nvidia for more than three decades. He tells employees that he's pushing them to do their life's work. "It should be like that," Huang said of his demanding management style in a recent 60 Minutes interview. "If you want to do extraordinary things, it shouldn't be easy."</p>

<p>Most employees appear to approve of Huang's unusual leadership style. His approval rating on Glassdoor is 97%, higher than his peers at Alphabet Inc. (94%), Apple Inc. (87%), Meta Platforms Inc. (66%) and Amazon.com Inc. (54%).</p>

<p>But the ex-marketing employee warned that Huang's flat corporate structure sometimes works differently than intended. She said that in her experience, because of the company's structure, people are incentivized to fight for Huang's attention rather than work together toward Nvidia's long-term success. The same structure applies to those far below Huang - the former technical support employee said his supervisor had more than 100 people directly reporting to him. At a certain point, with a certain amount of money, the stress starts to lose its appeal.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tech giant Apple on Monday named insider Kevan Parekh as its chief financial officer, replacing company veteran Luca Maestri who will transition from the role on Jan. 1, 2025.</p>

<p>The leadership change comes ahead of Apple's multiple product launch this fall season, which analysts have called the biggest software upgrade for the iPhone.</p>

<p>It includes artificial intelligence features, which are crucial for Apple as it looks to reverse a slowdown in global sales, particularly in China, and better compete with rivals who have rolled out AI upgrades.</p>

<p>Parekh, who has been with Apple for more than a decade and will join the company's executive committee, most recently served as vice president of financial planning and analysis.</p>

<p>"It appears that the transition to the new CFO is planned and orderly, which is the most important question. Maestri staying on with Apple is also very important, as it removes the risk of financial questions," D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria said.</p>

<p>"(Parekh) will need to continue the prudent capital management, but may also be tasked with restarting Apple's exploration of complimentary acquisitions."</p>

<p>Before Apple, Parekh held senior leadership roles at Thomson Reuters and General Motors.</p>

<p>Apple said Maestri will continue to lead the corporate services teams, including information systems and technology, information security and real estate and development, reporting to CEO Tim Cook.</p>

<p>During Maestri's tenure, Apple more than doubled its revenue, with services revenue growing more than five times.</p>

<p>"Apple filling the role with an internal candidate should make the transition a bit smoother... any change of this magnitude does create some level of uncertainty, especially given the consistency and the history of execution from Maestri," Piper Sandler analysts said in a note.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Apple said its third-quarter iPhone sales were better than expected and forecast more gains as it bets on artificial intelligence to attract buyers, even as its overall China business disappointed.</p>

<p>In recent years, iPhone sales have slowed due to a lack of significant upgrades in newer models and competition from Android-based smartphone brands offering high-end specifications at lower prices.</p>

<p>At its developers conference in June, Apple announced a slew of AI features under the umbrella "Apple Intelligence", including a revamped Siri and an integration with ChatGPT.</p>

<p>The iPhone maker's shares were last down nearly 1% in extended trading.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Tuesday ocean temperatures are rising in the Pacific Islands at three times the rate worldwide, and its population was "uniquely exposed" to the impact of rising sea levels.</p>

<p>Speaking to reporters in Tonga where the Pacific Islands Forum is being held, Guterres highlighted the findings of a report that showed the South West Pacific was worst hit by sea level rises, in some places by more than double the global average in the past 30 years.</p>

<p>"I am in Tonga to issue a global SOS – Save Our Seas – on rising sea levels," he said.</p>

<p>"Rising seas are amplifying the frequency and severity of storm surges and coastal flooding. These floods swamp coastal communities. Ruin fisheries. Damage crops. Contaminate fresh water. All this puts Pacific Island nations in grave danger," he said.</p>

<p>Water expands as it warms, contributing to sea level rise, he said.</p>

<p>Climate change and security are dominating discussions at the week-long annual leaders meeting, where the 18 members of the Pacific Islands Forum span atoll nations threatened by sea level rise such as host Tonga, and one of the world's biggest exporters of coal, Australia.</p>

<p>Asked by a reporter about Australia's export of fossil fuels, Guterres said fossil fuels must be phased out globally, although "the situation in different countries is different" and there would be different ways to do this.</p>

<p>The report released on Tuesday by the World Meteorological Organization showed ocean temperatures in the South West Pacific are increasing at up to three times the rate worldwide.</p>

<p>"Pacific islands are uniquely exposed. This is a region with an average elevation just one to two metres above sea level," Guterres said.</p>

<p>"Half the infrastructure is within 500 metres of the sea," he added.</p>

<p>Without cuts to global emissions, the Pacific Islands can expect additional sea level rise of 15 cm (5.9 inches) by 2050 and 30 days a year of coastal flooding, he said.</p>

<p>He called for global leaders to "massively boost climate adaptation investments" in vulnerable countries.</p>

<p>A "loss and damage" fund to help poor nations cope with costly climate disasters was approved at last year's U.N. climate summit, after years of lobbying by groups including the Pacific Islands, but the challenge remains to attract significant contributions to the fund from wealthier nations.</p>

<p>"Developed countries must deliver on their finance commitments – including the commitment to double adaptation finance to at least $40 billion a year by 2025," Guterres said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Special counsel Jack Smith is arguing to revive his office's classified documents case against former President Donald Trump in the first formal filing since the criminal case was dismissed last month by Judge Aileen Cannon.</p>

<p>In a brief filed with the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta on Monday, Smith argued that Cannon's decision to end the Trump case because the prosecutors' office lacked constitutional authority was "novel" and "lack[ed] merit."</p>

<p>Cannon had ruled the Justice Department didn't have the ability to appoint or fund special counsels like Smith.</p>

<p>Smith's team also cast the decision from Cannon as not just affecting other special counsel prosecutions - of which there are several ongoing in other courts, against Trump and Hunter Biden, among others - but also as potentially affecting the power of leaders across the federal government, as reported by CNN.</p>

<p>"If the Attorney General lacks the power to appoint inferior officers, that conclusion would invalidate the appointment of every member of the Department who exercises significant authority and occupies a continuing office, other than the few that are specifically identified by statute," Smith's office wrote in the 81-page filing.</p>

<p>"The district court's rationale would likewise raise questions about hundreds of appointments throughout the Executive Branch, including in the Departments of Defence, State, Treasury, and Labor," the prosecutors added.</p>

<p>Trump was charged last summer with several counts of mishandling sensitive government documents taken from his White House at the end of the presidency. The Republican presidential nominee also faces several obstruction charges for alleged efforts to hinder the federal probe into the materials.</p>

<p>The former president and his two co-defendants - Trump employees also accused of obstruction - have pleaded not guilty.</p>

<p>The 11th Circuit is reviewing the determinations by Cannon that Smith's appointment as special counsel was unconstitutional and that his office was being unlawfully funded, as reported by CNN.</p>

<p>Notably, though other courts have upheld the use of special counsels, Cannon said that Congress had not given the Justice Department the authority to make such an appointment, while also concluding that the funding for Smith's office had not been properly appropriated by lawmakers.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sea level rises in the Pacific Ocean are outstripping the global average, a World Meteorological Organization (WMO) report showed on Tuesday, imperiling low-lying island states.</p>

<p>Globally, sea level advances are accelerating as higher temperatures driven by the continued burning of fossil fuels melt once-mighty ice sheets, while warmer oceans cause water molecules to expand.</p>

<p>But even compared to the global average rate rise of 3.4 millimetres a year over the past three decades, the WMO report showed that the average annual increase was "significantly higher" in two measurement areas of the Pacific, north and east of Australia.</p>

<p>"Human activities have weakened the capacity of the ocean to sustain and protect us and – through sea level rise – are transforming a lifelong friend into a growing threat," said WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo in a statement to coincide with the release of the regional State of the Climate report 2023 at a forum in Tonga.</p>

<p>Already, such rises have brought a surge in the frequency of coastal flooding since 1980, with dozens of instances happening in islands like the Cook Islands and French Polynesia which previously reported just a handful of such cases annually.</p>

<p>Such events are sometimes caused by tropical cyclones which scientists think could also be intensifying due to climate change, as sea surface temperatures climb.</p>

<p>Over 34 hazards like storms and floods were reported in the Pacific region in 2023, resulting in more than 200 deaths, the WMO report said, adding that only a third of small island developing states had early warning systems.</p>

<p>A WMO spokesperson said that the impact of rising water levels on Pacific islands was disproportionately high since their average elevation is just a meter or two (3.3 to 6.5 feet) above sea level.</p>

<p>To raise awareness of the dangers, Tuvalu's foreign minister gave a speech to the U.N. climate conference in 2021 while standing knee-deep in seawater, making global headlines.</p>

<p>But the WMO report said further rises across the planet would "continue for centuries to millennia due to continuing deep ocean heat uptake and mass loss from ice sheets".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"This morning, the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation launched a massive strike with high-precision long-range air and sea-based weapons, striking unmanned aerial vehicles at critical energy infrastructure facilities that ensured the operation of the military-industrial complex of Ukraine. All the assigned targets were hit," it said on Monday in a statement.</p>

<p>The Ministry added that two electronic warfare stations and four field ammunition depots were destroyed over the past 24 hours, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Monday on Telegram that Russia launched more than 100 missiles of various types and about 100 drones, calling it "one of the largest attacks -- a combined strike".</p>

<p>Zelensky said the attack had caused extensive damage to the energy sector, but facilities are currently being restored.</p>

<p>Ukraine's government-run Ukrinform news agency said that explosions struck the Ukrainian capital, the cities of Dnipro, Kropyvnytsky, Vinnytsia and Kryvyi Rih in central Ukraine and the eastern city of Kharkiv.</p>

<p>According to the Ukrainian Air Force, Russia fired at Ukraine several groups of combat drones and cruise missiles.</p>

<p>Eleven Russian Tu-95MC strategic bombers and six Tu-22M3 long-range supersonic bombers were airborne during the attack.</p>

<p>Ukrainians had been expecting a major Russian missile attack for some time. The US Embassy issued a warning last week of an elevated risk of attack around Ukrainian Independence Day, which Ukraine marked on Saturday.</p>

<p>Nearly 15 missiles and 15 drones targeting the capital of Kyiv were downed, Serhiy Popko, head of Kyiv's military administration, wrote on Telegram. Both Russia and Ukraine deny deliberately targeting civilians.</p>

<p>Each says its attacks are aimed at destroying infrastructure critical to the other's war effort.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;Former US congresswoman, who left the Democratic Party in 2022 announced her endorsement of former President Donald Trump in the upcoming presidential polls in November, The Hill reported.</p>

<p>Gabbard, who has become a regular presence in conservative media, announced a National Guard Association gathering in Michigan where Trump was also speaking.</p>

<p>"This administration has us facing multiple wars on multiple fronts in regions around the world, and closer to the brink of nuclear war than we ever have been before," Gabbard said.</p>

<p>"This is one of the main reasons why I am committed to doing all that I can to send President Trump back to the White House, where he can once again serve us as our commander-in-chief," she added.</p>

<p>Notably, Gabbard ran an unsuccessful presidential campaign in the Democratic primary in 2020. After ending her bid, she exited Congress, left the Democratic Party and appeared at events like the Conservative Political Action Conference, The Hill reported.</p>

<p>The former congresswoman has huddled with Trump in recent weeks as part of preparations for next month's scheduled debate between Trump and Vice President Harris.</p>

<p>Arguably the most notable moment of Gabbard's unsuccessful 2020 White House bid was when she attacked Vice President Harris on the debate stage over her record as a prosecutor.</p>

<p>Gabbard's endorsement comes days after Robert F Kennedy Jr suspended his independent White House bid and backed Trump, which the former president's campaign touted as a significant development in battleground states.</p>

<p>This comes days after the New York Times reported that Trump has brought in Tulsi Gabbard to help sharpen his attacks in the debate against Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Gabbard reportedly joined Trump's practice session at the latter's private club and home, Mar-a-Lago. Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are set to face off in the ABC News debate on September 10.</p>

<p>Notably, Gabbard brings some key qualities to Trump's role: She's a woman, at a moment when Trump is for a second time facing a woman as his general election rival; she's a former House member, giving her policy experience; and, perhaps most importantly for Trump, she has been on a debate stage with Harris and delivered a stinging attack against her record as a prosecutor, New York Times reported.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

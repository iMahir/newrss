       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Protesters and police clashed in Georgia's capital Tbilisi for a fifth straight night on Monday, with signs of opposition spreading across the country over the government's decision to suspend talks on joining the European Union. Tension in the Black Sea nation has been simmering for months between the ruling Georgian Dream party and opponents, who accuse it of pursuing increasingly authoritarian, anti-Western and pro-Russian policies.</p>

<p>The crisis deepened on Thursday after Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze announced that Georgia would freeze accession talks with the EU for four years, until 2028. This speaker a wave of protests in the country of 3.7 million people, with tens and thousands of demonstrators stepping on roads in Tbilisi and tossing fireworks at police, who responded with volleys of water cannons and tear gas.</p>

<p>Now, there are signs that opposition was spreading across the country in at least eight cities and towns, according to reports. Demonstrators had blocked an access road into the country's main commercial port in the Black Sea city of Poti, according to Georgian news agency Interpress.</p>

<p>Opposition TV channel Formula showed footage of people in Khashuri, a town of 20,000 in central Georgia, throwing eggs at the local Georgian Dream office.</p>

<h2><strong>President Seeks Europe's Support&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>Georgia's President Salome Zourabichvili, locked in a standoff with her own government, appealed to European countries on Monday to confront what she described as a Russian attempt to impose control on her nation. "We want our European destiny to be returned to us," Ms Zourabichvili, who has personally remonstrated with riot police, told France Inter radio.</p>

<p>"This is the revolt of an entire country," she said.</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption"><em><small>Reuters</small></em></p>

<p>Ms Zourabichvili, whose powers are mainly ceremonial, said Russia, already at war in Ukraine, was conducting a "hybrid strategy" against Georgia and other countries such as Moldova and NATO and EU member Romania.</p>

<p>"There is a very strong need for very clear moral and political support" from Europe, said the 72-year-old president, who was born in France to Georgian parents and once served as French ambassador to Georgia.</p>

<h2><strong>What Led Georgia Here?</strong></h2>

<p>According to a poll conducted by the US non-profit National Democratic Institute in December last year, nearly 80 per cent of Georgians support European integration. Russia invaded Georgia in 2008 and still occupies nearly 20 per cent of its internationally recognised territory. Due to this, most Georgians harbour a feeling of hostility towards Moscow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Moreover, since the beginning of the Russia-Ukraine war in 2022, thousands of Russians - especially men of service age - have fled to Georgia to avoid conscription, according to a report by CNN. This tore the Black Sea nation's social fabric with Georgians fearing a Russification of their culture.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Georgia has been rocked by turmoil since the ruling Georgian Dream party claimed victory in the October 26 parliamentary election that both the opposition and Ms Zourabichvili called rigged.</p>

<p>The party, which ruled Georgia since 2012, is reportedly founded by a billionaire who made his fortune in Russia. The party is often accused by critics of trying to move the country closer to Russia and away from the EU. Ahead of October's elections, it pushed through legislation targeting independent civil society and curbing LGBTQ rights.</p>

<p>The EU and the United States see this as Georgia's shift away from a pro-Western path and back towards Russia's orbit. Georgian Dream says it is acting to defend the country's sovereignty against outside interference and prevent it from being dragged, like Ukraine, into a war with Russia.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze accused the opposition of "coordinated violence" aimed at overthrowing the constitutional order.</p>

<h2><strong>Protest In Georgia</strong></h2>

<p>On Sunday night, thousands of protesters gathered again in the capital Tbilisi and some tossed fireworks at police, who responded with volleys of water cannon and tear gas. Some protesters stayed out all night, but police eventually ended the standoff by moving them away from the parliament building.</p>

<p>Georgia's interior ministry said 21 police officers had been injured in the overnight protest, with 113 hurt since the beginning of the current unrest. Scores of protesters have also been injured in recent days, and the United States has condemned what it called the excessive use of police force.</p>

<p>Georgia's public ombudsman said 124 out of 156 people arrested at rallies had complained of the police using violence against them, calling this a "very disturbing number".<br />
<br />
However, more rallies were planned on Monday and strikes and other protests have also started. Hundreds of diplomats and civil servants have signed open letters protesting the decision to suspend talks with the EU and stop receiving any funds from the bloc for four years. At least four Georgian ambassadors have resigned.</p>

<h2><strong>Russia's Stand</strong></h2>

<p>Russia on Monday defended the crackdown on protesters, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying authorities are taking "measures to stabilise" the situation, accusing protesters of trying to "stir up" unrest.</p>

<p>Russia sees "the most direct parallel" with Ukraine's "Maidan" protest that ousted a Kremlin-backed leader in 2014 after he suspended talks on closer EU ties, Peskov said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian actress Kamilla Belyatskaya has died after being swept away by a giant wave while practising yoga on a beach on Koh Samui Island, Thailand, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/12/02/actress-24-swept-death-giant-wave-yoga-beauty-spot-22103152/" rel="nofollow, noindex">Metro</a></em> reported.&nbsp;The 24-year-old was on vacation with her boyfriend when the incident occurred. A video capturing her final moments before the wave struck has <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://x.com/vincent31473580/status/1863367392749129955">been widely shared</a>, showing her engrossed in meditation when the wave unexpectedly pulled her into the sea.&nbsp;A bystander attempted to rescue her, but unfortunately, failed to save her.&nbsp;Her body was later recovered a few kilometres away from the spot where she was swept away.</p>

<p>The Russian tourist had previously expressed her deep love for the exact spot where the accident occurred. She had repeatedly visited the particular location during her trips to the island, which she fondly referred to as her "home" and "the best place on earth". Admiring the place, she wrote on social media, "I love Samui so much. But this place, this rocky beach is the best thing I've ever seen in my life. Thank you, the universe, for me being here right now. I'm very happy. I'm happy."</p>

<p>On the day of the tragic incident, Ms Belyatskaya had travelled to the Lad Ko Viewpoint to admire the waves, arriving in a red car captured on CCTV. She then appeared to walk alone to the rocks, retrieving a pink foam mat from her car's trunk. The mat was later spotted floating in the turbulent waters off Koh Samui.</p>

<p>Rescue teams responded swiftly, arriving within 15 minutes of the actress being swept into the sea. However, the intense conditions hindered their efforts, and they were unable to save her.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Chaiyaporn Subprasert, the head of the Samui Rescue Centre, stated that warning systems were in place across the beaches of Koh Samui, aimed at alerting visitors of potential hazards and dangers. He said, "During monsoon season, we constantly warn tourists, especially in high-risk areas like Chaweng and Lamai beaches, where red flags indicate no swimming. While the incident's location is not a swimming area but rather a viewpoint for scenery, the victim may have been caught off guard by the unexpected wave surge."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maryam Faisal, a prominent Pakistani Tiktoker, has become the fifth Pakistani influencer to fall victim to a private video leak, following similar incidents involving celebrities like Kanwal Aftab, Minahil Malik, Imsha Rehman, and Mathira Khan.&nbsp;A private video allegedly featuring Ms Faisal has surfaced online, generating widespread debate and speculation, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/02-Dec-2024/tiktoker-maryam-faisals-alleged-private-video-leaked-online" rel="nofollow, noindex">Daily Pakistan</a></em> reported. The video, which appears to show a woman resembling Ms Faisal in an <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://x.com/Saweera2067514/status/1863241540706898339">intimate moment with a partner</a>, has sparked numerous reactions across social media platforms. However, the influencer has not publicly commented on or confirmed the authenticity of the video.</p>

<p>The leaked video has sparked debates about digital privacy and the growing problem of online harassment targeting influencers.</p>

<p><strong>Who is&nbsp;Maryam Faisal?</strong></p>

<p>Maryam Faisal is a Pakistani TikToker who has gained significant popularity on the platform. Known for her engaging content, she has amassed millions of followers. Her TikTok account (@maryamfaisal100) features a variety of videos, including dances, lip-syncs, and lifestyle content.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Fifth such breach</strong></p>

<p>This recent string of privacy violations started with social media influencer Minahil Malik after intimate videos allegedly featuring her were leaked and rapidly spread online, sparking extensive public debate. She claimed that the video was "fake" and lodged a complaint with the&nbsp;Federal Investigation Agency (FIA).</p>

<p>After that,&nbsp;a private video of Pakistan TikTok star&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/who-is-imsha-rehman-pakistani-tiktok-star-caught-in-video-leak-scandal-7030925">Imsha Rehman</a>&nbsp;went viral, showing her in an intimate position. She faced a lot of backlash from social media users, who accused her of intentionally making the video public to gain attention. In response, she also deactivated her social media accounts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Later, a private video of Pakistani TV host and influencer Mathira Mohammad was also leaked on social media.&nbsp;Several explicit clips allegedly showed Ms&nbsp;Mohammad in a compromising position. However, the videos could not be verified.&nbsp;The 32-year-old influencer said that people are misusing her name and photoshoot pictures and creating fake photos.</p>

<p>Last week,&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/kanwal-aftab-becomes-latest-victim-in-series-of-pakistani-influencer-video-leaks-7111466">Kanwal Aftab</a>, a prominent Pakistani influencer, became the fourth victim of the leak. The clips allegedly featured Ms Aftab in a "compromising situation", sparking widespread attention and controversy.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least two people were killed on Monday in Israeli strikes on southern Lebanon, Lebanese authorities said, as a ceasefire ending more than a year of hostilities between Israel and Lebanese armed group Hezbollah appeared increasingly fragile.</p>

<p>The truce, which came into effect early on Nov. 27, stipulates that Israel will not carry out offensive military operations against civilian, military or other state targets in Lebanon, while Lebanon will prevent any armed groups, including Hezbollah, from carrying out operations against Israel.</p>

<p>Lebanon and Israel have already traded accusations of breaches, and on Monday Lebanon said the violations had turned deadly.</p>

<p>One person was killed in an Israeli air attack on the southern Lebanese town of Marjayoun, about 10 km (six miles) from the border with Israel, Lebanon's health ministry said.</p>

<p>Lebanon's state security said an Israeli drone strike had killed a member of its force while he was on duty in Nabatieh, 12 km from the border. State security called it a "flagrant violation" of the truce.</p>

<p>There was no immediate comment from Israeli officials.</p>

<p>Public broadcaster Kan and other Israeli media outlets said on Monday that U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein, who brokered the ceasefire after weeks of shuttle diplomacy, had warned Israel against alleged violations.</p>

<p>The Israeli government did not immediately comment on the reports.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden's latest move has revived allegations raised by Donald Trump of the US Department of Justice being manipulated by political powerhouses. In a stunning volte face, Mr Biden today extended the Presidential pardon to his convicted son Hunter Biden, who was days away from being sentenced to decades in prison.</p>

<p>Joe Biden's move has raised questions about the US Department of Justice and its charges in the Adani case, as many geopolitical experts have pointed out on several occasions.</p>

<h2><strong>HUNTER BIDEN'S CASE</strong></h2>

<p>Hunter Biden, Joe Biden's son, was not just an accused, but found guilty and convicted for gun crimes in the US and for tax evasion of over $1.4 million. He was facing separate prison sentences of 17 years in the gun crime case and up to 25 years for tax evasion.</p>

<p>He has also been accused of using his father's political clout and influence to get exclusive rights to drill for oil in Ukraine as well as have a handful of murky deals with China - for which there can now no longer be a case pursued against him as his father's Presidential pardon gives him immunity for whatever he has done between January 1, 2014, to December 1, 2024.</p>

<p>Hunter Biden's sentencing in court to serve time in prison was scheduled for separate hearings starting December 12, 2024. But his father, President of the United States, went back on his word of "not interfering" in the case by extending the Presidential pardon.</p>

<p>On six occasions over the last year, Joe Biden had assured the US citizens of an "impartial" functioning of the US Department of Justice, but his move today is seen as a clear U-turn from his earlier resolve.</p>

<p>President-elect Donald Trump tore into Joe Biden's move of using the Presidential office to benefit family by calling it a "miscarriage of justice".</p>

<p>Hunter Biden is now a free man with a "full and unconditional" pardon for any action between 2014 and 2024. He cannot face action in future as well on his actions over the last 10 years - the time in which his father was the Vice President and then President of the US.</p>

<h2><strong>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WEAPONISED FOR FOREIGN POLICY?</strong></h2>

<p>The US Department of Justice faces criticism about being weaponised against political opponents in the US and also misused for foreign policy that benefitted those in power. Geopolitical experts and former diplomats have highlighted how Hunter Biden used his father's political clout to gain in Ukraine and China and how the US foreign policy was reportedly moulded by the Biden Administration to suit such personal gains.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">President Joe Biden grants 'unconditional' pardon to son Hunter Biden in federal convictions; Experts Question Outgoing administration's credibility point to DoJ's Vindictive Action against Adanis.<br />
<br />
On the panel: <a href="https://twitter.com/Chellaney?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Chellaney</a> and former diplomat Yogesh Gupta with NDTV's… <a href="https://t.co/v7k9jGlmOQ">pic.twitter.com/v7k9jGlmOQ</a></p>
— NDTV (@ndtv) <a href="https://twitter.com/ndtv/status/1863487076790063328?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>Joe Biden's move has also raised serious questions over the US Department of Justice's action against the Adani Group. There is a wider feeling among diplomats that the Adani indictment by the US Department of Justice is also politically driven by the outgoing Biden administration.</p>

<p>While US President's son Hunter Biden was found guilty and convicted of his charges, there has not been a shred of evidence against Gautam Adani, Sagar Adani and senior executive Vneet Jaain who have been accused by the DoJ and SEC, suspected of acting on the orders of the Biden administration.</p>

<p>The DOJ and the SEC had filed an indictment and a civil complaint in the New York District Court against Gautam Adani, Sagar Adani, and Vneet Jaain, key executives of Adani Green Energy Ltd (AGEL). The Adani Group had rejected the allegations, terming it totally "baseless", and said it would seek legal recourse to defend itself.</p>

<p>Finding itself on the back-foot due to the lack of any evidence, the US Department of Justice in a recent public statement in the Adani case said "The defendants are always innocent unless and until proven guilty."</p>

<p>Joe Biden's move today has sparked off a fierce debate in the United States's power corridors on whether the Department of Justice is indeed "controlled" by political powerhouses.</p>

<h2><strong>WHAT NEW FBI DIRECTOR 'KASH' PATEL SAID</strong></h2>

<p>Kashyap Patel, lawyer, investigator and a stern critic of the US deep state, has spoken out openly about "partisan" and "motivated" practices and also called for a drastic overhaul of the US law enforcement and Intelligence agencies.</p>

<p>"All people in the Department of Justice are just looking for their next promotion," said Mr Patel, who has been named as the next FBI Director by Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Many believe that these "baseless" allegations and "motivated and partisan" foreign policy of the Biden administration will be rectified by the incoming Trump administration. Donald Trump has already announced a complete overhaul of the US foreign policy, including how NATO functions.

       <description><![CDATA[Actor George Clooney is reportedly 'furious' at former President Barack Obama for "abandoning" him after using The American star to push President Joe Biden out of the presidential race.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following Democrats' devastating losses in the 2024 US presidential election, actor George Clooney is reportedly 'furious' at former President Barack Obama using The American star to push President Joe Biden out of the poll race. Days before Mr Biden ended his Presidential campaign, George Clooney wrote a strongly worded op-ed questioning if the 81-year-old could remain president, casting a shadow of doubt over his health and cognitive abilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Ocean's Eleven has reportedly been a close confidante of former President Obama, and it was the latter that allegedly convinced Mr Clooney to publically ask Mr Biden to step out of the race.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, after President-elect Donald Trump officially secured a second term in the White House, the actor has been facing a backlash from the Democrats' loss, as it was his article that was widely credited for changing the course of the election.</p>

<p>Mr Clooney is now "complaining that Obama who sort of manipulated him into doing the dirty work on his behalf has left him to take most of the blame for the election loss," according to a report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.skynews.com.au/opinion/george-clooney-furious-at-obama-for-manipulating-him-into-forcing-biden-out-of-election-race/video/1c67669f6565e7ffd4ad1395341add2c" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">Sky News.</a></p>

<p>A report by OK! Magazine said, "Obama and Clooney have been tight for years, and George became Barack's surrogate in leading the charge for Joe to step away."</p>

<p>"George is furious with Obama for disappearing after the election disaster and leaving him holding the bag for pushing the plan with his Hollywood pals," the article quoted an insider as saying.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As per the report, Mr Obana knew "he would look like a traitor if he publicly called for Joe to be cut loose. And now, he's trying to walk away from it all."</p>

<p>Now, amid public backlash over his article, the actor is reportedly feeling "duped" and "vows he's not going to be anyone's political water boy anymore."</p>

<p>"George feels he stepped up and took a bullet for the team," the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://okmagazine.com/p/george-clooney-furious-barack-obama-disappear-election/" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">report </a>said.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>George Clooney's Op-ed</strong></h2>

<p>Days before Mr Biden endorsed his Vice President Kamala Harris for the presidential race, Mr Clooney wrote a widely read opinion article for the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/10/opinion/joe-biden-democratic-nominee.html" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">New York Times</a>, highlighting the President's poor performance during his debate against his Democratic rival. The article claimed it would not be possible for the 81-year-old leader to win the head-on-head competition against Mr Trump.</p>

<p>"It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe "big F-ing deal" Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate," the article read.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Was he tired? Yes. A cold? Maybe. But our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn't see what we just saw. We're all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we've opted to ignore every warning sign," it added</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China on Monday said it had taken "control measures" against Philippine ships it accused of "illegally gathering" near a disputed reef in the South China Sea.</p>

<p>"Recently, several Philippine ships... illegally gathered under the pretence of fishing in the waters near Houteng Reef of China's Nansha Islands," China Coast Guard spokesperson Liu Dejun said in a statement, using the Chinese names for the Iroquois Reef and Spratly Islands.</p>

<p>"The Chinese Coast Guard took necessary control measures against the Philippine ships in accordance with the law," Liu said.</p>

<p>"We warn the Philippine side to immediately stop its infringements and provocations."</p>

<p>China claims almost all of the South China Sea, despite an international ruling in 2016 concluding its claims have no legal basis.</p>

<p>Beijing has deployed navy, coast guard and so-called maritime militia forces -- allegedly Chinese fishing vessels -- in a bid to bar the Philippines from strategically important reefs and islands in the South China Sea.</p>

<p>Vessels from the two sides have clashed frequently in the past year, resulting in injuries and damages.</p>

<p>Tensions escalated in November when Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos signed two laws defining the country's sea waters and imposing fixed lanes for foreign ships.</p>

<p>That sparked a sharp riposte by China, which summoned Manila's envoy "to lodge solemn representations" over their passage.</p>

<p>Tensions rose again earlier this month when the United States and the Philippines signed a security agreement that allows the two sides to share classified information.</p>

<p>Earlier on Monday, Marcos said a Russian attack submarine was spotted off the country's coast in the disputed South China Sea, describing its presence as "very worrisome".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United Nations chief said Monday the situation in war-torn Gaza was "appalling and apocalyptic", warning conditions faced by Palestinians in the territory may amount to the "gravest international crimes".</p>

<p>In remarks read out on his behalf at a Cairo conference aimed at increasing humanitarian aid, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged the international community to "build a foundation for sustainable peace in Gaza and across the Middle East".</p>

<p>The war in Gaza broke out when Palestinian group Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7, 2023, resulting in 1,208 deaths, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory campaign has killed 44,429 people in Gaza, according to figures from the territory's health ministry that the UN considers reliable.</p>

<p>Guterres highlighted the devastating toll of the conflict and the urgent need for international action.</p>

<p>"Malnutrition is rampant... Famine is imminent. Meanwhile, the health system has collapsed," he said.</p>

<p>The UN chief added that Gaza now has "the highest number of children amputees per capita anywhere in the world", with "many losing limbs and undergoing surgeries without even anesthesia".</p>

<p>The secretary-general also criticised the severe restrictions on aid delivery, calling the current levels "grossly insufficient".</p>

<p>According to UNRWA's count, only 65 aid trucks per day had been able to enter Gaza this past month, compared to a pre-war average of 500.</p>

<p>International aid organisations have repeatedly raised alarm over the deteriorating conditions in Gaza, warning that civilians are on the brink of famine.</p>

<p>They have said aid shipments reaching the enclave are now at their lowest since the start of the war.</p>

<p>Israel, which early in the conflict imposed a complete siege for a period on the Hamas-ruled territory, has blamed aid issues on what it says is the inability of relief organisations to handle and distribute large quantities of aid.</p>

<p>UN's Guterres said on Monday that the blockade of aid to Gaza "is not a crisis of logistics" but rather "a crisis of political will and of respect for fundamental principles of international humanitarian law".</p>

<p>UNRWA said all the attempts it made to deliver aid into northern Gaza had either been "denied" or "impeded" between October 6, 2024 and November 25, amid fierce fighting in the area.</p>

<p>Guterres said UNRWA is an "irreplaceable lifeline for millions of Palestinians", adding that "if UNRWA is forced to close, the responsibility of replacing its vital services ... would rest with Israel".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Although hunting or consuming sea turtles is prohibited under the Philippines' environmental protection laws, these marine creatures continue to be consumed in some communities where they are considered a traditional delicacy.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three people have died, and at least 32 others were hospitalized in the Philippines after consuming a stew made from an endangered sea turtle, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2y8xz9nweo">BBC</a></em> reported. Officials reported that dozens of indigenous Teduray people began experiencing symptoms such as diarrhoea, vomiting, and abdominal spasms after eating the dish last week in a coastal town in Maguindanao del Norte Province.&nbsp;Although hunting or consuming sea turtles is prohibited under the Philippines' environmental protection laws, these marine creatures continue to be consumed in some communities where they are considered a traditional delicacy.</p>

<p>However, eating sea turtles, particularly their meat or organs, can be extremely dangerous and potentially fatal. Sea turtles often carry toxins such as chelonitoxin, a naturally occurring biotoxin. Consumption of their meat, fat, or other parts can lead to poisoning symptoms like nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, difficulty breathing, and even death in severe cases. Though the exact cause is unknown, it is thought to be linked to poisonous algae that the turtles eat, according to the Turtle Foundation charity.</p>

<p>A local official, Irene Dillo told the <em>BBC </em>that some dogs, cats, and chickens fed the same sea turtle meat also died. She added that authorities are currently investigating the deaths.</p>

<p>According to local media, most of the residents hospitalised have since been discharged, while the three people who died were buried immediately, adhering to local traditions.</p>

<p>Councilor Datu Mohamad Sinsuat Jr. emphasised the need to strictly enforce the ban on hunting sea turtles in the region. He vowed, "This food poisoning incident will never happen again."</p>

<p>Earlier this year,&nbsp;eight children and an adult died after eating sea turtle meat on Pemba Island in the Zanzibar archipelago,&nbsp;<em><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/03/11/eight-children-a-woman-die-eating-sea-turtle-meat-20443027/?ico=top-stories_home_top">Metro</a></em>&nbsp;reported.&nbsp;A further 78 people were hospitalised after consuming the meal on March 5, according to Mkoani District medical officer, Dr Haji Bakari.</p>

<article>
<p>Similar cases have also been reported in Indonesia, Micronesia and India's Indian Ocean islands. So far, no antidote for the poisoning has been found.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin approved the country's budget for 2025 on Sunday, which includes record-breaking spending on military needs amid Moscow's ongoing assault against Ukraine. The budget allocates about $126 billion (13.5 trillion rubles) to national defence - which reportedly amounts to 32.5 per cent of the total government spending.</p>

<p>Moscow's 2025 defence budget is about $28 billion (three trillion rubles) higher than the previous record set this year, according to a report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/02/europe/putin-russia-defense-budget-ukraine-intl-hnk/index.html" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">CNN</a>. This is reportedly over 6 per cent of Russia's total&nbsp;gross domestic product (GDP).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last year, the Russian government allocated 28.3 per cent of total spending to Defence needs. According to a report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://kyivindependent.com/putin-approves-russias-budget-with-record-spending-on-national-defense/" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">The Kyiv Independent</a>, the planned Russian spending on war and law enforcement agencies surpassed the country's combined expenditures on education, healthcare, social policy, and the national economy.</p>

<p>The new three-year budget, however, projects a slight reduction in military spending for 2026 and 2027, with $114.9 billion allocated for 2026 and $122.4 billion for 2027. Lawmakers in both houses of the Russian parliament, the State Duma and Federation Council, had already approved the budget plans in late November.</p>

<p>The Russia-Ukraine war, which began in February 2022, remains Europe's biggest conflict since World War II. The war has drained both Moscow and Kyiv's resources.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Though Russian forces are bigger and better equipped, and in recent months Moscow's army has even pushed Ukrainian troops backwards in eastern areas, the massive spending on military needs has put a strain on its economy and population.</p>

<p>Inflation is running high in the country, and there is a labour shortage in the market. In an effort to control the spiralling situation, the Russian Central Bank, in October, raised interest rates to 21 per cent, the highest in decades.</p>

<p>Though Ukraine has always been on the back foot in the war in terms of material and manpower, it has been getting billions of dollars in help from its Western allies. On Monday, &nbsp;one of Ukraine's major backers, Germany pledged more than half a billion in new military equipment, scheduled to be delivered in December.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It remains to be seen how much aid Kyiv will continue to come from the United States once President-elect Donald Trump takes office.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has received an invitation to visit India from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the dates for his visit will be set in early 2025, Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov said.</p>

<p>While addressing a briefing, Ushakov stated that Putin and PM Modi have an agreement to hold meetings once a year and it is Russia's turn this time, according to Russian Embassy in India.</p>

<p>The diplomat stated, "Our leaders have an agreement to hold meetings once a year. This time, it's our turn." He further said, "We received Mr. Modi's invitation and we will certainly consider it positively."</p>

<p>Yury Ushakov noted, "We will figure out the tentative dates early next year."</p>

<p>This will be Putin's first visit to India since the beginning of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia in 2022. India has always advocated "peace and diplomacy" for resolving conflict between Ukraine and Russia.</p>

<p>Putin and PM Modi remain in regular contact, holding talks over phone-call once every couple of months, according to Russian Embassy in India. The two leaders also hold in-person meetings. This year, the two leaders met twice as PM Modi in July travelled to Moscow to participate in the 22nd Russia-India summit.</p>

<p>PM Modi's official visit to Russia in July marked his first bilateral visit after resuming office for the third time. PM Modi was also conferred with Russia's highest national award "The Order of St. Andrew the Apostle" for his contribution to fostering India-Russia ties.</p>

<p>From a warm hug to driving an electric car for 'dost' PM Modi, the chemistry between the leaders hogged the limelight. During his visit to Russia, PM Modi held a bilateral meeting and an informal meeting with Putin. The two leaders also visited the Rosatom Pavilion at the VDNKh Exhibition Centre in Moscow.</p>

<p>In October, PM Modi visited Russia's Kazan for a two-day visit to attend the BRICS Summit. He thanked Russian President Vladimir Putin, the people of Russia and their government for their hospitality. PM Modi took to X to share glimpses of his visit to Russia.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[With a market cap exceeding $135.37 billion, XRP has overtaken the USDT stablecoin ($134.17 billion) and Solana ($108.01 billion).]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The crypto market is abuzz following a seismic shift as XRP, the token powering Ripple's ecosystem, surged beyond $2, solidifying its position as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://beincrypto.com/ripple-xrp-flips-usdt-solana/" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>Beincrypto </em></a>reported.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>With a market cap exceeding $135.37 billion, XRP has overtaken the USDT stablecoin ($134.17 billion) and Solana ($108.01 billion), reigniting discussions about its potential to challenge Ethereum's dominance. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.37, marking a remarkable 25.57% increase since Monday's session began. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Speculation is rife about XRP's trajectory, with enthusiasts suggesting it could rival Ethereum (ETH), whose market cap currently stands at $441.46 billion. Adding to the buzz, a recent meeting between Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson and Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has captured attention, along with rumours of Garlinghouse being considered for a role as Donald Trump's potential crypto czar. Such a development could further bolster XRP's standing, especially given Trump's reported pro-crypto stance, Beincryto reported.</p>

<p>XRP's resurgence aligns with renewed scrutiny of Ripple's ongoing legal battle with the U.S. SEC. The lawsuit, which began in December 2020, has subjected XRP to intense market and regulatory pressures. Despite these challenges, XRP has regained its pre-lawsuit valuation, evoking memories of its dominance before the SEC's 2018 classification of Bitcoin and Ethereum as non-securities following the pivotal Hinman speech. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The Ripple case has unveiled internal SEC debates through the so-called "Hinman emails," revealing disagreements over the speech's implications for other cryptocurrencies. While these revelations have fueled market optimism, XRP's regulatory status remains unresolved, with legal analysts predicting the case could stretch into July 2025. &nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The rapid increase in satellites and space junk will make low Earth orbit unusable unless companies and countries cooperate and share the data needed to manage that most accessible region of space, experts and industry insiders said.</p>

<p>A United Nations panel on space traffic coordination in late October determined that urgent action was necessary and called for a comprehensive shared database of orbital objects as well as an international framework to track and manage them.</p>

<p>More than 14,000 satellites including some 3,500 inactive surround the globe in low Earth orbit, showed data from US-based Slingshot Aerospace. Alongside those are about 120 million pieces of debris from launches, collisions and wear-and-tear of which only a few thousand are large enough to track.</p>

<p>"There's no time to lose on space traffic coordination. With so many objects being launched into space, we have to do everything we can to ensure space safety, and that means facilitating the sharing of information between operators, be they public or private, in order to avoid collisions," said panel co-chair Aarti Holla-Maini, director of the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs.</p>

<p>Low Earth orbit must remain safe to prevent costly disruption to the technology behind global communication, navigation and scientific exploration, she said.</p>

<p>Yet there is no centralised system that all space-faring nations can leverage and even persuading them to use such a system has many obstacles. Whereas some countries are willing to share data, others fear compromising security, particularly as satellites are often dual-use and include defence purposes. Moreover, enterprises are keen to guard commercial secrets.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the mess multiplies.</p>

<p>A Chinese rocket stage exploded in August, adding thousands of fragments of debris to low Earth orbit. In June, a defunct Russian satellite exploded, scattering thousands of shards which forced astronauts on the International Space Station to take shelter for an hour.</p>

<p>Low Earth orbit is the region most congested with human-made objects as it offers a balance between cost and proximity, making it a prime target for the rapidly growing commercial space sector. It has also seen a 17% rise in close approaches per satellite over the past year, Slingshot data showed.</p>

<p>Projections point to tens of thousands more satellites entering orbit in the coming years. The potential financial risk of collisions is likely to be $556 million over five years, based on a modelled scenario with a 3.13% annual collision probability and $111 million in yearly damages, said Montreal-based NorthStar Earth &amp; Space.</p>

<p>"We are at a critical point with respect to putting regulations and structure in space to monitor and manage the growing congestion. With Starlink launching thousands of satellites per year, China and others preparing to follow, we will soon push the bearing capacity of prime orbits," said NorthStar CEO Stewart Bain.</p>

<h3><strong>Risky business</strong></h3>

<p>Low Earth orbit is densely packed, with bands such as the one for satellite internet service Starlink from commercial space company SpaceX - at an altitude of 540-570 km (336-354 miles). As of Nov. 27, Starlink had 6,764 satellites in orbit, Jonathan's Space Report showed.</p>

<p>SpaceX data showed Starlink satellites performed nearly 50,000 collision-avoidance manoeuvres in the first half of 2024, about double the previous six months.</p>

<p>SpaceX did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.</p>

<p>The European Space Agency, which has fewer spacecraft than SpaceX, said in 2021 its manoeuvres have increased to three or four times per craft versus a historical average of one.</p>

<p>The 800-900 km band contains fewer satellites but has 3,114 objects - including operational and non-operational payloads, rocket bodies and fragments - which make up 20% of the total mass of objects in low Earth orbit, posing significant collision risk, LeoLabs data showed.</p>

<p>Expired satellites add to the clutter as they stay in orbit until they fall into - and burn up in - Earth's atmosphere years later or are flown to a "graveyard orbit" some 36,000 km away.</p>

<p>Russia drew global criticism in November 2021 when it test fired a missile at a defunct satellite in orbit, creating thousands of fragments of debris. Russia invaded Ukraine three months after the test.</p>

<p>"The potential for conflicts between states has been on a steep rise in the recent past. If these extend to space it could complicate the outer space environment. We urgently need common global rules for coordination," said Anirudh Sharma, CEO of Bengaluru-based Digantara, which specialises in space situational awareness.</p>

<h3><strong>Final frontliner</strong></h3>

<p>The UN's Holla-Maini, whose office serves as secretariat for the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, said the October panel aimed to bring together public- and private-sector experts to outline steps needed to start work on coordination. It will present its findings at a committee meeting next year.</p>

<p>Global cooperation is essential to developing enforceable rules akin to those used by the International Civil Aviation Organization for air traffic, industry experts told Reuters.</p>

<p>Such effort would involve the use of existing tools, such as databases, telescopes, radars and other sensors to track objects while improving coverage, early detection and data precision.</p>

<p>Yet geopolitical tension and reluctance to share data with nations deemed unfriendly as well as commercial concerns over protecting proprietary information and competitive advantages remain significant barriers.</p>

<p>That leaves operators of orbital equipment relying on informal or semi-formal methods of avoiding collisions, such as drawing on data from the U.S. Space Force or groups like the Space Data Association. However, this can involve issues such as accountability and inconsistent data standards.</p>

<p>"The top challenges are speed - as consensus-building takes time - and trust," Holla-Maini said. "Some countries simply can't communicate with others, but the U.N. can facilitate this process. Speed is our biggest enemy, but there's no alternative. It must be done."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump has appointed Massad Boulos, a Lebanese-born billionaire, as his senior adviser for Arab and Middle Eastern Affairs. Boulos is also the father-in-law of Trump's daughter Tiffany Trump. The President-elect made the announcement on Truth Social, highlighting Boulos's legal and business expertise.</p>

<p>"I am proud to announce that Massad Boulos will serve as Senior Advisor to the President on Arab and Middle Eastern affairs. Massad is an accomplished lawyer and a highly respected leader in the business world, with extensive experience on the International scene," Trump wrote on Truth Social.</p>

<p>"He has been a longtime proponent of Republican and Conservative values, an asset to my Campaign, and was instrumental in building tremendous new coalitions with the Arab American Community. Massad is a dealmaker, and an unwavering supporter of PEACE in the Middle East. He will be a strong advocate for the United States, and its interests, and I am pleased to have him on our team,” Trump concluded.</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Earlier, Trump extended a diplomatic role to Charles Kushner, the father-in-law of his daughter Ivanka Trump, as ambassador to France.</p>

<h2><strong>Who is Massad Boulos?</strong></h2>

<p>Massad Boulos, born in Lebanon, moved to Texas as a teenager to pursue higher education at the University of Houston. His professional journey began in Nigeria, where he joined his family's automotive business, eventually rising to leadership positions at SCOA Motors and Boulos Enterprises.</p>

<p>Some reports suggest Mr Boulos unsuccessfully contested a parliamentary seat in Lebanon in 2009 and maintained ties with the country's Christian political elite - partly due to his father-in-law's financial support of the Free Patriotic Movement, a Christian party aligned with Hezbollah. Mr Boulos has denied these claims.</p>

<p>In an October 2024 interview with Newsweek, he said he was not affiliated with any party in Lebanon, though he acknowledged being “acquainted with most Lebanese Christian leaders,” including a Hezbollah-endorsed presidential candidate. He also refuted earlier reports by Arab News and AP about his alleged parliamentary candidacy.</p>

<p>In a June interview with AP, Mr Boulos described himself as a “friend” of Suleiman Frangieh, the leader of Lebanon's Marada Movement, whose presidential bid is backed by Hezbollah. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who endorsed Frangieh in 2023, was later killed in an Israeli airstrike on Beirut in September.</p>

<p>Mr Boulos's father and grandfather were influential figures in Lebanese politics, and his father-in-law was a significant financial supporter of the Free Patriotic Movement, a Christian party allied with Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Recently, Mr Boulos played a major role in Donald Trump's campaign, focusing on gaining support from Arab American voters in key states like Michigan. As reported by Axios, he has also acted as a crucial intermediary between Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Trump, facilitating communication in the months leading up to the election.</p>

<p>Michael Boulos, the son of Massad Boulos, and Tiffany Trump were married in an elaborate ceremony at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida in November 2022, following their engagement in the White House Rose Garden during Trump's first term.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Reversing his past promises to not use the powers of the presidency for the benefit of his family, US President Joe Biden on Sunday issued an official pardon for his son, Hunter Biden, sparing him a possible prison sentence for two criminal cases.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reversing his past promises to not use the powers of the presidency for the benefit of his family, US President Joe Biden on Sunday issued an official pardon for his son, Hunter Biden, sparing him a possible prison sentence for two criminal cases related to federal felony gun and tax convictions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Joe Biden had time and again said that he would not pardon his son or commute his sentence after convictions in the two cases in Delaware and California. Mr Biden's decision to use his position to help his son marks a significant shift in the Democratic President's political position, who promised Americans to restore norms and respect for the rule of law, after Donald Trump's first term in office.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Biden's Statement</strong></h2>

<p>"Today, I signed a pardon for my son Hunter. From the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department's decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted," the US President said in a statement.</p>

<p>Mr Biden,&nbsp;who is in the final weeks of his presidency before Trump takes office on January 20,&nbsp;said that his opponents had sought to break his son with selective prosecution.</p>

<p>"No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter's cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son -- and that is wrong," said the President.</p>

<p>He stressed that people were rarely brought to trial for felony charges for how they filled out a gun form, and said others who were late in paying taxes because of addiction but paid them back with interest and penalties, as his son had, typically received non-criminal resolutions to their cases.</p>

<p>"It is clear that Hunter was treated differently. The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election," Mr Biden said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"In trying to break Hunter, they've tried to break me - and there's no reason to believe it will stop here. Enough is enough," he added.</p>

<p>Hunter Biden, a recovering drug addict who became a target of Republicans, has been granted "a full and unconditional" pardon for any offences in a window from January 1, 2014, to December 1, 2024.</p>

<p>Mr Biden said he had made his decision to pardon over the weekend.</p>

<p>The president, his wife, Jill Biden, and their family including Hunter, spent the Thanksgiving holiday in Nantucket, Massachusetts, and returned to Washington on Saturday night.</p>

<p>"Here's the truth: I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice - and once I made this decision this weekend, there was no sense in delaying it further," he said.</p>

<p>"I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision," the President added.</p>

<h2><strong>What Is Presidential Pardon?</strong></h2>

<p>The US Constitution gives power to presidents to grant clemency, which can include commutations and pardons. Granting commutation reduces penalties against the convicted felon without erasing the conviction. Meanwhile, a pardon forgives a person's federal crimes entirely.</p>

<h2><strong>Republicans Criticized Joe Biden's Move</strong></h2>

<p>"Does the Pardon given by Joe to Hunter include the J-6 Hostages, who have now been imprisoned for years? Such an abuse and miscarriage of Justice!" President-elect Donald Trump said in a post on his Truth Social site, referring to those convicted for storming the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, after Trump claimed falsely that he had won the 2020 election.</p>

<p>"Joe Biden has lied from start to finish about his family's corrupt influence-peddling activities," said Representative James Comer, chair of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability.</p>

<h2><strong>Cases Against Hunter Biden</strong></h2>

<p>The younger Biden faced sentencing for the false statements and gun convictions this month. He was convicted earlier this year of lying about his drug use when he bought a gun -- a felony.</p>

<p>In September he also pleaded guilty to federal charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes while spending lavishly on drugs, sex workers and luxury items. He was scheduled for sentencing in that case on December 16.</p>

<p>Earlier, Hunter Biden has paid the back taxes, as well as penalties levied by authorities. In August 2023, his lawyers said prosecutors had reneged on a plea deal that would have resolved the tax and firearms charges -- but that agreement fell apart at the last minute.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For tax evasion, Hunter Biden was facing up to 17 years in prison. For the separate gun charge, he was facing 25 years in prison.</p>

<p>"I have admitted and taken responsibility for my mistakes during the darkest days of my addiction - mistakes that have been exploited to publicly humiliate and shame me and my family for political sport," Hunter Biden said in a statement on Sunday.</p>

<p>"In the throes of addiction, I squandered many opportunities and advantages ... I will never take the clemency I have been given today for granted and will devote the life I have rebuilt to helping those who are still sick and suffering," He said further, adding he had remained sober for more than five years.</p>

<p>His case has long been a thorn in the Biden family's side, particularly during this election year when Republicans have charged that Hunter was being treated too leniently.</p>

<p>However, President Biden's withdrawal from the presidential race in favour of Vice President Kamala Harris had taken much of the zeal out of the Republican drive to make an example out of his son. Still, prosecutors appeared unwilling to cut him any slack, rejecting a so-called "Alford plea," whereby Hunter Biden would admit guilt because of the high probability of conviction, but would maintain his innocence.</p>

<h2><strong>Power And Pardon</strong></h2>

<p>The move brings fresh scrutiny over the independence of the US judicial system -- especially at a time when incoming president Donald Trump has moved to appoint loyalists to the FBI and Justice Department himself.</p>

<p>But, this is not the first time when a US President used pardon to help family members and other political allies.</p>

<p>Bill Clinton pardoned his half-brother for old cocaine charges and Mr Trump pardoned the father of his son-in-law for tax evasion, though in both cases those men had already served their prison terms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Trump has also vowed to pardon supporters who stormed the US Capitol in a deadly riot on January 6, 2021, in a bid to reverse his 2020 election loss.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[To explore the Earth's natural satellite, the communication and navigation infrastructure between both worlds must be synced immaculately.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Time moves faster on the Moon than on Earth, a new study based on Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, published in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ad643a" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>Astronomical Journal</em></a> has shown. Since the moon's gravitational pull is weaker than Earth's, the clocks on the Moon tick faster with the difference being about 56 microseconds per Earth day, or 0.000056 seconds. "If we are on the Moon, clocks are going to tick differently [than on Earth]," said theoretical physicist Bijunath Patla of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) associated with the study.</p>

<p>Mr Patla and his colleague Neil Ashby, improved on previous analyses by using Einstein's work to calculate the number. The theory of general relativity posits that the rate of a standard clock is influenced by the gravitational potential at its location and its relative motion.</p>

<p>"For example, clocks farther away from Earth tick faster, and clocks in uniform motion tick slower with respect to "ideal" clocks, and vice versa. Therefore, choosing an appropriate reference frame becomes essential for obtaining self-consistent results when comparing clocks on two celestial bodies," the study stated.</p>

<p>To tackle such a problem, Mr Patla and Mr Ashby acknowledged that the Earth-Moon system is in free fall, moving only under the influence of the Sun's gravity. This enabled them to formulate the contributions from each complication: the rotation of each body, tidal forces, deviations in shape from perfect spheres, and so forth.</p>

<h3><strong>Why is it important?</strong></h3>

<p>Over 50 years after the first lunar landing, NASA is now preparing to send humans back to the Moon as part of the Artemis mission. To explore the Earth's natural satellite, the communication and navigation infrastructure between both worlds must be synced immaculately.</p>

<p>When it comes to navigation, a drift of 56 microseconds over a day between a clock on the Moon and a clock on Earth can be a big difference. The relativistic framework enables us to compare clock rates on both bodies and might help establish Coordinated Lunar Time (LTC). The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy has instructed NASA to work with the US government to devise a plan by the end of 2026.</p>

<p>As part of the Artemis Mission, NASA is planning to study places on the lunar surface where bases can be set up that can later be used to venture deeper into the vast emptiness of the cosmos. Scientists are also planning to set up rail tracks on the moon along with a transit system to transfer humans and cargo to the lunar body.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[While this trend offers a temporary solution to societal expectations, experts warn of the potential risks and emotional complexities.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As societal pressures and career aspirations delay marriage for many young Vietnamese, a unique trend has emerged: renting boyfriends. Social media groups have seen a surge in women seeking temporary partners to appease their families and avoid the stigma of being single, according to a report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/article/3288539/vietnam-youth-rent-partners-meet-parental-expectations-applicants-must-be-fit-good-cooks" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>South China Morning Post</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minh Thu, a 30-year-old professional, faced immense pressure from her parents to bring a boyfriend home for the Lunar New Year. Unable to find a suitable partner, she resorted to hiring a man to pose as her boyfriend. The man, skilled in domestic chores and social graces, successfully impressed her family.</p>

<p>Khanh Ngoc, another young woman, had a similar experience. She rented a handsome, younger man who charmed her parents during a visit. This experience improved her relationship with her family.</p>

<p>Huy Tuan, a 25-year-old man, has made a business out of being a "fake boyfriend." He undergoes rigorous training to meet the diverse needs of his clients, from casual dates to family gatherings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While this trend offers a temporary solution to societal expectations, experts warn of the potential risks and emotional complexities associated with such arrangements.</p>

<p>Nguyen Thanh Nga, a researcher at the Academy of Journalism and Communication in Vietnam, stated: "If exposed, families could experience significant emotional damage and lose trust. Additionally, renting a partner is not legally protected in Vietnam, so women should be especially cautious."</p>

<p>The trend of renting partners has garnered widespread attention on social media.</p>

<p>One online observer remarked, "Marrying without a successful career just leads to a lot of problems. Renting a partner is a win-win - it makes your parents happy and alleviates pressure on you."</p>

<p>Conversely, another commenter expressed concern: "I can't imagine how heartbreaking it would be for parents to find out it was a lie."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[An average $16 billion may have been illicitly siphoned out of Bangladesh annually during former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's 15-year rule.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An average $16 billion may have been illicitly siphoned out of Bangladesh annually during former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's 15-year rule, according to the findings of a committee formed by interim leader Muhammad Yunus.</p>

<p>The panel led by economist Debapriya Bhattacharya submitted a white paper on the state of Bangladesh's economy to Yunus in Dhaka on Sunday, according to a government statement.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina was ousted by student protesters in August after 15 years of increasingly authoritarian rule. The army and protest leaders tapped Nobel laureate Yunus, who pioneered microcredit to the poor, to lead an interim government.</p>

<p>"Our blood curdles to know how they plundered the economy," Yunus said in the statement. "The sad part is they looted the economy openly. And most of us could not summon courage to confront it."</p>

<p>The document shows "the economy we inherited after the July-August mass uprising," he said.</p>

<p>Leaders in Sheikh Hasina's party are in jail or hiding in Bangladesh, or have left the country. The party doesn't have a spokesperson who can be contacted to comment on allegations in the white paper.</p>

<p>As part of its investigations, the committee looked into seven large projects out of 29 which had more than 100 billion taka ($836 million) expenditure outlay each.</p>

<p>The initial cost of the seven projects examined was estimated at 1.14 trillion taka. Hasina's government later revised project costs to 1.95 trillion taka through the addition of more components and inflated land prices among others, according to the statement.</p>

<p>"The problem is deeper than what we have thought," Bhattacharya said, adding that the 400-page white paper will show "how crony capitalism gave birth to the oligarchs, who controlled the policy framing."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new audio clip featuring Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader Ali Muhammad Khan has surfaced, indicating widening rifts within the leadership of the Imran Khan-founded party after its "do-or-die" protest fiasco in Islamabad, Geo News reported.</p>

<p>The audio clip was leaked days after PTI suddenly delayed its march after a government crackdown on protesters trying to reach D-Chowk, drawing widespread condemnation within the party. Questions were raised within the PTI parliamentary leadership about why supporters were told to go to D-Chowk instead of holding a sit-in in Sangjani, as Imran Khan had ordered.</p>

<p>In the audio, which Ali Muhammad Khan confirmed was his during a talk with Geo News, the PTI leader said that Imran Khan had ordered the leaders to set up a protest camp in Islamabad's Sangjani area, not at D-Chowk in the Red Zone, according to Geo News report.</p>

<p>In the audio leak, Ali Muhammad Khan said, "The PTI founder had not asked to come to D-Chowk, but to Islamabad. Khan Sahib had said that the final sit-in location would be confirmed after the party members reached Islamabad." He said that Imran Khan had given instructions in the presence of Barrister Gohar Faisal.</p>

<p>Questioning the role of Imran Khan's sister, Aleema Khan, the PTI leader asked why did she made the call instead of the party chairman Gohar Ali Khan.</p>

<p>He asked, "The PTI founder had said that there was no place for hereditary politics in our party, so why did Aleema Khan call the protest herself?" He further said that Khan had said party leadership would give the call, according to Geo News report.</p>

<p>In the audio clip, Ali Muhammad Khan said that PTI's aim was to hold talks through the protests at the orders given by Imran Khan. He further said that Imran Khan was not aware of his wife, Bushra Bibi's presence in the protest and was informed regarding this by Barrister Gohar Ali Khan.</p>

<p>Khan said, "The PTI chairman and secretary general should have announced that the sit-in would be held in Sangjani," adding that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur was also in agreement with this. He said that no one had the right to override the decision of PTI founder, Geo News reported.</p>

<p>Stressing that PTI should have followed Imran Khan's instructions, Ali Muhammad Khan said, "We should have followed our leader's orders and stopped in Sangjani. No one, including Bushra Bibi, has the right to override the founder-chairman's decision." He said, "When Barrister Saif had conveyed the message of the founding chairman, we should have acted on it."</p>

<p>The PTI protests, demanding the release of former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, took a violent turn on Tuesday, resulting in the deaths of four security personnel and two PTI supporters, Dawn reported. The PTI protesters were met with intense tear gas upon reaching Islamabad's D-Chowk following which the clash between protesters and security forces broke out.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New Zealand scientists on Monday began dissecting a whale considered the rarest in the world, a species so elusive that only seven specimens have ever been documented.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The dead spade-toothed whale washed ashore on New Zealand's South Island earlier this year, offering a chance to study a deep-sea mammal that has never been seen alive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Measuring five metres (16.4 feet) long, the whale was winched off the beach in July and has sat in a special freezer since.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Whale expert Anton van Helden said it was the first time scientists had been able to dissect a complete spade-toothed specimen, which belongs to the family of beaked whales.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This is a remarkable and globally significant opportunity," he said.</p>

<p>The week-long dissection will help to fill in gaps about the whale's behaviour, its diet, and even its basic anatomy.</p>

<p>"Beaked whales are the most enigmatic group of large mammals on the planet," said Van Helden.</p>

<p>"They are deep divers that are rarely seen at sea, which presents real challenges for researching these marine animals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This one is the rarest of the rare -- only the seventh specimen known from anywhere in the world, and the first opportunity we have had to undertake a dissection like this."&nbsp;</p>

<p>New Zealand's conservation department said the spade-toothed whale was the "rarest whale in the world".&nbsp;</p>

<p>The species was first described in 1874 from just a lower jaw and two teeth collected from the Chatham Islands off the east coast of New Zealand.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That sample, along with skeletal remains of two other specimens found in New Zealand and Chile, enabled scientists to confirm a new species.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because so few specimens have been found and there have been no live sightings, the spade-toothed whale is classified as "data deficient" under the New Zealand Threat Classification System.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel launched air strikes into Lebanon on Sunday, saying it destroyed "thousands" of Hezbollah rocket launchers and thwarted a major attack, while the Lebanese group insisted it had been able to deliver a drone and rocket barrage of its own.</p>

<p>The result was perhaps the biggest exchange of fire in 10 months of a war which began with a Hamas attack launched from Gaza and has triggered both new violence on the Lebanon-Israel border and fears of a broader conflagration in the Middle East.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said around 100 of its fighter jets had struck more than 270 targets, "90 percent" of which "were short-range rockets aimed at northern Israel".</p>

<p>Hezbollah, the powerful Iran-backed Lebanese armed group, denied that thousands of launchers had been destroyed or that Israel had thwarted a larger attack. It said its own operation "was completed and accomplished".</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his cabinet the strikes were "not the final word" in the campaign against Hezbollah.</p>

<p>A soldier in the Israeli navy was killed in combat and two more wounded, the military said, with an official telling AFP their boat may have been hit by one of their own side's air-defence interceptors.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has traded near-daily cross-border fire with Israeli forces throughout the Gaza war, in what Hezbollah says is support for its Palestinian ally Hamas.</p>

<p>But fears of a wider regional conflagration soared after attacks in late July, blamed on Israel, killed Iran-aligned leaders including the Hamas political chief and a top Hezbollah commander, Fuad Shukr, which prompted vows of revenge.</p>

<p>Britain and Jordan were among those to appeal on Sunday for an end to the escalation and a ceasefire in Gaza.</p>

<p>Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi also called for the UN Security Council to take "deterrent" and "effective" measures against Netanyahu and his ministers who "kill all chances of achieving peace".</p>

<p><strong>Homes damaged</strong></p>

<p>Hezbollah said its operatives launched "a large number of drones" and "more than 320" Katyusha rockets targeting "enemy positions" across the border.</p>

<p>The group's leader Hassan Nasrallah named the "main target" as the Glilot military intelligence base near Tel Aviv, which Israeli media reported is home to the headquarters of the Mossad spy agency.</p>

<p>Israel's military said there were "no hits" on the base.</p>

<p>A secondary target, said Nasrallah, was Ein Shemer, a military airport used by Israeli drones.</p>

<p>He also appeared to suggest Hezbollah's retaliation for Shukr's killing was over, saying "if the result is satisfactory" then its response "has been accomplished".</p>

<p>An AFP photographer in Acre, an Israeli city 20 kilometres (12 miles) from the border, reported damage to three homes from a Hezbollah rocket that struck a roof, with shrapnel smashing windows and destroying a bed.</p>

<p>"There were explosions in the area of Haifa," said Abigail Levy, a resident of the coastal city further south. "I was stopped and was told not to go to the beach."</p>

<p>AFPTV footage from early Sunday showed dozens of interceptor rockets being launched into dense clouds above the Upper Galilee in northern Israel.</p>

<p>An AFP photographer saw a Hezbollah drone exploding into a huge fireball as it was intercepted by the Israeli Air Force.</p>

<p>Hezbollah announced two of its fighters had been killed, while its ally the Amal movement also reported the death of a member. No casualties were immediately reported in Israel.</p>

<p>Military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said Israel "was aware" of six operativess "killed in the strikes".</p>

<p>Another military spokesman, Nadav Shoshani, said Hezbollah's strikes were "part of a larger attack that was planned and we were able to thwart a big part of it this morning".</p>

<p>The fighting disrupted air travel in Israel and Lebanon, with both British Airways and Air France among those suspending flights to Tel Aviv.</p>

<p><strong>'Stop the escalation'</strong></p>

<p>Yemen's Huthi rebels, one of several Iran-backed groups that have been drawn into the Gaza war's periphery, hailed the Hezbollah attack and declared that their own retaliation was "definitely coming".</p>

<p>The fighting between Israeli forces and Hezbollah has killed hundreds, mostly in Lebanon, and displaced tens of thousands of residents on both sides of the border.</p>

<p>Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati told an emergency cabinet meeting he was in contact with "Lebanon's friends to stop the escalation".</p>

<p>General Charles Brown, the most senior officer in the US military, arrived in Israel on Sunday evening to meet his Israeli counterpart Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi, the Israeli military said.</p>

<p>The United States is Israel's top military supplier.</p>

<p>A US defence official said Washington had helped track the Hezbollah barrage although it was not involved in shooting down any drones or rockets or in the strikes on Lebanon.</p>

<p>The Flightradar24 tracking website on Sunday afternoon showed a US Navy surveillance drone had been flying over nearby Mediterranean waters.</p>

<p><strong>Gaza talks</strong></p>

<p>Hamas hailed Hezbollah's Sunday attack as "a slap in the face" for Israel, and the Palestinian movement on Sunday night said it fired a rocket toward Tel Aviv.</p>

<p>Israel's military said it landed in an "open area" south of the city.</p>

<p>In the leadup to Sunday's major exchange, Western and Arab diplomats had sought to head off regional retaliation, stressing the urgency of reaching a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal.</p>

<p>Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, whose officials have been mediating Gaza truce talks for months alongside the US and Qatar, "warned of the dangers of a new front opening in Lebanon" and called for progress in the talks to enable a "path to calm and stability in the region" his office said.</p>

<p>A Hamas official said on Sunday the group's delegation had left the Egyptian capital after meeting with mediators.</p>

<p>In Gaza, witnesses said battles raged in the area of Deir al-Balah, in the territory's central region.</p>

<p>Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,199 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign has killed at least 40,405 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which does not break down civilian and militant deaths. The UN rights office says most of the dead are women and children.</p>

<p>Out of 251 hostages seized by Palestinian Hamas operatives in their attack, 105 remain in Gaza including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French judicial authorities on Sunday extended the detention of the Russian-born founder and chief of Telegram Pavel Durov after his arrest at a Paris airport over alleged offences related to the popular but controversial messaging app.</p>

<p>His arrest at the Le Bourget airport outside Paris late Saturday is the latest extraordinary twist in the career of one of the world's most influential tech icons.</p>

<p>The detention of Durov, 39, was extended beyond Sunday night by the investigating magistrate who is handling the case, according to a source close to the investigation. This initial period of detention for questioning can last up to a maximum of 96 hours.</p>

<p>When this phase of detention ends, the judge can then decide to free him or press charges and remand in further custody.</p>

<p>Russia has accused France of "refusing to cooperate" and fellow tech mogul Elon Musk swept to his defence. Durov holds a French passport in addition to other nationalities.</p>

<p>Durov had arrived in Paris from Baku, Azerbaijan, and was planning to have dinner in the French capital, a source close to the case said.</p>

<p>He was accompanied by a bodyguard and a personal assistant who always accompany him, added the source, asking not to be named.</p>

<p>France's OFMIN, an office tasked with preventing violence against minors, had issued an arrest warrant for Durov in a preliminary investigation into alleged offences including fraud, drug trafficking, cyberbullying, organised crime and promotion of terrorism, another source said.</p>

<p>Durov is accused of failing to take action to curb the criminal use of his platform.</p>

<p>Telegram said in response that "Durov has nothing to hide and travels frequently in Europe."</p>

<p>"Telegram abides by EU laws, including the Digital Services Act -- its moderation is within industry standards," it added. "It is absurd to claim that a platform or its owner are responsible for abuse of that platform."</p>

<p><strong>'Assault on basic human rights'</strong></p>

<p>Durov founded Telegram in 2013 after his first project, the Russian social network VKontakte (VK), ran into ownership difficulties he blamed on the Kremlin.</p>

<p>Telegram has become hugely popular partly due to the ease of viewing and posting videos on its messaging "channels".</p>

<p>But critics accuse it of hosting often illegal content ranging from extreme sexual imagery, disinformation and also services for buying drugs.</p>

<p>Russia's embassy to Paris said it had demanded access to Durov but had had no response from France, saying "the French side is refusing to cooperate".</p>

<p>Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Moscow had asked for consular access, but since Durov also had French citizenship "France considers that it is his main nationality".</p>

<p>Musk, who leads the Tesla car group and the X social media, formerly Twitter, posted the hashtag #FreePavel on X and commented in French, "Liberte Liberte! Liberte?" (Freedom Freedom! Freedom?).</p>

<p>US whistleblower Edward Snowden, who took asylum in Russia, blasted "an assault on the basic human rights of speech and association", saying he was saddened Paris had "descended to the level of taking hostages as a means for gaining access to private communications."</p>

<p><strong>'Independence, privacy, freedom'</strong></p>

<p>A source close to the case expressed surprise that Durov had flown to France with a warrant against him. "Perhaps he had a feeling of impunity," said the source.</p>

<p>Le Bourget is now used by private planes rather than regular commercial traffic. It is also famed as the place the Russian ballet dancer Rudolf Nureyev defected to the West in 1961.</p>

<p>Telegram, an encrypted messaging app based in Dubai, has positioned itself as an alternative to US-owned platforms, which have been criticised for their commercial exploitation of users' personal data.</p>

<p>Telegram has committed to never disclosing information about its users.</p>

<p>In a rare interview given to right-wing talk show host Tucker Carlson in April, Durov said he got the idea to launch an encrypted messaging app after coming under pressure from the Russian government while working at VK.</p>

<p>He said he then tried to settle in Berlin, London, Singapore and San Francisco before choosing Dubai, which he praised for its business environment and "neutrality".</p>

<p>People "love the independence. They also love the privacy, the freedom, (there are) a lot of reasons why somebody would switch to Telegram," Durov told Carlson.</p>

<p>He said at the time that the platform had more than 900 million active users.</p>

<p>By basing itself in the United Arab Emirates, Telegram has shielded itself from moderation laws at a time when Western countries are pressuring large platforms to remove illegal content.</p>

<p>Telegram allows groups of up to 200,000 members, which has led to accusations that it makes it easier for false information to spread virally, as well as for users to disseminate neo-Nazi, paedophilic, conspiratorial and terrorist content.</p>

<p>Competitor messaging service WhatsApp introduced worldwide limits on message forwarding in 2019 after it was accused of enabling the spread of false information in India that led to lynchings.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Hamas said Friday it rejected "new conditions" in a Gaza ceasefire proposal that US-led mediators presented during two days of talks in Qatar.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hamas said Friday it rejected "new conditions" in a Gaza ceasefire proposal that US-led mediators presented during two days of talks in Qatar.</p>

<p>Diplomatic efforts have so far failed to alleviate the suffering endured over more than 10 months of war, but US President Joe Biden insisted after the latest round of talks that "we are closer than we have ever been".</p>

<p>He is sending US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Israel this weekend to push the latest proposal, the State Department said.</p>

<p>Egyptian, Qatari and US mediators have been seeking to finalise details of a framework initially outlined by Biden in May, which he said Israel had proposed.</p>

<p>In a joint statement, the mediators said they had presented both sides with a proposal that "bridges remaining gaps" and will continue working in the coming days to hash out the specifics on humanitarian provisions and the hostage-prisoners swap.</p>

<p>Talks aiming to secure a rapid deal are set to resume in Cairo "before the end of next week".</p>

<p>Hamas, which did not attend the Doha talks, swiftly announced its opposition to what it called "new conditions" from Israel in the latest plan.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on mediators to "pressure" Hamas to accept Biden's framework.</p>

<p>Threats by Iran and its proxies to attack Israel have added renewed urgency to the efforts to hammer out a Gaza ceasefire, with mediators seeking a deal in the hopes of dousing a wider regional conflict.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"No one in the region should take actions to undermine this process," Biden warned, later telling reporters, "There's just a couple more issues, I think we've got a shot."</p>

<p>- 'Cataclysmic' consequences -<br />
An informed source told AFP Hamas had objected to conditions about keeping Israeli troops on Gaza's border with Egypt and terms related to the release of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for Israeli hostages.</p>

<p>Western ally Jordan, however, put the blame squarely on Netanyahu for blocking a deal, with Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi urging pressure "by everyone who wishes to see this through to completion".</p>

<p>British Foreign Secretary David Lammy and his French counterpart Stephane Sejourne held talks in Israel on Friday to press the deal.</p>

<p>Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz told his visiting counterparts he expects foreign support if Iran seeks to avenge the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sejourne replied that it would be "inappropriate" to discuss responding to any attack while diplomacy to stop it from happening is in high gear.</p>

<p>A senior US official, speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity, said Iran would face "cataclysmic" consequences if it strikes Israel.</p>

<p>A deadly attack by Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank late Thursday drew international condemnation and calls for sanctions, including against government ministers, over the surge in settler violence against Palestinians since the Gaza war began.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said "dozens of Israeli civilians, some of them masked", entered the village of Jit and "set fire to vehicles and structures in the area, hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails". A Palestinian man was shot dead.</p>

<p>The West Bank-based Palestinian foreign ministry described the attack as "organised state terrorism".</p>

<p>The European Union's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said he would propose sanctions against Israeli government "enablers" of Jewish settler violence.</p>

<p>Israeli far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a proponent of West Bank settlements, was quick to join other Israeli leaders in condemning Thursday's attack by "criminals".</p>

<p>First polio case recorded</p>

<p><br />
Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel that triggered the war resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Militants also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead. More than 100 were freed during a one-week truce in November.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the toll from Israel's retaliatory military campaign topped 40,000, according to the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, which does not provide a breakdown of civilian and militant casualties.</p>

<p>The war has devastated the besieged territory's healthcare infrastructure, prompting repeated warnings from the World Health Organization about the risk of preventable diseases.</p>

<p>On Friday, the Palestinian health ministry reported an unvaccinated 10-month-old child in Gaza had been diagnosed with polio, the territory's first case in 25 years, according to the WHO.</p>

<p>The announcement came hours after UN chief Antonio Guterres called for two seven-day breaks in the Gaza war to vaccinate more than 640,000 children against type 2 poliovirus, which was first detected in the territory's wastewater in June.</p>

<p>As truce talks were underway, thousands of civilians were on the move again inside the Palestinian territory after the Israeli military issued fresh evacuation orders ahead of imminent military action.</p>

<p>The UN estimated the orders affect more than 170,000 people, forcing them to pack into the shrinking remnants of an area declared a humanitarian safe zone.</p>

<p>The area where people have been told to relocate to makes up just 11 percent of Gaza, according to the UN.</p>

<p>"During each round of negotiations, they exert pressure by forcing evacuations and committing massacres," Issa Murad, a Palestinian displaced to Deir al-Balah, said of the Israeli forces.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A British woman on Sunday celebrated her 102nd birthday by skydiving out of a plane and said she hoped her daredevil antics might inspire other elderly people to stay active.</p>

<p>Manette Baillie said it was "a bit scary", adding "I must admit I shut my eyes very firmly."</p>

<p>Baillie told BBC radio she just wanted "other people who are getting towards 80 and 90 not to give up anything. Just keep going".</p>

<p>It's not the first time the centenarian from the village of Benhall Green in eastern England has taken on a daredevil challenge.</p>

<p>She drove around the Silverstone motor racing circuit in a Ferrari at 210 kilometres per hour (130 miles per hour) to mark her 100th birthday two years ago.</p>

<p>The skydive at Beccles Airfield involved Baillie jumping from a height of more than 2,100 metres (6,900 feet), with an assistant strapped into the harness with her.</p>

<p>Baillie said earlier she had been spurred into action after hearing about a friend's 85-year-old father who had done a skydive.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of Britain's biggest mobile network operators said on Sunday it will warn parents they should not give smartphones to children under the age of 11.</p>

<p>The new guidance comes after growing concern from parents about the potential pitfalls of smartphone access for young people.</p>

<p>A recent study by the UK communications regulator found around a quarter of British children aged between five and seven-years-old now had a smartphone.</p>

<p>EE will say in new guidance that children should only be given phones with "limited capability devices" allowing them only to text and call.</p>

<p>It will also advise enabling parental control features for teens under the age of 16 and restrictions on social media for the under-13s.</p>

<p>UK parents have increasingly started to push back against the trend of giving children one of the devices when they transfer from primary to secondary school at the age of 11.</p>

<p>Widely justified on safety grounds in case of an emergency on the way to or from school, parents fear the phones also potentially open children up to online predators, bullying, social pressure and harmful content.</p>

<p>"While technology and connectivity have the power to transform lives, we recognise the growing complexity of smartphones can be challenging for parents and caregivers," said Mat Sears, EE corporate affairs director.</p>

<p>"They need support, which is why we are launching new guidelines on smartphone usage for under 11s, 11 to 13-year-olds, and 13 to 16-year-olds to help them make the best choices for their children through these formative years."</p>

<p>US author Jonathan Haidt -- whose recent book "The Anxious Generation" argued that smartphones have rewired children's brains -- has urged parents to act together on smartphone access so it becomes the norm for children not to have one.</p>

<p>A child "breaks our heart" by telling us they are excluded from their peer group by being the only one without a phone, he said earlier this year.</p>

<p>Mr Haidt advocates for no smart phones before the age of 14 or social media before 16.</p>

<p>"These things are hard to do as one parent. But if we all do it together -- if even half of us do it together -- then it becomes much easier for our kids," he added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four people including a police officer were injured in a stabbing attack in Sydney early on Sunday, police said, the latest in a series of knife assaults in Australia's biggest city this year.</p>

<p>A man who ran from the scene has been taken into custody, police said in a statement. There is no ongoing threat to people in Sydney, said New South Wales state Police Minister Yasmin Catley.</p>

<p>Police said no one was killed in the attack, which came after a "domestic-related" incident in a car that collided with another vehicle in the southern suburb of Engadine.</p>

<p>The attacker "was armed with what we believe to be a boxcutter," police superintendent Donald Faulds said in a televised press conference.</p>

<p>Aerial footage of the scene by the Australian Broadcasting Corp showed two crashed cars cordoned off with police tape.</p>

<p>Sydney, a city of 5 million, has seen a spate of knife attacks this year, prompting the New South Wales government to toughen its knife laws. The state parliament passed laws in June giving police electronic metal-detecting scanners to check people without a warrant at shopping centres, sporting venues and public transport stations.</p>

<p>In April, six people were killed and 12 injured in a knife attack at a mall in Sydney's Bondi area.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Indian-origin doctor was shot in US in Tuscaloosa, a city in Alabama, on Friday. The victim, identified as Dr Ramesh Babu Peramsetty, died on the spot. He was a renowned physician who operated several hospitals in America.</p>

<p>Dr Ramesh, who was from Andhra Pradesh's Tirupati district, was one of the founders and medical director of a group of local medical officers operating as the Crimson Network. He was known for his contributions in the field of healthcare and also practiced as a physician in Tuscaloosa.</p>

<p>"As many are aware at this moment, we have been informed of Dr. Ramesh Peramsetty's passing. The Peramsetty family ask for us to give them privacy as they grieve his passing. They have received abundant outpouring of love and faith. We will continue to honor him as he would want us to do. Thank you for your understanding," the Crimson Care Network Team said in a Facebook post. (sic)</p>

<p>The Crimson Care Network said its team "is prepared to make more statements within the next few days."</p>

<h3><strong>Who Was Dr Ramesh Babu Peramsetty?</strong></h3>

<p>Dr Peramsetty graduated from the Medical College of Wisconsin, Sri Venkateswara Medical College in 1986, according to his Wedmd page. He had 38 years of experience.</p>

<p>He worked in Tuscaloosa and four other locations and was specialised in Emergency Medicine and Family Medicine, it says. He was also affiliated with Diploma in Child Health (DCH) Regional Medical Center.</p>

<p>As per local reports, a street in Tuscaloosa was named after him due to his significant contributions in the medical profession. He also did extensive work during the Covid-19 pandemic and also received awards for the same, reports suggest. He is survived by his wife, two sons and two daughters and all are settled in the US, as per reports.</p>

<p>He donated Rs 14 lakh to Menakuru High School in Andhra Pradesh where he studied and also for the construction of a Sai temple in his village, according to reports.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US rapper Macklemore has announced he is cancelling an upcoming show in Dubai over the UAE's involvement in the conflict in Sudan, charges the Gulf state has denied.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The rapper best known for hits like 2012's "Thrift Shop" made the announcement in a post on social media on Saturday.</p>

<p>"I have decided to cancel my upcoming show in Dubai this October," he said.</p>

<p>"Over the last several months I've had a number of people reach out to me, sharing resources and asking me to cancel the show in solidarity with the people of Sudan," he said.</p>

<p>"Until the UAE stops arming and funding the RSF I will not perform there," Macklemore added, referring to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces that have been battling the Sundanese army.</p>

<p>War has raged since April 2023 between the Sudanese army, under the country's de facto ruler Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the RSF, which is commanded by Burhan's former deputy Mohamed Hamdan Daglo.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For months, the army has accused the UAE of supporting the RSF.</p>

<p>In June, Sudan's ambassador to the United Nations Al-Harith Idriss al-Harith Mohamed called Abu Dhabi's financial and military support for the RSF the "main reason behind this protracted war".</p>

<p>The UAE has denied allegations of RSF support as "disinformation", saying that it's efforts are focused exclusively towards de-escalation and alleviating Sudan's humanitarian suffering.</p>

<p>Macklemore has released socially aware music in the past, supporting LGBTQ+ rights while also criticising ills including poverty and consumerism.</p>

<p>In his latest track released in May, Macklemore voices support for Palestinians and also praises students across the United States protesting against Israel's war in Gaza.</p>

<p>The song, "Hind's Hall", is named after a building at Columbia University that students recently occupied and renamed after Hind Rajab, a six-year-old Palestinian girl killed in Gaza.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that Sunday's strikes in Lebanon were "not the final word" in his country's military campaign against Lebanese armed group Hezbollah.</p>

<p>"We are striking Hezbollah with surprising, crushing blows... This is another step towards changing the situation in the north and safely returning our residents to their homes. And, I repeat, this is not the final word," Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting.</p>

<p>He said the military destroyed thousands of "short-range rockets, all of which were intended to harm our civilians and forces in the Galilee".</p>

<p>"Additionally, the IDF (Israeli military) intercepted all the drones that Hezbollah launched at a strategic target in central Israel," he said, without identifying what the target was.</p>

<p>Israeli media however reported the target Hezbollah aimed to strike was the headquarters of the Israeli Mossad spy agency near Tel Aviv.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk on Sunday came out in support of Telegram Founder Pavel Durov, saying Mark Zuckerberg should instead be arrested for "massive child exploitation" problem on his Meta-owned Instagram.</p>

<p>The billionaire reacted after Russian-born Pavel Durov, founder and owner of the popular encrypted messaging app Telegram, was arrested in France over numerous charges related to his platform, and faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.</p>

<p>Mr Musk said that Meta Founder Mark Zuckerberg has "already caved into censorship pressure".</p>

<p>"Instagram has a massive child exploitation problem, but no arrest for Zuck, as he censors free speech and gives governments backdoor access to user data," the X owner posted.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

Instagram has a massive child exploitation problem, but no arrest for Zuck, as he censors free speech and gives governments backdoor access to user data. <a href="https://t.co/RTTGIaD0gA">https://t.co/RTTGIaD0gA</a> <a href="https://t.co/iPb5NIxIJN">https://t.co/iPb5NIxIJN</a></p>
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1827647414020211016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 25, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>He further said that "It's 2030 in Europe and you're being executed for liking a meme".</p>

<p>"It is vital to the support of free speech that you forward X posts to people you know, especially in censorship-heavy countries," the tech billionaire mentioned.</p>

<p>In February this year, Mr Zuckerberg apologised to the families of victims of online child sex abuse during a Senate hearing on Capitol Hill.</p>

<p>The billionaire entrepreneur told parents that "I'm sorry for everything you have all been through. No one should go through the things that your families have suffered".</p>

<p>"And this is why we invest so much and we are going to continue doing industry-wide efforts to make sure no one has to go through the things your families have had to suffer," he added.</p>

<p>In May this year, Mr Musk said that Zuckerberg-run Meta is "super greedy" at taking credit for advertisers who run campaigns on its platform.</p>

<p>The X owner replied that "we are terrible at claiming credit, and Meta is super greedy at claiming credit."</p>

<p>The rivalry between Mr Musk and Mr Zuckerberg is well known. They were apparently set for a "cage fight' some time back -- dubbed as the fight of the century. However, the much-anticipated showdown between the duo was cancelled.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>German police said Sunday that a Syrian man has given himself up and confessed to killing three people and wounding eight others in a knife rampage at a street festival.</p>

<p>The random attack as thousands of people gathered on Friday night in the western city of Solingen has stunned Germany.</p>

<p>Two men aged 56 and 67 and a 56-year-old woman were killed, officials said. Four of the wounded remained in a serious condition. All of the victims were stabbed in the neck, according to police.</p>

<p>Police said in a statement that the suspect was a 26-year-old Syrian who had "given himself up to authorities... and declared himself responsible for the attack".</p>

<p>Officers arrested a suspect in a raid at a hostel for asylum seekers on Saturday, not far from the scene of the attack, a police spokesman told AFP.</p>

<p>Police have evidence linking the man to the knife attacks, according to North Rhine-Westphalia state interior minister Herbert Reul. Federal prosecutors have launched an investigation into charges of "participating in a terrorist organisation", a spokesman said.</p>

<p>According to the Bild and Spiegel newspapers, the suspect arrived in Germany in December 2022 and had a protected immigration status often given to those fleeing war-torn Syria.</p>

<p>He was not known to the security services as an extremist, the newspapers reported.</p>

<p><strong>Teen arrested&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Police have also arrested a 15-year-old suspected of failing to report a criminal act. Witnesses allegedly saw the teen discussing the attack, said Markus Caspers, prosecutor of Duesseldorf, just west of Solingen.</p>

<p>The attack took place as thousands of people gathered for the first night of a "Festival of Diversity", part of a series of events to mark Solingen's 650th anniversary. The whole festival has now been cancelled.</p>

<p>Germany has been on high alert for extremist attacks since the Gaza war erupted on October 7 with the Hamas attacks on Israel.</p>

<p>German street festivals and markets have previously been hit.</p>

<p>A truck rampage at a Berlin Christmas market in 2016 killed 12 people. In May, a police officer was killed and five people were wounded in a knife attack at a far-right rally in Mannheim, with an Islamist motive suspected.</p>

<p>The jihadist Islamic State group's Amaq propaganda arm said "the perpetrator of the attack on a gathering of Christians" in Solingen "was a soldier of the Islamic State".</p>

<p>IS said the attack was carried out as "revenge for Muslims in Palestine and everywhere", in an apparent reference to the Gaza conflict.</p>

<p>The claim could not be immediately verified, though German officials had said "a terrorist motive cannot be excluded".</p>

<p>Interior Minister Nancy Faeser had warned this month that Germany was in "the firing line" of Islamist groups.</p>

<p>National and local leaders, including Chancellor Olaf Scholz, said the country had been "deeply shocked" by the deaths in Solingen, a city of 160,000 people.</p>

<p>Witness Lars Breitzke told the Solinger Tageblatt newspaper he was near the attack, close to the main stage, and "understood from the expression on the singer's face that something was wrong".</p>

<p>"And then, a metre away from me, a person fell," said Breitzke, who at first thought it was someone who had had too much to drink.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When he turned around, he saw other people on the ground in pools of blood.</p>

<p>During a visit to the site of the tragedy Faeser called for the country to "remain united" as she denounced "those who want to stir up hatred".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Let us not be divided," she said.</p>

<p>Scholz's centre-left coalition faces regional elections next week in the east of the country, where the far-right AfD is leading in polls.</p>

<p>Germany took in more than a million asylum seekers in 2015-2016 at the height of Europe's migrant crisis.</p>

<p>The influx was deeply divisive in Germany and fuelled the popularity of the AfD.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Titanic, famously touted as "practically unsinkable" before its maiden voyage, remains one of the deadliest maritime disasters in history.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A newspaper chronicling the devastating human toll of the Titanic sinking has been uncovered after 112 years in a wardrobe. The edition of the <em>Daily Mirror</em>, dated April 20, 1912-five days after the tragedy-was discovered in a home in Lichfield, Staffordshire. Its front-page story depicts the anguish of passengers' relatives in Southampton, anxiously awaiting news of their loved ones from the list of survivors, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/titanic-sink-newspaper-wardrobe-auction-how-much-b2600091.html"><em>Independent </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://hansonsauctioneers.co.uk/suffering-of-british-families-with-loved-ones-on-titanic-revealed-by-newspaper-found-in-wardrobe-after-112-years/"><em>Hanson's Auctioneers</em></a>, who sold the newspaper this week, described the find as a "valuable piece of social history."</p>

<p>Charles Hanson, the auction house's owner, remarked, "The sinking of the Titanic has been extensively documented in films, TV shows, and books, and we know much about the lives lost. This discovery serves as a poignant reminder of the many bereaved families and friends-heartbroken mothers, fathers, and wives."</p>

<p>The Titanic, famously touted as "practically unsinkable" before its maiden voyage, remains one of the deadliest maritime disasters in history. Over 1,500 people perished when the ship struck an iceberg in the North Atlantic, with only around 700 survivors. Although the ship was equipped with too few lifeboats, many were launched half-empty due to the widespread belief that the Titanic could not sink.</p>

<p>Southampton, home to the majority of the ship's crew, was particularly hard hit by the disaster. The Daily Mirror described the scene outside the White Star Line's offices, where lists of survivors were posted: "A list of the saved was posted outside the White Star offices, and mothers and wives who had been hoping against hope eagerly read the names, only to find their worst fears were realized. By this appalling disaster, mothers have been robbed of sons, wives of husbands, and young girls of sweethearts."</p>

<p>The newspaper called the publication of the survivors' list "a terrible day in the history of the town, though it put an end to all suspense." The cover story was supplemented by a two-page spread featuring photographs of victims, including Titanic's captain, Edward Smith.</p>

<p>This piece of maritime and social history sold at auction for 34 pounds on Tuesday, August 20. The auctioneer noted that while accounts of the sinking often focus on the victims, the newspaper's emphasis on the families left behind is what makes it so compelling. "When you see the faces of those affected, it's very moving," Mr. Hanson added.</p>

<p>The newspaper was found alongside other historical documents, including those covering King George V's coronation in 1911.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon-based armed group Hezbollah launched hundreds of rockets and drones at Israel today after Israel's military said it initiated pre-emptive strikes on targets in Lebanon, stating that they had detected preparations by Hezbollah for "large-scale" attacks on Israeli territory.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Israel said its military deployed fighter jets that destroyed "thousands" of Hezbollah rocket launchers in south Lebanon that were aimed at northern and central Israel.</p>

<p>"Approximately 100 IAF fighter jets struck and eliminated thousands of Hezbollah rocket launcher barrels, aimed for immediate fire toward northern and central Israel. More than 40 Hezbollah launch areas were struck. We will do whatever is needed to defend our civilians and the State of Israel," the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) posted on X.</p>

<p>Pictures emerged of an Israeli fighter jet firing flares as it tried to intercept a hostile aircraft that was launched from Lebanon over the border area with south Lebanon.&nbsp;Israel conducted an airstrike on the town of Zibqin in south Lebanon. Visuals showed smoke billowing from the site of the airstrike.</p>

<p>The Lebanese movement said its attack was an "initial response" to the assassination of its military commander Fuad Shukr last month, adding the attack &nbsp;had "ended with total success".</p>

<p>Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant declared a state of emergency and Foreign Minister Israel Katz said Israel would respond to developments on the ground but did not seek a full-scale war.</p>

<p>As a precautionary measure, flights to and from Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv were suspended for around 90 minutes.</p>

<p>The United Nations peacekeeping force in Lebanon and the UN's special coordinator's office in the country called on all sides to cease fire, calling the developments overnight "worrying".</p>

<p>Responding to the developments, the US said it "will keep supporting Israel's right to defend itself". National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett said, "At President Joe Biden's direction, senior US officials have been communicating continuously with their Israeli counterparts. We will keep supporting Israel's right to defend itself, and we will keep working for regional stability."</p>

<p>Today's escalation is one of many between Israel and Hezbollah that began after Hamas's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on October 7 last year, which led to the outbreak of the Gaza war.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 45-year-old woman from Andhra Pradesh has gone missing in Malaysia's capital Kuala Lumpur after being swept away into a sewage drain after the footpath she was walking on collapsed suddenly.</p>

<p>The woman, identified as Vijayalakshmi from Chittoor district's &nbsp;Animiganipalle village, was reportedly walking along a footpath when the ground collapsed. While her husband and son managed to escape the collapse, she was swept into the underground sewer.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hezbollah, which has exchanged fire with Israeli forces since October, last went to war with Israel in 2006 and has since expanded its domestic and regional influence, politically and militarily.</p>

<p>Financed and armed by Iran, Hezbollah is the most prominent actor in the so-called axis of resistance -- regional pro-Tehran armed groups opposed to Israel that also include Palestinian group Hamas, Iraqi movements, and Yemen's Huthi rebels.</p>

<p>Since the day after Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel that triggered war in the Gaza Strip, Hezbollah has launched cross-border attacks from Lebanon seeking to tie up Israeli military resources in support of its Palestinian ally.</p>

<p>Fears of all-out war have spiked after Hezbollah vowed to avenge an Israeli strike on Beirut's southern suburbs last month that killed a key commander, Fuad Shukr, and Iran pledged retaliation for the killing in Tehran, blamed on Israel, of Hamas's political chief Ismail Haniyeh.</p>

<h3><strong>Hezbollah-Israel War</strong></h3>

<p>Hezbollah, whose name means "Party of God" in Arabic, was founded during the Lebanese civil war after Israel besieged the capital Beirut in 1982, and has since become a key domestic political player.</p>

<p>Created at the initiative of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, the Shiite Muslim movement gained its moniker as "the Resistance" by fighting Israeli troops who occupied southern Lebanon until 2000.</p>

<p>Israel and Hezbollah fought a month-long war in July-August 2006 that killed some 1,200 people in Lebanon, mostly civilians, and 160 in Israel, mostly soldiers, after the group kidnapped two Israeli troops in a cross-border raid.</p>

<p>United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701 ended that conflict and called for the Lebanese army and United Nations peacekeepers to be the only armed forces deployed in south Lebanon.</p>

<p>But Hezbollah has maintained a discreet presence there, where it enjoys broad support and where experts say it likely has a network of underground tunnels.</p>

<p>On August 16, the group released a video showing what appeared to be underground tunnels and large missile launchers, without revealing their location.</p>

<p>The group also has a strong presence in the Bekaa valley in east Lebanon near the border with Syria.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has bolstered its powerful arsenal, including with guided missiles, and says it can count on more than 100,000 fighters.</p>

<p>Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah was elected secretary-general in 1992 after Israel assassinated his predecessor, and he rarely appears in public.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Hezbollah's Regional Influence</strong></h3>

<p>Hezbollah is a key actor in the Middle East, where it plays a central role in the "axis of resistance". It has supported and trained Iran-backed groups in Iraq and Huthi rebels in Yemen, who since October have claimed attacks on Israel and Israeli-linked shipping interests.</p>

<p>Hezbollah is also present in Syria, where many of its members have fought in support of President Bashar al-Assad in his country's civil war, with Damascus also an ally of Tehran.</p>

<p>Domestically, Hezbollah is the only Lebanese faction to have retained its weapons after the country's 1975-1990 civil conflict, doing so in the name of "resistance" against Israel.</p>

<p>It is now a key political player, though detractors have accused it of being a "state within a state".</p>

<p>Political deadlock between Hezbollah allies and their adversaries since late 2022 has prevented the election of a new president, in a country experiencing a grinding economic crisis.</p>

<h3><strong>Hezbollah's Services</strong></h3>

<p>Founded in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, Hezbollah has become predominant in all Shiite Muslim areas of Lebanon, while its key religious and financial institutions are based in Beirut's southern suburbs.</p>

<p>The movement runs an extensive social services network, complete with schools, hospitals, emergency responders and a wide range of charitable organisations serving its supporters.</p>

<p>Its trademark yellow flags and huge portraits of Nasrallah, along with pictures of dead commanders, fighters and "axis of resistance" figures, adorn areas of the country where it is popular.</p>

<p>The United States has considered Hezbollah a "terrorist" organisation for years, blaming it for a series of bombings and hijackings in the 1980s, including one targeting US Marines in Beirut. The European Union applies the classification to the group's armed wing.</p>

<p>In 2022, a UN-backed court sentenced two Hezbollah members in absentia to life imprisonment for a huge Beirut bombing in 2005 that killed Lebanon's former premier Rafic Hariri.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NASA, on Saturday, announced&nbsp;that Boeing's Starliner capsule will return empty from the International Space Station (ISS), citing ongoing propulsion system problems. This latest development adds to Boeing's woes, with estimated losses in the Starliner program exceeding $1 billion, reported <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/24/nasa-boeing-starliner-decision-return-empty-spacex-astronauts-iss.html ">CNBC</a>.</p>

<p>Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams will now return on Elon Musk's SpaceX's Crew-9 vehicle in February 2025, after a six-month extended stay on the ISS. The original nine-day test flight was delayed due to issues with Starliner's thrusters.</p>

<p>A "technical disagreement" between NASA and Boeing led to the decision, with NASA prioritising safety and choosing SpaceX for the return mission.</p>

<p>"Boeing has worked very hard with NASA to get the necessary data to make this decision," NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said on Saturday. "We want to further understand the root causes and understand the design improvements so that the Boeing Starliner will serve as an important part of our assured crew access to the ISS." Mr Nelson stressed that test flights like the Starliner mission are "neither safe, nor routine."</p>

<p>Following the decision, NASA will conduct an additional phase of its Flight Readiness Review to determine the optimal time to bring the empty Starliner capsule back to Earth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite Boeing's assurances that Starliner was safe for emergency crew return, NASA disagreed. Mr Nelson expressed support for Boeing, stating he was "100% certain" that Starliner would launch with a crew again in the future. Boeing also reaffirmed its commitment to safety, saying it would execute the mission as determined by NASA and prepare for a safe uncrewed return.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/boeingspace/status/1827396444959002966?s=46 ">statement on X</a>, Boeing said, "We continue to focus, first and foremost, on the safety of the crew and spacecraft. We are executing the mission as determined by NASA, and we are preparing the spacecraft for a safe and successful uncrewed return."</p>

<p>Ken Bowersox, NASA associate administrator, said NASA officials were unanimous in their decision to choose SpaceX to bring the crew home. Meanwhile, SpaceX will bring two astronauts along on its Crew-9 vehicle - instead of the four who were originally planned to go - to make room for Wilmore and Williams.</p>

<p>Boeing's Starliner capsule, 'Calypso', has been docked at the International Space Station since June, with its mission extended indefinitely due to ongoing thruster failures. The Starliner crew flight test, intended to be a final milestone for Boeing, has instead become a major setback.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A member of the Reuters team covering the war in Ukraine was missing and two others were hospitalised after a strike on a hotel in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk. In a statement, the news agency said that the Hotel Sapphire, where a six-person Reuters crew was staying, was hit "by an apparent missile strike" on Saturday.</p>

<p>"One of our colleagues is unaccounted for, while another two have been taken to hospital for treatment," the agency said.</p>

<p>"Three other colleagues have been accounted for. We are urgently seeking more information, working with the authorities in Kramatorsk, and supporting our colleagues and their families. We will give an update when we have more information," it added.</p>

<p>Vadym Filashkin, governor of Donetsk region, said in a post on Telegram on Sunday morning that "the Russians hit Kramatorsk", and that two journalists were injured, while one was missing after a strike on a hotel.</p>

<p>"Authorities, police and rescuers are working on the spot. Debris clearance and rescue operations are ongoing," he said.</p>

<p>The Russian Defence Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Ukraine's General Prosecutor's Office said in a statement on Telegram that it had opened a "pre-trial investigation" into the strike, which it said happened at 10:35 p.m. local time (1935 GMT) on Saturday.</p>

<p>"Russian troops struck the city of Kramatorsk, probably with an Iskander-M missile," it said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A heart-stopping incident occurred at Gravity Circus in East Sussex when a&nbsp;female circus performer&nbsp;fell off a tightrope 16 feet in the air in front of a horrified audience. According to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/08/23/circus-performer-seriously-injured-falling-tightrope-front-crowd-21479970/">Metro</a></em>, a performer was seated on a chair balanced on a pole held by two men as they navigated a tightrope 16 feet in the air. As she adjusted her position, the pole wobbled, causing her foot to slip. She fell from the apparatus, and the chair struck a wire, sending her into a freefalling backflip. The performer hit the ground knees first, spinning until she landed in a fetal position on the metal floor.</p>

<p>The horrific accident, captured on video, has left onlookers shocked and concerned for the performer's well-being.</p>

<p>According to South East Coast Ambulance Service (Seacamb), the woman sustained non-life-threatening injuries and was taken to the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton.&nbsp;Seacamb said she suffered from ''facial and other injuries consistent with a fall.''</p>

<p>Witness Hayley Walsh told the&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czx6wql53n4o" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">BBC</a>,</em> ''It looked like she gave way. She lost her balance and went flying down wrapped around the wire. She smashed down onto the metal floor.''</p>

<p>After the incident, Gravity Circus informed on Facebook that the performer was ''doing well and is in safe hands''.</p>

<p>They said, ''We can confirm that an accident occurred last night involving one of our tightrope performers during the show. In live entertainment and high-risk performances, accidents can unfortunately happen despite stringent safety measures. Our emergency protocols were immediately enacted, and the performer was promptly taken to the hospital. Our primary concern is the well-being of the performers, their families, the high-wire troupe, and our entire circus family. We are closely monitoring the situation and conducting a thorough investigation.''</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A spacecraft launched last year will slingshot back around Earth and the Moon next month in a high-stakes, world-first manoeuvre as it pinballs its way through the Solar System to Jupiter.</p>

<p>The European Space Agency's Juice probe blasted off in April 2023 on a mission to discover whether Jupiter's icy moons Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa are capable of hosting extra-terrestrial life in their vast, hidden oceans.</p>

<p>The uncrewed six-tonne spacecraft is currently 10 million kilometres (six million miles) from Earth.</p>

<p>But it will fly back past the Moon and then Earth on August 19-20, using their gravity boosts to save fuel on its winding, eight-year odyssey to Jupiter.</p>

<p>Staff at the ESA's space operations centre in Darmstadt, Germany began preparing for the complicated manoeuvre this week.</p>

<p>Juice is expected to arrive at Jupiter's system in July 2031.</p>

<p>It will take the scenic route. NASA's Europa Clipper spacecraft is scheduled to launch this October yet beat Juice to Jupiter's moons by a year.</p>

<p>Long and winding road</p>

<p>Juice is taking the long way around in part because the Ariane 5 rocket used to launch the mission was not powerful enough for a straight shot to Jupiter, which is roughly 800 million kilometres away.</p>

<p>Without an enormous rocket, sending Juice straight to Jupiter would require 60 tonnes of onboard propellant -- and Juice has just three tonnes, according to the ESA.</p>

<p>"The only solution is to use gravitational assists," Arnaud Boutonnet, the ESA's head of analysis for the mission, told AFP.</p>

<p>By flying close to planets, spacecrafts can take advantage of their gravitational pull, which can change its course, speed it up or slow it down.</p>

<p>Many other space missions have used planets for gravity boosts, but next month's Earth-Moon flyby will be a "world first", the ESA said.</p>

<p>It will be the first "double gravity assist manoeuvre" using boosts from two worlds in succession, the agency said.</p>

<p>Juice will cross 750 kilometres above the Moon on August 19, before shooting past our home planet the following day.</p>

<p>The probe will leave Earth at a speed of "3.3 kilometres a second -- instead of three kilometres if we had not added the Moon", Boutonnet said.</p>

<p>As Juice whizzes past Earth and the Moon, it will use the opportunity to snap photos and test out its many instruments.</p>

<p>Down on Earth, some will be taking photos right back. Some lucky amateur sky gazers, armed with telescopes or powerful binoculars, may even be able to spot Juice as it passes over Southeast Asia.</p>

<p>- 'Plate of spaghetti' -</p>

<p>The move has been carefully calculated for years, but it will be no walk in the park.</p>

<p>"We are aiming for a mouse hole," Boutonnet emphasised.</p>

<p>The slightest error during its slingshot around the Moon would be amplified by Earth's gravity, potentially creating a small risk that the spacecraft could enter and burn up in Earth's atmosphere.</p>

<p>The team on the ground will be closely observing the spacecraft -- and have 12-18 hours to calculate and adjust its trajectory if needed, Boutonnet said.</p>

<p>He mostly feared a scenario in which the amount of course corrections needed would erase the gains from the double-world slingshot, meaning they would be "doing all this for nothing".</p>

<p>If all goes well, Juice will head back out into interplanetary space -- for a little while at least.</p>

<p>It will first head to Venus for another boost in 2025.</p>

<p>Juice will even fly past Earth twice more -- once in 2026, then a final time in 2029 before finally setting off towards Jupiter.</p>

<p>Then comes the really tricky part.</p>

<p>Once Juice arrives at Jupiter, it will use a whopping 35 gravitational assists as its bounces around the planet's ocean moons.</p>

<p>During this phase, the probe's trajectory looks like "a real plate of spaghetti", Boutonnet said.</p>

<p>"What we're doing with the Earth-Moon system is a joke in comparison," he added.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few days ago, a tweet claiming responsibility for a global Microsoft outage triggered a meme fest on X. Today, the same man has returned with another viral post, this time taking credit for the chaos that ensued after three arson attacks on France's high-speed rail network. These incidents have paralysed train travel nationwide, just as Paris geared up to host the opening ceremony of the 2024 Olympics yesterday.</p>

<p>A Microsoft error had crippled Windows computers worldwide on July 19. It was later revealed that an update to the anti-virus program 'Falcon Sensor' by CrowdStrike caused the massive outage. Enter Vincent Flibustier, an X user posing as a CrowdStrike employee. Vincent broke the internet with an AI-generated photo of himself outside the CrowdStrike office, captioned, "First day at Crowdstrike, pushed a little update and taking the afternoon off."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last night, three separate arson attacks targeting France's high-speed rail network affected train travel nationwide. The attacks' timing and perpetrators remain unclear, but their impact was immediate and devastating.</p>

<p>Mr Flibustier, following a similar routine, swiftly uploaded an AI-generated image of himself standing in front of a poster of Societe Nationale Des Chemins De Fer Francais - France's state-owned railway network. The tweet has once again gone viral with Mr Flibustier's mission accomplished.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">First day of my new job at SNCF, did a little update on Fire alert system, taking now my afternoon off ? <a href="https://t.co/f3twAKusFh">pic.twitter.com/f3twAKusFh</a></p>
â€” Vincent Flibustier ? (@vinceflibustier) <a href="https://twitter.com/vinceflibustier/status/1816758155239453036?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 26, 2024</a></blockquote>

<h3><strong>What Happened In France</strong></h3>

<p>Approximately 8 lakh passengers are expected to be affected over the weekend, with a quarter of a million already impacted on Friday alone, according to SNCF. The rail network was anticipated to be particularly busy this weekend, not only because of the Olympics but also as people return from or leave for their summer holidays.</p>

<p>There were delays of 90 minutes to two hours on services between Paris and France's north and east. One major branch of the network, the line to France's southeast, was spared after rail maintenance workers surprised unauthorized individuals on site.</p>

<p>High-speed rail operator Eurostar announced that around one in four services across its network linking France, the UK, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany would be cancelled, including trains from Paris to London. Others would operate slower on regular lines not designed for high-speed trains.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US presidential candidate Donald Trump falsely accused election rival Kamala Harris of being an anti-Semite who plans to allow the murder of newborn babies, in a speech meant to rally religious supporters Friday that quickly went off the rails.</p>

<p>The vice president, who is married to a Jewish man, has gained ground on Trump in polling since she replaced Joe Biden on the top of the Democratic ticket just days ago.</p>

<p>Former Republican president Trump dedicated much of his address at a religious convention in southern Florida to assailing Harris's record as a senator and as Biden's number two, but many of his attacks were smears untethered to reality.</p>

<p>Explaining why 59-year-old Harris had skipped Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyau's speech to the US Congress on Wednesday to instead honour a prior commitment, Trump accused her, baselessly, of anti-Semitism.</p>

<p>"She doesn't like Jewish people. She doesn't like Israel. That's the way it is, and that's the way it's always going to be. She's not going to change," he said.</p>

<p>The remark -- coupled with his claim that Harris "is totally against the Jewish people" in North Carolina on Wednesday -- marked an escalation in Trump's incendiary rhetoric, days after his campaign said an attempt on his life had given him a focus on unity.</p>

<p>The hour-long Friday speech, hosted by hard-right Turning Point Action, raised legitimate questions over Harris's previous statements on policing, immigration and the environment that placed her to the left of current Biden administration policy.</p>

<p>But it was marked by hyperbole and falsehood.</p>

<h3><strong>'Execute the baby'</strong></h3>

<p>Trump -- a convicted felon who is fighting multiple further indictments -- suggested baselessly that the Justice Department and FBI were "rounding up" Christians and anti-abortion activists and throwing them in jail for their "religious beliefs."</p>

<p>He also called Biden's decision to exit the election campaign a "coup" by Democrats and said America was a "laughing stock."</p>

<p>But he saved his darkest vitriol for Harris, calling her a "bum" and a failed vice president who had rejected federal judges for being Catholic and would appoint "hardcore Marxists" to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>He also accused her falsely of wanting to force doctors to give chemical castration drugs to children and suggested she might cheat to win in November.</p>

<p>"If Kamala Harris has her way, they will have a federal law for abortion, to rip the baby out of the womb in the eighth, ninth month and even after birth -- execute the baby after birth," he claimed, in perhaps his most egregious calumny.</p>

<p>78-year-old Trump, now the oldest major-party nominee in history, is scrambling to reorient an election against someone two decades his junior, having expected to face an 81-year-old incumbent Biden beset by concerns over infirmity.</p>

<p>Just last week, the former reality TV star was in cruise control as he accepted a hero's welcome -- and the official presidential nomination -- at the Republican convention in Milwaukee.</p>

<h3><strong>Crowning glory</strong></h3>

<p>His crowning glory came a week after a gunman nearly killed him at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania -- an extraordinary incident that Trump vowed Friday to commemorate with "a big and beautiful" new rally in the town, although he did not give a date.</p>

<p>Seeking to become the first female president in US history, Harris is tasked with rapidly assembling a campaign against an opponent who has been in near permanent reelection mode since he became president in 2016.</p>

<p>Trump's predecessor Barack Obama pledged support for Harris earlier Friday, as polls showed her closing the gap that Trump had built over Biden to make the race a statistical tie.</p>

<p>A top California prosecutor and senator before being elected the country's first female and first Black and South Asian vice president, Harris has highlighted Trump's criminal conviction and what she said Thursday is a Republican attack on "hard-fought freedoms" in US society.</p>

<p>Democrats leapt on a Trump campaign announcement late Thursday that cast into doubt whether he will debate Harris.</p>

<p>"It shows that he's afraid," Transport Secretary Pete Buttigieg, a major Harris campaign advocate, told MSNBC.</p>

<p>"It shows that he knows that if the two of them are on a stage together, it's not going to end well for him."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Kamala Harris has reinvigorated the Democratic ticket and inspired the voters they need most: women, African-Americans and youth. But it's not all smooth sailing.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris has reinvigorated the Democratic ticket and inspired the voters they need most: women, African-Americans and youth. But it's not all smooth sailing.</p>

<p>Following Joe Biden's withdrawal from the presidential race, Kamala Harris is poised to become the first woman of colour to run as presidential candidate of a major political party in the US.</p>

<p>As the youngest presidential nominee since Barack Obama, Harris, 59, is comparatively youthful compared with Biden, 81, and Donald Trump, 78.</p>

<p>Her age is likely to make her more appealing and relatable for younger Americans. Polling has already found that 82 percent of voters under 30 - more than any other age group - thought Biden was too old to be an effective president.</p>

<p>Since Israel's invasion of Gaza, Biden has also increasingly been losing the youth vote, with many disillusioned with his stance on the crisis. (Research has demonstrated a stark generation gap around views on Israel and Palestine, with Americans under 30 much more likely to sympathise with Palestinians.)</p>

<p>The heads of the US's most prominent Black sororities and fraternities, known as the 'Divine Nine', have already begun planning a massive voter organisation effort to support Harris. The organisations comprise more than two million young Black people - and their support could represent a significant political advantage.</p>

<p>Though still early days, it's clear Harris has already reinvigorated the Democratic ticket and re-energised the voters they need most: women, African Americans and, especially, young people.</p>

<p>It is important for Harris to court this demographic - and ensure they actually turn up to polling booths in November. Most younger voters - especially women and people of colour - vote Democrat, but only half of Americans aged 18-29 actually voted in 2020.</p>

<p><strong>'Brat' memes and coconut emojis</strong></p>

<p>Just hours after Biden's announcement, Harris received resounding endorsement from the often-cynical Gen Z and younger Millennials.</p>

<p>When British popstar of the summer Charli XCX tweeted "Kamala IS Brat" on Sunday, it instantly went viral. (To clarify, Brat is Charli XCX's latest chart-topping album, released last month. Many fans have since adopted the "brat" identity, which is "to embrace your messiness and vulnerability - being your own authentic self.")</p>

<p>It's a trend currently dominating queer and Gen Z pop culture, as a "brat summer" is declared in the Northern hemisphere and those in the South enjoy a "brat winter".</p>

<p>Even before Harris became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, this Kamala x Brat crossover had been building for weeks online, through memes and TikToks created by fan communities.</p>

<p>Memes can make politics more entertaining and accessible to younger voters and profoundly influence public perceptions of political leaders, especially during election campaigns.</p>

<p>The adoption of Harris as a "brat" is indicative of her youth appeal. Reading the room, the Harris campaign has embraced this trend, changing its official twitter backdrop to a "Brat green" to mimic Charli XCX's album cover</p>

<p>Coconut emojis and memes have likewise flooded social media platforms to demonstrate support.</p>

<p>This trend was inspired by a remark made by Harris at a White House event last May.</p>

<p>"My mother used to - she would give us a hard time sometimes, and she would say to us, 'I don't know what's wrong with you young people. You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?' while laughing. Then, in a serious tone, 'you exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you'," she said.</p>

<p>After going viral at the time (while simultaneously being mocked by conservatives) this quote has resurfaced with greater popularity in recent days. It resonates with younger voters who admire Harris' authenticity. Coconuts have since become a rallying cry for supporters, again demonstrating her youth appeal.</p>

<p><strong>Harris must contend with misogynoir</strong></p>

<p>Yet politics can be a hostile game, especially for those who do not fit the white male status quo.</p>

<p>Women politicians - especially leaders - have historically experienced sexism and misogyny from their peers, the public and the media.</p>

<p>The mainstream media plays a key role in shaping cultural and social attitudes on gender norms, roles and stereotypes. It wields the power to influence public opinion.</p>

<p>The Australian media did just this in its portrayal of first woman prime minister Julia Gillard, who endured an unprecedented quantity and ferocity of criticism during her term.</p>

<p>Hillary Clinton, who came closest to breaking the highest glass ceiling in the US, likewise endured an onslaught of sexism and misogyny from the media, as well as the public and especially Trump.</p>

<p>Scholars analysing the 2016 presidential election found that television coverage favoured Trump and demonised Clinton. Print and online articles were often sexist and targeted her integrity.</p>

<p>And sexist stereotypes spread on social media (including memes emphasising female physical traits to depict Clinton as weak, ill or unattractive, and conversely memes highlighting 'anti-feminine traits' such as dishonesty or untrustworthiness.)</p>

<p>Research has found conservative media outlets with more traditional and right-wing audiences were more likely to be sexist in the coverage of Clinton, while sexism was a "significant predictor" of voter choice at the 2016 election, especially for white voters.</p>

<p>What, then, will Harris likely endure from more traditional media and the opposition during what is gearing up to be a divisive and vicious campaign season?</p>

<p>If her treatment as vice presidential nominee during the 2020 election is any indication, Harris will likely be subjected to unprecedented levels of misogyny and racism.</p>

<p>One study examining gendered abuse of women political candidates at the 2020 election found that a majority was directed at Harris.</p>

<p>This included sexualised narratives (that she "slept her way to the top"), transphobic narratives (that she's secretly a man), racist narratives (questioning her citizenship and claiming she is not "Black enough" or "Indian enough").</p>

<p>This is referred to as "semiotic violence", where words are weaponised to attack women politicians to silence and ultimately deny them their civic rights.</p>

<p>As a Black and Indian woman, Harris faces what has been termed "misogynoir" - a specific kind of racist misogyny aimed at Black women, who are frequently stereotyped as being "angry" and hypersexualised.</p>

<p>Media coverage of Harris' 2020 vice presidential nomination unduly focused on her gender and race, with one quarter of news articles including a racist or sexist stereotype (though largely due to quoting Trump's ad hominem attacks).</p>

<p>The "angry Black woman" stereotype was most prevalent in this coverage, with Harris portrayed as "mean", "nasty" and "mad".</p>

<p><strong>Republican attacks intensify</strong></p>

<p>In the days since Harris became the prospective nominee, Republicans have intensified their attacks.</p>

<p>Several Republican congresspeople have called her a "DEI [Diversity, Equity and Inclusion] pick" - a coded slur implying she lacks merit and qualification.</p>

<p>Adding fuel to the fire, a 2021 clip has resurfaced of GOP vice presidential nominee JD Vance questioning Harris' leadership skills because she doesn't have biological children, referring to Democrats as a "bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable with their lives".</p>

<p>While Harris is popular among progressive young voters on social media, the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism revealed that hateful and violent speech targeting her on conservative platforms increased dramatically in the 48 hours after Biden' endorsed her as the nominee.</p>

<p>Those comments rose by 33 percent on Trump's Truth Social, 292 percent on Gab, 50 percent on Telegram and 525 percent on 4chan.</p>

<p>Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson has instructed the GOP to refrain from sexist and racist attacks against Harris and instead critique her policy record.</p>

<p>Yet the party's own presidential nominee has continued to attack Harris, labelling her "dumb" and "crazy"; perpetuating a misogynoir stereotype that Black women are irrational and less intelligent and suggesting she is unfit for leadership.</p>

<p>The 2024 US presidential election will certainly be a tale of two Americas - one defined by hatred and the past, while the other looks toward a more inclusive future.</p>

<p>Though embraced by youth culture, Harris will need nerves of steel to get through the upcoming campaign in one piece.</p>

<p>Sadly, this is what women - especially those with multiple marginalised identities - are forced to contend with for daring to enter the (masculinised) political realm.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris is the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. And while she will not be the Democrat's first woman nominee, nor the first person of colour, she faces the compounding challenge of being both.</p>

<p>She will be subject to a highly combative and partisan media landscape, against an opponent who pushes political rhetoric to the extreme.</p>

<p>The crucial question remains whether the media can fairly assess her qualifications for office. The answer could profoundly impact women's political participation - not only in the United States but globally.</p>

<p><strong>Sexist, racist, transphobic: Past media treatment of Harris</strong></p>

<p>The media coverage of Harris to date reflects the US' s deeply partisan landscape, with Democrat and Republican voters consuming and trusting in two nearly inverse news media landscapes.</p>

<p>While mainstream media begins to reckon with Harris as the presumptive nominee (The New York Post referred to Harris as the first 'DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion] President', so we're off to a predictable start), previous scrutiny , particularly during her past campaigns, highlights persistent themes of sexism, racism, and conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>These media onslaughts echo attacks faced by other women leaders globally.</p>

<p>In the 2020 US election, analysis of online discourse of women politicians (78 percent of which was directed at Harris) found that women faced three familiar narratives.</p>

<p>First, sexualised narratives (that Harris "slept her way to the top"). Second, transphobic narratives (insinuating that Harris was secretly a man). And, third, racist or racialised narratives (whether Harris was suitably Black or Indian enough, or even whether there was legitimacy to her citizenship and therefore eligibility for the Presidency).</p>

<p>It's important to note that while online commentary is not media reporting, the distance between the two has blurred in recent years.</p>

<p>As the line between "reporter" and "influencer" becomes less distinguishable, high-profile Republican commenters continue to post unfounded aspersions, such as Harris "isn't black...[but] part of the delusional, Democrat DEI quota".</p>

<p>Typically, these narratives then seep, largely unquestioned , into a range of traditional news and social media channels such as X, Donald Trump's Truth Social, Facebook, and political segments of conservative news programs.</p>

<p>In this environment, misinformation and disinformation thrive.</p>

<p>Americans are simultaneously more likely to turn to social media for their news and are less critical of these sources, creating an environment where the veracity of gendered and racialised statements regarding Harris is less important than their virality.</p>

<p><strong>Media's history of misogyny</strong></p>

<p>Women leaders worldwide, such as former prime ministers Julia Gillard in Australia, the UK's Theresa May (and oh-so-briefly, Liz Truss), New Zealand's Jacinda Ardern and Sanna Marin in Finland, have all endured misogynistic media portrayals.</p>

<p>Many may recall Gillard's opponent posing with "Ditch the Witch" placards, watched video compilations of Ardern responding to misogynistic questions, or the international furor Marin faced after, in Fox News' words , "going viral for [a] raunchy dance video...".</p>

<p>America's last (and first) major party woman presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, faced a similar media environment that took misogynistic cues from her political opponent.</p>

<p>Even with the protections offered to her in her position of privilege and power, the media was seemingly only too happy to respond to Trump's calls to "lock her up" with a series of investigative reports into the Clinton Foundation, her tenure as Secretary of State, and her character.</p>

<p>As a Black and South Asian woman, Harris may face more harassment than Clinton, Gillard, Ardern or Marin, all of whom are white in white-majority countries.</p>

<p>The term misogynoir, coined by gay black feminist Moya Bailey, aptly describes a "particular brand of hatred directed at Black women in American visual and popular culture".</p>

<p>In the past, Harris' opponents have already referred to her as "aggressive", "angry" and "mean", and suggested she's a DEI nominee successful for the novelty of those identities rather than her qualifications.</p>

<p>Recent media reporting of Harris therefore continues this rich tradition i n an environment where a second Trump administration poses a grave threat to American democracy.</p>

<p><strong>The consequences of bias</strong></p>

<p>Biased media reporting contributes to real-world consequences, deterring women and marginalised people from entering politics due to fears of online harassment and myriad biases.</p>

<p>A report from the Global Institute for Women's Leadership and Women For Election in Australia found that 66 percent of women polled considered online harassment a barrier to running for office. Another 46 percent said bias against candidates from a marginalised background was an additional deterrent.</p>

<p>Young politically engaged people also see workplace safety - meaning spaces free of violence, misogyny, and other forms of discrimination - as crucial to their engagement in a political career.<br />
Long before the attempted assassination of Trump, the personal safety of political candidates has been a key concern.</p>

<p>The perception of politics as hostile and unsafe (also known as "toxic parliaments" in a new book launched by ANU's Global Institute for Women's Leadership last week) further erodes trust in political institutions and discourages young people from pursuing political careers.</p>

<p>Young women and other minority groups do not have the Secret Service protecting them when they run for local office, but those politics remain as vitriolic - and are far more accessible - than the Oval Office.</p>

<p>The conditions in which Harris obtained the nomination also matters.<br />
With an ageing President polling much lower than his opponent, a turbulent domestic economy, and the highly criticised support of Israel's war on the Palestinians, Biden's passing of the baton to Harris recalls the "glass cliff" phenomenon whereby women are promoted to leadership at "particularly precarious times" - for instance in periods of crisis, or where the chance of failure is high.<br />
These conditions matter, as they will become inextricably tied to the story of Harris' run for president and embedded into any number of explanations or justifications as to why her campaign succeeded or failed.</p>

<p><strong>Progress, or just holding the line for women?</strong></p>

<p>If Harris loses in November, Trump's administration is slated to implement and accelerate policies that undermine the rights of women and minorities on issues including abortion, immigration, education and voting rights.</p>

<p>The success of this agenda will have far-reaching consequences for the US and its allies, not to mention galvanising illiberal governments world-wide which are implementing populist, anti-rights agendas.<br />
Yet, even if Trump fails and Harris becomes the next US President, it is clear that the gendered, racialised mess of media reporting is not a blip, but a characteristic of our media landscape.</p>

<p>Both media conglomerates and everyday keyboard warriors have an effect on gendered and racialised bias among voters. Reporters, at least, should be held to minimum standards to do better.</p>

<p>Beyond reporting, the events of the last few years have revealed the vulnerabilities of the American democratic system.</p>

<p>Whether Harris succeeds or fails , she faces an enormous burden to simply hold the line, let alone prevent regression along a host of domains from social to economic.</p>

<p>It will be the work of decades to not only patch up the cracks, but to envision and build a system that is fairer, safer and more accessible for all.</p>

<p>But who is up to the task, if not women?</p>

<p>Jack Hayes is a PhD candidate in the Department of International Relations in the Coral Bell School of Asia Pacific Affairs at the Australian National University.</p>

<p>Dr Elise Stephenson is a multi award-winning Australian gender researcher and entrepreneur, and Deputy Director at the Global Institute for Women's Leadership at the Australian National University.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few days ago, a tweet claiming responsibility for a global Microsoft outage triggered a meme fest on X. Today, the same man has returned with another viral post, this time taking credit for the chaos that ensued after three arson attacks on France's high-speed rail network. These incidents have paralysed train travel nationwide, just as Paris geared up to host the opening ceremony of the 2024 Olympics yesterday.</p>

<p>A Microsoft error had crippled Windows computers worldwide on July 19. It was later revealed that an update to the anti-virus program 'Falcon Sensor' by CrowdStrike caused the massive outage. Enter Vincent Flibustier, an X user posing as a CrowdStrike employee. Vincent broke the internet with an AI-generated photo of himself outside the CrowdStrike office, captioned, "First day at Crowdstrike, pushed a little update and taking the afternoon off."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last night, three separate arson attacks targeting France's high-speed rail network affected train travel nationwide. The attacks' timing and perpetrators remain unclear, but their impact was immediate and devastating.</p>

<p>Mr Flibustier, following a similar routine, swiftly uploaded an AI-generated image of himself standing in front of a poster of Societe Nationale Des Chemins De Fer Francais - France's state-owned railway network. The tweet has once again gone viral with Mr Flibustier's mission accomplished.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">First day of my new job at SNCF, did a little update on Fire alert system, taking now my afternoon off ? <a href="https://t.co/f3twAKusFh">pic.twitter.com/f3twAKusFh</a></p>
â€” Vincent Flibustier ? (@vinceflibustier) <a href="https://twitter.com/vinceflibustier/status/1816758155239453036?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 26, 2024</a></blockquote>

<h3><strong>What Happened In France</strong></h3>

<p>Approximately 8 lakh passengers are expected to be affected over the weekend, with a quarter of a million already impacted on Friday alone, according to SNCF. The rail network was anticipated to be particularly busy this weekend, not only because of the Olympics but also as people return from or leave for their summer holidays.</p>

<p>There were delays of 90 minutes to two hours on services between Paris and France's north and east. One major branch of the network, the line to France's southeast, was spared after rail maintenance workers surprised unauthorized individuals on site.</p>

<p>High-speed rail operator Eurostar announced that around one in four services across its network linking France, the UK, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany would be cancelled, including trains from Paris to London. Others would operate slower on regular lines not designed for high-speed trains.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There does not seem to any light at the end of the tunnel for children of legal immigrants, a significantly large number of whom are Indian-Americans who came to the US as a young kid with their parents and now risk being deported back to the country where they don't know anyone because of them being aging out when they turn 21.</p>

<p>There are around 250,000 of such children of legal immigrants, a significantly large number of whom are Indians. The White House on Thursday blamed the Republicans for this legislative impasse.</p>

<p>"I talked about the bipartisan agreement that came together from the Senate where we negotiated a process to help the so-called documented Dreamers. And sadly, Republicans, and I've said this many times already at this podium today, which is that they voted it down twice. They voted it down twice,' White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters at her daily news conference.</p>

<p>Last month led by Senator Alex Padilla, Chair of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, and Border Safety, and Representative Deborah Ross, a bipartisan group of 43 lawmakers called on Biden Administration to take urgent action to protect the more than 250,000 Documented Dreamers - children of long-term visa holders - who are at risk of aging out of their dependent status and are forced to self-deport if they are ineligible for another status.</p>

<p>"These young people grow up in the United States, complete their education in the American school system, and graduate with degrees from American institutions," wrote the lawmakers. "However, due to the long green-card backlog, families with approved immigrant petitions are often stuck waiting decades for permanent resident status," they said in a letter to the Biden Administration on June 13.</p>

<p>Last month, Improve The Dream, an organization representing these children of legal immigrants, met with over 100 congressional offices and senior administration officials.</p>

<p>"It is disappointing to see the lack of action and associated proposed regulations deprioritized and delayed. It is time for action and I hope President Biden and the administration see the support from this bipartisan letter and show they care about one of the most bipartisan issues in Congress and rectify the mistakes of the past,' said Dip Patel, founder of Improve The Dream comments.</p>

<p>At the same time, he expressed gratitude for the bipartisan members of Congress leading in a letter asking for urgent administrative policy improvements and who continue to champion a permanent solution through Congress.</p>

<p>"I was forced to start visa-hopping to be able to stay in this country when I was 20 years old, right before I aged out, as a junior at the University of Minnesota - Duluth. I am about to turn 27 this August. Soon, if my time visa-hopping was personified, they would be older than I was when I first came to the United States," Jefrina, currently a graduate student pursuing my MBA at the Saint Mary's University of Minnesota told PTI.</p>

<p>She came to the US from India in 2005 at the age of 7. "I arrived under a dependent H-4 visa. My family applied for permanent residency in 2010 when I was 12 years old, and I unwittingly fell in love with this country. In the last 19 years, Minnesota has undoubtedly become my home," she said.</p>

<p>"My young adult life has been a series of temporary fixes to avoid self-deportation. I graduate from my Masters program in December, and I'm yet again at the crossroads of leaving my family, pets, friends, and a myriad of unquantifiable reasons I call Minnesota my home," Jefrina said.</p>

<p>Praneetha, a Cloud Engineer based in Texas, who came to the US with her family when she was 8 years old as a dependent on her parents' work visa, and after living in the US for more than 15 years, is left with no clear path toward permanent residency and has to hop from visa to visa in order to continue living and working in the country.</p>

<p>Roshan was forced to leave the US last month. He was working with- an American semiconductor manufacturing company. He came to the US with his Mom and brother at the age of 10 on an H4 visa- he grew up in Boston and graduated from Boston College in 2021 with a degree in Economics.</p>

<p>Roshan grew up in the US for almost 16 years but aged out in 2019. He had to leave the US in June without a clear path for returning, living, and working in the only country that he has truly called home.</p>

<p>Patel said every day without action results in young adults, who have been lawfully raised in the United States by skilled workers and small business owners, to be forced to leave the country, separating them from their families and stopping their ability to contribute to the country.</p>

<p>The administration has heard countless stories and examples of American-raised and educated STEM and health care talent (which comprises 87% of all impacted by aging-out, according to Improve The Dream's survey) contributing in other countries now due to barriers in our legal immigration system.</p>

<p>"Our country is not only losing young talent who were raised and educated here, but we're also losing many of their parents, who have years of practical experience as small business owners or in fields like medicine, engineering, and artificial intelligence. The economic case is clear and the moral case is clear. It is common sense," he said in response to a question.</p>

<p>"All major administrative actions have excluded this population from receiving benefit, despite the tools for such relief being available and being used for others. Until Congress can pass the bipartisan America's Children Act, we need urgent action by the administration to prioritize this issue, which has bipartisan support from Congress and the general public, and clear economic benefit," Patel told Press Trust of India.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world's richest one per cent increased their fortune by $42 trillion over the past decade, which is nearly 34 times more than the entire bottom 50 per cent of the world's population, according to a new analysis by Oxfam. The organisation released the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/top-1-percent-bags-over-40-trillion-new-wealth-during-past-decade-taxes-rich-reach">new report </a>ahead of the third meeting of G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors in Brazil. It said that the average net worth of the elite jumped by nearly $400,000 per person, after adjusting for inflation, compared to $335 for the bottom half of residents.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Inequality has reached obscene levels, and until now governments have failed to protect people and planet from its catastrophic effects," said Oxfam International's Head of Inequality Policy, Max Lawson. "The richest one percent of humanity continues to fill their pockets while the rest are left to scrap for crumbs," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Oxfam's research also found that the share of income of the top 1 per cent of earners in G20 countries has risen by 45 per cent over four decades while top tax rates on their incomes were cut by roughly a third.</p>

<p>"Globally, billionaires have been paying a tax rate equivalent to less than 0.5 percent of their wealth. Their fortunes has risen by an annual average of 7.1 percent over the last four decades, and an annual net wealth tax of at least 8 percent would be needed to reduce billionaires' extreme wealth. G20 countries are home to nearly four out of five of the world's billionaires," the report read.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The latest analysis comes as the advocacy group, along with several partners, is calling on G20 leaders to hike taxes on the ultra-rich.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Also Read |&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/elon-musk-disowned-by-transgender-daughter-hes-desperate-for-attention-6193039">Elon Musk Disowned By Transgender Daughter: "He's Desperate For Attention"</a></strong></p>

<p>As part of its G20 presidency, the Brazilian government recently also commissioned a study on raising taxes on the wealthy. It found that a 2 per cent minimum tax on global billionaires' wealth would yield between $200 billion and $250 billion from about 3,000 taxpayers annually.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Momentum to increase taxes on the super-rich is undeniable, and this week is the first real litmus test for G20 governments. Do they have the political will to strike a global standard that puts the needs of the many before the greed of an elite few?" Mr Lawson said.</p>

<p>Notably, Oxfam regularly issues reports highlighting global inequality and pushes for changes to start evening the playing field.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JD Vance, former US President Donald Trump's running mate, has defended his 2021 remarks where he referred to Democratic politicians as a "bunch of childless cat ladies with miserable lives".</p>

<p>JD Vance, who appeared on The Megyn Kelly Show on Friday, said "Obviously, it was a sarcastic comment. I've got nothing against cats. People are focusing so much on the sarcasm and not on the substance of what I actually said."</p>

<p>"The simple point that I made is that having children, becoming a father, becoming a mother, I really do think it changes your perspective in a pretty profound way," he told The Megyn Kelly Show.</p>

<p>"This is not about criticizing people who for various reasons don't have kids. This is about criticizing the Democratic party for becoming anti-family and anti-child," he said.</p>

<p>JD Vance had singled out Kamala Harris, now the Democratic Presidential nominee, among others during a 2021 interview and said those without offspring, especially "childless cat ladies", had no "direct stake" in the country.</p>

<p>Speaking to Tucker Carlson on Fox News, he had said the US was being run by "a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too."</p>

<p>Vance's comments have drawn sexism charges ahead of the US Presidential elections that the Republicans were touted to win until President Joe Biden bowed out from the race.</p>

<p>Kamala Harris's lack of biological children has been regarded as an issue by the Republicans, but she has received support from politicians, celebrities, and from her own family. Her supporters also pointed out that no US president has ever physically given birth, since all have been men.</p>

<p>Kerstin Emhoff, the mother of Harris' stepchildren, has slammed the attacks on the Vice President as "baseless" in a statement to CNN.</p>

<p>"For over 10 years, since Cole and Ella were teenagers, Kamala has been a co-parent with Doug and I. I love our blended family and am grateful to have her in it," she said.</p>

<p>Vance, 39, was tapped by Trump days after a failed assassination attempt on the former president upended what had already been a chaotic presidential contest.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than 180,000 Palestinians have fled fierce fighting around the southern Gaza city of Khan Yunis in four days, the United Nations said Friday, after an Israeli operation to extract captives' bodies from the area.</p>

<p>Recent "intensified hostilities" in the Khan Yunis area, more than nine months into the Israel-Hamas war, have fuelled "new waves of internal displacement across Gaza", said the UN humanitarian agency, OCHA.</p>

<p>It said "about 182,000 people" have been displaced from central and eastern Khan Yunis between Monday and Thursday, and hundreds are "stranded in eastern Khan Yunis".</p>

<p>The Israeli military on Monday ordered the evacuation of parts of the southern city, announcing its forces would "forcefully operate" there, including in an area previously declared a safe humanitarian zone.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Israel said five bodies of captives seized during Hamas's October 7 attack that triggered the war had been recovered from the area.</p>

<p>Israel's military said on Friday that its forces had "eliminated approximately 100 terrorists" in the city this week.</p>

<p>Israel's military chief, Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi said the captives' bodies were pulled from underground tunnels and walls in "a hidden place".</p>

<p>Troops "were near those fallen bodies in the past, we did not know how to reach them" until this week, Halevi said in a statement.</p>

<p>Witnesses and rescuers said heavy battles continued around eastern Khan Yunis on Friday. The Nasser Hospital said 26 bodies were brought to the medical site.</p>

<p>The October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Out of 251 people taken hostage that day, 111 are still held in the Gaza Strip, including 39 the military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive against Hamas has killed at least 39,175 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.</p>

<p>According to UN figures, the vast majority of Gaza's 2.4 million people have been displaced at least once by the fighting.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US president Donald Trump was indeed hit by an assassin's bullet or a fragment of one, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said Friday, putting to rest questions over the nature of the Republican candidate's wounding at a campaign rally this month.</p>

<p>"What struck former President Trump in the ear was a bullet, whether whole or fragmented into smaller pieces, fired from the deceased subject's rifle," the FBI said in a statement.</p>

<p>Trump's right ear was covered in blood on July 13 after he was injured during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The FBI deemed the assault -- in which a gunman fired eight bullets from outside the event's security perimeter -- an assassination attempt.</p>

<p>But FBI chief Christopher Wray told US lawmakers on Wednesday that there was some doubt as to "whether or not it's a bullet or shrapnel that, you know, that hit his ear."</p>

<p>Following the new statement from the FBI -- which Trump has long alleged is part of a "deep state" conspiring against him -- the Republican posted on his Truth Social platform: "I assume that's the best apology that we'll get from Director Wray, but it is fully accepted!"</p>

<p>Earlier Friday, he posted a letter from his former White House doctor saying the wound was almost certainly due to a bullet.</p>

<p>"There is absolutely no evidence that it was anything other than a bullet," wrote Ronny Jackson, now a Republican congressman from Texas, on Truth Social.</p>

<p>Two rally attendees were seriously wounded in the attack, and a 50-year-old Pennsylvania firefighter was shot dead, according to officials. The gunman was killed by a US Secret Service sniper.</p>

<p>Since the shooting, Trump has made the attack a key part of his campaign pitch, telling a crowd in Michigan that he "took a bullet for democracy."</p>

<p>At the Republican National Convention where he was anointed the party's nominee for president, Trump said he had "God on my side" as he described the attack.</p>

<p>And at Trump rallies, many of the former president's supporters have taken to wearing bandages on their right ears, a reference to the attack.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Trump had also denied Wray's comments and accused him of political partisanship.</p>

<p>"It was, unfortunately, a bullet that hit my ear, and hit it hard. There was no glass, there was no shrapnel," he said.</p>

<p>A New York Times investigation published Friday said "a detailed analysis of bullet trajectories, footage, photos and audio... strongly suggests Mr Trump was grazed by the first of eight bullets fired by the gunman."</p>

<p>Trump's campaign has not released any medical reports or statements from his current physician, instead quoting Jackson -- a former White House physician who is a staunch political ally of the ex-president.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Karachi has been ranked as the second-riskiest city for tourists, with a rating of 93.12 out of 100, according to a July 11 Forbes Adviser list, reported Dawn.</p>

<p>The July 11 Forbes Adviser list of three of the riskiest cities highlighted that Karachi was second just behind Venezuela's Caracas, which had a score of 100, while Myanmar's Yangon ranked third with a score of 91.67 out of 100.</p>

<p>According to the ranking, the city had the highest personal security risk, reflecting risk from crime, violence, terrorist threats, natural disasters, and economic vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>It added that Karachi had the second-worst (level 3, reconsider travel) travel safety rating from the US State Department, as reported by Dawn.</p>

<p>Moreover, Karachi has the fourth-highest infrastructure security risk, reflecting the availability and quality of city infrastructure, according to the report.</p>

<p>To uncover the most and least risky cities for tourists, Forbes Adviser said that it compared 60 international cities across seven key metrics.</p>

<p>Notably, Karachi has repeatedly appeared on lists of "unlivable" cities.</p>

<p>Earlier in 2017, the city was named among the least safe cities in the world by the Economist Intelligence Unit, according to Dawn.</p>

<p>The research and analysis division of the Economist Group ranked Karachi among the top five "least livable" urban centres in the world.</p>

<p>Earlier on Thursday, five people died after two groups exchanged fire at each other in Karachi's defence area in Pakistan, ARY News reported.</p>

<p>DIG South Asad Raza confirmed that a total of five individuals lost their lives while two others got injured after an exchange of fire between two groups in Karachi's Defence Nishat Commercial area.</p>

<p>Moreover, eyewitnesses to the incident reported that several people were injured during the violent altercation, and vehicles belonging to both groups involved in the incident were also seen at the scene.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>France, Italy and five other EU countries were placed in a formal procedure on Friday for violating the bloc's budget rules, a step that could lead to unprecedented penalties unless they take corrective measures.</p>

<p>"Today the Council adopted decisions establishing the existence of excessive deficits for Belgium, France, Italy, Hungary, Malta, Poland and Slovakia," the body representing the 27 member states said.</p>

<p>Known as an "excessive deficit procedure", it kickstarts a process forcing a country to negotiate a plan with Brussels to get their debt or deficit levels back on track.</p>

<p>The seven countries had deficits -- the gap between government revenue and spending -- above three percent of gross domestic product, in violation of the bloc's fiscal rules.</p>

<p>France's deficit reached 5.5 percent in 2023, but it appears that bringing it down would be difficult because of political uncertainty following the results of a snap election that was won by a leftwing coalition demanding much higher public spending.</p>

<p>The EU countries with the highest deficit-to-GDP ratios last year were Italy (7.4 percent), Hungary (6.7 percent), Romania (6.6 percent) and Poland (5.1 percent).</p>

<p>The council also said Romania had "not taken effective action" against its excessive deficit, despite having a procedure opened against it in 2020 and would therefore be kept under watch.</p>

<p>As a next step, the countries will have to send medium-term plans by September about how they will rectify the breach.</p>

<p>Then the European Commission in November will deliver assessments of the plans with details on the route they must take to return to fiscal health.</p>

<p>This is the first time Brussels is rebuking EU states since the bloc suspended the rules after the 2020 coronavirus pandemic and the energy crisis triggered by Russia's war on Ukraine, as states propped up businesses and households with public money.</p>

<p>The EU spent two years during the suspension to reform the budget rules to give greater leeway for investment in critical areas like defence.</p>

<p>But two sacred objectives remain: a state's debt must not go higher than 60 percent of national output, with a public deficit of no more than three percent.</p>

<p>Countries failing to remedy the situation can in theory be hit with fines of 0.1 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) per year, until action is taken to address the violation.</p>

<p>In practice, though, the commission has never gone as far as levying fines, fearing it could trigger unintended political consequences and hurt a state's economy.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Kremlin said Friday that it was "working hard" to reverse declining birth rates in Russia, warning that "disastrous" demographic trends were putting the country's future at risk.</p>

<p>Russia has faced a myriad of demographic challenges since the collapse of the USSR, including an ageing population, an outflow of men due to the conflict in Ukraine and the lowest fertility rate in 17 years.</p>

<p>"It is now at a terribly low level -- 1.4 (births per woman). This is comparable to European countries, Japan and so on. But this is disastrous for the future of the nation," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a media festival.</p>

<p>"Anyone with many children is a hero. We live in the largest country in the world. And there are fewer of us every year. And the only way to cope with this is to increase the average birth rate," Peskov said.</p>

<p>Russia had a population of about 148 million people at the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, a figure that now stands at around 144 million after a protracted period of high deaths and low births in the 1990s.</p>

<p>The country's birth rate has not recovered since Soviet times despite President Vladimir Putin's government offering generous payouts and mortgage subsidies to large families.</p>

<p>Recent problems include large numbers of Covid deaths, hundreds of thousands of men fleeing the country to avoid being mobilised to fight in Ukraine, and migration into Russia hitting a ten-year low in 2023.</p>

<p>Russia's population could drop to 130 million by the 2040s, demographers have forecasted.</p>

<p>When asked whether young families could still have faith in the future, the Kremlin pointed to similar demographics in other countries.</p>

<p>"This is unfortunately a trend," Peskov said.</p>

<p>"The situation will remain difficult for some period of time, but the government is working hard on this issue, and it is one of the top priorities of the President of Russia," he added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Israeli military commander said Friday that troops in the country's north were preparing for "a decisive offensive" against Lebanon's Hezbollah after months of deadly cross-border exchanges.</p>

<p>Israeli forces have traded near-daily fire with Hamas ally Hezbollah since the Palestinian group's October 7 attack on southern Israel started the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>Major General Ori Gordin, Israel's commanding officer in the north, told troops that "we have already eliminated more than 500 terrorists in Lebanon, the great majority of them from Hezbollah", an army statement said.</p>

<p>According to an AFP tally, more than nine months of violence have killed at least 523 people in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Most of them, 342 people, have been confirmed to be Hezbollah operatives but the tally also includes 104 civilians. Gordin did not mention civilian casualties.</p>

<p>In northern Israel, at least 18 Israeli soldiers and 13 civilians have been killed, according to the military.</p>

<p>The exchanges of fire have been largely restricted to the border areas and displaced tens of thousands of Lebanese as well as Israeli residents.</p>

<p>The Israeli military has "destroyed thousands" of targets across the border, Gordin said.</p>

<p>The statement said troops were now preparing "for the transition to offence".</p>

<p>"When the moment comes and we go on the offensive, it will be a decisive offensive," Gordin added.</p>

<p>Iran-backed Hezbollah says it is acting in support of Hamas with its attacks on Israel since October 8.</p>

<p>The escalating violence and unsuccessful mediation efforts have raised fears of all-out conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, which last went to war in 2006.</p>

<p>Israel has demanded that parts of southern Lebanon be cleared of Hezbollah operatives in line with a UN Security Council resolution that ended the 2006 war.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alleged Mexican kingpin Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada has pleaded not guilty to U.S. drug trafficking charges, court records showed on Friday, after he and a son of another drug lord were arrested on Thursday in El Paso, Texas.</p>

<p>Court records showed that Zambada on Friday waived his right to appear personally in court and directed that a not guilty plea be entered on his behalf.</p>

<p>He was ordered detained without bond and is scheduled to be arraigned before U.S. Magistrate Judge Anne Berton next Wednesday, the records showed. His lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>Both Zambada and Joaquin Guzman Lopez, a son of Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, face multiple charges in the U.S. for funneling huge quantities of fentanyl and other drugs to U.S. streets.</p>

<p>Their detentions were a dramatic achievement for U.S. law enforcement that could also shake up the Mexican drug landscape.</p>

<p>Mexico's government was informed of the detentions by the U.S. government, but Mexican authorities did not participate in the operation, Mexican Security Minister Rosa Rodriguez said on Friday.</p>

<p>Rodriguez added that it was unclear if Zambada and Guzman Lopez handed themselves over to U.S. authorities voluntarily.</p>

<p>"The Mexican government did not participate in this detention or surrender," Rodriguez said at a press conference.</p>

<p>Zambada, who is believed to be in his 70s, and Guzman Lopez, who is in his 30s, were detained after landing in a private plane in the El Paso area.</p>

<p>Zambada co-founded the Sinaloa Cartel with El Chapo, who was extradited to the U.S. in 2017 and is serving a life sentence in a maximum-security prison.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited former U.S. President Donald Trump at Trump's Florida resort on Friday for a meeting that could ease tensions between two leaders who forged a close alliance during Trump's years in the White House.</p>

<p>Netanyahu met Trump, the Republican nominee in the 2024 U.S. presidential race, a day after Netanyahu met Democratic President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, who is running against Trump in the Nov. 5 U.S. election.</p>

<p>The longtime Israeli leader rearranged his US travel schedule to meet Trump. He landed in Palm Beach early on Friday.</p>

<p>Opinion polls put Harris and Trump in a close race for the White House, prompting world leaders like Netanyahu, traditionally more aligned with Trump's Republicans than Biden's Democrats, to strike a balance in dealings with the U.S.</p>

<p>Nine months into an Israeli offensive in Gaza, Harris pressed Netanyahu on the suffering of Palestinians in the enclave in talks that were watched for signs of how she might shift American policy if she becomes president.</p>

<p>"I made clear my serious concern about the dire humanitarian situation there," Harris said on Thursday after the meeting. "I will not be silent."</p>

<p>"Israel has a right to defend itself. And how it does so matters," she said.</p>

<p>Israeli officials criticized Harris for saying it was time for the war to end.</p>

<p>In an interview with Fox News on Thursday, Trump called for a quick end to the war and a return of the hostages Hamas holds in Gaza, adding that Israel has to better manage its "public relations."</p>

<p>"I want him (Netanyahu) to finish up and get it done quickly," Trump said. "They are getting decimated with this publicity."</p>

<p>Trump also criticized those who protested a speech Netanyahu gave to the U.S. Congress on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Dozens of Democrats boycotted the speech, voicing dismay over the thousands of civilian deaths in Gaza and the displacement of most of its 2.3 million people.</p>

<p><strong>NETANYAHU, TRUMP LOOK TO EASE TENSIONS</strong></p>

<p>The meeting between Trump and Netanyahu signaled that both were looking to ease tensions.</p>

<p>The Israeli leader angered Trump when he congratulated Biden on his victory over Trump in the 2020 election. Trump has falsely claimed the election was stolen from him by voter fraud.</p>

<p>Trump more recently criticized Netanyahu for Israeli security failures around the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel that triggered the Israeli offensive in Gaza.</p>

<p>Hamas and its allies killed 1,200 people and took 250 hostage, according to Israeli tallies. Some 120 hostages are still being held though Israel believes one in three are dead.</p>

<p>In defiant remarks to Congress on Wednesday, Netanyahu defended Israel's military and dismissed criticism of a campaign which has devastated Gaza and killed more than 39,000 people, according to health officials in the Hamas-ruled enclave.</p>

<p>Israeli officials estimate that some 14,000 fighters from&nbsp; groups including Hamas and Islamic Jihad have been killed or taken prisoner out of a force they estimated to number more than 25,000 at the start of the war.</p>

<p>In Wednesday's speech, Netanyahu praised Biden's support for Israel.</p>

<p>But to cheers from Republicans, he touched on Trump's pro-Israel record as president. He praised Trump's decision to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a long-held goal of conservatives that infuriated Palestinians.</p>

<p>He also cited the Abraham Accords, landmark U.S.-brokered agreements signed during Trump's White House years that normalized bilateral relations between Israel and both Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates.</p>

<p>Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw encouraged peaceful protests but said he did not expect demonstrations on the scale of what happened during Netanyahu's speech in Washington when thousands of activists marched - vandalizing some landmarks and confronting police - to protest the war in Gaza.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An alternative healer was on Friday found guilty of the manslaughter by gross negligence of a diabetic woman who died from medical complications at a "slapping therapy" workshop in the UK.</p>

<p>Hongchi Xiao, 60, from Cloudbreak, California, was convicted following a trial at a court in Winchester, southern England.</p>

<p>He was charged in November following the death of Danielle Carr-Gomm, 71, who was taking part in a session at a hotel to help her diabetes in October 2016.</p>

<p>The pensioner died at a "paida lajin" workshop, which involves patients being slapped or slapping themselves repeatedly.</p>

<p>Prosecutors told the court the alternative healer breached his duty of care towards Carr-Gomm by failing to take reasonable steps to ensure medical assistance when she was suffering from a "medical crisis", namely ketoacidosis.</p>

<p>Diabetic ketoacidosis is a serious condition that can happen in people with diabetes due to a lack of insulin and requires urgent medical treatment.</p>

<p>Xiao, who was born in China, was extradited to the UK from Australia.</p>

<p>Carr-Gomm, who was described by her family as an avid follower of holistic medicine and alternative therapies, was born in France and moved to the UK at the age of 21.</p>

<p>She was diagnosed with diabetes in 1999 but struggled to inject insulin because of a fear of needles.</p>

<p>The head of the Crown Prosecution's special crime division, Rosemary Ainslie, said: "Hongchi Xiao knew the consequences of Danielle Carr-Gomm's decision to stop taking insulin could be fatal, he had seen it before.</p>

<p>"Hongchi Xiao was the man in charge, yet he failed to respond to Mrs Carr-Gomm's worsening condition with tragic consequences.</p>

<p>"His failure to take reasonable steps to help Mrs Carr-Gomm substantially contributed to her death and amounted to gross negligence."</p>

<p>Xiao will be sentenced on October 1.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 17-year-old teenager in the US has been accused of deliberately causing a train derailment to record it and post it on YouTube. According to court documents, the Nebraska teen allegedly caused the train to go off the tracks, recorded the incident, and shared the footage on YouTube, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/07/25/teen-train-crash-derailment-record-youtube-video-nebraska-21299670/">Metro</a></em> reported.</p>

<p>The incident happened in April this year when the teen allegedly tampered with a rail switch, causing two locomotives and five fully loaded coal trains to veer off the tracks and crash into an empty coal car. He then alerted authorities to the derailment and asked the investigator who arrived what caused the crash. He told the investigator he was a train enthusiast and showed him the video he had shot of the derailment.</p>

<p>When authorities said they did not know the cause of the derailment, the boy said, ''Obviously a switch was flipped the wrong way.''</p>

<p>An investigator with BNSF Railway found that a padlock supposed to be attached to the switch was missing, indicating tampering. Three days later,&nbsp;a BNSF investigator obtained CCTV footage showing a 1996 Buick Park Avenue in the vicinity, with the same teenager walking towards the switch at the south end of the tracks. According to the affidavit, the teen was later recorded returning to his vehicle.</p>

<p>A <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q97XRpF6SZA">video of the derailment was posted on a YouTube account</a> believed to be linked to the teen, an investigator said. Authorities also discovered that a tripod had been set up near the accident site just four minutes before the train derailed. The derailment caused $350,000 in damages to BNSF Railway and the Omaha Public Power District, as per <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/teen-accused-derailing-train-recording-crash-posting-online-rcna163686">NBC News.&nbsp;</a></em></p>

<p>The 17-year-old was charged in Lancaster County Juvenile Court on Wednesday, but prosecutors have requested that the case be moved to adult court. He faces two felony charges of criminal mischief in connection with a train derailment.</p>

<p>''My office will file a motion to transfer the case to adult court and it will be up to the juvenile court Judge to transfer the case or have it remain in juvenile court,'' Lancaster County Attorney Patrick Condon told <em>McClatchy News.</em></p>

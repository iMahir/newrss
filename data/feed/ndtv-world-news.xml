       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian presidential aircraft and funds were used in a program that took children from occupied Ukrainian territories, stripped them of Ukrainian identity and placed them with Russian families, according to a report by Yale's School of Public Health.</p>

<p>The US State Department-backed research, published on Tuesday, identified 314 Ukrainian children taken to Russia in the early months of the war in Ukraine as part of what it says was a systematic, Kremlin-funded program to "Russify" them.</p>

<p>Reuters was unable to confirm the report's findings independently.</p>

<p>In March 2023, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and his child rights' commissioner, Maria Lvova-Belova, for the alleged war crime of deportation of Ukrainian children.</p>

<p>At the time, Lvova-Belova said her commission acted on humanitarian grounds to protect children in an area where military action was taking place. Lvova-Belova's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Kremlin said it could not respond to questions sent on Monday, citing a lack of time.</p>

<p>The new report, shared with Reuters, offers details of the alleged deportation programme and individuals involved, including what its lead researcher said were new links to Putin.</p>

<p>The researcher, Nathaniel Raymond, Executive Director of Yale's Humanitarian Research Lab, said he was scheduled to present the findings to the UN Security Council on Wednesday. The United States holds the rotating presidency of the 15-member body this month.</p>

<p>Raymond said the research offers evidence that would support additional charges by the ICC against Putin of "forcible transfer" of people from one national and ethnic group to another.</p>

<p>He further said the report proved "the deportation of Ukraine's children is part of a systematic, Kremlin-led program" to make them citizens of Russia.</p>

<p>Forcible transfer is a crime against humanity under international law. Because they must be widespread and systematic, crimes against humanity are generally considered more serious than the war crimes Putin is currently charged with for alleged deportation of Ukrainian children.</p>

<p>In response to Reuters questions, the ICC office of the prosecutor said the Yale report was useful "in our continued activities in this case." It said it could not provide further information about charges or actions that may arise from its investigative activities in Ukraine.</p>

<p>The Ukrainian president's office did not respond to requests for comment. Ukraine's prosecutor general's office said it had no immediate comment.</p>

<p>In response to the ICC charges last year, Lvova-Belova said Russia had not moved anyone against their will or that of their parents or legal guardians, whose consent was always sought unless they were missing.</p>

<p>She said children were placed with temporary legal guardians and were not given up for adoption.</p>

<p>Russia, which does not recognise the ICC, has said the court's warrants are meaningless. Court decisions could nonetheless limit travel by charged individuals because its 124 member states have an obligation to execute warrants.</p>

<p><strong>CHILDREN IDENTIFIED</strong></p>

<p>The research is based on data mined from three Russian government adoption databases over 20 months. Yale's investigation then mapped out the alleged program's logistics and funding and confirmed the identities of the 314 children, Raymond said.</p>

<p>The research is part of an initiative led by the State Department under President Joe Biden to document potential violations of international law and crimes against humanity by Russia and Russia-aligned forces in Ukraine.</p>

<p>The US State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>The report said Ukrainian children brought to Russia had been subjected to "pro-state and militarised propaganda," noting it had documented such "patriotic re-education" at all the facilities where the children were processed.</p>

<p>Reuters has documented the transfer of thousands of children to Russian camps, the forced naturalisation of Ukrainians and the involvement of Belarus in the program.</p>

<p>Stephen Rapp, the US ambassador-at-large for war crimes under former president Barack Obama and formerly a prosecutor at the international tribunals for Rwanda and Sierra Leone, reviewed the report and told Reuters that "it proves their direct involvement, making changes to law and practice to allow and accelerate coercive adoptions that would have been illegal under Russia's own law in February 2022."</p>

<p>Kyiv estimates around 19,500 children have been taken to Russia or Russian-occupied Crimea since the invasion. Lvova-Belova has challenged Kyiv's numbers and asked it to provide evidence.</p>

<p>She previously said 380 orphans and children not in the custody of parents were placed with Russian foster families between April and October 2022.</p>

<p><strong>FLIGHTS</strong></p>

<p>Russia began taking Ukrainian children from occupied Ukrainian territories in the days before the invasion in February 2022, according to the report.</p>

<p>Russia's Aerospace Forces and aircraft under the direct control of Putin's office transported multiple groups of children from Ukraine on Russian Federation-flagged military transport planes between May and October 2022, the report said.</p>

<p>The report said at least two groups of children flew on aircraft managed by the Presidential Property Management Department within the Presidential Administration in May and October 2022.</p>

<p>Children taken to the Chkalovsky military airfield just outside Moscow on Sept. 16, 2022 had been transported from the occupied Ukrainian territories of Donetsk and Luhansk to the Russian city of Rostov, not far from Ukraine's border, then flown on a plane with tail number RA-85123, the report said.</p>

<p>The aircraft is a TU-154M operated by the 223rd Flight Squad of the Russian Defence Ministry, it said. Flight tracking data on website Flightradar24.com also confirmed this.</p>

<p>Of the 314 Ukrainian children identified, 166 were placed directly with Russia citizens, the report said. The other 148 were listed in Russia's child placement databases, with about a third of those now placed with Russian citizens. The remaining children were last known to be located at Russian institutions, the report said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Indian-origin man who was recently involved in a confrontation with several people in a lift lobby in Singapore has come forward to share his side of the story. In a Facebook video, that has since been deleted, the man, identified as Suresh Vanaz, was seen shouting and being restrained by several men. The clip showed him falling over and hurling a backpack at another man. It suggested that the fight started when the man tried to help a wheelchair user enter the lift.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Monday, Mr Vanaz took to Instagram to share his side of the story. In a video, he claimed that the Facebook video was edited for virality instead of showing his family's perspective. He explained that the altercation began when he was helping his wheelchair-bound brother out of the lift. He said that people did not give way when he began backing out of the lift and instead berated him. He also said that one man challenged him to a fight after he knocked into him on the way out, but backed down and fled the scene when he squared up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Further, Mr Vanaz admitted that he got angry due to the other party's inconsiderate behaviour and that he had a similar experience when taking the lift with his wheelchair-bound brother. In the caption of his post, he also raised issues with the "keyboard warriors" who left unkind comments online without knowing his side of the story.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Be mindful people, caregivers are going through stress in this Singapore situation here," he said.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[A 41-year-old woman has been arrested in the hit-and-run death of an Indian student in Connecticut last year.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 41-year-old woman has been arrested in the hit-and-run death of an Indian student in Connecticut last year.</p>

<p>Jill Augelli was arrested on November 18 in the October 2023 death of Priyanshu Agwal 23, an international student at the University of New Haven.</p>

<p>She has been charged with one count of evading responsibility resulting in death, according to a report in the Hartford Courant.</p>

<p>Agwal was just a few months shy of finishing graduate school and was applying for jobs when the hit-and-run incident took his life, the report added.</p>

<p>The New Haven Police Department announced the arrest of the driver allegedly involved in the incident during a news conference on Monday.</p>

<p>At the news conference, Agwal's brother, Aman, spoke about how he missed him every day for the past year since the accident.</p>

<p>"I just want to say I miss my brother every day," he said. The report quoted him as saying that he still has dreams about his brother. He said he teeters between having good memories of his sibling and feeling guilty.</p>

<p>Aman said the driver did not stop after the crash. "I feel like she didn't try to stop and it led to a major injury," he said.</p>

<p>The Courant report quoted New Haven Mayor Justin Elicker as saying that Priyanshu Agwal's family described him as a person with a "big smile" whose "outgoing, charismatic personality" led to him having lots of friends.</p>

<p>He was "loved by many" and had "his whole life ahead of him", Elicker said, adding that he was applying for jobs at the time of his death and had "big dreams" of a life in the United States.</p>

<p>Elicker added that "thanks to Priyanshu Agwal and his family deciding to donate his heart," he was able to save someone else's life.</p>

<p>"And so that heart is beating in someone else's body now," Elicker said. "So even though he lost his life, part of his life is giving someone else a life today and that we're grateful for as well." New Haven Police Chief Karl Jacobson said authorities at the time did not have enough evidence to charge Augelli and "had to work to put her behind the driver's seat during the crash".</p>

<p>This involved obtaining GPS data from her cell phone carrier that allegedly showed she was "in the vicinity" of the collision when it happened, police said, according to the Courant report. Forensic testing also allegedly showed Agwal's DNA was on Augelli's car.</p>

<p>According to police, Agwal was driving an electric scooter on October 18, 2023, around 11 pm when he entered an intersection and was hit by a motorist. The driver did not stop and instead continued, the report said.</p>

<p>Agwal was taken to Yale New Haven Hospital where he was pronounced dead about a week later.</p>

<p>Investigators found the car involved in the crash the next day in Naugatuck. According to police, investigators found that Augelli was the registered owner of the vehicle, the report said.</p>

<p>Augelli remains held on a USD 100,000 bond and is scheduled to appear in New Haven Superior Court on Tuesday.</p>

<p>According to the University of New Haven, Priyanshu Agwal, 23, was pursuing a master's degree in business analytics after coming to the US in 2022 from Deoli, Rajasthan. He had served as a business analyst intern with an IT company.</p>

<p>Elicker said he hopes Priyanshu Agwal's story can help underline the importance of safe driving and the critical need to stop and help when crashes happen. "If you flee we will track you down and hold you accountable," Elicker said in the report.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China has banned exports to the United States of items related to the minerals gallium, germanium and antimony that have potential military applications, it said on Tuesday, a day after Washington's latest crackdown on China's chip sector.</p>

<p>A commerce ministry directive on dual-use items with both military and civilian applications cited national security concerns. The order, which takes immediate effect, also requires stricter review of end-usage for graphite items shipped to the US.</p>

<p>"In principle, the export of gallium, germanium, antimony, and superhard materials to the United States shall not be permitted," China's commerce ministry said.</p>

<p>The curbs strengthen enforcement of existing limits on exports of the critical minerals that Beijing began rolling out last year, but apply only to the U.S. market, in the latest escalation of trade tensions between the world's two largest economies ahead of President-elect Donald Trump taking office.</p>

<p>Chinese customs data show there have been no shipments of wrought and unwrought germanium or gallium to the US this year through October, although it was the fourth and fifth-largest market for the minerals, respectively, a year earlier.</p>

<p>Gallium and germanium are used in semiconductors, while germanium is also used in infrared technology, fibre optic cables and solar cells.</p>

<p>Similarly, China's overall October shipments of antimony products plunged by 97% from September after Beijing's move to limit its exports took effect.</p>

<p>China accounted last year for 48% of globally mined antimony, which is used in ammunition, infrared missiles, nuclear weapons and night-vision goggles, as well as in batteries and photovoltaic equipment.</p>

<p>This year, China has accounted for 59.2% of refined germanium output and 98.8% of refined gallium production, according to consultancy Project Blue.</p>

<p>"The move is a considerable escalation of tensions in supply chains where access to raw material units is already tight in the West," said Project Blue co-founder Jack Bedder.</p>

<p>Prices of antimony trioxide in Rotterdam had soared by 228% since the beginning of the year to $39,000 a metric ton on Nov. 28, data from information provider Argus showed.</p>

<p>"Everyone will dig in their backyard to find antimony. Many countries will try to find antimony deposits," said a minor metals trader in Europe, declining to be named.</p>

<p>China's announcement comes after Washington launched its third crackdown in three years on China's semiconductor industry on Monday, curbing exports to 140 companies, including chip equipment maker Naura Technology Group.</p>

<p>Trump, whose first White House term was marked by a bitter trade war with China, has said he will implement 10% tariffs on Chinese goods and threatened 60% tariffs on Chinese imports during his presidential campaign.</p>

<p>"It comes as no surprise that China has responded to the increasing restrictions by American authorities, current and imminent, with its own restrictions on the supply of these strategic minerals," said Peter Arkell, chairman of the Global Mining Association of China.</p>

<p>"It's a trade war that has no winners," he said.</p>

<p>Separately, several Chinese industry groups called on Tuesday for their members to buy domestically made semiconductors, with one saying U.S. chips were no longer safe and reliable.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian entrepreneur Kuldeep Dhankar recently shared how he survived a car crash with the help of his Apple Watch. Taking to X, Mr Dhankar, the founder of Last9.io, shared a photo of his crashed car on a US highway and a police officer inspecting the accident site. In his post, he said that he got rear-ended by a car while he was in standstill traffic. He revealed that his Apple Watch immediately detected the crash and automatically called the cops. This prompt response from the device's crash detection feature and the California Highway Patrol played a vital role in ensuring Mr Dhankar's safety, allowing him to continue his journey with minimal delay.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Got rear ended by a car while we were at standstill in traffic, on the I-5 yesterday. the car behind was probably a total loss. (we are perfectly safe) Apple watch detected that we were in a crash and auto called 911 and there was an officer on the scene with in minutes. we were able to leave in 30 minutes and got to our destination safe. so impressed by Apple watch and california highway patrol. Also thankful. very thankful," Mr Dhankar wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Reacting to the post, one user wrote, "Glad to know that you and the others are safe. Take care!" "Glad you are safe! Apple Watch did its job well" commented another.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Damn, that sounds horrible. Glad you are okay," wrote a third user. "This looks so scary! So glad you guys are all ok!" expressed a fourth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, this is not the first time an Apple Watch saved a person's life. Back in October, the device proved to be a lifesaver for an elderly woman by detecting an irregular heartbeat, leading to timely medical intervention. Renowned for its advanced health-tracking capabilities beyond just monitoring steps, sleep, and blood oxygen levels, the Apple Watch's ECG (electrocardiogram) feature identified a condition called atrial fibrillation, prompting the woman to seek immediate medical attention.</p>

<p>Nikias Molina shared this incident on X, revealing that his Apple Watch Series 10 detected his grandmother's irregular heartbeat. "My Apple Watch Series 10 detected my grandmother's atrial fibrillation today using the ECG feature. She's now at the hospital and receiving the care she needs. I still can't believe it," he wrote while sharing a picture of the watch alert.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French far-right leader Marine Le Pen appears to be betting her future on ousting President Emmanuel Macron before his term ends in 2027, lawmakers and analysts say. To do so, she has helped trigger France's second political crisis in six months.</p>

<p>It's a decision that may haunt her.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Michel Barnier on Monday chose to ram through parliament a key component of the 2025 budget bill after Le Pen and her National Rally (RN) party rejected a last-minute concession aimed at securing their support.</p>

<p>Barnier's minority government is almost certain to lose the resulting no-confidence motion on Wednesday, brought down by the far right and the left combined.</p>

<p>The RN's decision to wield the knife underlines the power of a once-fringe party that became the largest parliamentary force after this summer's snap election.</p>

<p>But it is a risky play at a complex domestic and geopolitical moment from a party seeking to portray itself as a stable government in waiting.</p>

<p>And even if Le Pen's gambit brings the RN to power sooner than expected, she will inherit the same fiscal mess that humbled Barnier, with investors increasingly alarmed by France's 6% budget deficit.</p>

<p>"The RN is wrong to vote to topple the government because it will bear the responsibility," Eric Woerth, a former minister and lawmaker from Macron's camp, told Reuters. "It is they who will have pressed the button and no-one else... The RN has shown that it is not a party of government."</p>

<p>Paul Molac, a centrist lawmaker, told Reuters the RN may be vulnerable to Barnier's claims it seeks to "heap disorder atop disorder," making it harder to win support from the moderate conservatives it needs to win the Elysee.</p>

<p>"Marine Le Pen wants to be president and she's organising chaos?" said centre-right lawmaker Yannick Neuder.</p>

<p>The RN cannot topple the government alone and will need to join forces with the left, a group she has often described as a grave danger to France. That, too, could weaken her standing among more moderate conservatives.</p>

<p>Le Pen appeared aware of that danger, writing on X on Tuesday that critics alleging "collusion between the National Rally and (the hard-left) France Unbowed" were spreading "disinformation." She has previously rejected accusations the RN are "artisans of chaos" as "fake news."</p>

<h2><strong>EARLY ELECTION?</strong></h2>

<p>Le Pen on Monday said Barnier should have done more to incorporate the RN's concerns given its strong showing in the election.</p>

<p>She said the constitution provided three ways out of the crisis. Two of them - a reshuffle or another dissolution of parliament - were currently unviable, leaving a third and final option: Macron's resignation.</p>

<p>"This is the decision and the responsibility of the President of the Republic," she said.</p>

<p>RN spokesman Philippe Ballard told Reuters Macron's resignation "could be a way out" of the crisis.</p>

<p>Patrick Weil, a historian of the far right, said Le Pen had made a risky move but her reasons for doing so were clear.</p>

<p>"She wants an early election," he said, predicting Le Pen would reject all Macron's proposed prime ministers, forcing him into resigning. "It'll be checkmate. If all the governments he names are rejected, what can he do?"</p>

<p>RN lawmaker Thomas Menage told Reuters any future government that failed to incorporate the party's budgetary red lines "will very quickly face a no-confidence motion."</p>

<p>Observers say a Macron resignation is unlikely but not impossible. Should he step down, the Senate president would step in until a new presidential election for a full term can be held.</p>

<p>As part of the budget negotiations, the RN had called for the scrapping of an electricity tax hike, to raise pensions in line with inflation, to scrap cuts to medication reimbursements, freeze a gas tax hike and cut France's EU contributions.</p>

<h2><strong>TRYING TIMES</strong></h2>

<p>Le Pen's political future may also be influencing her decision-making. She is on trial for embezzling EU funds, with a verdict due on March 31. Prosecutors have sought an obligatory five-year ban from public office that would prevent her from running for president in 2027.</p>

<p>Le Pen denies the allegations, and that her legal woes are influencing her calculations. Still, her attacks against Barnier's budget intensified after the prosecutors made their request, and people close to Barnier said they thought the trial had forced her to change tack.</p>

<p>Ultimately, her hopes of reaching the Elysee may rest on winning an early election.</p>

<p>She's not the only political figure to bet on a pre-2027 vote: Macron's former Prime Minister Edouard Philippe in September announced his candidacy for "the next presidential election" and his allies said he wasn't ruling out a presidential election as soon as 2025.</p>

<p>Macron, who can only be impeached by a two-thirds majority in both houses, has already rejected resigning early.</p>

<p>"But as we have seen before, Macron can surprise and shift from previous positions," EuroIntelligence said in a note.</p>

<p>The crisis is unlikely to please investors who this week pushed French borrowing costs above those of Greece.</p>

<p>"The RN says 'I don't have the solution to plug the hole, it's up to the government to plug the hole,'" said Woerth, the Macronista lawmaker. "It's an incomprehensible, irresponsible position."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Los Angeles police have classified Hannah Kobayashi, a 30-year-old who vanished after arriving from Maui, as a voluntary missing person.</p>

<p>New video evidence shows Kobayashi entering Mexico on foot at the San Ysidro port of entry on November 12th.</p>

<p>"As the family is aware, late yesterday after traveling to the US-Mexico border we reviewed video surveillance from US Customs and Border Protection which clearly shows Kobayashi crossing the United States border on foot into Mexico," said LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell during a press conference.</p>

<p>"She was alone with her luggage and appeared unharmed," he added.</p>

<p>Kobayashi's family reported her missing on November 11th after she failed to board her connecting flight to New York from Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Security footage captured her at various locations in LA between November 8th and 11th. &nbsp;Investigators also determined she retrieved her luggage at LAX and used public transportation to reach the border.</p>

<p>"To date the investigation has not uncovered any evidence that Kobayashi is being trafficked or is the victim of foul play. She is also not a suspect in any criminal activity," McDonnell emphasised. "We respect her right to privacy but understand her family's concern."</p>

<p>Prior to leaving Maui, Kobayashi expressed a desire to disconnect from technology, according to police.</p>

<p>Authorities interviewed individuals Kobayashi interacted with in LA, including someone who met her at LAX. Their statements corroborated with the new video evidence.</p>

<p>The LAPD is urging Kobayashi to contact her family, law enforcement, or a US embassy to confirm her well-being.</p>

<p>"We've basically done everything we can do at this point, she's left the country, and in another nation now," Chief McDonnell said. He also added that the investigation will not be carried forward to Mexico. If Kobayashi returns to the U.S., law enforcement will be notified, he said.</p>

<p>The announcement comes after the tragic passing of Kobayashi's father, Ryan, who died by suicide on November 24th while searching for his daughter. He was found dead because of multiple blunt force traumatic injuries according to the LA medical examiner.</p>

<p>A GoFundMe established by the family has raised nearly $47,000 to support search efforts and funeral expenses.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Saudi Arabia has executed more than 300 people this year, a record tally based on official figures, after state media said four more people were put to death on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The latest executions were carried out against three people convicted of drug smuggling and another for murder, the official Saudi Press Agency reported, citing the interior ministry.</p>

<p>It brings the total number of executions for the year so far to 303, according to an AFP tally based on state media reports.</p>

<p>The Gulf monarchy had enacted the death penalty 200 times by the end of September, according to the same tally of official data, indicating a rapid rate of executions in recent weeks.</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia executed the third highest number of prisoners in the world in 2023 after China and Iran, according to Amnesty International.</p>

<p>Previously the record number of executions in a single year in the country had stood at 196 in 2022, said the London-based human rights group, which began compiling the annual figures in 1990.</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia carried out 170 executions in 2023, according to an AFP tally of official data.</p>

<p>Taha al-Hajji, legal director of the Berlin-based European Saudi Organisation for Human Rights (ESOHR), condemned the "rocket speed" of executions in 2024, calling it "incomprehensible and inexplicable".</p>

<p><strong>'Unprecedented'</strong></p>

<p>Human rights activists had previously warned Saudi Arabia could exceed 300 executions this year, with one execution being recorded almost every day.</p>

<p>Lina al-Hathloul, head of communications for the London-based ALQST human rights organisation, said the number of executions was "unprecedented".</p>

<p>"This grim milestone shows the Saudi authorities' flagrant disregard for the right to life and contradicts their own pledges to limit use of the death penalty," she said.</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia, the world's largest exporter of oil, has faced consistent criticism over its use of the death penalty, which rights groups have condemned as excessive and in marked contrast to the kingdom's efforts to present a modern image to the world.</p>

<p>In 2022, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told The Atlantic the kingdom had eliminated the death penalty with the exception extreme cases.</p>

<p>But the ESOHR's Hajji said the kingdom's de facto ruler "will address this issue and say that execution is used for the most serious crimes such as murder... but the reality and numbers do not lie and completely contradict these statements".</p>

<p>Although figures before 1990 are unclear, The Washington Post reported that 63 people were beheaded in 1980 after the previous year's seizure by Islamist militants of Islam's holiest place, the Grand Mosque in Mecca.</p>

<p>Riyadh has previously said the death penalty is necessary to "maintain public order" and sentences are only carried out if "the defendants have exhausted all levels of litigation".</p>

<p><strong>Drug-related charges</strong></p>

<p>This year's executions included 103 people convicted on charges related to drug smuggling and 45 people in cases related to terrorism, according to the AFP tally including Tuesday's announcements.</p>

<p>The kingdom ended a three-year moratorium on the execution of drug offenders at the end of 2022, putting 19 to death in a month.</p>

<p>In 2022, the United Nations said imposing the death penalty for drug crimes "contradicts international norms and standards", calling on the Saudi authorities to "halt the implementation of death sentences for drug crimes".</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia also executed 113 foreigners, another record, most of them on drug-related charges.</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia has carried out more than 1,000 executions since King Salman bin Abdulaziz came to power in 2015, according to a joint report by the London-based anti-death penalty organisation Reprieve and ESOHR published early last year.</p>

<p>Among them, 81 people were executed in a single day for terrorism convictions in March 2022, sparking widespread international condemnation.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A 27-year-old woman in the US who killed and ate a cat has been sentenced to one year in jail after a furious judge slammed her for the stomach-turning act.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 27-year-old woman in the US who killed and ate a cat has been sentenced to one year in jail after a furious judge slammed her for the stomach-turning act. According to the <em>New York Post</em>, Allexis Ferrell committed the gruesome act in August outside her home in Ohio. A bodycam footage from police officers who reached her house showed the 27-year-old on all fours outdoors eating the cat as horrified neighbours looked on. "What did you do? Why did you kill the cat?" a police officer is heard asking the woman in the clip. &nbsp;</p>

<p>On Monday, Stark Country Common Pleas Judge Frank Forchione called Ferrell a national embarrassment. "You've embarrassed this county. You've embarrassed this nation. More importantly, you've embarrassed yourself," the judge said, per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/02/us-news/disgusted-judge-puts-away-woman-who-ate-cat-in-stomach-turning-video-youve-embarrassed-this-nation/" rel="noindex,nofollow">outlet</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"To me, you present quite a danger to our community. This is repulsive to me. I mean, that anyone would do this to an animal. And an animal's like a child. I don't know if you understand that or not. I can't express the disappointment, shock, disgust that this crime has brought to me. I don't know what could prompt anyone to want to eat a cat," Mr Forchione continued.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The judge sentenced Ferrell to one year in jail after she pleaded guilty to a felony charge of animal cruelty. According to the <em>Post</em>, her one-year sentence will be added to a separate 18-month sentence she is facing for two previous crimes including a theft in 201 and a child endangerment case from last year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Stark County Prosecutor Chelsea Small called the cat incident disturbing. "It's one of the most disturbing cases that I've seen as a prosecutor," she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ferrell's attorney Stephen Kandel, however, said that that shocking video makes it clear that the 27-year-old "has an issue with drugs and alcohol, through her evaluation, through her past history". He added that he has arranged for his client to undergo inpatient treatment after her release.</p>

<p>Notably, Ferrell's case became a part of online presidential campaign chatter after Donald Trump and JD Vance claimed that Haitian immigrants in Springfield were eating local pets. Later, officials clarified that Ferrell is not an immigrant and her case is not tied to that claim. She was born in Ohio and graduated from Canton McKinley High School in 2015.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>German authorities are pressing for a 100-year-old former Nazi concentration camp guard to face trial almost 80 years since the end of World War II.</p>

<p>The higher regional court in Frankfurt on Tuesday said it had overturned a decision by a lower court under which the suspect had been deemed unfit to stand trial.</p>

<p>The suspect, named as Gregor Formanek by German media, was charged last year with aiding and abetting murder in 3,322 cases while working at the former Sachsenhausen concentration camp near Berlin between July 1943 and February 1945.</p>

<p>However, an expert determined in February that Formanek was not fit to stand trial due to his mental and physical condition and the court in Hanau, Hesse state, eventually decided not to open the proceedings against him.</p>

<p>The Frankfurt court on Tuesday found the expert's decision had not been based on "sufficient facts".</p>

<p>"The expert himself stated that it was not possible to interview the defendant and that the opportunity for extensive psychiatric testing was not available," it said.</p>

<p>Germany has been scrambling to bring the last surviving former Nazi war criminals to justice since a 2011 landmark ruling paved the way for several trials.</p>

<p>One former death camp guard, John Demjanjuk, was convicted on the basis that he served as part of Hitler's killing machine, even though there was no proof he had directly killed anyone.</p>

<p>Since then, several former concentration camp workers have been found guilty of being accessories to murder on the same basis.</p>

<p>However, with time running out, many cases have been abandoned in recent years after the accused died or were physically unable to stand trial.</p>

<p>More than 200,000 people, including Jews, Roma, regime opponents and gay people, were detained at the Sachsenhausen camp between 1936 and 1945.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands died there from forced labour, murder, medical experiments, hunger or disease before the camp was liberated by Soviet troops.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[South Korea's President Yoon Suk Yeol on Tuesday declared emergency martial law, saying the step was necessary to protect the country from "communist forces" amid parliamentary wrangling over a budget bill.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korea's President Yoon Suk Yeol on Tuesday declared emergency martial law, accusing the opposition of being "anti-state forces intent on overthrowing the regime" amid parliamentary wrangling over a budget bill.</p>

<p>"To safeguard a liberal South Korea from the threats posed by North Korea's communist forces and to eliminate anti-state elements plundering people's freedom and happiness, I hereby declare emergency martial law," Yoon said in a live televised address to the nation.</p>

<p>"With no regard for the livelihoods of the people, the opposition party has paralysed governance solely for the sake of impeachments, special investigations, and shielding their leader from justice," he added.</p>

<p>The surprise move comes as Yoon's People Power Party and the main opposition Democratic Party continue to bicker over next year's budget bill. Opposition MPs last week approved a significantly downsized budget plan through a parliamentary committee.</p>

<p>The opposition has slashed approximately 4.1 trillion won ($2.8 billion) from Yoon's proposed 677 trillion won budget plan, cutting the government's reserve fund and activity budgets for Yoon's office, the prosecution, police and the state audit agency.</p>

<p>"Our National Assembly has become a haven for criminals, a den of legislative dictatorship that seeks to paralyse the judicial and administrative systems and overturn our liberal democratic order," Yoon said.</p>

<p><strong>Assembly Closed</strong></p>

<p>Yoon, a former prosecutor, accused opposition lawmakers of cutting "all key budgets essential to the nation's core functions, such as combatting drug crimes and maintaining public security... turning the country into a drug haven and a state of public safety chaos."</p>

<p>The president went on to label the opposition, which holds a majority in the 300-member parliament, as "anti-state forces intent on overthrowing the regime".</p>

<p>Yoon described the imposition of martial law as "inevitable to guarantee the continuity of a liberal South Korea," adding that it would not impact the country's foreign policy.</p>

<p>"I will restore the country to normalcy by getting rid of anti-state forces as soon as possible," he said, without elaborating further other than the martial law in place.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He described the current situation as South Korea "on the verge of collapse, with the National Assembly acting as a monster intent on bringing down liberal democracy".</p>

<p>With martial law imposed, all military units in the South, which remains technically at war with the nuclear-armed North, have been ordered to strengthen their emergency alert and readiness postures, Yonhap news agency reported.</p>

<p>The entrance to the National Assembly has been sealed, and MPs have been barred from entering the building, according to Yonhap.</p>

<p>The imposition of emergency martial law comes as Yoon's approval rating dropped to 19 percent in the latest Gallup poll last week, with many expressing dissatisfaction over his handling of the economy and controversies involving his wife, Kim Keon Hee.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Bangladesh today summoned India's envoy to Dhaka, hours after closing its visa and consular office in Tripura after a security incident yesterday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh today summoned India's envoy to Dhaka, hours after closing its visa and consular office in Tripura following a security incident yesterday. Tensions between both countries are high amid violence against Hindu minorities in Bangladesh. Indian High Commissioner Pranay Verma arrived at the Foreign Ministry Office in Dhaka at 4 pm local time.</p>

<p>"The Indian High Commissioner has been summoned by acting foreign secretary Reaz Hamidullah," Bangladesh's state-run news agency said. Hours earlier, a notice from the Bangladesh High Commissioner's office in Tripura stated that "Given the security situation, all visa and consular services at the Bangladesh Assistant High Commission, Agartala will remain suspended until further notice."</p>

<p>It also stated that "This comes into effect immediately".</p>

<p>Around 50 people had participated in a massive protest against the arrest of Hindu monk Chinmoy Krishna Das in Agartala yesterday.</p>

<p>During the protest, they entered the premises of the Bangladesh Assistant High Commission. This drew a sharp response from the interim government in the neighbouring country. Dhaka alleged that local police were "not found to be active in containing the situation". It said the incident had left the mission staff with a "deep sense of insecurity" and called upon New Delhi to take "immediate action".</p>

<p>The Ministry of External Affairs responded that the incident in "deeply regrettable". "Diplomatic and consular properties should not be targeted under any circumstances. Government is taking action to step up security arrangements for the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi and their Deputy/Assistant High Commissions in the country," a statement said.</p>

<p>The number of cops at the Bangladesh mission in Agartala has been stepped up after yesterday's incident.</p>

<p>After the meeting, the Indian High Commissioner said, "We have a wide-ranging, multi-faceted relationship, and as I have said before, you cannot reduce it to one issue or one agenda. We are working across many issues. We (India) always wants to build a positive, stable and constructive relationship. There are many interdependencies we have and we want to build on that to mutual benefit."</p>

<p>He further said that "We will keep ensuring that our cooperation benefits our two peoples. The number of positive developments to our relationship in the last few months - from trade, to power transmission, to supplying essential commodities - we have maintained a lot of positivity in our relationship."</p>

<p>"We are also willing to work with the interim government in Bangladesh. We are committed to work with them to fulfil our shared aspirations for peace, security and development."</p>

<p>India has taken up the issue of Hindus being targeted in Bangladesh and priests being arrested by the authorities in Bangladesh. There have also been multiple incidents of violence, vandalism and desecration targeting the minority Hindu community.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mere weeks before the completion of his Presidential term, outgoing president Joe Biden approved a crucial sale of defence equipment to India. He notified the Congress about the decision on Monday.<br />
<br />
The US has authorised the sale of MH-60R Multi-Mission Helicopter Equipment and related ones at the cost of USD 1.17 billion.</p>

<p>This will enhance India's submarine warfare capabilities by deterring present and future threats the Defense Security Cooperation Agency told the Congress. As per the contractors, the helicopter&nbsp;brings transformational anti-submarine (ASW) and anti-surface warfare (ASuW) capabilities to navies around the world. Originally designed specifically for the US Navy, the aircraft is described as "rugged, powerful, and reliable".</p>

<p>"This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by helping to strengthen the United States - India strategic relationship and improving the security of a major defense partner which continues to be an important force for political stability, peace, and economic progress in the Indo-Pacific and South Asia regions," the DSCA said.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.business-standard.com/external-affairs-defence-security/news/us-okays-1-2-bn-mh-60r-helicopter-equipment-sale-to-india-why-it-matters-124120300570_1.html" rel="noindex,nofollow">Business Standard</a>, the MH-60Rs intended for the Indian Navy are equipped with specialised systems tailored to Indian requirements and have reportedly been customised, including the addition of Identification Friend-or-Foe (IFF) transponder units from Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL).</p>

<p>Lockheed is also collaborating with Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) for integrating such systems.

       <description><![CDATA[Despite a tripling of vehicle numbers, pollution levels have decreased, making Beijing a model for other cities tackling similar problems.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China was once nicknamed as the "Kingdom of Bicycles" because of the widespread practice of cycling in this densely populated nation. There was a time when a bicycle was one of the "three rounds" every Chinese house desired, together with a wristwatch and a sewing machine.</p>

<p>However, the country has faced many challenges since it transitioned from bicycles to automobiles and other combustion engines. This shift led to complex problems for the environment, society, and economy. Beijing became known specifically for its poor air quality and a lot of haze.</p>

<p>The fast-growing population, along with high vehicle count and economic expansion, causes this much pressure on Beijing's ecology.</p>

<p>Despite these obstacles, Beijing has improved its air quality significantly in recent years, serving as a model for other cities, particularly in South Asia, facing comparable problems.</p>

<p>As China emerged as the world's largest automobile producer and consumer, it grappled with the detrimental impacts of increased oil consumption, but now China's skies are clearer, and its air quality has drastically improved.</p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.weforum.org/videos/beijingc-cut-air-pollution/#:~:text=Since%202013%2C%20PM2.,more%20than%20300%20in%202023.">World Economic Forum,</a> the Chinese capital has cut fine particle pollution by 64% and sulphur dioxide by 89% since 2013-now other cities are following its lead.</p>

High-efficiency terminal treatment facilities were continuously renovated, and ultralow emission standards were enforced during this period.</p>

<p>The prevention and control of vehicle pollution have long been critical tasks in Beijing's air pollution control. Focusing on new vehicles, in-use vehicles, and fuel quality, Beijing has implemented a series of local emission standards and comprehensive control measures, as well as strengthened traffic management and economic incentives continuously.</p>

<p>Although the number of vehicles increased threefold in Beijing during the last two decades, the total pollutant emissions decreased remarkably.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spain has registered its warmest November since record-keeping began more than six decades ago, even after October ended with its worst floods in a generation, official data showed Tuesday.</p>

<p>November's average temperature was 12.4 degrees Celsius (54.3 Fahrenheit), which was 0.5 degrees Celsius higher than the previous record for the month in 1983, and 2.8C higher than the November average between 1991 and 2020, national weather agency AEMET said on social media.</p>

<p>It was the highest average temperature for a month of November since the agency began to keep records in 1961.</p>

<p>"It was also a very dry November overall," the agency said, adding that precipitation was 40 percent below normal levels "despite the abundant rains" during the first days of the month in the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>Torrential rains on October 29 caused flash floods that killed at least 230 people and swept away cars and wrecked homes and businesses, mainly in the eastern region of Valencia on the Mediterranean coast.</p>

<p>The storm was followed by several episodes of heavy rain in the region during the first week of November that hampered the clean-up operation.</p>

<p>Spain endured its second-hottest year on record in 2023 with an average temperature of 15.2C, just below the record 15.5C registered in 2022.</p>

<p>As global temperatures rise because of climate change, scientists have warned that heatwaves and other extreme weather events like droughts and wildfires will become more frequent and more intense.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korean actor Park Min-jae has died at the age of 32, <em>CNA Lifestyle</em> reported citing South Korean news agencies. Mr Min-jae died from sudden cardiac arrest on November 29, Friday, while travelling to China. Despite his brief career, the actor made significant contributions to several notable Korean dramas including<em> 'Little Women', 'Call It Love', 'The Korea-Khitan War', 'Snap And Spark',</em> and <em>'True To Love'.</em>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"A beautiful actor who loved acting and always did his best, Park Min-jae has gone to heaven," Mr Min-jae's agency Big Title said in a statement. "We will no longer be able to see his acting, but we will always remember him with pride," it continued. The agency also stated that the 32-year-old did not have major health issues before leaving for China, per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://cnalifestyle.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/park-min-jae-death-korean-actor-414661" rel="noindex,nofollow">outlet</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Big Title's CEO Hwang Ju Hye also expressed his grief online. "The guy who said he would conquer China and go on a month-long trip has gone on a much longer journey. It was so sudden and so shocking... The family must be feeling unimaginable sorrow... Min Jae, there's still so much we wanted to say and do together. I was grateful to have been your representative, even if only for a short time, and I'm deeply sorry. I will never forget the name, Actor Park Min Jae," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Min-jae's demise also left many of his fans in disbelief. "my condolences to you all," commented one user. "Our deepest condolences to his family, friends, and fans during this difficult time. May he rest in peace," commented another.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japan is planning to use AI to police anime and manga pirating websites that the pop-culture powerhouse accuses of costing it billions of dollars in lost revenue every year.</p>

<p>There are at least 1,000 websites illegally offering free downloads of Japanese content, mostly its globally-renowned manga graphic novels, a group of domestic publishers claimed earlier this year.</p>

<p>But under a 300 million yen ($2 million) pilot scheme proposed by Tokyo's cultural agency, AI will scour the web for sites pirating manga books and anime cartoons, using an image and text detection system.</p>

<p>"Copyright-holders spend a significant amount of human resources trying to manually detect pirated content online," cultural agency official Keiko Momii told AFP on Tuesday.</p>

<p>But human moderators can "barely keep up" with constantly proliferating illegal content, the agency said in a written document.</p>

<p>The initiative features in the agency's supplementary budget request for this fiscal year ending in March.</p>

<p>It is inspired by a similar project in South Korea and if successful could also be applied to other illegally shared films and music.</p>

<p>Japan, the birthplace of comic and cartoon epics such as "Dragon Ball" and game franchises from "Super Mario" to "Final Fantasy", sees the creative industries as a driver for growth on par with steel and semiconductors.</p>

<p>In its revised "Cool Japan" strategy released in June, the government said it aims to boost exports of these cultural assets to 20 trillion yen ($130 billion) by 2033.</p>

<p>Around 70 percent of pirating sites offering Japanese content operate in foreign languages including English, Chinese and Vietnamese, Japanese publishers say.</p>

<p>In 2022, Japan's gaming, anime and manga sectors raked in 4.7 trillion yen ($30 billion) from abroad -- close to microchips exports at 5.7 trillion yen, government data shows.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak urged voters to choose the Conservative party as polling booths opened across the&nbsp;country for the general election.&nbsp;Sharing a photo with his wife, Akshata Murty, at a polling booth, the UK PM asked voters to stop the Labour "supermajority".</p>

<p>"The polls are open. Vote Conservative to stop the Labour supermajority which would mean higher taxes for a generation," he said in a post on X. The photo showed the couple holding hands and walking to a polling booth.</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<br />
Vote Conservative to stop the Labour supermajority which would mean higher taxes for a generation. <a href="https://t.co/NPH7lSeDFc">pic.twitter.com/NPH7lSeDFc</a></p>
— Rishi Sunak (@RishiSunak) <a href="https://twitter.com/RishiSunak/status/1808760847063298126?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 4, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p></p>

<p>The 44-year-old Indian-origin PM faces voter angst towards the incumbent Conservative Party which has been in power for over 14 years under five prime ministers.</p>

<p>Throughout the six-week campaign that followed Mr Sunak's sudden call for elections, the UK PM has trailed behind 61-year-old Keir Starmer who leads the Labour Party.</p>

<p>“Stop Labour's supermajority” is the central message Mr Sunak was trying to drive home as he wrapped up his campaign, even as most of the incumbent Conservatives all but conceded defeat in the general election.</p>

<p>“Labour will put up your taxes. Again and again and again,” he posted on social media as the catch-all message to wind up the campaign trail.</p>

<p>Around 40,000 polling booths opened across the country at 7am local time as an estimated 46 million registered voters began turning out to mark a cross next to their chosen candidate on a paper ballot.</p>

<p>Once the votes are cast and the booths officially close at 10 pm local time, the focus shifts to the definitive exit poll soon after which gives a fair snapshot of what can be expected&nbsp;UK-wide. Counting commences up and down the country right away, with the first results expected just before midnight local time.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris is engaged in a delicate balancing act, playing cheerleader for President Joe Biden while standing by as a leading contender to replace him if he ends his reelection bid.</p>

<p>Biden's dismal performance in last week's debate with Donald Trump has triggered panic in much of the Democratic Party as people question whether Biden is physically and mentally able to beat Trump and serve another four years.</p>

<p>Former congressman Tim Ryan, while professing his admiration for Biden, wrote in a piece for Newsweek that "the Democratic nominee in 2024 should be Kamala Harris."</p>

<p>Jim Clyburn, a senior House Democrat, and Black leader, told MSNBC: "We should do everything we can to bolster her -- whether it's in second place or at the top of the ticket."</p>

<p>Harris herself has not publicly voiced any desire to replace Biden.</p>

<p>"Look, Joe Biden is our nominee," she said in an interview Tuesday with CBS News. "We beat Trump once, and we're going to beat him again, period."</p>

<p>She said she was proud to be on the current ticket with the president.</p>

<p>Shortly after the debate, Harris rushed onto TV to defend Biden, admitting he had started off slowly in the clash with Trump, but saying he ultimately finished strong.</p>

<p>The official schedule for Biden on Wednesday said he had lunch with Harris, which is not a regular event, though it was a weekly fixture for Biden when he was vice president under Barack Obama.</p>

<h3><strong>One heartbeat&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Harris, 59, is the first woman, the first Black person, and the first person of Asian origin -- her mother was from India -- to hold the job that puts her a heartbeat from the presidency, as Americans like to say.</p>

<p>Harris would become president if Biden died in office or became incapacitated.</p>

<p>But she would not necessarily replace Biden if he were to end his candidacy, and Biden has insisted he has no plans to do so.</p>

<p>"For three and half years there has always been this drumbeat that someone other than the VP should be the Democratic candidate," said Ange-Marie Hancock, professor of political science at The Ohio State University.</p>

<p>Hancock said it was possible an "undercurrent of racism and sexism" was at work against Harris.</p>

<p>For years Harris has been less popular among Americans than other Democrats seen as possible candidates, such as California Governor Gavin Newsom or his Michigan counterpart Gretchen Whitmer.</p>

<p>US media have reported extensively on mistakes she made early in this administration, mainly on the diplomatic front, and on tension among her staffers.</p>

<p>But Hancock said things could turn in Harris's favor, because she has spent time out visiting battleground states, in particular, to promote abortion rights as it came under repeated fire from conservative judges and governors.</p>

<p>Flickers of that turn could be seen on social media, where supportive Harris-related memes have begun going viral under the hashtag #KHive.</p>

<p>Harris is sometimes criticized as disappointing as an orator. But she got a warm welcome recently when she made a tour of universities that was focused on schools with high numbers of minority students.</p>

<p>She'll make more stops in July to speak with African American audiences, particularly women, with three trips to Louisiana, Texas, and Indiana.</p>

<h3><strong>Polling&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>A CNN poll released Tuesday had Harris doing better than Biden against Trump, although not beating him.</p>

<p>This poll gave Harris 45 percent of voter intentions against 47 percent for Trump, while Biden scored 43 percent to 49 percent for the Republican former president in a race between the two men.</p>

<p>In the event Biden was to drop out, Harris, thanks to her name recognition, her ties to powerful people in the government, and the prospect for brisk fundraising, would go into the Democratic convention next month in a position of strength.</p>

<p>But the Republicans are ready and waiting.</p>

<p>"Kamala Harris is very much on the GOP's radar," Hancock said, referring to Trump's party.</p>

<p>The Trump campaign on Wednesday broadcast a video montage of Biden suffering falls and other embarrassing moments, and questioned whether he can serve another term.</p>

<p>It concludes with the question, "And you know who is waiting behind him, right?" and footage of Harris laughing.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As residents of Joe Biden's hometown, Scranton prepared to mark that most American of holidays -- July 4 -- many were also voicing alarm about the US president following his disastrous debate last week against Donald Trump.</p>

<p>"I think he should never have done that (debate)," said Dennis Frison, 70, a retired food service worker as he smoked a cigarette outside the Pennsylvania coal mining town's buzzing Whiskey Dick's bar on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Scranton has long been the heart of the political mythology around Biden, recalling his hardscrabble upbringing, repaying his affection with an expressway named for him and a life-size cardboard cutout in Hank's Hoagies sandwich store.</p>

<p>But Pennsylvania remains a key battleground in the 2024 election, and national polls are showing warning signs after Biden's faltering performance against White House challenger Trump sparked widespread panic over his ability to finish a second term.</p>

<p>"I think he can still do what he needs to do as the president, he's just not as cognizant as he used to be," Frison said of the 81-year-old.</p>

<p>As for the alternatives, Frison said he was wary of Biden being replaced by his vice president, Kamala Harris, because of comments she has previously made about not seeking to pass laws to help Black people.</p>

<p>Like others in the town, however, he could not name anyone other than Harris to step up to replace "Scranton Joe" at the top of the Democratic ticket.</p>

<h3><strong>'Placeholder candidate'?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>And the vice president found more support elsewhere -- such as outside the town's Marketplace mall, where Silvera Kosarev, 21, was signing up voters for November's election.</p>

<p>"Of course, I'm not impressed by Biden... he's just kind of like a placeholder candidate to get over (the election) and then get someone else into office if he wants to step aside," they said.</p>

<p>"I'd be fine for Kamala (Harris) if she just stepped in. I'm just absolutely anti-Trump."</p>

<p>Others in the town did support Trump -- and did not mince their words about Biden.</p>

<p>"To me, it was like he has dementia (or) Alzheimer's, the way he speaks. It's just not good at all," said Sheryl Krauter, 33, who relocated to Scranton from Queens in New York.</p>

<p>"When Trump was president, everything was settled a little bit and nobody messed with us. (Now) everything is all over the place," she said as stallholders set up around her on Courthouse Square for Thursday's Independence Day celebrations.</p>

<p>Given Biden's highly-anticipated debate performance, during which he garbled answers and lost his train of thought, allowing Trump to deliver falsehoods and misinformation unchallenged, she questioned Biden's state away from piercing public scrutiny.</p>

<p>A short drive away from the fudge and rice pudding stands is the wooden, three-storey house with a neatly manicured front lawn where Biden grew up.</p>

<p>A small poster invites visitors to photograph the home from the street -- although not one of the neighboring houses displayed a Biden-Harris campaign sign.</p>

<p>A few doors down from Biden's former home, Jamie Hayes said she was "embarrassed" for Biden after his debate performance.</p>

<p>"I felt he didn't feel well, and he probably shouldn't have gone on stage. He probably made the worst of two (choices) -- if he didn't go on, I'm sure they would have felt he was backing down," said the 73-year-old grandmother.</p>

<p>"(But) I do believe that he has surrounded himself with enough people who are like-minded that could step in," she said.</p>

<p>"I've heard more about Kamala Harris, and so I would support her."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britons headed to the polls Thursday in a general election widely expected to emphatically return the opposition Labour party to power and end nearly a decade-and-a-half of Conservative rule.</p>

<p>The country's first national ballot since Boris Johnson won a landslide for the Tories in 2019 follows Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's surprise call to hold it six months earlier than required.</p>

<p>His gamble looks set to backfire spectacularly, with polls throughout the six-week campaign -- and for the last two years -- pointing to a heavy defeat for his right-wing party.</p>

<p>That would almost certainly put Labour leader Keir Starmer, 61, in Downing Street, as leader of the largest party in parliament.</p>

<p>Centre-left Labour is projected to win its first general election since 2005 by historic proportions, with a flurry of election-eve polls all forecasting its biggest-ever victory.</p>

<p>But Starmer was taking nothing for granted as he urged voters not to stay at home. "Britain's future is on the ballot," he said. "But change will only happen if you vote for it."</p>

<p><strong>Long night</strong></p>

<p>Voting began at 7:00 am in more than 40,000 polling stations across the country, from church halls, community centres and schools to more unusual venues such as pubs and even a ship.</p>

<p>At 10:00 pm, broadcasters then announce exit polls, which typically provide an accurate picture of how the main parties have performed.</p>

<p>Results from the UK's 650 constituencies trickle in overnight, with the winning party expected to hit 326 seats -- the threshold for a parliamentary majority -- as dawn breaks Friday.</p>

<p>Polls suggest voters will punish the Tories after 14 years of often chaotic rule and could oust a string of government ministers, with talk that even Sunak himself might not be safe.</p>

<p>That would make him the first sitting prime minister not to retain his seat in a general election.</p>

<p>"I appreciate people have frustrations with our party," he conceded on Wednesday. "But tomorrow's vote... is a vote about the future."</p>

<p><strong>Endorsements</strong></p>

<p>Sunak, 44, is widely seen as having run a dismal campaign, with anger over his decision to leave D-Day commemorations in France early the standout moment.</p>

<p>In new blows Wednesday, The Sun newspaper switched allegiance to Labour -- a key endorsement given the tabloid has backed the winner at every election for several decades.</p>

<p>It follows the Financial Times, the Economist and The Sunday Times as well as traditionally left-leaning papers The Guardian and The Daily Mirror, also endorsing the party.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, three large-scale surveys indicated Labour was on the brink of a record victory, with the Tories set for their worst-ever result and the centrist Liberal Democrats resurgent in third.</p>

<p>YouGov, Focaldata and More in Common all projected Labour would secure at least 430 seats, topping the 418 under Tony Blair in 1997.</p>

<p>The Conservatives could plunge to a record low of less than 127, the trio predicted.</p>

<p>The Lib Dems were tipped to scoop dozens of seats -- up from their current tally of 15 -- while Nigel Farage's anti-immigrant Reform UK party was set to win a handful.</p>

<p>YouGov and More in Common both forecast the Brexit figurehead would finally become an MP at the eighth time of asking.</p>

<p><strong>'National renewal'</strong></p>

<p>If the predictions are accurate, Sunak will on Friday visit head of state King Charles III to tender his resignation as prime minister.</p>

<p>Starmer will meet the monarch shortly after to take up his invitation to head the next government -- and become prime minister.</p>

<p>The Labour leader will then travel to Downing Street -- the office and residence of British leaders -- where he would be expected to deliver a speech before making ministerial appointments.</p>

<p>It would cap a remarkable political rise for the former human rights lawyer and chief prosecutor, first elected an MP in 2015.</p>

<p>He has promised a "decade of national renewal" but faces a daunting task revitalising creaking public services and a flatlining economy.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"We are carefully managing (the) supply of eggs due to the current industry challenges," McDonald's Australia said in a message to customers this week.</p>

<p>Scientists say the bird flu strain is genetically related to viruses detected in Australia's wild bird population and is not the H5 strain spreading elsewhere in the world.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi will soon embark on a trip to the Russian Federation, where he will hold talks with President Vladimir Putin. This will be Modi's first foreign visit for a bilateral meeting in his third term. While the announcement has already raised eyebrows across the globe, it is emblematic of the fact that India will continue to do a balancing act under Modi 3.0 and reassure Russia of its goodwill and partnership. Meanwhile, Modi will be skipping the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit beginning today in Astana, Kazakhstan, with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar representing India there instead.</p>

<p>Modi last visited Russia in 2019, when he attended the Eastern Economic Forum and the annual bilateral summit, a process instituted in 2000.&nbsp;The last talks between the two leaders were in December 2021, during Putin's visit to India.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Given that this will be the first bilateral summit between India and Russia since the latter began its "special military operations” in Ukraine in February 2022, the Ukraine conflict and trade — which has reached unprecedented levels mainly on account of discounted Russian oil — will obviously be at the top of the agenda. The two countries are also set to upgrade their defence relations with a new agreement that will involve joint deployment of troops, warships, and fighter jets&nbsp;— something India has never done with any other country. An agreement on logistics support is on the cards too.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Russia-China Friendship Is Deepening, But...</strong></h2>

<p>It is widely believed that Modi is skipping the SCO summit to avoid a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping given the fraught relations between the two neighbours since the Galwan clashes in the summer of 2020. Simultaneously, India in recent times has been alarmed by the deepening ties between Russia and China. No doubt, talks will focus on this aspect too.</p>

<p>The Russia-China partnership has evolved since the Ukraine war began. China was the first country that Putin chose for an official visit after his re-election in March this year. As a bigger neighbouring country with far deeper pockets than India's, this is natural. Bilateral trade between the two countries stands at over $240 billion. China is Russia's largest crude importer, while Chinese goods, from automobiles to clothes, have been filling the void left by the flight of Western companies from Russia. The Chinese yuan accounted for 34.5% of Russia's total export payments over the past two years. China has supplied Russia with dual technology, and the two have also been conducting joint military exercises. In fact, Beijing has been accused by the West of both abetting and benefiting from the Ukraine conflict.</p>

<p>Yet, the Russia-China partnership is not foolproof. There are avenues New Delhi and Moscow can explore in order to balance China's influence in the Eurasian region.</p>

<h2><b>There Are Gaps To Fill</b></h2>

<p>Perhaps a big indicator of the gaps in the Russia-China relationship is the lack of movement on the Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline, which Russia is keen to get started to prop up its economy. According to Russian analysts, this was the main reason for Putin's Beijing visit. Yet, nothing came of it. Rather, industry experts in China have been talking about the non-feasibility of the pipeline.</p>

<p>Putin followed up his visit to China with trips to Uzbekistan, North Korea, and Vietnam. All three destinations are symbolic of larger geopolitical shifts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Uzbekistan, part of the post-Soviet space in Central Asia, lies in Russia's strategic backyard. China's inroads in the region were restricted to the economic sphere, with Russia retaining its military and strategic influence. This was a key reason for the establishment of the SCO. But Russia's distraction with Ukraine has upended this arrangement.</p>

<p>For instance, a railway line mooted almost two decades ago but which remains in the pipeline because of Moscow's reservations, was recently greenlit by China, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan - another close Russian ally in post-Soviet Central Asia. The route will run from Kashgar in China through Kyrgyzstan and will terminate in Uzbekistan's Andijan province, bypassing Russian territory. Moreover, the Kyrgyz part of the route will be financed by Chinese loans, pushing it deeper into Chinese debt.</p>

<p>For perspective, similar Chinese debt owed by Tajikistan, which houses Russia's largest foreign military base abroad, has resulted in Tajikistan ceding territory to the Chinese to station their own base there.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was to regain this space that Tashkent became Putin's second destination upon assuming office again. Most significant were the deals signed for nuclear cooperation, under which Russia would build a small nuclear power plant — Central Asia's first — and increase gas supplies from Russia to Uzbekistan. Modernisation of the gas transportation system is also part of the deals, signifying long-term plans.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Russia In China's Backyard</strong></h2>

<p>Putin's other two visits were to North Korea and Vietnam in East and Southeast Asia, which China considers its strategic backyard.</p>

<p>In North Korea, the two sides signed a defence treaty, diversifying the former's security partnerships. Thus far, China had been the only country with which North Korea had a defence alliance. China's response to this agreement has been muted, but analysts say that it's actually a headache for Beijing as it fears that the pact may attract unnecessary American attention to the region. The deal also has the potential to cause a power imbalance in Northeast Asia.</p>

<p>With Vietnam, China had strained relations till most recently. Yet, while ties have improved at the party level and in the economic sphere, the Vietnamese military is still wary of Beijing and its expansionist policy in the South China Sea, where Vietnam's Special Economic Zone lies.&nbsp;A slew of agreements were signed between Russia and Vietnam during Putin's visit, including in the energy sector. The Russian president also expressed his desire to increase cooperation with ASEAN.</p>

<p>More recently, last week, Russia finalised an agreement with another Chinese ally, Cambodia, for cooperation between their ground forces. This was a first in bilateral relations between the two countries.</p>

<h2><strong>Putin's Asia Pivot</strong></h2>

<p>Overall, Russia has been pivoting to Asia since at least 2014, when the first sanctions were imposed on it by the West. With his North Korea and Vietnam visits, Putin demonstrated that he has options in the region. And this is something China is not excited about. Beijing sees itself as the natural leader of the global South and is the major power in ASEAN. Russia, it feels, is just a newcomer.</p>

<p>According to Prof. Baladas Ghoshal, former Professor and Chair in Southeast Asian Studies at the Jawaharlal Nehru University, “Southeast Asian countries are more focused on development and economy, for which they depend on China. However, they are not too comfortable with being too close to China." The recent desire of a number of ASEAN countries such as Malaysia and Thailand to join BRICS stems from this intention of hedging against China and seeking a balance with other powers, like Russia.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>The Sri Lanka Example</strong></h2>

<p>This provides a window of opportunity for cooperation between India and Russia in third countries to balance China's expanding footprint. South Asia, the Indian sphere of influence where China has been making deep inroads, already offers such an example. In April, the Sri Lankan cabinet announced that it was handing over the management of the Chinese-built Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport to India's Shaurya Aeronautics (Pvt) Ltd. and Russia's Airports of Regions Management Company. The $209 million airport had been running losses since 2013. Strategically located close to the China-managed Hambantota port, the joint Indo-Russian presence will help counter Chinese influence close to India's borders.</p>

<p>The two countries are also cooperating in the Roopur nuclear power plant in Bangladesh, where Russia is constructing the power plant while India is assisting with logistics. Another example is the sale of the Brahmos cruise missile system to the Philippines, which is currently engaged in a tussle with China in the South China Sea. The missile was jointly developed by India's Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Russia's NPOM, and&nbsp;Russian endorsement was needed for its export.</p>

<p>This India-Russia cooperation can be extended to ASEAN and Central Asian countries as well. For instance, India, Vietnam, and Russia can work together in the hydrocarbon sector as ONGC Videsh has a presence in Vietnam. Defence is another area where the two can cooperate. This makes sense because not only are Central Asian countries tied to Russia through the Collective Security Treaty Organisation, but ASEAN members like Vietnam and Indonesia have also traditionally had close defence cooperation with Moscow.</p>

<p>It's true that India and Russia lack China's deep pockets. But where China's calling card is its massive investments and the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Russia and India can leverage their position through joint efforts towards invigorating trade and investments in Central Asia, the ASEAN region, and even South Asia. It'll be a win for not just countries in these three regions, but also Russia and India as they counter China's expansionist policies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Emma Navarro is the daughter of billionaire Ben Navarro, whose $1.5 billion net worth surpasses that of Federer, Djokovic and Nadal combined.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In what was the first major upset of Wimbledon 2024, Emma Navarro defeated Naomi Osaka 6-4, 6-1 on Wednesday. Ms Osaka, a four-time Grand Slam champion, was playing her first Wimbledon tournament in five years. Ms Navarro, currently world 17, defeated the former world number 1, in less than an hour at Centre Court.<br />
<br />
Navarro has yet to lose a set in the tournament. She will face Diana Shnaider in the third round of Wimbledon on Friday.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Here are some facts about the rising tennis star:</strong><br />
<br />
1. Emma Navarro was born in New York City in 2001. Her passion for tennis started in early childhood and she decided to pursue the sport seriously by fourth grade. She attended Ashley Hall in Charleston, South Carolina, where she quickly made a name for herself as a junior tennis star. Her late grandfather, Frank Navarro, was a college football player and coach.<br />
<br />
2. She is the daughter of Ben Navarro, an American billionaire and founder of Sherman Financial Group, which runs Credit One. According to Forbes, Ben Navarro's net worth is approximately $1.5 billion, surpassing the combined wealth of tennis legends Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal. Emma Navarro has also earned a significant $1,074,546 in prize money so far this year.<br />
<br />
3. The 23-year-old's big breakthrough in tennis came in 2019 when she won the junior French Open doubles title alongside Chloe Beck. That same year,&nbsp;she also impressed in singles, finishing as the tournament's runner-up. Her outstanding performance earned her the top spot as the nation's no. 1 recruit, as ranked byTennisRecruiting.net.<br />
<br />
4. In 2020, Ms Navarro enrolled at the University of Virginia, where she continued to excel in tennis. During her time with the Cavaliers, she became the 2021 NCAA singles champion, a feat only one other player in the program's history had achieved. She also secured her first main-draw WTA singles victory at the Volvo Car Open in Charleston by defeating Renata Zarazua in straight sets. Her impressive collegiate performance earned her a wild card entry into the US Open.<br />
<br />
5. Emma Navarro turned pro in 2022, earning ITA singles and doubles All-American honours. She quickly made her mark in the professional circuit, capturing her first WTA title at the Hobart International in January. Ms Navarro's Grand Slam performances improved, reaching the third round of the Australian Open and the fourth round of the French Open. Now, two years later, Ms Navarro played her first Wimbledon as a seed. In the first round, she defeated China's Wang Qiang, a former US Open quarter-finalist, 6-0, 6-2, and defeated Naomi Osaka in the second round.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The drumbeat of pressure on Joe Biden to drop out of the US presidential race intensified Wednesday with a bombshell report in the New York Times that he had conceded the possibility to a key ally.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The drumbeat of pressure on Joe Biden to drop out of the US presidential race intensified Wednesday with a bombshell report in the New York Times that he had conceded the possibility to a key ally, as well as movement within his own party to demand his withdrawal.</p>

<p>The White House and Biden's campaign quickly denied the Times report suggesting the president had vocalized to a supporter that he could ill-afford another misstep that would irrevocably damage his campaign. Biden himself insisted to campaign staff he intended to remain in the race.</p>

<p>"I'm in this race to the end and we're going to win because when Democrats unite, we will always win," Biden said in a call alongside Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Yet time is running out for the beleaguered president to convince anxious Democratic officials, donors and voters that he remains viable in his effort to keep former President Donald Trump from returning to office. In another blow, dozens of Democratic lawmakers are considering signing a letter demanding Biden withdraw from the race, a senior party official said.</p>

<p>That anxiety has only been fueled by a flood of recent reporting suggesting other Democrats are eyeing possible replacement candidates - and by the Times reporting.</p>

<p>Biden told his ally the race would be in a "different place" if upcoming events went poorly, the Times reported. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre subsequently said Biden had flatly denied making such a comment.</p>

<p>Biden plans to sit for an interview with ABC News on Friday, and hold a rally in Madison, Wisconsin. On Sunday, he'll travel to Philadelphia for another campaign event. He also plans interviews with Black radio stations in Philadelphia and Milwaukee to coincide with his travel.</p>

<p>Biden has been calling senior Democratic lawmakers - including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries - in a bid to shore up support on Capitol Hill, even as members of his party are publicly expressing dismay about his campaign.</p>

<p>So far, only two sitting House Democrats - Lloyd Doggett of Texas and Raul Grijalva of Arizona - have publicly called for Biden to step aside. But the President may not be able to survive a coordinated revolt among Democratic lawmakers worried that his poor performance could cost them seats or a shot at control of the House and Senate in the upcoming election.</p>

<p>Jean-Pierre said Biden had told her the calls with congressional Democrats were "strong."</p>

<p>"He's moving forward as being president. He's moving forward with his campaign," she added.</p>

<p>A Senate Democrat, however, said Wednesday evening that several colleagues had privately indicated they didn't see a way for the president to survive politically. The senator, granted anonymity to speak frankly about discussions among colleagues, said Biden hadn't assuaged concerns about his debate collapse against Trump.</p>

<p>Biden served for 36 years in the Senate, and Democrats there have been largely silent about his candidacy during a week of turmoil.</p>

<p>Later on Wednesday, Biden held a hastily arranged meeting with Democratic governors, many of whom are at the center of speculation about possibly replacing him on the ticket. Several emerged to say that they were firmly behind Biden. "The president was very clear that he is in this to win this," Governor Wes Moore of Maryland told reporters.</p>

<h2><strong>Crisis Meeting</strong></h2>

<p>Moore and other nationally prominent governors with extensive fundraising networks like California's Gavin Newsom, Michigan's Gretchen Whitmer and Illinois's JB Pritzker went to the White House for the crisis meeting in person, while others joined virtually.</p>

<p>"I heard three words from the president - he's all in. And so am I. Joe Biden's had our back. Now it's time to have his," Newsom said.</p>

<p>But other recent reports have spurred speculation among Democratic allies. On Tuesday, the Washington Post said that former President Barack Obama had privately conveyed to allies that Biden's path to reelection was more challenging following his debate performance.</p>

<p>Reuters published a new poll showing Harris - the most likely successor if Biden were to step aside - trailing Trump, the Republican candidate, by a single point. Momentum behind the vice president, who could take over the campaign's sizable war chest, has gathered in recent days. The pair had lunch together on Wednesday afternoon and jointly dialed into their campaign's conference call.</p>

<p>A Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll in May showed Harris gaining trust among swing-state voters, 48% of whom say she's ready to assume the duties of the presidency if Biden were unable to continue.</p>

<p>The Leadership Now Project, a group of business leaders who had organized to counter what they saw as threats to democracy during the last Trump administration, called for Biden to cede his place as the Democratic nominee.</p>

<p>"This process will undoubtedly be messy and is not without risk," the group said in a statement. "However, the stakes are too high not to act."</p>

<h2><strong>All-Hands Calls</strong></h2>

<p>In Wilmington, Delaware, staffers at Biden's campaign headquarters received an email from campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez and chair Jen O'Malley Dillon saying the campaign would increase its cadence of all-staff calls and emails to better coordinate.</p>

<p>White House Chief of Staff Jeff Zients held a similar all-hands meeting with staffers there on Wednesday, imploring them to keep their heads held high and continue executing their responsibilities while acknowledging Biden "didn't have a great night."</p>

<p>"People are looking for chatter," he said, according to a recording of the call obtained by Bloomberg. "Tune it out."</p>

<p>The campaign's memo asked staffers to emphasize the "full picture" of Biden's support, downplaying recent polls that have shown a noticeable tilt toward Trump.</p>

<p>"Polls are a snapshot in time and we should all expect them to continue to fluctuate - it will take a few weeks, not a few days, to get a full picture of the race," the pair wrote.</p>

<p>Part of that effort included sending a memo to congressional staffers stressing that polls remained within the margin of error, and the campaign's belief that a bad showing in the coming weeks did not actually indicate "a reshaping of the race."</p>

<p>A New York Times/Siena College poll released Wednesday, though, found Trump's lead over Biden had grown to six points, 49% to 43%, with nearly three-quarters of voters saying the Democratic president is too old for the job.</p>

<p>South Carolina Democrat Jim Clyburn, a leading Biden supporter who spoke with the president on Wednesday, told CNN he wants to see the president in "town-hall type" events now and performing there would calm some fears.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It resembles a malevolent robot from 1980s sci-fi but West Japan Railway's new humanoid employee was designed with nothing more sinister than a spot of painting and gardening in mind.</p>

<p>Starting this month, the machine with a crude head and coke bottle eyes mounted on a truck -- which can drive on rails -- will be put to use for maintenance work on the firm's network.</p>

<p>Its operator sits in a cockpit on the truck, "seeing" through the robot's eyes via cameras and operating its powerful limbs and hands remotely.</p>

<p>With a vertical reach of 12 metres (40 feet), the machine can use various attachments for its arms to carry objects as heavy as 40 kilograms (88 pounds), hold a brush to paint, or use a chainsaw.</p>

<p>For now, the robot's primary task will focus on trimming tree branches along rails and painting metal frames that hold cables above trains, the company said.</p>

<p>The technology will help fill worker shortages in ageing Japan as well as reduce accidents such as workers falling from high places or suffering electric shocks, the company says.</p>

<p>"In the future, we hope to use machines for all kinds of maintenance operations of our infrastructure," and this should provide a case study for how to deal with the labour shortage, company president Kazuaki Hasegawa told a recent press conference.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Joe Biden on Wednesday asserted that he is the nominee of the Democratic Party for the November 5 presidential elections and there is no pressure on him to quit the race.</p>

<p>Biden's statement is quite contrary to the reports appearing in the media and the internal party murmurs that he should leave the election race amid his dismal performance in the presidential debate against his Republican rival Donald Trump.</p>

<p>"I'm the Democratic Party's nominee. No one is pushing me out. I'm not leaving, I'm in this race to the end, and WE are going to win this election. If that's all you need to hear, pitch in a few bucks to help [Vice President Harris] and me defeat Donald Trump in November," Biden said in his fundraising email on Wednesday.</p>

<p>After his terrible performance in the presidential debate in Atlanta last Thursday, Biden's approval ratings have dipped, and his own party leaders are calling him to quit the race.</p>

<p>"Look, this campaign is bigger than me or you. Everything we believe in, everything we stand for, and everyone we are fighting for are at risk in this election," Biden said in the email.</p>

<p>"Let me say this as clearly and simply as I can: I'm running," he said in his mass email to his supporters.</p>

<p>"I've been knocked down and counted out my whole life. I'm sure the same is true for many of you. But my father had an expression. He said, 'Champ, it's not how many times you get knocked down. It's how quickly you get up," Biden said.</p>

<p>"As a country, when we get knocked down, we get back up. When we get counted out, we just work harder. That is exactly what I am going to do, and it's what I need you to do as well. Just as we beat Donald Trump in 2020, we are going to beat him again in 2024. But it won't be easy, and I need YOU behind me to get it done. Each and every one of you," said the president who is seeking a second term.</p>

<p>If elected, Biden, 81, would be the oldest-ever president in American history.</p>

<p>"I would not be running again if I didn't believe with all my heart and soul that I could do this job. That I could finish the job that Kamala and me started on January 20, 2021. My word as a Biden. There is no other team I would rather go into battle with than this one. Let's link arms and get this done," the president added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australian police said on Thursday it had located the remains believed to be that of a missing 12-year-old child reportedly attacked by a crocodile in the country's north.</p>

<p>The child was reported missing on Tuesday evening after swimming in a creek near Palumpa, a remote town of around 350 people seven hours by road from Darwin, the capital of Australia's Northern Territory.</p>

<p>"This is devastating news for the family, the community and everyone involved in the search," Northern Territory police Senior Sergeant Erica Gibson said in a statement.</p>

<p>There are more than 100,000 crocodiles in the Northern Territory, which has a land area more than six times the size of Britain, though fatal attacks are relatively rare. It can grow up to 6 metres (20 ft) long.</p>

<p>The child and family had visited the creek for holidays, and it was reported that a black crocodile was seen in the immediate area, police told ABC Radio.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian American politician Nikki Haley on Wednesday took a jibe at top American journalist George Stephanopoulos who had questioned her claim that President Joe Biden would not complete his first term and that voting for him would be a vote for Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Haley had said this to Stephanopoulos in an interview on ABC News last year when she was a primary presidential candidate of the Republican Party. Haley has now suspended her campaign.</p>

<p>"Believe me now, George?" Haley wrote on X, formerly Twitter, as she shared an edited clip from her interview with Stephanopoulos last year.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Believe me now, George? <a href="https://t.co/gy7aS6Mq3Y">https://t.co/gy7aS6Mq3Y</a></p>
— Nikki Haley (@NikkiHaley) <a href="https://twitter.com/NikkiHaley/status/1808287598722666587?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 2, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The Republican leader's post comes amid media reports and internal murmurs in the Democratic party that Biden should leave the election race amid his dismal performance in the presidential debate against his Republican rival Donald Trump.</p>

<p>The post that Haley shared was captioned, "Biden is set to do his first post-debate interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos. Here's George shouting over Nikki Haley last year when she questioned Biden's ability to finish a second term: 'How do you know Joe Biden is not going to finish his term? What is that based on?'" In that clip, Haley said Biden would not complete his term.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, excuse me, one second about that. How do you know Joe Biden is not going to finish his term? What is that based on?" Stephanopoulos had interjected as Haley tried to continue.</p>

<p>"Well, first of all, a vote for Joe Biden is a vote for Kamala Harris," she had said during the interview.</p>

<p>"You know that and I know that. There's no way that Joe Biden is going to finish his term. I think Kamala Harris is going to be the next president, and that should send a chill up every American's spine," she had said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japan's government has finally eliminated the use of floppy disks in all its systems, two decades since their heyday, reaching a long-awaited milestone in a campaign to modernise the bureaucracy.</p>

<p>By the middle of last month, the Digital Agency had scrapped all 1,034 regulations governing their use, except for one environmental stricture related to vehicle recycling.</p>

<p>"We have won the war on floppy disks on June 28!" Digital Minister Taro Kono, who has been vocal about wiping out fax machines and other analogue technology in government, told Reuters in a statement on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The Digital Agency was set up during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, when a scramble to roll out nationwide testing and vaccination revealed that the government still relied on paper filing and outdated technology.</p>

<p>A charismatic figure with 2.5 million followers on X, Kono formerly headed the defence and foreign ministries as well as the COVID vaccine deployment, taking up his current role in August 2022 after a failed bid to become prime minister.</p>

<p>Japan's digitisation effort has run into numerous snags, however. A contact-tracing app flopped during the pandemic and adoption of the government's My Number digital identification card has been slower than it hoped, amid repeated data mishaps.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UK Conservatives hoped Rishi Sunak would stabilise the party and country when they made him leader following his predecessors' chaotic tenures. Instead, he has led them to the brink of electoral wipeout.</p>

<p>The party's MPs installed the 44-year-old former financier in October 2022, after Liz Truss's 49-day premiership imploded when spooked markets moved against her tax-slashing plans.</p>

<p>Sunak succeeded to a point in stabilising the country's economy but failed to stop bitter Tory infighting or to make a dent in the persistent polling lead held by the opposition Labour Party.</p>

<p>Buoyed by rare pieces of economic good news, Sunak called the July 4 election in late May, despite not having to face the voters until early 2025.</p>

<p>He hoped the shock announcement would catch right-wingers Reform UK by surprise, and Labour's 20-point polling lead would shrink during the campaign.</p>

<p>But Sunak's campaign has lurched from one disaster to another.</p>

<p>By far the most damaging was Sunak's decision to leave early from D-Day commemoration events in France, provoking unilateral outrage and alienating the right wing whose votes he desperately needed.</p>

<p>Now they look set to vote en masse for Reform, led by Brexit talisman Nigel Farage.</p>

<p>He also had to apologise after Conservative candidates and the party's campaign chief were put under investigation over alleged bets placed on the date of the election before it was called.</p>

<p>All of which has left Sunak cutting an increasingly frustrated figure, shorn of the bullish rhetoric of the early campaign but still insisting the election result is not a foregone conclusion.</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;'Dishy Rishi'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The privately wealthy Sunak struggled to connect with regular voters hit hard by a cost-of-living crisis.</p>

<p>He was roundly mocked for suggesting he had an austere childhood because his family did not have satellite television, and his interactions with voters have often seemed awkward.</p>

<p>His current difficulties are a far cry from his rapid rise to power, becoming Britain's youngest prime minister of modern times at age 42, as well as the first of South Asian descent.</p>

<p>The observant Hindu was born in Southampton on England's south coast on May 12, 1980, to a family doctor father and a mother who ran a local pharmacy.</p>

<p>Sunak's grandparents were from Punjab in northern India and emigrated from eastern Africa in the 1960s, arriving in Britain with "very little", he has said.</p>

<p>Sunak was educated at the exclusive private Winchester College, then Oxford and Stanford Universities.</p>

<p>During his Tory leadership bid, a video emerged of a 21-year-old Sunak talking about his friends.</p>

<p>"I have friends who are aristocrats, I have friends who are upper-class, I have friends who are, you know, working-class," he says, before adding quickly: "Well, not working-class."</p>

<p>After making millions in finance, Sunak won the safe and overwhelmingly white Conservative seat of Richmond in Yorkshire, northern England, in 2015.</p>

<p>His Instagram-friendly profile earned him the media nickname of "Dishy Rishi".</p>

<p>An early backer of Brexit, he took over as finance minister in February 2020 -- a baptism of fire as the Covid pandemic erupted.</p>

<p>The details-oriented policy wonk was forced to craft an enormous economic support package at breakneck speed, which he regularly touts as one of his proudest achievements in politics.</p>

<h3><strong>Wealthy wife&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The pandemic sullied his squeaky-clean reputation, though, after he received a police fine for breaching Covid rules by joining a birthday gathering for then-prime minister Boris Johnson at Downing Street.</p>

<p>Sunak also faced difficult questions about the tax affairs of his wife Akshata Murty, whose father Narayana Murthy is the billionaire co-founder of IT giant Infosys.</p>

<p>In early 2022, newspapers reported she had non-domiciled status, meaning she had not been paying UK taxes on her Infosys returns.</p>

<p>The news hit Sunak's approval ratings and Murty announced that she would pay UK taxes on her global income.</p>

<p>The Sunaks met while studying in California and have two young daughters, plus a photogenic dog.</p>

<p>He insists his own family's experience, and that of his wife, are a "very Conservative" story of hard work and aspiration.</p>

<p>In July 2022, Sunak quit as finance minister, helping to trigger Johnson's resignation after one scandal too many and public anger at the government's Covid response.</p>

<p>Many Tories have never forgiven him and have harped against his leadership from the sidelines.</p>

<p>He insists only he has a "clear plan" backed by "bold action" to change Britain but voters look set to limit his time in office to less than two years.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Polls opened in the UK's general election today, with the opposition Labour party the heavy favourite to gain power and end 14 years of Conservative rule.</p>

<p>Polls opened at 7:00 am (0600 GMT) and will close at 10:00 pm, when exit polls will give a strong indication of the final result.</p>

<p>Several <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/uk-election-2024-hour-by-hour-guide-to-how-the-results-come-in-6030150">surveys predict</a> Labour will win more than the record 418 seats it secured when ex-leader Tony Blair ended 18 years of Conservative rule in 1997.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The UK operates under a first-past-the-post electoral system where voters elect representatives in 650 constituencies. The party that wins the majority of seats, at least 326, will form the government, and its leader will become the prime minister. If no party secures a majority, the existing prime minister gets the first opportunity to form a coalition government.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The main political parties include the Conservative Party led by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, Labour Party led by Keir Starmer, Liberal Democrats led by Ed Davey, Reform UK led by Nigel Farage, Scottish National Party (SNP) led by John Swinney, and the Green Party co-led by Carla Denyer and Adrian Ramsay.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UK votes Thursday to decide whether Labour Party leader Keir Starmer can end 14 years of opposition and win the keys to 10 Downing Street, or whether - somehow - Prime Minister Rishi Sunak can buck the polls and claim what would be an extraordinary turnaround victory.</p>

<p>Pollsters say the question is less about a Labour win than the scale of it. Starmer's party has led the Conservatives by more than 20 points through the 6-week election campaign, according to Bloomberg's poll of polls.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Every so-called MRP survey of the campaign - seen as the gold standard analysis technique - has pointed to a huge Labour majority in the House of Commons, ranging from 162 to 382 seats. All bar the lowest would see Labour win more seats under Starmer than in Tony Blair's 1997 landslide.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Labour leader Keir Starmer hopes to emerge from the elction count as the UKs new prime minister." id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-07/8hq1ir3_keir-starmer-bloomberg_625x300_04_July_24.jpg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="Labour leader Keir Starmer hopes to emerge from the elction count as the UKs new prime minister." /></div>

</div>

<p>The Tories appear on course for a wipeout. One poll projects them winning just 53 seats, down from 365 in 2019; another sees the Liberal Democrats vaulting above the Tories into second and becoming the official opposition. Nigel Farage's decision to stand for his Reform UK party has hurt the Conservatives.</p>

<p>British general elections are decided by separate votes in 650 districts, each with a seat in the House of Commons. A party needs 326 for a majority, though about 320 typically suffices because the speaker and three deputies don't vote, and Northern Ireland's Sinn Fein chooses not to sit in Westminster.</p>

<p>Typically, most constituencies don't change parties in a general election: in 2019, 2017, 2015 and 2010, the number of seats changing hands were 81, 70, 111 and 117. If a Labour landslide materializes, it's likely to be bigger this time: in 1997, 184 constituencies flipped.</p>

<p>Key to interpreting the results is the concept of swing - the vote shift from one party to another compared with the previous election. In special elections since 2019, Labour and the Liberal Democrats have secured a series of historic swings from the Conservatives. This election is complicated by boundary changes, meaning some seats don't map exactly onto the result five years ago.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But the polling points to a seismic moment in which some of the biggest figures in British politics could lose their seats - one survey even has Sunak becoming the first prime minister to suffer that fate.</p>

<p>Below is a list of some key results to watch for and when, using timings on Thursday night and Friday morning provided by the Press Association, and based on seat projections from YouGov's June 11-18 MRP poll.</p>

<p><strong>10 p.m. Thursday</strong><br />
Voting ends and the BBC, Sky and ITV release the official Ipsos exit poll. Last time, it predicted 368 seats for the Conservatives and 191 for Labour - close to the final result of 365 to 203.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>11 p.m.</strong><br />
Constituencies in North East England race to be first to complete their counts. Blyth and Ashington expects to announce results at 11:30 p.m., with Houghton and Sunderland South doing so 15 minutes later.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They're both safe Labour seats and shouldn't provide surprises. Bridget Phillipson, who will hope to be education secretary, is standing in Sunderland and should be the first of Labour's current shadow cabinet to be elected.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Would-be education secretary Bridget Phillipsons seat is one of the first expected to declare results." id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-07/6498urf_bridget-phillipson-bloomberg_625x300_04_July_24.jpg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="Would-be education secretary Bridget Phillipsons seat is one of the first expected to declare results." /></div>

</div>

<p><strong>Midnight</strong><br />
The first Tory loss could be Chairman Richard Holden, who was parachuted in to stand in Basildon and Billericay, where Labour and Reform UK are challenging. Also just after midnight, Labour's first gain from the Tories could be in Broxbourne. Another possible gain, Swindon South, is due at 12:30 a.m.</p>

<p>Labour could then begin to rebuild its so-called red wall - the Brexit-backing traditional Labour seats that switched to the Boris Johnson-led Tories in 2019. Cramlington and Killingworth - a new seat formed largely from the old constituency of Blyth Valley - expects to announce at 12:45 a.m.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>1 a.m. Friday</strong><br />
The bulk of early seats should be Labour holds, but the party's first gain from the Scottish National Party (measured against the 2019 election) is possible in redrawn Rutherglen. Labour took the old seat in a by-election in 2023. Labour once dominated in Scotland, winning 41 of its 59 seats in 2010. In 2019, it won just one - and is banking on gains this time, capitalizing on SNP turmoil.</p>

<p>Labour gains from the Conservatives are possible in Leigh and Atherton and Swindon North. At 1:45 a.m., there's the potential for the Liberal Democrats to make their first gain from the Tories, in Harrogate and Knaresborough.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2 a.m.&nbsp;</strong><br />
If the polls are correct, it's possible the Tories will get to 2 a.m. with no seats. But Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch - also a favorite to succeed Sunak as party leader - should hold hers in North West Essex. The Tories should also defend Castle Point and may retain Havant.</p>

<p>Still, Tory losses to Labour are likely to stack up, with defeats possible in former cabinet minister and right-winger Simon Clarke's Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland. He was the original red-wall Tory, taking his seat in 2017.</p>

<p>Labour will also be looking at Glenrothes and Mid Fife, West Dunbartonshire and Paisley and Renfrewshire South for more gains from the SNP.</p>

<p><strong>2:30 a.m.&nbsp;</strong><br />
House of Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle's seat of Chorley is due to announce, but he's unlikely to face any problems, because he'll be largely unopposed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Labour will be looking to regain the red wall seats of Heywood and Middleton North, Burnley and Bolsover from the Conservatives. Other Labour gains could include Aldershot, the home of the British Army which has always voted Tory.</p>

<p>The Liberal Democrats will hope to wrest Stratford-on-Avon from the Tories, and are also fighting for victory in North East Hampshire - the first so-called blue wall seat likely to declare. YouGov's Patrick English defines the blue wall as Conservative-held areas in the south or east of England that voted Remain in the Brexit referendum and have a higher than average proportion of graduates.</p>

<p>Another seat of interest is Rochdale, a northern town with a large Muslim population where left-winger George Galloway of the Workers Party of Britain won a fractious by-election in February dominated by the Israel-Hamas war.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">

</div>

<p><strong>3 a.m.</strong><br />
More than 100 seats are due to call results at about 3 a.m.</p>

<p>Starmer's party will hope to win back red wall seats Bolton North East, Dudley, Great Grimsby and Cleethorpes, Tipton and Wednesbury and West Bromwich. Another, Blackpool South, voted Tory in 2019 but switched back to Labour in a by-election in May on the third-biggest Tory-to-Labour swing ever.&nbsp;</p>

<p>An announcement is also expected in Islington North, where former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn - ejected from the party by Starmer - is standing as an independent to try to extend his 41-year stint in Parliament.</p>

<p>The Tories could see their first cabinet minister fall. The Liberal Democrats look likely to take Justice Secretary Alex Chalk's blue wall Cheltenham seat, while Transport Secretary Mark Harper may lose to Labour in the Forest of Dean.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other potential blue wall losses include Romsey and Southampton North to the Liberal Democrats and the wealthy London district of Chelsea and Fulham to Labour. In Newark, former cabinet minister Robert Jenrick - who's been touted as a potential Tory leader - may lose to Labour.</p>

<p><strong>3:15 a.m.</strong><br />
The Greens hope to win their second-ever seat in the House of Commons. Co-leader Carla Denyer mounted a strong campaign in Bristol Central, where would-be culture secretary Thangam Debbonaire could suffer a rare Labour loss.</p>

<p>The blue wall seats of Stroud and Witney - the latter was once held by ex-premier David Cameron - may fall to Labour and the Liberal Democrats respectively. Tory Chief Whip Simon Hart could be defeated by the Welsh nationalist Plaid Cymru party in Caerfyrddin, while Labour are hoping to regain the red wall seat of Scunthorpe, and Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey's constituency of Kingston and Surbiton is also due to announce.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>3:30 a.m.</strong><br />
Another 100-odd seats are due to announce, with several Conservatives big beasts at risk of defeat. Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt could become the most senior minister ever to lose their seat, with Godalming and Ash potentially falling to the Liberal Democrats. Davey's party could also take Education Secretary Gillian Keegan's Chichester seat, while Health Secretary Victoria Atkins is under threat from Reform UK in Louth and Horncastle.</p>

<p>Tory leadership hopefuls Defence Secretary Grant Shapps and Leader of the House of Commons Penny Mordaunt could be defeated by Labour in Welwyn Hatfield and Portsmouth North. Starmer's party is also looking to win back red wall seats including Gedling, Hyndburn, Rother Valley and Wolverhampton North East. Blue wall losses for the Tories could include Esher and Walton to the Liberal Democrats and Harrow East to Labour.</p>

<p>There's interest in Dover and Deal, a seat on the front line of UK immigration pressure where right-winger Natalie Elphicke was elected as a Conservative in 2019. She defected to Labour in May and isn't standing this time. Rachel Reeves, in line to be the first female chancellor, should win Leeds West and Pudsey, a new seat combining her former constituency and a Tory-held one.</p>

<p>In Scotland, more gains from the SNP are possible for Labour in Glasgow East, Inverclyde and Renfrewshire West, and Cumbernauld and Kirkintilloch.</p>

<p><strong>3:45 a.m.</strong><br />
Tamworth - which Labour won in an October by-election on what was at the time the second-biggest-ever swing from the Tories - may be a rare loss for the opposition party, going back to the Conservatives. But Labour will hope to take Redditch and Ribble Valley from the Tories, while the Liberal Democrats are gunning for the blue wall seat of Wimbledon as well as Tory-held Carshalton and Wallington, both in south London.</p>

<p><strong>4 a.m.</strong><br />
The halfway mark in terms of number of seats to declare, with more than 120 constituencies expecting to announce.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some MRP polls see Sunak losing Richmond and Northallerton to Labour, a result that would define the Tory collapse. Expect some words from him reflecting on how the election is panning out - and possibly even a concession. In Braintree, Home Secretary James Cleverly faces a Labour threat, though a more likely loser is Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride in Central Devon.</p>

<p>One of the biggest questions of the night should be answered in Clacton, where Brexit architect Nigel Farage looks set to win a seat in the House of Commons at his eighth attempt. His Reform UK could also win Boston and Skegness, where the man Farage replaced as leader, Richard Tice, is standing.</p>

<p>The Tories also face losing the blue wall seats of Beckenham and Penge and Hertford and Stortford to Labour, and East Hampshire, Guildford, Harpenden and Berkhamsted, South Cotswolds and Woking to the Liberal Democrats.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Labour is seeking to win back red wall seats from the Tories including Newton Aycliffe and Spennymoor, which includes the bulk of Tony Blair's old constituency, as well as Penistone and Stocksbridge, Birmingham Northfield, and Bishop Auckland. Another seat to watch is Birmingham Ladywood, where Labour insiders see would-be justice secretary Shabana Mahmood coming under pressure from an independent candidate.</p>

<p><strong>4:15 a.m.</strong><br />
Starmer should win easily in Holborn and St. Pancras in north London, and if the polling is correct, Labour will be also close to securing its overall majority. He's likely to give a speech pointing to the challenges ahead for the country.</p>

<p>Boris Johnson's old seat of Uxbridge and South Ruislip, which the Tories narrowly held in a by-election last year, is expected to fall to Labour.</p>

<p><strong>4:30 a.m.&nbsp;</strong><br />
If the MRP projections by YouGov, which pioneered the technique in the 2017 election, are correct, then Labour is expected to reach the magic number of 326 amid a flurry of 60 or so seat announcements at about 4:30 a.m.</p>

<p>Potential Tory losses to Labour include former Business Secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg's North East Somerset and Hanham seat, and Worthing West, where Peter Bottomley, the longest-standing MP and so-called father of the House of Commons, is seeking to extend a tenure that began in 1975.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cabinet minister David Davies may lose out to Labour in Monmouthshire, with Starmer's party also hoping to pick up the blue wall Tory seats of Kensington and Bayswater and Milton Keynes North.</p>

<p>Retiring Tory grandee Michael Gove's old seat of Surrey Heath looks set to go to the Liberal Democrats, as is the archetypal middle England seat of Tunbridge Wells.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Ashfield, former Tory and Labour politician Lee Anderson is a potential winner for Reform UK. Another minor party success looks nailed-on in Brighton Pavilion, where the Greens are standing a new candidate - former London mayor candidate Sian Berry - to replace the party's first ever MP, former leader Caroline Lucas, who's held the constituency since 2010.</p>

<p><strong>5 a.m.</strong><br />
By now the overall result should be clear - unless the polls were wrong.</p>

<p>Cabinet casualties are possible in Banbury, which Conservative Attorney General Victoria Prentis may lose to Labour, and in Ely and East Cambridgeshire, where Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer is under pressure from the Liberal Democrats. Veterans minister Johnny Mercer, who attends cabinet, faces defeat to Labour in Plymouth Moor View.</p>

<p>Labour wants Tory blue wall seats including Earley and Woodley, Filton and Bradley Stoke, Truro and Falmouth and North Somerset and Hitchin, where City Minister Bim Afolami is standing. Red wall seats they're looking to win back include Doncaster East and the Isle of Axholme, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Ossett and Denby Dale and Stoke-on-Trent's three constituencies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Liberal Democrats are eying up the blue wall seats of Lewes, Newbury, Winchester and Maidenhead, which was vacated after 27 years by retiring former Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May.</p>

<p><strong>5:30 a.m.</strong><br />
Blink-and-you-miss-her ex-premier Liz Truss is expected to hold South West Norfolk, though it may be close. Security minister Tom Tugendhat could be one of the few Tory leadership contenders to keep his seat in Tonbridge.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Former Prime Minister Liz Truss may face a tight race in her seat in Norfolk." id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-07/e6ifpuk_liz-truss-bloomberg_625x300_04_July_24.jpg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="Former Prime Minister Liz Truss may face a tight race in her seat in Norfolk." /></div>

<p>Labour hopes to win the blue wall seats of Chipping Barnet and Hendon, while the Liberal Democrats are targeting Didcot and Wantage. Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner's safe seat of Ashton-under-Lyne is also due to declare.</p>

<p>6 a.m.<br />
The last few results dribble in. The Liberal Democrats look set to hold Chesham and Amersham, which they won in a by-election in 2021 on a huge swing from the Tories in what was Boris Johnson's first major electoral setback as prime minister. They could also take Wokingham, and Henley and Thame - Johnson's old constituency from the days before he was London mayor.</p>

<p>Labour will hope to cap off their expected victory by taking the blue wall seats of Croydon South and Wycombe from ministers Chris Philp and Steve Baker.</p>

<p><strong>6:30 a.m.&nbsp;</strong><br />
The final declarations are expected to include Ilford North, the seat held by Labour's prospective health secretary Wes Streeting.</p>

<p>Once all the results are in, the focus will switch to the change of government - if the expected Labour win has materialized. Sunak is likely to head to Buckingham Palace to tender his resignation to King Charles III. Then it's Starmer's turn, and the King will invite him to form a new government.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Labour leader Keir Starmer dismissed as "desperate" Rishi Sunak's last-gasp efforts to stoke fears about the opposition party winning a huge majority at Thursday's UK election, with the Prime Minister's campaign turning increasingly frantic as it sought to avert a crushing Conservative defeat.</p>

<p>Two days out from the vote, PM Sunak ramped up attacks on Labour and warned that typical Conservative voters staying home could hand Starmer a result in line with current opinion polls which project him securing a parliamentary majority of more than 200 seats. That would mean the incoming government would have a "blank check" to do what it likes, Sunak said.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">'I don't want people to sleepwalk into that'<br />
<br />
Rishi Sunak told <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BBCBreakfast?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BBCBreakfast</a> he's concerned about a 'Labour supermajority' with less than 48 hours to go until polls open in the General Election<a href="https://t.co/2pmWZBN0m3">https://t.co/2pmWZBN0m3</a> <a href="https://t.co/8MweIKxAVt">pic.twitter.com/8MweIKxAVt</a></p>
— BBC Breakfast (@BBCBreakfast) <a href="https://twitter.com/BBCBreakfast/status/1808043738146423198?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 2, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>While Mr Sunak denied he's given up on victory, the Tories have pivoted in the past two weeks to issuing warnings about the scale of a Labour victory - an apparent concession that the governing party is not going to win after a succession of surveys deploying seat-by-seat analysis projected the opposition is heading for a victory of historic proportions. In all, 10 of 11 so-called MRP polls project Labour will take more seats than in Tony Blair's landslide in 1997.</p>

<p>The polls - and Labour's stubborn 20-point lead that's budged little over the campaign - highlight how little the Tories' initial messaging around sticking with Sunak's plan cut through with voters. The last campaign days appear now to be an exercise in damage limitation, geared toward convincing former Tory supporters who are either considering not voting or backing Nigel Farage's right-wing Reform UK party to turn out on Thursday and vote Conservative.</p>

<p>In a video on Sunak's X social media account, the Tory campaign suggested a Labour government would crash the FTSE 100 and cause energy blackouts. Yet Bloomberg reporting shows investors increasingly see the UK as a safe haven due to political and economic stability brought by a change of government.</p>

<p>Throughout Tuesday, the Tories have also attacked Starmer over comments he made to Virgin Radio, that he blocks out appointments after 6 pm on Fridays to spend time with his family. Starmer's wife comes from a Jewish family, and the Labour leader has spoken about the importance of their Friday evenings.</p>

<p>Even so, prominent Tories took aim at Starmer's remarks. Defense Secretary Grant Shapps accused him of planning to be a "part-time prime minister" while minister Maria Caulfield told broadcasters Starmer wanted to work a four-day week - something the Labour leader did not say.</p>

<p>"It really is desperate. My family's really important to me as they will be to every single person watching this," Starmer told reporters on his own campaign visit. "It's increasing desperation bordering on hysterical now."</p>

<p>The Conservative attacks, which were widely criticized by leaders in Britain's Jewish community, come despite Sunak saying just two weeks ago that he admired Starmer for ensuring he has family time.</p>

<p>"He does a very good job of balancing family life and work life and making sure that he prioritizes that and makes time for it," Mr Sunak told LBC radio then.</p>

<p>Asked by Bloomberg if he endorsed the comments by his campaign alleging Starmer would not be able to defend the country because he'd finish work at 6 pm, Mr Sunak replied: "I do worry about our country's security under Keir Starmer and I have deep concerns about it."</p>

<p>Yet the overall vibe is of a campaigning running out of ideas to try to close the polling gap to Labour.</p>

<p>Tory leaflets warn of "French-style union laws," national road charging and more money spent on welfare benefits. That's despite Labour saying changes to working rights will be carried out in communication with business, pledging to get people off benefits and into work, and having announced no plans for national pay-per-mile charging on roads.</p>

<p>On the BBC, the premier warned that "illegal migrants will be out on the street" if Labour wins, and that asylum-seekers were "queuing up" at Calais in northern France, waiting for a Starmer government before attempting to cross the English Channel in small boats. That's despite the Channel crossings through the end of June reaching a record for the first six months of the year.</p>

<p>Labour has denied any plan to raise taxes, insisting it will not put up any on "working people" and categorically ruling out rises to income tax, the national insurance payroll tax, corporation tax and valued-added tax. The party has also accused Mr Sunak of lying to the public about their policies on borders and the work ethic of their would-be premier.</p>

<p>The "stench of their lies and hypocrisy" is "overwhelming," Shadow Health Secretary Wes Streeting said on social media.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UK Elections 2024 has boiled down to a close fight between the incumbent Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and the Labour Party's Keir Starmer. However, there are some other big faces who could be influential in the UK Polls this time.</p>

<p>Here are the key contenders in UK Elections 2024:</p>

<p><strong>1. Rishi Sunak:</strong></p>

<p>The 44-year-old British PM of Indian descent has some of the lowest approval ratings. His conservative party is up against Keir Starmer's labour party this time. Sunak has failed to meet promises, including cutting health waiting lists and stopping irregular immigration, though immigration is one of the key issues influencing the UK Polls this time.</p>

</div>

<p><strong>2. Keir Starmer:</strong></p>

<p>Opinion polls expect Keir Starmer to replace Sunak as the British PM. Starmer succeeded left-winger Jeremy Corbyn as the Labour Party's Leader in 2020.</p>

</div>

<p><strong>3. Nigel Farage:</strong></p>

<p>Nigel Farage, of the right-wing Reform Party in the UK, was involved in a racism scandal.&nbsp;Farage got the nickname "Mr Brexit" from former US president Donald Trump as he helped to persuade a majority of Britons in 2016 to vote to leave the European Union.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"></div>

<p><strong>4. John Swinney:</strong></p>

<p>John Swinney does not hold a seat in the UK Parliament. But he was the first minister in the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Swinney leads the Scottish National Party which is fighting the Labour Party." id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-07/gl0b8j9g_john-swinney-ndtv-_625x300_04_July_24.jpg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="Swinney leads the Scottish National Party which is fighting the Labour Party." /></div>

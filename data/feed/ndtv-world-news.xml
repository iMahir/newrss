       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>YouTuber Jack Doherty crashed his $200,000 McLaren sports car during a livestream this weekend after seemingly looking at his phone while driving in the rain. Mr Doherty, 20, who has nearly 15 million subscribers, is known for his controversial prank videos and displays of wealth. He was streaming the incident on Kick, where his channel was later banned following the crash.</p>

<p>A clip circulating online appeared to show Mr Doherty speeding on a wet highway while glancing at his phone before shouting, "No, no, no!" as he lost control of the car and crashed into a guardrail.</p>

<p>Mr Doherty also shared videos of the aftermath, including one of him calling for help from inside the vehicle. In the clip, he asked a bystander to hold the camera as others pulled him out of the window.</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p></p>

<p>Viewers criticized Mr Doherty for seemingly showing more concern for his wrecked McLaren than for his injured cameraman, who remained in the passenger seat clutching his arm and bleeding from the head.</p>

<p>A user wrote, "Your friend's face is gushing blood but you make sure he stays filming from all angles.... nice."</p>

<p>Another user wrote, "I don't know who this idiot is but if you're whining about your car on video for likes while a person in the car is hurt and bleeding you're a garbage person."</p>

<p>"You were looking at your phone while driving, reading your chat. Let's be honest, you weren't concerned about your friend at all. You just kept crying about the car and when your friend asked where he was bleeding from, you repeatedly ignored him and made him keep filming you," the third user wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p></p>

<p>Mr Doherty later posted a video from a hospital room, where his cameraman was getting stitches. Some noted he didn't re-upload the full footage showing his actions leading up to the crash.</p>

<p>A separate clip showed Mr Doherty lamenting his damaged car while handing the camera to his injured cameraman, asking him to continue filming.</p>

<p>This isn't Mr Doherty's first on-camera crash. In March, he flipped his new Can-Am off-road vehicle shortly after getting it, and in November, he crashed a golf cart with his girlfriend inside, flipping it toward her, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/influencer-jack-doherty-crashes-200k-mclaren-driving-livestream-rcna174183" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>NBC </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Doherty had purchased the now-totaled McLaren for over $200,000 last year, just weeks after buying a Lamborghini and a Tesla. In a video posted at the time, he joked that he would "crash this car, mark my words."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="theconversation-article-title">What do you imagine a good night's sleep to be?</p>

<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>Often when people come into our sleep clinic seeking treatment, they share ideas about healthy sleep.</p>

<p>Many think when their head hits the pillow, they should fall into a deep and restorative sleep, and emerge after about eight hours feeling refreshed. They're in good company – many Australians hold <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2014.09.011">the same belief</a>.</p>

<p>In reality, healthy sleep is cyclic across the night, as you move in and out of the different stages of sleep, often waking up several times. Some people remember one or more of these awakenings, others do not. Let's consider what a healthy night's sleep looks like.</p>

<p>Adults usually move through five or six sleep cycles in a night, and it is entirely <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2014.09.011">normal</a> to wake up briefly at the end of each one. That means we might be waking up five times during the night. This can increase with older age and still be healthy. If you're not remembering these awakenings that's OK – they can be quite brief.</p>

<h3><strong>What does getting a ‘good' sleep actually mean?</strong></h3>

<p>You'll often hear that adults <a href="https://www.sleephealthfoundation.org.au/sleep-topics/how-much-sleep-do-you-really-need#:%7E:text=Sleep%20requirements%20stabilise%20in%20early,their%20best%20the%20next%20day">need between seven and nine hours</a> of sleep per night. But good sleep is about more than the number of hours – it's also about the quality.</p>

<p>For most people, sleeping well means being able to fall asleep soon after getting into bed (within around 30 minutes), sleeping without waking up for long periods, and waking feeling rested and ready for the day.</p>

<p>You shouldn't be feeling excessively sleepy during the day, especially if you're regularly getting at least seven hours of refreshing sleep a night (this is a rough rule of thumb).</p>

<p>But are you noticing you're feeling physically tired, needing to nap regularly and still not feeling refreshed? It may be worthwhile touching base with your general practitioner, as there a range of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/screen-time-in-bed-is-worse-than-screen-time-before-bed-study-6488051">possible reasons</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>Common issues</strong></h3>

<p>Sleep disorders are common. Up to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35478719/">25% of adults</a> have insomnia, a sleep disorder where it may be hard to fall or stay asleep, or you may wake earlier in the morning than you'd like.</p>

<p>Rates of common sleep disorders such as insomnia and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sleep-apnea/symptoms-causes/syc-20377631">sleep apnoea</a> – where your breathing can partially or completely stop many times during the night – also increase with age, affecting <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32280974/">20% of early adults</a> and 40% of people in <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35082023/">middle age</a>. There are effective treatments, so asking for help is important.</p>

<p>Beyond sleep disorders, our sleep can also be disrupted by chronic health conditions – such as <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012369218311139">pain</a> – and by <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsr.13075">certain medications</a>.</p>

<p>There can also be other reasons we're not sleeping well. Some of us are woken by children, pets or traffic noise during the night. These “<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07420528.2021.2003375">forced awakenings</a>” mean we may find it harder to get up in the morning, take longer to leave bed and feel less satisfied with our sleep. For some people, night awakenings may have no clear cause.</p>

<p>A good way to tell if these awakenings are a problem for you is by thinking about how they affect you. When they cause feelings of frustration or worry, or are impacting how we feel and function during the day, it might be a sign to seek some help.</p>

<p>We also may struggle to get up in the morning. This could be for a range of reasons, including not sleeping long enough, going to bed or waking up at irregular times – or even your own <a href="https://www.sleephealthfoundation.org.au/sleep-categories/circadian-rhythm-disorders#:%7E:text=The%20circadian%20rhythms%20throughout%20the,regulation%20of%20our%20sleeping%20patterns">internal clock</a>, which can influence the time your body prefers to sleep.</p>

<p>If you're regularly struggling to get up for work or family needs, it can be an indication you may need to seek help. Some of these factors can be explored with a sleep psychologist if they are causing concern.</p>

<h3><strong>Can my smart watch help?</strong></h3>

<p>It is important to remember that sleep-tracking devices can <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-024-01016-9">vary in accuracy</a> for looking at the different sleep stages. While they can give a rough estimate, they are not a perfect measure.</p>

<p>In-laboratory <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31277862/">polysomnography</a>, or PSG, is the best standard measure to examine your sleep stages. A PSG examines breathing, oxygen saturation, brain waves and heart rate during sleep.</p>

<p>Rather than closely examining nightly data (including sleep stages) from a sleep tracker, it may be more helpful to look at the patterns of your sleep (bed and wake times) over time.</p>

<p><a href="https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.8356">Understanding your sleep patterns</a> may help identify and adjust behaviours that negatively impact your sleep, such as your bedtime routine and sleeping environment.</p>

<p>And if you find viewing your sleep data is making you feel worried about your sleep, this may not be useful for you. Most importantly, if you are concerned it is important to discuss it with your GP who can refer you to the appropriate specialist sleep health provider.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hurricane Milton exploded in strength Monday to become a potentially catastrophic Category 5 storm bound for Florida, threatening the US state with a second ferocious hurricane in as many weeks.</p>

<p>The back-to-back hurricanes have whipped up a US election storm, with Vice President Kamala Harris slamming her White House rival Donald Trump and Florida's Republican governor Ron DeSantis for "political gamesmanship" and for spreading misinformation about the federal response.</p>

<p>Milton, which is forecast to batter Mexico's Yucatan peninsula as it churns eastward, rapidly intensified to the highest category on a scale of five, triggering evacuation orders and warnings of savage conditions on Florida's west coast.</p>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/33-dead-in-us-from-hurricane-helene-officials-6666374">National Hurricane Center (NHC)</a> said the storm's maximum sustained winds were near 180 miles (285 kilometres) per hour, and that air pressure at the centre of the storm was at a "near record low."</p>

<p>Communities hit by Hurricane <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/hurricane-helene-rips-through-florida-town-people-left-to-start-from-scratch-6681187">Helene</a>, which slammed Florida late last month, raced to remove debris that could become dangerous projectiles as Milton barrels in.</p>

<p>"Last time, people's cars were underwater... but the bigger issue this time is going to be the wind," said David Levitsky, a retired homeowner on Treasure Island, in Pinellas County.</p>

<p>Residents on the low-lying island have been piling up debris from Helene's flooding in their front yards for removal.</p>

<p>"All this stuff is just wind fodder that's going to just be blowing down the street and hitting who knows what," the 69-year-old told AFP.</p>

<p>Amid the wreckage, DeSantis, a conservative known to clash with the federal government, found himself under fire after broadcaster NBC reported he was ignoring phone calls from Harris on the Helene recovery.</p>

<p>DeSantis did speak to President Joe Biden about the preparations, the White House said late Monday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Harris slammed the Republican governor for "playing political games."</p>

<p>"It is about political gamesmanship, instead of doing the job you took an oath to do, which is to put the people first," she told reporters, while also criticizing Trump as "extraordinarily irresponsible."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The former president has tapped into real frustration about the federal response after Helene and fueled it with disinformation, falsely claiming federal disaster money had been misappropriated and spent instead on migrants.</p>

<h3><strong>Worst hit in 100 years&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>As Milton barreled toward Florida, state authorities have issued mandatory evacuation orders for areas including some parts of Tampa, a metropolitan area of more than three million people that could take a direct hit.</p>

<p>"If the storm stays on the current track, it will be the worst storm to impact the Tampa area in over 100 years," the National Weather Service said.</p>

<p>A major storm surge for Florida's west coast is forecast for Tuesday night or early Wednesday, and Tampa could suffer an influx of water between eight and 12 feet (2.4 to 3.6 meters) above ground level.</p>

<p>Rainfall of 10 inches (25 centimetres), with localized spots of up to 15 inches, is expected to cause severe flash flooding.</p>

<p>In the central city of Orlando, under grey skies, hundreds of cars lined up to collect sandbags.</p>

<p>"We might<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/after-helene-florida-orders-evacuations-as-hurricane-milton-strengthens-6736892"> evacuate</a>, me and my pets, we might go to Georgia," Tony Carlson, 32, told AFP. "People think it's going to be pretty bad."</p>

<p>Maria Torres, 29, said her family was not planning to leave but had prepared with a generator, food and water.</p>

<p>In Mexico's Yucatan, workers boarded up glass doors and windows, fishermen hauled boats ashore and schools were suspended.</p>

<p>In the southeastern United States, emergency workers are still struggling to provide relief in the aftermath of Helene, which killed at least 230 people across several states.</p>

<p>Helene hit the Florida coastline on September 26 as a Category 4 hurricane, dumping rain and causing massive flooding in remote inland towns in states further north, including North Carolina and Tennessee.</p>

<p>Deanne Criswell, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), also dismissed the claims about money being diverted to migrants as false and slammed the misinformation as "dangerous."</p>

<p>She warned Monday that "these storms are bringing more water than they ever have and so while we have the wind risk, the water is what's killing people."</p>

<p>Researchers say climate change likely plays a role in the rapid intensification of hurricanes because there is more energy in warmer oceans for them to feed on.</p>

<p>Helene was the deadliest natural disaster to hit the US mainland since 2005's Hurricane Katrina, with the death toll still rising.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Passengers aboard a flight to Tokyo last week got more inflight entertainment than they bargained for last week when an explicit film featuring sex talk and explicit images was broadcast to every screen.</p>

<p>Technical problems meant individual movie selection was not available on a Qantas flight from Sydney to Haneda, leaving the crew to pick one film to be broadcast to the whole cabin.</p>

<p>Their selection of Dakota Johnson and Sean Penn's racy drama "Daddio" was a surprise to many, and to the airline, which apologised Tuesday.</p>

<p>According to one review, the movie features "references to oral sex, masturbation" as well as a "brief but clear photo of erect penis on phone screen. Photos of a woman's naked breasts. Explicit sex-related dialogue and texting".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The movie was clearly not suitable to play for the whole flight and we sincerely apologise to customers for this experience," a Qantas spokesperson said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once the mistake was clear, "all screens were changed to a family-friendly movie for the rest of the flight," Qantas added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We are reviewing how the movie was selected."&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Widespread anger among Arab Americans and Muslims over US support for Israel's wars in Gaza and Lebanon could cost Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, the election, Green Party candidate Jill Stein told Reuters on Sunday.</p>

<p>Polls show Harris and her Republican rival, former President Donald Trump, in a tight race for the Nov. 5 election, with Stein garnering just 1% support nationally, as she did in the 2016 election.</p>

<p>But Stein has seen growing support among Arab Americans and Muslims in battleground states like Michigan, Arizona and Wisconsin where they have large populations that helped propel President Joe Biden to narrow victories in the 2020 election.</p>

<p>Stein has sought the support of those groups, calling for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and an immediate US arms embargo on Israel. An August poll by the Council on American Islamic Relations showed her taking support away from Harris in those swing states.</p>

<p>"The Democrats have lost the Muslim American and the Arab American vote," Stein told Reuters after a rally attended by about 100 people in the Detroit suburb of Dearborn on Sunday. "They're going to be losing enough swing states that they will not win and they cannot win."</p>

<p>She said Democrats could win back those voters if they enacted an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon, and halted arms sales to Israel, but that there was no sign of such action.</p>

<p>The Biden administration, along with several US allies like France, has called for an immediate 21-day ceasefire across the Israel-Lebanon border and has been trying, unsuccessfully, to negotiate a ceasefire in Gaza for months.</p>

<p>Asked about her potential role as a "spoiler," taking votes from Harris and so helping Trump in those states, Stein said another Trump presidency would be "terrible" but so would four more years of Democratic rule, given high rental costs, the wars in Gaza and Lebanon, and attacks on civil liberties.</p>

<p>"This is a very dire situation that will be continued under both Democrats and Republicans. So we say there is no lesser evil in this race," she said.</p>

<p>The Democratic party called Stein "a spoiler candidate" with no path to victory.</p>

<p>"She put Donald Trump in the White House in<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/defying-donald-trump-green-party-pursues-recounts-in-3-us-states-1634416"> 2016 </a>and she's ready to do it<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/wisconsin-narrowly-won-by-donald-trump-agrees-to-recount-us-presidential-votes-1630415"> again</a>. A vote for Stein is a vote for Trump," said Adrienne Watson, senior adviser to the Democratic National Committee.</p>

<p>Harris has sought to ease the concerns of Arab American and Muslim voters, and met with a small group of local leaders in Flint, Michigan, on Friday.</p>

<p>Muslim advocacy group Emgage Action endorsed Harris last month, saying it disagreed with her position on the war in Gaza but that Trump posed a greater danger. A separate group called Arab Americans for Harris-Walz launched last week.</p>

<p>On Monday, a campaign group called "Abandon Harris" said it was endorsing Stein, citing a shared responsibility to stand against oppression "and using all our power to stop genocide - wherever it may arise."</p>

<p>Trump is also trying to woo Arab and Muslim voters and his campaign opened an office on Saturday in Hamtramck, a Detroit suburb whose Yemeni American mayor Amer Ghalib has endorsed him.</p>

<p>"For the Arab American and Muslim leaders in Detroit, the overwhelming choice is between Jill Stein and Donald Trump, and our argument is that there's only one person who's brought permanent peace to the region, and that's Donald Trump," said Richard Grenell, who has held dozens of meetings with these voters in Michigan, Arizona and other critical states.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democratic White House hopeful Kamala Harris said in an interview broadcast Monday that if elected president she would not meet with Vladimir Putin for peace talks if Ukraine was not also represented.</p>

<p>"Not bilaterally without Ukraine, no. Ukraine must have a say in the future of Ukraine," the US vice president told CBS's "60 Minutes" program when asked if she would meet one-on-one with the Russian leader to negotiate an end to the war.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden's administration has previously rejected any talks with Putin.</p>

<p>Harris also reiterated her criticisms of Republican rival Donald <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/harris-trump-face-off-for-first-time-in-key-us-presidential-debate-6537401">Trump's policies</a> on Ukraine, describing them as a "surrender" to the invasion Moscow launched in February 2022.</p>

<p>Trump has previously been critical of Washington's massive military and financial aid for Ukraine and insisted that he could quickly reach a peace deal with Putin.</p>

<p>"Donald Trump, if he were president, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/putin-should-stop-interfering-in-us-elections-white-house-6499064">Putin</a> would be sitting in Kyiv right now. He talks about, 'Oh, he can end it on day one.' You know what that is? It's about surrender," she said.</p>

<p>Kyiv fears such a deal would involve ceding to Russia the territory in eastern Ukraine that it has captured since the invasion.</p>

<p>Harris meanwhile said she would deal with Ukraine's bid to join the NATO military alliance "if and when it arrives at that point."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk is ramping up his public support of Donald Trump, telling Tucker Carlson in a conversation streamed Monday that he is "all in" on the Republican presidential candidate.</p>

<p>After appearing alongside Trump at a weekend rally, the world's richest man used a cosy two-hour chat with Carlson to push right-wing talking points, including what he said was the threat to democracy if Democrat Kamala Harris prevails in November's election.</p>

<p>"My view is that <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/elon-musk-donald-trump-pennsylvania-butler-assassination-site-2024-us-presidential-elections-6726322">if Trump doesn't win</a> this election, it's the last election we're going to have," the Tesla and SpaceX boss told former Fox News host Carlson.</p>

<p>Musk, who has increasingly courted controversy in recent years, said he believed "illegals" -- migrants -- were being deliberately transported to a handful of key states, where if they are eventually granted citizenship, they will become Democrat voters.</p>

<p>"Now these swing-state margins are sometimes ten- twenty-thousand votes. So what happens if you put hundreds of thousands of people into each swing state?</p>

<p>"So my prediction is, if there's another four years of a Dem administration, they will legalize so many illegals that... the next election there won't be any swing states, and this will be a single-party country."</p>

<p>The assertions from <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-to-return-to-shooting-site-in-pennsylvania-elon-musk-to-attend-6712802">Musk</a> -- who is himself from South Africa -- are a common refrain on the political right, which alleges a conspiracy between Democrats and immigrants.</p>

<p>Musk is<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-presidential-elections-2024-elon-musk-changes-x-display-picture-to-show-support-for-donald-trump-6726978"> increasingly becoming</a> a surrogate for Trump on the campaign trail and is reportedly planning to make a number of stops in battleground states in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Over the weekend, he unveiled a program promising to pay $47 to anyone who registers voters in Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin and Michigan.</p>

<p>The scheme is looking to copy successful referral programs the South African-born entrepreneur has used in the past with his Tesla electric cars.</p>

<p>In his nearly two-hour chat with Carlson, in which the two men chuckled repeatedly at each other's pronouncements, Musk said he had thrown his <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/elon-musk-secretly-funded-right-wing-group-long-before-donald-trump-endorsement-sources-6706711">full backing</a> behind fellow billionaire Trump.</p>

<p>"If he loses, it's going to be hard for you to pretend you never supported him," said Carlson.</p>

<p>"I'm like, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/if-elected-to-power-will-appoint-elon-musk-to-lead-us-government-efficiency-panel-donald-trump-6500930">all in</a>, baby," replied Musk.</p>

<p>"How long do you think my prison sentence is gonna be?" he chortled, laughing at the idea that the tables would turn against him under a Democratic administration. "Will I see my children? I don't know."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A US judge on Monday ordered Google to open its Android smartphone operating system to rival app stores, in a fresh legal setback for the tech giant.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US judge on Monday ordered Google to open its Android smartphone operating system to rival app stores, in a fresh legal setback for the tech giant.</p>

<p>The order is the result of Google's defeat in an antitrust case brought by Fortnite-maker Epic Games, where a California jury decided that Google wields illegal monopoly power through its Android Play store.</p>

<p>The San Francisco jury in December took just a few hours to decide against Google, finding that the company had embarked on various illegal strategies to maintain its app store monopoly on Android phones.</p>

<p>The order, which Google is appealing, follows a similar setback in August when a different judge found that Google's world-leading search engine was also an illegal monopoly.</p>

<p>Google is also facing an antitrust lawsuit in a third federal case in Virginia over its dominance of online advertising.</p>

<p>Under the Epic Games order, for the next three years Google will be prohibited from engaging in several practices that were deemed anticompetitive by the jury in the landmark case.</p>

<p>These prohibitions include revenue sharing with potential competitors and requirements that developers launch apps exclusively on the Play Store.</p>

<p>The judge has also ordered the creation of a three-person Technical Committee to oversee the implementation of the changes and resolve any disputes that may arise.</p>

<p>This injunction represents a significant challenge to Google's dominance in the Android app ecosystem and could reshape the mobile app landscape in the coming years.</p>

<p>Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney urged companies to seize this opportunity "to build a vibrant and competitive Android ecosystem with such critical mass that Google can't stop it."</p>

<p>He also underlined that the changes would only be applicable in the US, but pledged that "the legal and regulatory battle will continue around the world."</p>

<p><strong>- Google appeals -</strong></p>

<p>Google said it would appeal the injunction and also demand that it be set aside pending the outcome of its continued legal challenge.</p>

<p>The judge said the order was effective November 1, with some provisions given until July 1 to be implemented.</p>

<p>"We will keep advocating for what is best for developers, device manufacturers and the billions of Android users around the world," said Lee-Anne Mulholland, the company's regulatory affairs vice president.</p>

<p>Phones running on the Android operating system have about a 70 percent share of the world's smartphone market.</p>

<p>Smartphone companies can install the Android app for free under the condition that the Play app store remains on the home page and that other Google offers are pre-installed.</p>

<p>The jury found that Google worked illegally to make sure that the Google Play app store was the only conduit for making payments to third party apps such as Fortnite and other games.</p>

<p>A sizable chunk of app store revenue comes from video games, and Epic Games has long sought to have payments for its mobile games, such as Fortnite, take place outside the Google or Apple app stores that take commissions as high as 30 percent.</p>

<p>Epic mostly lost a similar case against Apple, where a different US judge largely ruled in favor of the iPhone-maker.</p>

<p>Apple and Google regularly argue that their app shop commissions are industry-standard, and that they pay for benefits such as reach, transaction security and ferreting out malware.</p>

<p>Google also argued that the arrangement with smartphone makers helped Android-run devices better compete against Apple's iPhone.</p>

<p>But the trial exposed that Google rakes in tens of billions of dollars of revenue through the app store.</p>

<p>In order to preserve its one-stop-shop for apps, Google paid smartphone makers a cut of its revenue in return for the Play store remaining the exclusive gateway.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, at an official memorial marking the anniversary of October 7 attack Monday, vowed to press on fighting until achieving the "sacred mission" of the war against Hamas.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel on Monday battled on multiple fronts, intensifying its fight with Lebanon's Hezbollah as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to press the "sacred mission" against Israel's enemies, on the first anniversary of the deadliest attack in Israeli history.</p>

<p>Hamas said it will be a long fight, but Netanyahu said both wars would ensure the violence Israel endured last October 7 could never be repeated.</p>

<p>Israel's military said air defences intercepted a missile fired from Yemen, while in the West Bank, Palestinian officials reported a deadly Israeli raid.</p>

<p>Tehran, which arms and finances Hezbollah and backs the Yemeni rebels, hailed Hamas's October 7 attack as Iran awaits what Israel said will be retaliation for an Iranian missile barrage on Israel last week.</p>

<p>"As long as the enemy threatens our existence and the peace of our country, we will continue to fight. As long as our hostages are still in Gaza, we will continue to fight," Netanyahu said in a pre-recorded television address, vowing not to give up on the "sacred mission" of achieving the war's goals.</p>

<p>Pope Francis condemned the "shameful inability" of world powers to end the Middle East conflict, and European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the region is "on the verge of a complete conflagration".</p>

<p>Abu Obeida, spokesman for Hamas's armed wing, said the movement chooses "to keep up the fight in a long war of attrition, one that is painful and costly for the enemy".</p>

<p>He also said scores of people taken hostage into Gaza last October 7 were enduring a "very difficult" situation.</p>

<p><strong>- Thousands of militants killed -</strong></p>

<p>A senior Hamas official has acknowledged that "several thousand fighters from the movement and other resistance groups died in combat".</p>

<p>When the Gaza war began, Netanyahu vowed to "crush" Hamas, but troops have found themselves returning again to areas to confront signs the movement was trying to rebuild.</p>

<p>Netanyahu has vowed to bring home the hostages, but critics in Israel have accused him of obstructing mediation for a truce and hostage-release deal.</p>

<p>Late last month Israel turned its focus north towards Hezbollah, with intensified air strikes in Lebanon and, since last week, "targeted" ground raids.</p>

<p>Netanyahu says the aim is to ensure tens of thousands of Israelis forced to flee Hezbollah fire can return home safely.</p>

<p>On Monday the military said it would expand its operations against Hezbollah to Lebanon's coast south of the Al-Awali river, and warned people to stay away.</p>

<p>It also declared a "closed military zone" near the coast in Israel's extreme northwest, near Shlomi, after a similar declaration last week to the northeast in the Metula area.</p>

<p>The military said Hezbollah fired about 135 projectiles into Israel Monday and Israeli forces hit back by striking "over 120 terror targets in southern Lebanon within an hour".</p>

<p>Late Monday, Lebanese state media reported more Israeli strikes on Hezbollah's south Beirut stronghold, which has been repeatedly pounded even after a bombing killed Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah.</p>

<p><strong>- More troops deployed -</strong></p>

<p>Hezbollah said it targeted Israeli soldiers in two south Lebanon border villages, including Maroun al-Ras where it has reported previous clashes. The army said it had deployed another division for operations across the border.</p>

<p>At least four projectiles were fired from Gaza just after October 7 commemorations began, Israel's military said, adding it retaliated against militant infrastructure throughout Gaza.</p>

<p>Hamas said it fired rockets near the border with Gaza and at Tel Aviv, while Hezbollah twice said it had launched rockets at areas north of Haifa, a major coastal city.</p>

<p>As troops fought what Israel says is a war for its very existence, vigils at massacre sites and rallies called for the return of hostages a year after their abduction.</p>

<p>The October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Late Monday in Tel Aviv, musicians performed as victims' images flashed on screens at a ceremony attended by families and relatives of those killed and abducted.</p>

<p>"We know in our minds, our hearts, in every cell in our bodies: there will be no rehabilitation without the return of the hostages. All of them," said Nitza Corngold, whose son Tal Shoham was seized.</p>

<p>The day began with President Isaac Herzog leading a moment's silence at 6:29 am -- the time the attack began -- in Reim, a kibbutz community where Hamas fighters killed at least 370 people at the Nova music festival, that day's deadliest attack.</p>

<p>It began when Hamas fired thousands of rockets at nearby Israeli communities.</p>

<p>At the same time militants stormed across Gaza's fortified border and attacked nearly 50 different sites, including kibbutzim communities and army bases.</p>

<p>Militants went door-to-door shooting residents dead.</p>

<p><strong>- Gaza's 'graveyard' -</strong></p>

<p>Hours later, Israel launched a military offensive that has reduced swathes of Gaza to rubble, and displaced nearly all of its 2.4 million residents at least once amid an unrelenting humanitarian crisis.</p>

<p>Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said on X Monday the war had turned Gaza into a "graveyard".</p>

<p>Of the 251 people taken hostage into Gaza, 97 are still being held, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>According to Hamas-run Gaza's health ministry, 41,909 people, the majority civilians, have been killed there since the start of the war. The figures have been deemed reliable by the United Nations.</p>

<p>Since Israel's escalation in Lebanon began in late September, more than 1,110 people have been killed and more than one million are displaced, official figures show.</p>

<p>Violence has also soared in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where the Palestinian health ministry says more than 700 people have been killed since the Hamas attack, including two on Monday during Israeli raids.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The inauguration of a new runaway in the Maldives built under an airport redevelopment project assisted by India and the official launch of the RuPay card in the island nation on Monday are aimed at boosting economic ties and tourism cooperation between the two countries.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Maldivian Mohamed Muizzu jointly virtually inaugurated the runway at the Hanimadhoo International Airport and also witnessed via weblink a live transaction using a RuPay payment service card in the Maldives.</p>

<p>The launch took place after the two leaders held extensive talks which Muizzu in his press statement said were to "chart a new path for the future".</p>

<p>The Maldivian president accompanied by First Lady Madam Sajidha Mohamed and a Maldivian delegation arrived in India on Sunday evening.</p>

<p>Though the Maldivian president attended PM Modi's swearing-in ceremony in June, it is his first bilateral visit to India.</p>

<p>Prior to the launch of different India-assisted projects in the Maldives, a small official video was played in which details about these projects were shared in the presence of the two leaders at the Hyderabad House.</p>

<p>"The bonds between India and Maldives stretch back centuries, woven together through rich trade and cultural exchanges," it was narrated in the video.</p>

<p>Over the years, this relationship has evolved, characterised by "mutual respect and unwavering support", underpinned by India's Neighbourhood First policy and SAGAR vision, it said.</p>

<p>India has always been the first responder in the Maldives during times of crisis.</p>

<p>"Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Mohamed Muizzu, this relationship is to achieve greater heights," it added.</p>

<p>The RuPay card launch today will pave the way for strengthened India-Maldives relations by boosting tourism and economic cooperation, according to the India-Maldives video.</p>

<p>"It will allow Indian tourists to make cashless transactions easily, reducing cost and enhancing convenience, especially in the Maldives tourism sector," it said.</p>

<p>The inauguration of the new runaway at Hanimadhoo International Airport marks a "significant milestone in the airport's ongoing expansion project".</p>

<p>Its redevelopment, under an "Indian Line of Credit of USD 132 million", aims to provide complete new infrastructure including runaway, ATC tower, ARFF block, hangar, cargo facilities, and passenger terminal building, it added.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi in his press statement after the bilateral talks said President Muizzu's visit adds "another chapter to our ties".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan's Punjab government on Monday banned jailed former premier Imran Khan from meeting his family members, lawyers and party leaders till October 18 due to "security concerns", amidst his party staging anti-government protests in several cities.</p>

<p>The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf founder Khan has been lodged in Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail in multiple cases since August 2023.</p>

<p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi has accused PTI of trying to disrupt the upcoming Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit scheduled to be held on Oct 15 and 16 in Islamabad and emphasised that the government will ensure that these plans do not succeed.</p>

<p>"Incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi have been banned from meeting their family, lawyers, and party leaders at Adiala Jail, Rawalpindi, till Oct 18," a Punjab government official said.</p>

<p>The government has decided given "security concerns", he said.</p>

<p>According to PTI sources, the government has decided in anticipation of the upcoming SCO summit.</p>

<p>The coalition government led by PML-N's Shehbaz Sharif has alleged that PTI is staging protests in Islamabad to sabotage the summit. The Pakistan Army has been called in to provide security for the SCO summit.</p>

<p>Earlier, security agencies arrested six Adiala jail staff for aiding the PTI founder.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a PTI spokesperson said the legal team of Khan will file a petition in court, requesting the lifting of a ban on meetings with Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi. "Justice Sardar Ijaz of Islamabad High Court had ordered the authorities not too long ago to arrange meetings via video link, if not possible physically, given the number of cases Imran Khan has to deal with, legal consultation is given and, therefore should be provided," he said.</p>

<p>PTI supporters held anti-government protests in several parts of Pakistan, including Islamabad, Lahore and Rawalpindi.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The mayor of the capital of Mexico's violence-plagued state of Guerrero was killed on Sunday less than a week after he took office, the state's governor confirmed.</p>

<p>Alejandro Arcos was killed just six days after he took office as mayor of the city of Chilpancingo, a city of around 280,000 people in southwestern Mexico.</p>

<p>"His loss mourns the entire Guerrero society and fills us with indignation," Guerrero Governor Evelyn Salgado said in a statement shared on social media.</p>

<p>Guerrero's state attorney general's office also said it was investigating his murder.</p>

<p>The official confirmation came after photos circulated on the messaging app WhatsApp depicting a severed head on top of a pick-up truck, appearing to be that of Arcos. Reuters could not independently verify the photos' authenticity.</p>

<p>Arcos' death comes just three days after the new city government's secretary, Francisco Tapia, was shot to death.</p>

<p>"They were young and honest officials who sought progress for their community," Senator Alejandro Moreno wrote on social media.</p>

<p>Moreno, who is the head of Mexico's PRI political party, called on the federal attorney general's office to lead the investigation into Arcos and Tapia's murders, given "the situation of ungovernability in Guerrero."</p>

<p>Guerrero has become one of the deadliest states for aspiring and elected public officials, as well as for journalists.</p>

<p>At least six candidates for public office were killed in the state in the run-up to Mexico's June 2 elections.</p>

<p>Arcos' social media posts show the mayor in recent days had been supervising disaster relief efforts following the impact of Hurricane John last month, which caused severe flooding in beach resort Acapulco and surrounding towns.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump said Monday that illegal immigrants were bringing "bad genes" into the United States, doubling down on previous inflammatory rhetoric about migrants poisoning the blood of the country.</p>

<p>Trump was criticizing his Democratic presidential rival Vice President Kamala Harris in a radio interview when he brought up government figures showing there were 13,000 immigrants in the United States who were not in federal immigration detention, despite homicide convictions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"How about allowing people to come to an open border, 13,000 of which were murderers, many of them murdered far more than one person? They are now happily living in the United States," he told conservative host Hugh Hewitt.</p>

<p>"You know now, a murderer -- I believe this -- it's in their genes. We've got a lot of bad genes in our country right now. They had 425,000 people come into our country that shouldn't be here that are criminals."</p>

<p>Trump was misconstruing data released in September by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency.</p>

<p>The figures don't include people incarcerated outside of ICE facilities -- in state, local or other federal facilities, for example -- and they cover a period spanning decades, including when Trump was president.</p>

<p>US media reported Monday that migrant apprehensions at the US-Mexico border fell 75 per cent year-on-year in September -- to the lowest level since the Trump administration -- citing Department of Homeland Security statistics.</p>

<p>"I don't normally defend Trump's statements, and even here he drops the 13,000 released murderers lie," said conservative political commentator Richard Hanania, president of the Center for the Study of Partisanship and Ideology.</p>

<p>"But he's right that crime is largely genetic. He should just learn about the low crime rate among immigrants and think about the implications."</p>

<p>Trump, who is neck-and-neck with Harris in nationwide and swing-state polling ahead of November's election, has spent much of his campaign demonizing both undocumented immigrants and those in the United States legally.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During a rally last month, the 78-year-old former reality TV star said Harris should be prosecuted over President Joe Biden's border policies and called illegal immigrants "animals," out to "rape, pillage, thieve, plunder and kill."</p>

<p>"They will walk into your kitchen, they'll cut your throat," he said.</p>

<p>And he repeatedly threatened legal Haitian residents in Ohio with deportation, falsely accusing them of eating locals' pets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump -- the oldest major-party White House candidate in history and the first convicted felon to run -- accused immigrants of "poisoning the blood of our country" in December in a phrase that earned him comparisons with Adolf Hitler.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[One year after Hamas's deadly attack on Israel unleashed war in Gaza, the Palestinian territory is unrecognisable and its residents are exhausted by displacement and shortages, with no end in sight.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One year after Hamas's deadly attack on Israel unleashed war in Gaza, the Palestinian territory is unrecognisable and its residents are exhausted by displacement and shortages, with no end in sight.</p>

<p>"It felt like the first day of the war all over again", said Khaled al-Hawajri, 46, as the Israeli forces bombarded his Gaza neighbourhood on Monday, even as Israel marked the anniversary of the Hamas attack.</p>

<p>"Last night we were terrorised by the bombardments from quadcopters and tank shells," said Hawajri, who has been displaced 10 times with his family of seven in the past year.</p>

<p>"We have endured a whole year in the north under bombardment, terror, and fear in the hearts of my children," he said, adding he had stayed in Gaza's devastated north because "there is no safe place in the entire Strip".</p>

<p>On Monday, Gaza City was barely recognisable, ravaged by relentless air strikes and fighting.</p>

<p>Residents walked along sand-covered streets stripped of pavements, with buildings either destroyed or left without facades, while piles of rubble littered the roads.</p>

<p>With fuel in short supply and expensive, car traffic was almost nonexistent. Most people walked, cycled or used donkey carts.</p>

<p>"There is no electricity or petroleum products. Even firewood is not available. Food is almost non-existent", said 64-year-old Hussam Mansour, speaking from a street in Gaza City, surrounded by piles of rubble and sand.</p>

<p>The United Nations says 92 per cent of Gaza's roads and more than 84 per cent of its health facilities have been damaged or destroyed in the war.</p>

<p><strong>- Long war -</strong></p>

<p>Mansour and his sons have all been displaced, and his apartment building was destroyed in an air strike.</p>

<p>"Now when I walk the streets, I do not recognise them anymore," he said.</p>

<p>Like Hawajri and Mansour, Gaza's 2.4 million inhabitants have endured hardship, with no signs of relief, even after Israel reassigned divisions to the north of the country where troops are fighting Hamas's Lebanese ally Hezbollah.</p>

<p>About 90 per cent of the population has been displaced at least once, the United Nations says.</p>

<p>"Last night was one of the hardest nights of the war as if the war had just begun!" said 46-year-old Muhammad al-Muqayyid, displaced from the Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza.</p>

<p>"I never imagined the war would last this long," he said.</p>

<p>"A year has gone and we have seen every kind of suffering -- disease, hunger, danger and loss."</p>

<p>The Israeli military has been fighting Hamas in Gaza since the unprecedented attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military offensive in Gaza has killed at least 41,909 people, most of them civilians, according to figures provided by the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.</p>

<p>The UN acknowledges the figures to be reliable.</p>

<p>A year on, Israel has yet to achieve one of its main objectives: securing the return of all those taken hostage on October 7, 2023.</p>

<p>Of the 251 captured that day, 97 are still held captive in Gaza, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>The Israeli military is still carrying out operations in Gaza to free the hostages and crush Hamas, in power since 2007.</p>

<p>"There was a sudden ground invasion by tanks, and people were rushing out of their homes without taking anything with them, just carrying their children and running through the streets with fire and shells raining down on them", Muqayyid said, referring to an Israeli military operation in northern Gaza on Sunday.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Hamas keeps fighting. Its armed wing, the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, said it launched a barrage of rockets at Tel Aviv on Monday.</p>

<p>Samah Ali, a 32-year-old woman displaced in the central Gaza city of Deir el-Balah, said rocket launches were predictable on this day.</p>

<p>"Suddenly, we heard the sound of rockets launching, and everyone in the camp came out to see where they had been fired from," she said, adding some people fled fearing retaliatory Israeli strikes.</p>

<p>"It's certain that the occupation army will return and strike."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Ports throughout Europe have not allowed the ship to dock because it is carrying a staggering 20,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The MV Ruby, a Maltese-registered cargo ship, has been drifting at sea for six weeks after sustaining damage shortly after departing from Russia. Ports throughout Europe have not allowed the ship to dock because of its contents and&nbsp;compromised state. According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/06/world/europe/ship-explosives.html" rel="nofollow, noindex">New York Times,&nbsp;</a></em>the ship is<em> c</em>arrying a staggering 20,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, a chemical commonly used in agricultural fertilizers.&nbsp;Due to the dangerous nature of its cargo and damage to the vessel, no port has granted entry for long-term repairs, leaving the MV Ruby in limbo.</p>

<p>When improperly stored or exposed to stressors like heat and pressure, ammonium nitrate can become highly unstable and explosive. Notably, ammonium nitrate was the same substance responsible for the catastrophic Beirut port explosion in August 2020 that&nbsp;claimed 200 lives, displaced 300,000 people, and inflicted 15 billion pounds in damage on the Lebanese capital.&nbsp;Alarmingly,&nbsp;MV Ruby's cargo holds approximately seven times the amount. The potential blast equivalent to an atomic bomb has raised serious concerns, emphasising the urgent need to ensure the safe disposal or repair of the vessel.</p>

<p>Over the weekend, the MV Ruby remained 14 miles off the coast of Kent, in southeastern England, where it has been since last month, as per <em>NYT.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>The ship, registered in Malta and owned by Ruby Enterprise, is managed by Serenity Shipping based in the UAE, but its Russian cargo has raised suspicions. Its stalled journey has sparked concerns among governments that it could be a Trojan horse aimed at sabotaging vital shipping and port infrastructure.</p>

<p>The ship's journey began in late August from the Russian port of Kandalaksha, with a reported destination of the Canary Islands. However, after sustaining damage, the Ruby attempted to dock at Norwegian and Lithuanian ports, only to be refused due to security concerns.&nbsp;Lithuania's Foreign Minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, made it clear that despite no evidence of malicious intent, the country cannot afford to let its guard down when dealing with Russia.</p>

<p>''When we are dealing with Russia or other international actors that are unfriendly to us, we always keep this possibility in mind,'' Lithuania's foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The authorities in Sweden also denied the vessel to dock in Gothenburg and Uddevalla ports which are closer to populated regions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The MV Ruby then headed to Britain, only to be met with heightened scrutiny. Lithuania's former ambassador to Britain, Eitvydas Bajarunas labelled the ship a "floating megabomb" in a think tank column, warning of potential Russian sabotage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The MV Ruby's managers have requested permission to dock, transfer its 20,000 tons of ammonium nitrate to another vessel, and undergo essential repairs. However, British authorities have yet to respond. In the meantime, the ship has refuelled while anchored at sea, according to the British Coast Guard.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Air raid sirens echoed across central Israel including Tel Aviv after surface-to-surface missiles were fired from Yemen on Israel on the first anniversary of deadly attacks in Israel where over 1,200 people were killed. Israel did not mention who fired the missile, but Iran-backed Houthis - A Shia militant group in Yemen - have over the past year attacked Israel several times in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.</p>

<p>Several events were organised across Israel to remember those who died in the attacks carried out by Hamas. Videos show people hiding for cover as air raid sirens went off. Several journalists lying on the ground when missile warnings were issued.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/how-gaza-is-reduced-to-rubble-in-a-year-analysis-using-satellite-images-6731563">On October 7, 2023</a>, Hamas - a militant group which controlled Gaza - crossed over into Israel and launched 'Operation Al Aqsa Flood', a deadly terror attack, that killed over 1,200 people across the country. Israel was caught off-guard. Hamas operatives fired over 5,000 rockets, they came through paragliders, broke the Gaza wall and went on a killing spree.</p>

<p>Militants abducted 251 hostages, 97 of whom are still captive in Gaza, including 33 the Israeli military has said are dead.</p>

<p>At least 41,870 Palestinians, a majority of them civilians, have been killed in Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip since the war began, according to data provided by the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza. The UN has acknowledged these figures as reliable.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said Sunday it <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-deploys-more-troops-near-gaza-ahead-of-oct-7-attack-anniversary-6731132">deployed more troops</a> to defend southern communities and areas bordering Gaza, ahead of the anniversary of the October 7 attack by Hamas.</p>

<p>Inside Gaza, the military said three divisions were working to "dismantle terrorist infrastructure and degrade Hamas's capabilities".</p>]]></content:encoded>

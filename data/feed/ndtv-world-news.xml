       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli couple Leron and Zoli Mor have identical tattoos on their arms showing a procession of eight elephants, their tails and trunks intertwined.</p>

<p>The first two are the parents and the six smaller ones behind them are the calves. The last three are even smaller than the rest and are depicted in fresher ink because they were added later.</p>

<p>The eight elephants represent the Mor family. Leron and Zoli Mor have three children of their own and have adopted three others whose parents - one of them Leron's sister - were killed in the attack by Hamas gunmen on Israel on Oct. 7 last year.</p>

<p>"They were five," Leron Mor said at the family's new home in the northern Israeli village of Bnei Dror, pointing to that tattoo on her arm. "And they were joined by three more."</p>

<p>One of the three who were adopted, Avigail Idan, was among more than 250 people taken hostage during the attack led by the Palestinian militant group. She was released last November though about 100 people are still in captivity as the Israel-Hamas war triggered by the attack rages on.</p>

<p>She was aged three at the time of the attack, in which her parents were among 1,200 people killed. Her older siblings, Michael and Amalia, hid in a cabinet at their home in a kibbutz, their mother lying lifeless on the floor nearby.</p>

<p>The Mors were also living in the kibbutz in southern Israel at the time and were rescued from their home the day after the attack. They now live far away in Bnei Dror, an agricultural village near the Mediterranean coast.</p>

<p>"The conversation here in the house is very open. We talk about their parents. We do not forget about them for one moment," said Leron Mor. "We look at pictures together. And they are present in our lives."</p>

<p>Avigail also has U.S. citizenship, and she and the family met U.S. President Joe Biden at the White House in April.</p>

<p>"He was simply compassionate and warm and caring," Leron Mor said. "We spoke to him about the people, our friends, who are still there and all the hostages. We asked him to make every effort to get them out because that's the only important thing right now. There is nothing more important than that."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Army is testing robot dogs mounted with AI-enabled guns at a military facility in the Middle East, according to <em>Military.com</em>. Photos shared by the Defense Visual Information Distribution Service (DVIDS) show one such robot dog undergoing "rehearsals" at the Red Sands Integrated Experimentation Center in Saudi Arabia in mid-September as part of a recent counter-unmanned aerial system exercise. The four-legged robot can be seen mounted with what appears to be an AR-15/M16 pattern rifle on a rotating turret and resembles the robot system that the US Army tested at Fort Drum, New York in August.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The US Army describes the robot dog as a four-legged unmanned ground vehicle (UGVs) armed with an artificial intelligence-enabled rifle - contributing to innovative unmanned capabilities. Notably, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.dvidshub.net/image/8663734/centcom-and-saudi-arabian-armed-forces-conduct-third-iteration-red-sands-counter-s-uas-exercise">DVIDS </a>is an operation run by the US Department of Defence to provide media on its activities across the world.</p>

<p>Speaking to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/10/01/army-has-sent-armed-robot-dog-middle-east-testing.html" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>Military.com</em></a>, a US Army Central spokesman said that the armed robot dog was one of several "non-counter-sUAS" systems tested alongside 15 counter-drone platforms at Red Sands during the September test. The gun engaged several static ground targets, the official said without elaborating on its potential applications.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the US Defence Department has been incorporating robot dogs and other autonomous ground vehicles in its formations over the last few years. Additionally, the Pentagon has increasingly experimented with mounting weapons systems on robot dogs.&nbsp;</p>

Here's What Happened</a></strong></p>

<p>The Marine Corps, in particular, has tested quadrupedal robots outfitted with both Onyx Industries' SENTRY remote weapon system and the M72 LAW anti-tank rocket launcher, while the Army has considered outfitting mechanized canines with the new 6.8mm XM7 rifle the service recently fielded under its Next Generation Squad Weapon program to replace the M4 carbine, the outlet reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, the US military isn't the only country pursuing four-legged weapon combat robots. In May, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/chinese-military-unveils-rifle-mounted-robot-dog-5764449">Chinese military</a> debuted its own robot dog armed with an assault rifle during a training exercise in Cambodia. The video of the robot dog was released by state broadcaster CCTV.</p>

<p>"It can serve as a new member in our urban combat operations, replacing our (human) members to conduct reconnaissance and identify (the) enemy and strike the target," a soldier named Chen Wei said in the video.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Travel tech platform EaseMyTrip - which suspended flight bookings to Maldives in January after a diplomatic row with India - on Friday said it has resumed bookings to the island nation after "improved bilateral ties" between both governments.</p>

<p>In June, EaseMyTrip CEO Nishant Pitti responded to the controversy around the resumption of flight bookings to Maldives through the platform, admitting that "some bookings did occur" between May 16-26 but the company acted swiftly and removed them.</p>

<p>The response came after Kerala Congress questioned EaseMyTrip on social media platform X, highlighting the company's earlier decision to remove Maldives from its platform as a show of support for Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p>

<p>In a statement on Friday, EaseMyTrip co-founder and CEO Pitti said, "Basis positive developments in mending India-Maldives bilateral ties, by both governments, we are resuming bookings to the Maldives. This decision comes after careful consideration and follows a constructive dialogue with the Ministry of Tourism of Maldives delegation during their recent visit to India and our office".</p>

<p>"Being a nation-first company we are always in alignment with our government and support their vision. It is a progressive step towards the renewed friendship and mutual goals of enhancing tourism."&nbsp;</p>

<p>EaseMyTrip had initially halted bookings to Maldives in January after three Maldivian ministers made derogatory comments about Prime Minister Modi following his visit to Lakshadweep.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A father in Malaysia set his son's motorbike ablaze in a desperate attempt to protect him from potentially deadly accidents. According to the <em>South China Morning Post</em>, the father, whose identity has been revealed, initially bought the motorcycle for his son because he thought it would be more convenient for him to ride it to school. However, after discovering that his son had become dangerously addicted to riding the motorcycle, the father made the drastic decision to burn the two-wheeler, believing it was a better fate than his son dying in an accident.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The father discovered that his son, whose age has not been disclosed, began participating in illegal motorbike races, often returning home late at night, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/article/3280310/malaysia-dad-sets-sons-motorbike-fire-driven-concern-his-safety-late-night-races" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>SCMP </em></a>reported. This reckless behaviour raised serious safety concerns for the father, who repeatedly attempted to dissuade his son from engaging in such perilous activities. But his advice fell on deaf ears, leaving him feeling increasingly helpless and desperate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Therefore, faced with the possibility of his son sustaining injuries or worse, the father took the drastic decision of destroying the motorcycle. "I don't want to lose my son forever," the father said in a TikTok video of himself burning the two-wheeler. "I also do not want to receive a call from police officers that my son has been detained for racing the motorcycle," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The father stated that the motorcycle had become the primary source of conflict between him and his son so he felt he had no choice but to destroy it. He defended his action as a desperate measure for his son's well-being. "I did this for the sake of my child. Burning the motorbike is the best medicine for my son before I lose him. With this motorbike, my son is a monster," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The outlet did not disclose the son's reaction to his father burning his vehicle. However, on social media, the incident has sparked discussion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I agree with this father. He did it out of genuine concern for his son's safety. He saved his son's life, and after all, a life cannot be bought with money," wrote one person, per SCMP. &nbsp;"I hope the son can understand his father's love," said another.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, some social media users did see the positive side of the father's action.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"His method is violent. You should treat your kid as a friend, not an enemy. You should discuss it with your child. Your behaviour has not solved the problem and will only worsen the relationship between you and your son," commented one user.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Why not sell it? You could make some money from the sale," said another.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>S Jaishankar will visit Pakistan later this month to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, becoming the first External Affairs Minister to do so in nine years. The last visit was by Sushma Swaraj in 2015.&nbsp;</p>

<p>External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said on Friday that Mr Jaishankar will lead a delegation to Pakistan to attend a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Council of Heads of Government meeting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The External Affairs Minister will lead our delegation to Pakistan to participate in the SCO summit which will be held in Islamabad on October 15 and 16," Mr Jaiswal said, emphasising that the visit will be limited to attending the summit. Pakistan had invited Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the meeting in August.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The decision to send Mr Jaishankar to Pakistan for the summit is being seen as a major one by the Union government given the chill in ties between the two countries since the Pulwama terrorist attack in February 2019, which was followed by the Balakot air strikes, in which India targeted a Jaish-e-Mohammed training camp. The relationship got even more strained after Pakistan vociferously opposed India's removal of Article 370, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir.&nbsp;</p>

<p>India has repeatedly slammed Pakistan's interference on the issue and reiterated that it is an internal matter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Addressing the United Nations General Assembly last week, Mr Jaishankar had warned Pakistan that its policy of cross-border terrorism could never succeed and also alluded to its economic crisis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Many countries get left behind due to circumstances beyond their control. But some make conscious choices with disastrous consequences. A premier example is our neighbour, Pakistan. Unfortunately, their misdeeds affect others as well, especially the neighbourhood," the minister said.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Display Of Commitment</strong></p>

<p>Given all of this, the fact that Mr Jaishankar will attend the summit in the country is being seen as a display of India's commitment to the SCO which, it believes, has been playing a vital role in boosting regional security cooperation. Sushma Swaraj had visited Pakistan in 2015 to attend a conference on Afghanistan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Apart from India, the SCO has China, Russia, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan as member countries and is an influential economic and security bloc as well as one of the largest transregional international organisations.</p>

<p>The SCO was founded at a summit in Shanghai in 2001 by the presidents of Russia, China, the Kyrgyz Republic, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan and India was an observer country for the first time in 2005. It became a permanent member, along with Pakistan, in 2017.&nbsp;</p>

<p>India was the chair of the organisation in 2023 and hosted the SCO summit in the virtual format in July of that year.</p>

<p>The SCO Council of Heads of Government conclave, which Mr Jaishankar will be attending, is the second-highest platform in the grouping while the Heads of State Summit is the top-most forum and is generally attended by the Prime Minister.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Boeing Starliner lifted off the International Space Station in June with NASA's veteran astronauts, Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore, the mission was intended to last for eight days but a technical failure delayed the astronauts' return, extending the mission by eight more months.</p>

<p>The Boeing Starliner capsule faced propulsion issues including a Helium leak which resulted in aborting the return. The spacecraft's service module reported several tiny helium leaks making it unsafe for travel. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/explained-why-helium-leaks-delayed-boeing-starliner-astronauts-return-6509846">Helium </a>is essential to preserving the spacecraft's structural integrity and manoeuvrability. Along with Helium leaks, the spacecraft detected problems in its thrusters and valves.</p>

<p>The mission aimed to demonstrate the Boeing Starliner's capability to take humans to the ISS. Boeing needed to tap into the space Elon Musk's SpaceX has entered to provide crew transportation services to NASA.</p>

<p>Transporting Ms Williams and Mr Bilmore was Starliner's first crewed flight.</p>

<h2><b>SpaceX To The Rescue</b></h2>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/space-x-to-bring-back-sunita-williams-on-way-to-international-space-station-6676224">The NASA-SpaceX spacecraft, carrying Crew-9</a> members NASA astronaut Nick Hague (commander) and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov (mission specialist), docked at the International Space Station (ISS) last month to bring back Ms Williams and Mr Wilmore.</p>

<p>The Crew-9 members will have two empty seats for NASA astronauts Barry Wilmore and Sunita Williams will fill when the spacecraft returns next year.</p>

<p>The astronauts will now return home in February next year.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the Starliner returned to Earth after weeks of extensive testing but without the crew. The return of Starliner delayed the launch of Crew-9 from mid-August to September since NASA wanted more time to evaluate the reliability of the Starliner.</p>

<p>Hague and Gorbunov will stay in space for five months before coming back home.</p>

<h2><b>Surviving In Space</b></h2>

<p>The extended stay of Williams and Bilmore raised concerns about their survival, particularly regarding food and oxygen supply.</p>

<p>NASA assured that there is no immediate danger to the astronauts and the ISS has sufficient provisions to support the crew for the additional time.</p>

<p>"The space station is well-stocked with everything the crew needs, including food, water, clothing and oxygen," NASA stated. The agency stressed that regular resupply missions will ensure the astronauts' needs are met, citing regular arrivals of cargo spacecraft carrying food, fuel and supplies.</p>

<p>The space station revealed that two spacecraft - one carrying "8,200 pounds of food, fuel, supplies" and another carrying "three tons of cargo" - arrived at the ISS recently.</p>

<p>Living in space for an extended period requires unique arrangements. On the ISS, astronauts can sleep anywhere - floor, ceiling or walls - thanks to zero gravity. They use sleeping stations, similar to phone booths, with sleeping bags and pillows attached to the floor, wall, or ceiling. Astronauts can also make video calls, audio calls or send emails through NASA.</p>

<p>Aboard the ISS, Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore also have access to the Vegetable Production System (Veggie garden) which allows them to grow fresh produce and even flowers in space. During their extended stay, the duo has been experimenting with various techniques to improve crop growth in space.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[From a meagre 0.4 square miles in 1986, the vegetation cover reached almost 5 square miles in 2021, the study found.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Icy Antarctica is known for its vast white landscape. But extreme heat events and climate change are turning parts of the continent green, according to a concerning new study. Scientists from universities of Exeter and Hertfordshire used satellite imagery and data to analyse vegetation levels in Antarctica, which has been warming at ana alarming rate, much faster than the global average. As per <em>CNN</em>, the team of researchers found plant life - mostly mosses - and said the green cover has increased 10-fold over the past four decades or 40 years.</p>

<p>The study was published on Friday in the journal <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-024-01564-5">Nature Geoscience</a></em>.</p>

<p>From a meagre 0.4 square miles in 1986, the vegetation cover reached almost 5 square miles in 2021, the study found. In a period of five years - from 2016 to 2021 - accelerated by more than 30 per cent.</p>

<p>"Our findings confirm that the influence of anthropogenic climate change has no limit in its reach," Thomas Roland, a study author and environmental scientist at the University of Exeter, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/04/climate/antarctica-greening-vegetation-satellite-images/index.html">told <em>CNN</em></a>. "Even on the Antarctic Peninsula - this most extreme, remote and isolated 'wilderness' region - the landscape is changing, and these effects are visible from space."</p>

<p>Though the landscape is almost entirely snow, these researchers found that the green cover has grown dramatically.</p>

<p>At a conference in Chile in August, nearly 1,500 academics, researchers and scientists discussed whether the extreme climate events events meant Antarctica had reached a tipping point, or a point of accelerated and irreversible sea ice loss from the West Antarctic ice sheet.</p>

<p>"You might see the same rise in CO2 over thousands of years, and now it's happened in 100 years," said Liz Keller, a paleoclimate specialist from the Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand.</p>

<p>Antarctica, the coldest place on Earth, has witnessed severe extreme heat events.</p>

<p>In summer months this year, the average temperature in the continent climbed up to 50 degrees Fahrenheit above normal.</p>

<p>In March 2022, temperatures in some parts of Antarctica reached up to 70 degrees Fahrenheit above normal, the most extreme temperature variation ever recorded in the continent.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India on Friday announced that External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar will travel to Pakistan to attend a conclave of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in mid-October.</p>

<p>The announcement was made by external affairs ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.</p>

<p>The last Indian external affairs minister to visit Pakistan was Sushma Swaraj. She had travelled to Islamabad in December 2015 to attend a conference on Afghanistan.</p>

<p>Pakistan is hosting the SCO Council of Heads of Government (CHG) meeting on October 15 and 16.</p>

<p>"The external affairs minister will lead our delegation to Pakistan to participate in the SCO summit which will be held in Islamabad on October 15 and 16," Mr Jaiswal said at his weekly media briefing.</p>

<p>The spokesperson clarified that the external affairs minister is travelling to Pakistan only to attend the SCO summit.</p>

<p>In August, Pakistan invited Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the SCO's summit.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar's visit to Pakistan assumes significance as it is seen as a major decision on New Delhi's part.</p>

<p>The decision to send the senior minister is seen as a display of India's commitment to the SCO which has been playing a key role in boosting regional security cooperation.</p>

<p>The ties between India and Pakistan came under severe strain after India's warplanes pounded a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist training camp in Balakot in Pakistan in February 2019 in response to the Pulwama terror attack.</p>

<p>The relations further deteriorated after India on August 5, 2019 announced the withdrawal of special powers of Jammu and Kashmir and the bifurcation of the state into two union territories.</p>

<p>India has been maintaining that it desires normal neighbourly relations with Pakistan while insisting that the onus is on Islamabad to create an environment free of terror and hostility for such engagement.</p>

<p>The SCO council of heads of government conclave is the second-highest platform in the grouping.</p>

<p>The SCO heads of state summit is the top most forum in the grouping that is generally attended by the Indian prime minister.</p>

<p>The SCO, comprising India, China, Russia, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, is an influential economic and security bloc that has emerged as one of the largest transregional international organisations.</p>

<p>India was the chair of the SCO last year. It hosted the SCO summit in the virtual format in July last year.</p>

<p>India's association with the SCO began in 2005 as an observer country. It became a full member state of SCO at the Astana summit in 2017.</p>

<p>India has shown a keen interest in deepening its security-related cooperation with the SCO and its Regional Anti-Terrorism Structure (RATS), which specifically deals with issues relating to security and defence.</p>

<p>The SCO was founded at a summit in Shanghai in 2001 by the presidents of Russia, China, the Kyrgyz Republic, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.</p>

<p>Pakistan became its permanent member along with India in 2017.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's supreme leader vowed in a rare address on Friday that his allies around the region would keep fighting Israel, as he defended his country's missile strike on its arch-foe.</p>

<p>Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's address in Tehran was the first since Iran launched its second-ever attack on Israel, and also the first since exchanges of fire pitting Hezbollah fighters against Israeli troops escalated into full-blown war in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Nearly a year after the Palestinian militant group Hamas launched the deadliest attack on Israel in its history on October 7, Israel announced it was shifting its focus to securing its border with Lebanon.</p>

<p>Israel says its objective is to allow 60,000 Israelis displaced by a year of cross-border rocket attacks launched by Hezbollah to return to their homes.</p>

<p>Israel's attacks on Hezbollah strongholds around Lebanon have killed more than 1,000 people since September 23, according to the Lebanese health ministry, and forced hundreds of thousands more to flee their homes in a country already mired in economic crisis.</p>

<p>They have also killed an Iranian general, a host of Hezbollah commanders and, in their biggest blow to the group in decades, assassinated its leader, Hassan Nasrallah.</p>

<p>Speaking to a crowd of thousands in Farsi-speaking Iran, he said in Arabic: "The resistance in the region will not back down with these martyrdoms, and will win."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The address comes as Israel weighs retaliation for Hezbollah backer Iran's missile attack which Tehran said was revenge for the killing of Nasrallah and other top figures.</p>

<p>Khamenei praised Hezbollah, saying that it was providing "a vital service to the entire region and the entire Islamic world".</p>

<p>The escalation has left people in Lebanon fearful that there will be no swift end to the violence engulfing their country.</p>

<p>In Beirut, 35-year-old displaced nurse Fatima Salah said people were "scared for our children, and this war is going to be long".</p>

<p>Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant warned that "those who attack the state of Israel, pay a heavy price".</p>

<p>Iran said it would step up its response if Israel counterattacked.</p>

<p>Israel intercepted most of the 200 missiles launched by Iran, though the attack has sparked fear in Israel of more violence to come. In the West Bank, a Palestinian was killed by shrapnel.</p>

<p>Rony Eli-Ya, 37, an Israeli on a pilgrimage to Ukraine's Uman, said it was "a miracle, not a single rocket killed a single Jew" in the attack.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden said the United States was "discussing" possible Israeli strikes on Iranian oil facilities.</p>

<p><strong>- Border crossing closed -</strong></p>

<p>Lebanon said an Israeli strike on Friday cut off the main international road to Syria after Israel said Hezbollah was transporting weapons through the tiny Mediterranean country's principal land border crossing.</p>

<p>The strike comes after 310,000 people, mostly Syrians, have in recent days fled the war pitting Israel against Hezbollah in Lebanon for relative safety in neighbouring Syria.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said its fighter jets struck Hezbollah targets near the border crossing overnight.</p>

<p>It said they included a 3.5 kilometre (two-mile) long tunnel that "enables the transfer and storage of large quantities of weapons underground".</p>

<p>The border with Syria is the only land route out of Lebanon and the strike could leave thousands who are unable to fly out trapped.</p>

<p>Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi meanwhile landed in Beirut for talks with Lebanese officials, Lebanon's official National News Agency reported.</p>

<p>He arrived after an intense night of bombardment of Hezbollah's main bastion in the southern suburbs, with the US and an Israeli news website saying Israel targeted the militant group's potential successor just a week after it killed its Nasrallah.</p>

<p>The strikes destroyed at least five buildings and left a huge crater in the road, an AFP photographer said.</p>

<p>A target of one of Israel's recent Beirut strikes was Hashem Safieddine, a potential successor to Hezbollah chief Nasrallah, US news site Axios said, citing three Israeli officials it did not identify.</p>

<p>Israeli news website Ynet also reported Safieddine had been the target, while the Israeli military told AFP it was looking into the reports.</p>

<p>In Lebanon, a source close to Hezbollah said Nasrallah had been given a temporary burial in a secret location until a public funeral could be held.</p>

<p>Israel announced this week that its troops had started ground raids into parts of southern Lebanon, a stronghold of Hezbollah, after days of heavy bombardment of areas across the country where the group holds sway.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said it shelled Israeli troops in a border area of south Lebanon Friday, in the latest such clash on the frontier.</p>

<p>The militant group also said it kept up its rocket fire, with sirens warning of incoming fire blaring in northern Israel Friday.</p>

<p>Lebanon's health ministry said that 37 people were killed and 151 wounded by Israeli strikes over the previous 24 hours.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said nine of its soldiers have been killed in combat in Lebanon.</p>

<p><strong>- Tulkarem strike -</strong></p>

<p>In the occupied West Bank, a source within the Palestinian security services told AFP that an air raid on the refugee camp of Tulkarem, which killed 18 people, was the deadliest in the territory since 2000.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said its strike in the northern West Bank killed Hamas leader Zahi Yaser Abd al-Razeq Oufi, who it accused of participating in numerous attacks.</p>

<p>Calls for restraint have multiplied but months of similar calls to halt fighting in Gaza failed to bring a ceasefire.</p>

<p>Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures that include hostages killed in captivity.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive in Gaza has killed at least 41,788 people, the majority of them civilians, according to figures provided by the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. The United Nations has described the figures as reliable.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the conflict in West Asia is poised to set off a series of dangerous escalations risking full-scale war between Iran and Israel, Iran's Ambassador to India Iraj Elahi today sought India's intevention to help bring stability to the region.</p>

<p>"India must take this oportunity to convince Israel to stop its aggression in the reigon and help bring peace and stability," the Ambassador said, speaking to NDTV.</p>

<p>India, which has friendly ties with both Iran and Israel, has been urging all parties involved in the West Asia crisis to de-escalate tensions and resolve issues through diplomacy and dialogue.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi had even spoken to Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu after Tel Aviv opened a new front to the conflict with its northern neighbour Lebanon, where it is targeting Hezbollah.</p>

<p>In an exclusive interview to NDTV, the Iranian Ambassador also said that "If Israel stops, we will stop," adding that "Iran does not want war. We want to have peace in the region, but if our national security is hit, then it leaves us with no other option than to retaliate, and that is precisely what we did."</p>

<p>He went on to explain that Iran's ballistic missile attack was "retaliatory move" and was done in response to the "assassination of Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh on Iranian soil. He was our state guest and was assassinated by Israel in our country. That is a national security issue, and according to our Constitution, we have to deal with such an issue with a retaliatory response."</p>

<p>The Ambassador also clarified that the missile attack was not for the killing of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah. "The issue is getting mixed up here. Our retaliation to Israel was only for the killing of Ismail Haniyeh, not for the Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah. Hezbollah can take care of itself," he said.</p>

<h2><strong>IRAN'S SUPREME LEADER MAKES RARE SERMON</strong></h2>

<p>Earlier in the day, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Israel "won't last long" as he backed the Palestinian and Lebanese movements against Israel in his rare Friday sermon. Addressing tens of thousands of supporters at a mosque in Tehran, Khamenei justified its missile strikes on Israel as a "public service".</p>

<p>A gun kept by his side, the Iran leader declared that Israel would not prevail against Hamas or Hezbollah as chants of "we are with you" from the crowd echoed in the vast mosque grounds.</p>

<p>This was Ayatollah Khamenei's first public sermon in five years. The last time he did so was in January 2020 after a missile attack on a US army base in Iraq - which was Tehran's response to the killing of top Revolutionary Guards commander Qasem Soleimani.</p>

<p>Speaking about the rare incident, Ambassador Elahi said, "He is the Supreme leader of Iran. He is not just the political head of the government, but also the commander-in-chief of the Iranian armed forces - the highest military leader," implying that his orders are always followed.</p>

<h3><strong>'DEFINING THE CRISIS - THE PROBLEM OF INTERPRETATION'</strong></h3>

<p>Ambassador Elahi said that the entire crisis is a "confusion" which is caused due to the problem of how it is defined and how it is interpreted. "Israel defines the crisis as proxies of Iran (Hamas and Hezbollah) targetting Israel. But Iran defines the crisis as Israel's aggression and occupation of Palestine and Lebanon."</p>

<p>We believe in the pursuit of truth, said the Ambassador, explaining his stance that "It is Israel that has occupied Palestinian territories both in West Bank and in Gaza. It has also occupied territories in Lebanon, as well as the Golan Heights in Syria. It is them who have invaded and been the aggressors."</p>

<h3><strong>'RESILIENT IRAN'</strong></h3>

<p>There is a perception in the West that Iran has been weakened by US sanctions - that its economy is dwindling and its military not as powerful as it once was, the Ambassador said, adding that "this perception is incorrect. Iran has shown that it is self-reliant and its domestic economy is functioning fine."</p>

<p>Speaking about how Iran plans to defend its oil reserves or other critical infrastructure from an Israeli retaliatory strike, the Ambassador said, "In the military there is passive and active defence. The response to Israel in terms of a missile attack for violating our sovereignty was an active defensive role. But at the same time, Iran also has a strong defence mechanism in place for an incoming attack. We will defend our interests, installations and assets passively."</p>

<p>He went on to say that it is because of the sanctions that today Iran has "achieved self-sufficieny in many sectors. It has made Iran self-reliant and resilient. In fact, Iran recently even launched its own satellite. So our economy is anything but weak - and decision-makers in Israel and the US should not feel otherwise and miscalculate."</p>

<p>Giving an example of Iran's war with Iraq, the Ambassador said that during that time, "68 countries were against Iran and supporting Iraq. They even sent troops to the war front. US was proving its intelligence inputs, food was going to Iraq from Gulf nations, arms and ammunitions were being provided to Iraq by the Soviet Union. France was heloing Iraq too, but we overcame all that and defended ourselves. We have done it then, we will do it now," the envoy said.</p>

<p>He also mentioned that Iran is in close consultation with both Russia and China on the West Asia crisis.</p>

<h3><strong>'ISRAEL'S REACTION SHOWS IT IS PAINED BY IRANIAN STRIKES'</strong></h3>

<p>The way Benjamin Netanyahu has reacted "shows the extent to which Iran's missile strike has harmed Israel. How much it has pained Israel. Despite Israel's censorship of actual damage caused, their reaction indicates that Iranian missiles have indeed hit their military installations. Our retaliation was indeed damaging for them," the Ambassador said.</p>

<p>He further said that "Our retaliation shows that we did not strike their residential areas, only their intelligence and military installations. That said, we do not wish to escalate this further. We hope that Israel will not resort to an attack that will restart an endless cycle of responses."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu will be visiting India from October 6 to 10, the foreign ministry said today. This will be his first bilateral visit to India. He had earlier travelled to India in June this year for the swearing-in ceremony of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his council of ministers.</p>

<p>Mr Muizzu will meet President Droupadi Murmu and hold discussions with PM Modi on bilateral, regional, and international issues of mutual interest during his visit. He will also visit Mumbai and Bengaluru where he would be attending business events.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/s-jaishankar-meets-maldives-president-mohamed-muizzu-to-reset-bilateral-ties-6306626">Maldives is India's key maritime neighbour</a> in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). The nation also found a special place in the Prime Minister's vision of 'SAGAR' (Security and Growth for All in the Region) and India's 'Neighbourhood First Policy'.</p>

<p>"The visit of President Mohamed Muizzu to India after the recent visit of the External Affairs Minister )S Jaishankar) to the Maldives is testimony to the importance that India attaches to its relations with the Maldives and is expected to lend further momentum to cooperation and robust people to people ties between the two countries," the Minister of External Affairs said in a statement.</p>

<p>S Jaishankar visited the Maldives in August - first high-level trip from New Delhi after the island nation's pro-China president, Muizzu, assumed office in November last year.</p>

<p>During his visit, he met the Maldives President and other top leaders and assured them that New Delhi attached top priority to its multifaceted relationship with Male and was determined to further its developmental cooperation with the country.</p>

<p>India's relationship with the Maldives was hurt after Muizzu, known for his pro-China leanings, took charge as the President late last year.</p>

<p>Within hours of his oath, he demanded India replace the defence personnel it had stationed in the Maldives with civilians.</p>

<p>He, however, visited India to attend PM Modi's oath-taking ceremony and recently reaffirmed his administration's full commitment to strengthening the historic and close connections between the Maldives and India.</p>

<p>He said that India has always been one of the closest allies and invaluable partners, facilitating and providing aid whenever Maldives has needed it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia's Foreign Ministry said on Friday that a decision to remove the Taliban from a list of terrorist organisations had been "taken at the highest level", the state TASS news agency reported on Friday.</p>

<p>The decision needs to be followed up with various legal procedures in order to make it a reality, President Vladimir Putin's special representative on Afghanistan Zamir Kabulov was quoted as saying.</p>

<p>Putin said in July that Russia considers Afghanistan's Taliban movement an ally in the fight against terrorism.</p>

<p>Russia has been slowly building ties with the Taliban since it seized power in Afghanistan in August 2021 as U.S.-led forces withdrew after 20 years of war but the movement is still officially outlawed in Russia.</p>

<p>The killing of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in Israeli airstrikes on the Dahieh suburb of Beirut, a predominantly Shia stronghold, was a tectonic event both for the group and the region. Nasrallah had been the leader of Hezbollah for over three decades. The outfit itself was designated as a terror group by the US and others in 1997, two years before even Al Qaeda was labelled as such. In response to his death, Iran has launched a ballistic missile attack against Israel, upping the ante.</p>

<h2><strong>Hezbollah's Worst Crisis, Ever</strong></h2>

<p>The crisis today for Hezbollah, founded in 1982 from the ashes of the Lebanese Civil War, is more existential in nature than ever before. Along with Nasrallah, a majority of the group's military and political hierarchy has also been eliminated. While Israel's offensives against Hezbollah's leadership are not new, the 2006 Israel-Lebanon war, where Israel failed to deliver a thumping defeat, was a focal moment in its strategic thinking. The 2008 assassination in Syria of the group's second in command and founder of the Lebanese Islamic Jihad Organisation, Imad Mughniyeh, was a turning point, one that ultimately culminated in Israeli operations inside Lebanon over the past two months, such as targeting communication lines used via old pagers and walkie-talkies.</p>

<p>Moving forward, reconstructing Hezbollah in a post-Nasrallah era will not be easy. Israel, with these strikes, followed by a real threat of a region-wide escalation, may have found ample time for itself to hope for a political alternative emerging from within Lebanon, a country where Hezbollah was a state within a state and challenged the normal functioning of politics. Lebanon has had no president since 2022. Along with Nasrallah, the killing of senior Hezbollah commanders, such as the southern front chief Ali Karaki and Iranian commander Abbas Nilforoushan, amongst others, also significantly disrupts the chain of command. The Iranian retaliation against Israel in the form of ballistic missiles was explicitly highlighted as a response to these assassinations.</p>

<h2><strong>Who Will Lead Hezbollah?</strong></h2>

<p>The next leader of the group is widely expected to be Hashem Safieddine, a senior member and cousin of Nasrallah. Safieddine, by some accounts, is more radical and less politically astute than his predecessor. Sporting a black turban, he believes that he is a direct descendant of Prophet Mohammed. Safieddine has very close ties with Iran and is known to be married to the daughter of slain Iranian commander Qasseim Soleimani.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If he becomes the Hezbollah chief, Safieddine will have to contend with a mammoth reality. The degradation of his group's leadership is sure to have a significant impact. To date, Al Qaeda is reeling from the loss of its leaders Osama Bin Laden and Ayman Al Zawahiri; reconstruction efforts seem to be slow, and for the moment, invisible. Hamas, too, since the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran this July (also purportedly by Israel), has seen little activity at the top. Its new chief, Yahya Sinwar, has largely maintained radio silence. Even so, it's important to acknowledge that every such group or movement has unique character traits in terms of both survivability and ideology, and both these traits are interlinked. Al Qaeda was largely based on the cult of personality, Hezbollah isn't.</p>

<h2><strong>What The Arab World Would Want</strong></h2>

<p>The fate and future of Hezbollah will also depend on regional dynamics. Iran is not only a principal support pillar for the 'Axis of Resistance' built around the Palestine issue, but Hezbollah itself is also much more institutionally attached to Tehran's constructs. While Hamas is a Sunni movement, Hezbollah is a quintessential representation of Shia power and influence in the region, and hence is also much more critical towards Iranian thinking. While powers in the Arab world have tried to maintain a level of neutrality, pitching the ongoing fallout as an 'Iran-vs-Israel' crisis, the dissolution of both Hamas and Hezbollah would in all probability be a welcome step, specifically as much of the dirty work would land on Israeli shoulders.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Moving forward, the main question is who and what would replace the political vacuum left behind. History is littered with examples of how non-state militant actors, driven by ideology, are easily able to bulldoze their way to power before regional or international consensus-led political alternatives even start materialising.</p>

<h2><strong>Can Iran Cross The Nuclear Threshold?</strong></h2>

<p>Notably, Israel's kinetic pushback is not just a symptom of the audacity of an existential state. The biggest and yet the least talked about military operations that afforded Israel - especially after 2006 - the space to build capacities to take on Hezbollah, Hamas, and others, were its attempts to make sure that arch-foes in Iran and Syria would be unable to attain nuclear capabilities. The Israeli airstrike in 2007 decommissioned Syria's suspected nuclear programme in the Deir Ez-Zor region. Protracted and clandestine operations against Iran's nuclear programme have also inflicted on Tehran critical setbacks. It is considered a threshold nuclear state now, but if the current trajectory continues, it may even sprint towards weaponisation.</p>

<p>The next few months will continue to be unpredictable for West Asia, bringing it back to the core of international geopolitics, big power competition, nuclear brinkmanship and potential re-drawing of traditional influence architectures. After all, all these factors work in tandem.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Australian court upheld an order on Friday for Elon Musk's X to pay a fine of A$610,500 ($418,000) for failing to cooperate with a regulator's request for information about anti-child-abuse practices.</p>

<p>X had challenged the fine but the Federal Court of Australia ruled it was obliged to respond to a notice from the eSafety Commissioner, an internet safety regulator, seeking information about steps to address child sexual exploitation material on the platform.</p>

<p>Musk took X, then called Twitter, private in 2022. But the company had argued it was not bound to respond to the notice in early 2023 because it was folded into a new Musk-controlled corporate entity, removing liability.</p>

<p>"Had X Corp's argument been accepted by the Court it could have set the concerning precedent that a foreign company's merger with another foreign company might enable it to avoid regulatory obligations in Australia," eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said in a statement following the verdict.</p>

<p>eSafety has also started civil proceedings against X because of its non-compliance.</p>

<p>X did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.</p>

<p>This is not the first conflict between Musk and the Australian internet safety regulator. The eSafety Commissioner earlier this year ordered X to remove posts showing a bishop in Australia being stabbed during a sermon.</p>

<p>X challenged the order in court on the grounds that a regulator in one country should not decide what internet users viewed around the world, and ultimately kept the posts up after the Australian regulator withdrew its case.</p>

<p>Musk said at the time the order was censorship and shared posts describing the order, which would have applied globally, as a plot by the World Economic Forum to impose eSafety rules on the world.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[It is the right of every nation which comes under occupation to resist the occupation, said Lebanon's Ambassador to India Rabie Narsh, speaking to NDTV about the ongoing and escalating conflict in West Asia.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is the right of every nation which comes under occupation to resist the occupation, said Lebanon's Ambassador to India Rabie Narsh, speaking to NDTV about the ongoing and escalating conflict in West Asia.</p>

<p>"Lebanon's armed forces have not been pressed into action, because if we do that, then it officially becomes a war between two nations. It is currently the people who are resisting an occupation by Israel," the envoy said.</p>

<p>Explaining his remark, the Ambassador said, "Israel has been attacking us since its formation due to its policy of occupation and expansionism. Resistance groups like the Hezbollah and many others have always resisted this occupation."</p>

<p>Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon is widely considered a militant organisation by many countries in the West and even a terrorist organisation by some, including Israel and the United States. Members of the Hezbollah are part of the Parliament in Lebanon, but are not considered part of the government.</p>

<p>Speaking about "resistance group" Hezbollah, the Ambassador said clearly that Lebanon "does not consider Hezbollah a terrorist group. They are freedom fighters who are resisting an occupation. The are fighting for the freedom and liberty of the people of Lebanon, and their fight is against state terrorism being done by Israel, and against occupation. They are freedom fighters because they are fighting on their own land"</p>

<p>"As for the relationship between Hezbollah and the Lebanese government, it has always been there, and is a debatable issue," he said, adding that "When it comes to domestic issues, Hezbollah is a political party just like any other political party. They play by the same rules as every other political party."</p>

<h2><strong>ROCKETS FIRED AT ISRAEL</strong></h2>

<p>Israel has been targeted by Lebanon for the last 11 month, Tel Aviv has said. As recently as Thursday, 230 rockets were fired by Hezbollah on to Israeli territory.</p>

<p>Responding to this, the Ambassador said, "It is not true that Hezbollah has been fighting Israel for the last 11 months. The fight has been on since the formation of Israel in 1947-48. The resistance to occupation has been on since then. The fight has been on since then. Even now Israel is encroaching Lebanese territory."</p>

<p>Pinning the blame on the international community, the envoy said, "It is expected of the international community to put a hold on this situation. Today, we are suffering because the international community has failed to stop Israel's war crimes."</p>

<p>Speaking about the killing of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, the envoy said, "You can see the implications of assassinating him. You can see the fallout. The war is still on. Israel's strikes are even killing civilians in Lebanon. Hundreds of civilians have been killed so far. This is what terrorism really is. If what Israel is doing is not terrorism, then what is."</p>

<h3><strong>'THE PEOPLE ARE HEZBOLLAH'</strong></h3>

<p>Israel has been saying that Hezbollah militants have been taking shelter in civilian areas, residing and hiding in residential colonies and even hiding their weapons, arms and ammunition under civilian buildings.</p>

<p>The envoy however, rubbished these claims as "pure lies" by Israel. He said, "Israel's entire journey has been built up on lies. Their entire narrative is a lie, and these claims are lies," he said, adding that there has been a recent visit organised by Hezbollah for journalists, where they have shown that the areas targeted by Israel are pure civilian areas and no military installations were there."</p>

<p>He went on to say that, "As for Hezbollah members living there, well, the people are Hezbollah. Hezbollah is not an imaginary organisation. It is made of the people of Lebanon. Those who are resisting the occupation. So, yes, people are there. It may be Hezbollah or some other groups, but just because of that is it justified to kill their entire families and their children."</p>

<p>"As for the weapons, I do not know where they hide them," he added.</p>

<h3><strong>THE PRICE FOR THE HOLOCAUST</strong></h3>

<p>The Holocaust was the systematic state-sponsored killing of six million Jewish men, women, and children and several million others by Nazi Germany between 1941 and 1945 during World War-II.</p>

<p>Acknowledging the suffering of the Jewish people, the Ambassador said, "Of course, we do not deny that the Jewish people have suffered from the Holocaust and genocide, but on whose hand? Was it at the hands of the Arabs, or the Lebanese people? Or was it at the hands of the Europeans? So tell me, why should the people of Lebanon or Palestine pay the price for the crimes committed against Jews by another people."</p>

<h3><strong>THE TWO-STATE SOLUTION</strong></h3>

<p>Lebanon does not want war, the Ambassador told NDTV. "A military solution can not be achieved. We have sought for a political and a diplomatic solution. We have agreed that the only solution is a two-state solution. A state of Israel and a state for Palestine, each having defined territories and sovereign rights. But the only one who is opposed to this solution is Israel," he said.</p>

<p>Israel, he said, "seems to be above the international laws and the international community. It is always treated by the West as a spoilt child. This must end. Netanyahu's crazy campaign must stop, his criminal agendas should finish. So, yes, we can only move to peace when the UN resolution for a two-state policy is implemented and Palestine is given its due recognition as a country."</p>

<h3><strong>ANOTHER ISRAELI 'LIMITED INVASION' - HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT</strong></h3>

<p>Speaking about the "limited invasion" by Israel this time - as it has done in 1982 and 2006 - the Ambassador said, "It is the same, nothing&nbsp; will change. It is the mentality of war that Israel has always had."</p>

<p>He went on to say that "The entire foundation of Israel is based on a lie... and what makes it dangerous is that they justify their acts and agendas based on religious doctrines. 'The Promised Land', 'The Chosen People'. It is very dangerous when one builds their entire strategy on a twisted religious doctrine."</p>

<p>"Israel today occupies territories in Palestinian West Bank, they have occupied the Gaza strip, they have occupied Golan Heights in Syria and have also occupied lands in Lebanon. It is very clear who the aggressor is," the Ambassador said.</p>

<p>On Iran's ballistic missile attack on Israel, the envoy told NDTV that "What Iran does is up to them. How I see this is that Israel is left with no friends in the region. They are the aggressor. Be it Iran or Iraq or Yemen, or Lebanon - Israel has no good ties with anyone around it."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Israel "won't last long" as he backed the Palestinian and Lebanese movements against Israel&nbsp;in his rare Friday sermon. Addressing tens of thousands of supporters at a mosque in Tehran, Khamenei justified its missile strikes on Israel as a "public service".</p>

<p>A gun kept by his side, the Iran leader declared that Israel would not prevail against Hamas or Hezbollah as chants of "we are with you" from the crowd echoed in the vast mosque grounds.</p>

<p>Khamenei's first Friday sermon in five years marks a crucial show of defiance amid threats to the supreme leader's life. He remains a top target for Israel, which has vowed to retaliate after Tuesday's missile attacks.</p>

<p>In his speech, he also praised Hassan Nasrallah, the former chief of the Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah who was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut last week.</p>

<p>"Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah is no longer with us, but his spirit and his path will continue to inspire us forever. He was the high-standing flag against the Zionist enemy. His martyrdom will further increase this influence. The loss of Nasrallah is not in vain. We must stand up against the enemy while strengthening our unwavering faith," Khamenei told the gathering.</p>

<p>Khamenei also called Hezbollah a "blessed tree" that grew steadily under the leadership of Nasrallah.</p>

<p>"It is the duty and responsibility of all Muslims to help the blooded people of Lebanon and to support Lebanon's jihad and the battle for al-Aqsa mosque," he declared.</p>

<p>Iran's supreme leader, who backs the Palestinian Hamas group, called their October 7 attacks on Israel the "correct move".</p>

<p>"No international law has the right to object and protest against the Lebanese and Palestinians for standing up for themselves against the occupation," he told the crowd.</p>

<p>Khamenei, who spoke after a prayer ceremony for Nasrallah, also called Israel a "tool" for the United States "to take control of all the lands and resources in the region."</p>

<p>"There is no doubt that the Zionists and the Americans are dreaming - the Zionist entity will be uprooted from the ground, it has no roots, it is fake, unstable, and exists only because of American support," said Khamenei.</p>

<p>Khamenei, the supreme leader who holds the highest authority in Iran, had last delivered a Friday sermon five years ago. His sermon comes just three days after Iran launched 180 missiles targeting crucial infrastructure in Israel and three days before the first anniversary of the Israel-Gaza war.</p>

<p>The Iran leader had last led Friday prayers in January 2020 after a missile attack on a US army base in Iraq in response to the killing of top Revolutionary Guards commander Qasem Soleimani.</p>

<p>Iran supports both Hamas and Hezbollah, who are fighting Israel on its southern and northern fronts.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The massive asteroid that ended the dinosaurs 66 million years ago was not an isolated event, new research has revealed. The study, published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01700-4#:~:text=The%203D%20data%20reveal%20more,both%20sides%20of%20the%20crater ">Nature</a>, detailed scans of an underwater crater off the coast of Guinea. It revealed that another large asteroid struck Earth around the same time, potentially contributing to the cataclysmic conditions that led to the dinosaurs' extinction.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Scientists recently mapped the Nadir crater, spanning over 8 km in diameter, and revealed that it was created by an asteroid measuring 400 metres wide. This asteroid struck the planet at nearly 72,000 kmph&nbsp;between 65 million and 67 million years ago. While it was smaller than the asteroid linked to the mass extinction, it was still powerful enough to leave a significant mark on Earth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“The new images paint a picture of the catastrophic event,” said Dr Uisdean Nicholson, a marine geologist at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh. He discovered the <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abn3096 ">Nadir crater in 2022</a>, but the impact details were unclear until now.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Using advanced 3D seismic imaging, researchers managed to explore the crater's rim and the geological features lying 300 metres beneath the ocean floor. Dr Nicholson called it “exquisite,” saying, “There are around 20 confirmed marine craters worldwide, and none of them has been captured in anything close to this level of detail.”</p>

<p>The findings suggest the impact triggered intense tremors that liquefied sediments beneath the sea bed, resulting in faults and landslides that left traces of damage visible for thousands of square miles beyond the crater's edge. Furthermore, the collision unleashed a massive tsunami, estimated to have exceeded 800 metres in height, which would have surged across the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<p>Although the exact timing of this asteroid's impact remains uncertain, its discovery raises intriguing possibilities about a cluster of impacts occurring at the end of the Cretaceous period – 145 million years ago to 66 million years ago. The asteroid responsible for the extinction of the dinosaurs created a much larger crater – 160 km wide – at Chicxulub on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico.</p>

<p>Dr Nicholson said the “closest humans have come to seeing something like this is the 1908 Tunguska event”, when a 50-metre asteroid entered Earth's atmosphere and exploded in the skies above Siberia. He pointed out that the new 3D seismic data across the Nadir crater provides an unrivalled opportunity to test impact crater hypotheses and develop new models of crater formation in marine environments.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UN health agency said on Friday that it had approved the use of the first diagnostic test for mpox, a key tool in countries battling outbreaks.</p>

<p>More than 800 people have died across Africa from mpox, where the disease has been officially detected in 16 countries, according to the African Union's disease control centre.</p>

<p>"The approval for emergency use" of the test "will be pivotal in expanding diagnostic capacity in countries facing mpox outbreaks, where the need for quick and accurate testing has risen sharply", the World Health Organization said in a statement.</p>

<p>The test, called the Alinity m MPXV assay and manufactured by Abbott Molecular Inc., enables the detection of the mpox virus from swabs taken from human lesions.</p>

<p>"By detecting DNA from pustular or vesicular rash samples, laboratory and health workers can confirm suspected mpox cases efficiently and effectively", the WHO said.</p>

<p>"Limited testing capacity and delays in confirming mpox cases persist in Africa, contributing to the continued spread of the virus", it said.</p>

<p>The approval of the test "represents a significant milestone in expanding testing availability in affected countries," the statement quoted Yukiko Nakatani, an assistant director-general of WHO, as saying.</p>

<p>"Increasing access to quality-assured medical products is central to our efforts in assisting countries to contain the spread of the virus and protect their people, especially in underserved regions", Nakatani said.</p>

<p>Mpox, previously known as monkeypox, is caused by a virus transmitted to humans by infected animals but can also be passed from human to human through close physical contact.</p>

<p>It causes fever, muscular aches and large boil-like skin lesions, and can be deadly.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

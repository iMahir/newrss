       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New demonstrations were expected in Venezuela on Tuesday, after four people died and dozens were injured when the authorities broke up protests against President Nicolas Maduro's claim of victory in a hotly disputed election.</p>

<p>Security forces fired tear gas and rubber bullets Monday at angry protesters challenging the official results, which were questioned by the opposition and neighboring countries.</p>

<p>Thousands of people flooded the streets of several neighborhoods in the capital Caracas, chanting "Freedom, freedom!" and "This government is going to fall!"</p>

<p>Some ripped down and burned Maduro campaign posters while at least two statues of Hugo Chavez -- the late authoritarian socialist who led Venezuela for more than a decade and handpicked Maduro as his successor -- were knocked down by protesters.</p>

<p>In addition to the deaths, 44 were reported injured, according to the National Hospital Survey, a network that monitors crises in the country's hospitals</p>

<p>Two of the dead were in the state of Aragua and one in Caracas, the network said. The NGO Foro Penal meanwhile reported one more dead in the northwestern state of Yaracuy.</p>

<p>Amid growing fears of violence, a leading figure in the opposition coalition, Freddy Superlano, was "kidnapped" by black-clad officials, his Voluntad Popular said on X.</p>

<h3><strong>Fears of fraud</strong></h3>

<p>The elections were held amid widespread fears of fraud by the government and a campaign tainted by accusations of political intimidation.</p>

<p>The National Electoral Council (CNE) certified the reelection of Maduro, 61, to another six-year term until 2031, with the president winning 51.2 percent of votes cast compared to 44.2 percent for Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia.</p>

<p>But opposition leader Maria Corina Machado told reporters that a review of available voting records clearly showed that the next president "will be Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia," who replaced her on the ballot after she was barred from running by Maduro-aligned courts.</p>

<p>The records showed a "mathematically irreversible" lead for Gonzalez Urrutia, she said, with 6.27 million votes to Maduro's 2.75 million.</p>

<p>The Organization of American States, a regional body, charged Tuesday there was "exceptional manipulation" of the election results that handed Maduro his win.</p>

<p>Machado called for families to turn out Tuesday for "popular assemblies" nationwide to show support for a peaceful transition of power.</p>

<p>Maduro's campaign manager Jorge Rodriguez, also called on X for "large marches starting this Tuesday to celebrate the victory."</p>

<p>In Caracas on Monday, AFP observed members of the national guard firing tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters, some wearing motorbike helmets and bandanas tied over their faces. Some responded by throwing rocks.</p>

<p>Protests were reported even in poor areas of Caracas that had been bastions of support for Maduro. Shots were heard in some areas.</p>

<p>The United Nations, United States, European Union and several Latin American countries called for a "transparent" process, while allies including China, Russia and Cuba congratulated Maduro.</p>

<p>Nine Latin American countries called in a joint statement for a "complete review of the results with the presence of independent electoral observers." Chile's president said the outcome was "hard to believe."</p>

<p>Amid the tensions, Peru recalled its ambassador and Panama said it was suspending relations with Venezuela. Caracas meanwhile said it was withdrawing diplomatic staff from Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Panama, Peru, the Dominican Republic and Uruguay.</p>

<h3><strong>'Bloodbath' warning</strong></h3>

<p>Independent polls had predicted Maduro would lose Sunday's vote.</p>

<p>He has been at the helm of the once-wealthy oil-rich country since 2013. Amid US sanctions and economic mismanagement, the past decade has seen GDP drop by 80 percent, pushing more than seven million of Venezuela's 30 million citizens to emigrate.</p>

<p>Maduro is accused of locking up critics and harassing the opposition in a climate of rising authoritarianism.</p>

<p>In the run-up to the election, he warned of a "bloodbath" if he lost.</p>

<p>Sunday's election was the product of a deal reached last year between the government and opposition.</p>

<p>That agreement led the United States to temporarily ease sanctions imposed after Maduro's 2018 reelection, rejected as a sham by dozens of Latin American and other countries.</p>

<p>Sanctions were snapped back after Maduro reneged on agreed conditions.</p>

<p>Venezuela boasts the world's largest oil reserves but production capacity has been severely diminished in recent years.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Kremlin on Tuesday dismissed as absurd U.S. intelligence assertions that Russia is seeking to meddle in the presidential election and said that U.S. spies were intent on casting Russia as an enemy.</p>

<p>U.S. intelligence officials have said that Russia is seeking to influence the November election, and that Moscow has used Russia-based influence-for-hire companies to shape U.S. public opinion.</p>

<p>"As for these accusations, they are absurd, and we strongly reject them," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said when asked about the reports from Washington.</p>

<p>"There will be a lot of such statements as the U.S. elections approach because Russia and the head of the Russian state personally are essentially significant factors that both Republicans and Democrats exploit during their political struggle, especially in the election campaign," said Peskov.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meta Platforms has agreed to pay $1.4 billion to Texas to resolve the state's lawsuit accusing the Facebook parent of illegally using facial-recognition technology to collect biometric data of millions of Texans without their consent.</p>

<p>The terms of the settlement, disclosed on Tuesday, marks the largest accord ever by any single state, according to the lawyers for Texas, whose legal team included the plaintiffs firm Keller Postman.</p>

<p>The lawsuit, filed in 2022, was the first major case to be brought under Texas' 2009 biometric privacy law, according to law firms tracking the litigation. A provision of the law provides damages of up to $25,000 per violation.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The U.S. Secret Service's new acting director said in prepared congressional testimony on Tuesday he was "ashamed" of a major security lapse that preceded the July 13 attempted assassination of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump at a Pennsy]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The U.S. Secret Service's new acting director said in prepared congressional testimony on Tuesday he was "ashamed" of a major security lapse that preceded the July 13 attempted assassination of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump at a Pennsylvania campaign rally.</p>

<p>In testimony released before addressing two Senate committees, Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe said he visited the outdoor rally site in Butler and climbed onto the roof of a nearby building from which 20-year-old Thomas Crooks fired shots that wounded Trump's right ear, killed one rally attendee and wounded two others, with an AR-15-style rifle.</p>

<p>"What I saw made me ashamed," Rowe said in the prepared testimony for a joint hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Judiciary Committees. "As a career law enforcement officer, and a 25-year veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured."</p>

<p>Rowe's admission of a glaring security lapse came a week after former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned under bipartisan congressional pressure after refusing to detail security shortfalls in testimony before a House of Representatives panel.</p>

<p>Rowe sought to assure lawmakers that he has since taken steps to prevent similar lapses from occurring amid concerns among both Democrats and Republicans about further political violence as the campaign intensifies ahead of the Nov. 5 U.S. election.</p>

<p>"I directed our personnel to ensure every event site security plan is thoroughly vetted by multiple experienced supervisors before it is implemented," Rowe said.</p>

<p>The Secret Service, a federal law enforcement agency whose duties including protecting the president and certain other top political figures, has added six people to its protection list since July 13, including Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance and his family and independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, while reinforcing security details, Rowe said.</p>

<p>Rowe was due to testify alongside Paul Abbate, deputy director of the FBI, which is due to interview Trump on Thursday as part of its investigation into the shooting.</p>

<p>The attempted assassination is the topic of multiple investigations by House and Senate committees, as well as a new bipartisan task force established by Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries.</p>

<p>Investigators have been unable to determine a clear motive for Crooks, who they have described as a loner with no close friends and a social network limited mainly to immediate family members. Much interest revolves around the timeline from when law enforcement officials first noticed Crooks to when Secret Service snipers killed him after he opened fire.</p>

<p>The FBI said on Monday that Crooks first came to the attention of police more than an hour before he fired at least eight shots at the former president.</p>

<p>A local officer took a photo of Crooks and sent it to other law enforcement officials at the scene. About 30 minutes later, SWAT team members saw Crooks using a rangefinder and browsing news sites, the FBI said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain on Tuesday urged its citizens in Lebanon to leave the country, warning that tensions along the Israeli border could worsen quickly.</p>

<p>"There are frequent artillery exchanges and air strikes, tensions are high, and the situation could deteriorate rapidly," Foreign Secretary David Lammy told parliament.</p>

<p>"I am working with foreign office consular teams to make sure we are prepared for all scenarios, but if this conflict escalates, the government cannot guarantee we will be able to evacuate everyone immediately. People may be forced to shelter in place."</p>

<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer chaired a meeting of the government's emergency response committee, known as COBRA, on the matter earlier on Tuesday, Lammy said.</p>

<p>"My message to British nationals in Lebanon is therefore quite simple: leave," Lammy said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Taylor Swift said she was "completely in shock" on Tuesday after mass stabbings in Southport, northern England, during a dance class themed around the US pop star left three girls dead.</p>

<p>Five young children and two adults remained in critical condition, with police confirming three girls aged six, seven and nine were killed in a stabbing spree at an events space in the seaside town near Liverpool.</p>

<p>The third girl, aged nine, died on Tuesday due to her injuries, while the other two died on Monday.</p>

<p>"The horror of yesterday's attack in Southport is washing over me continuously, and I'm just completely in shock," Swift wrote in an Instagram post about the incident, which also left eight others critically injured.</p>

<p>"I am at a complete loss for how to ever convey my sympathies to these families."</p>

<p>Swift fans also raised over £60,000 ($77,000) for the families of victims through a fundraiser on JustGiving.</p>

<p>Held at the start of the UK school holidays for children aged between 6 and 11, the event was a dance and yoga class with a bracelet-making activity. The organiser had posted on Facebook "Calling all Swifties!" to sign up for the workshop.</p>

<p>A fundraiser called "Swifties for Southport" was raising money for the families affected which would go to Alder Hey Children's Hospital, where some of the victims were taken by ambulance after the attack.</p>

<p>The fundraiser, made by the organisers of the Taylor Swift UK &amp; EU Facebook group, had raised £39,375 to support families and pay for the funerals of the two children who were killed.</p>

<p>"Every donation through this link goes directly to the verified charity" and will "help make a difference to those impacted in a time of great sadness", the organisers wrote on the fundraiser page.</p>

<p>A 17-year-old male was arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder. While the motivation of the attack was not clear, police confirmed it was not being treated as terror-related.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris launched a $50 million advertising blitz on Tuesday, capitalizing on the momentum of a fledgling campaign against Republican rival Donald Trump with a one-minute spot titled "Fearless."</p>

<p>It was Harris' first big ad buy since consolidating support for the Democratic nomination after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race on July 21 and endorsed her.</p>

<p>In addition to garnering the backing of big-money donors, Harris has sparked newfound energy among groups such as young voters that Biden had been struggling to win over.</p>

<p>Public opinion polls in the last week have shown Harris, 59, closing the gap with 78-year-old Trump, who still leads in some national surveys.</p>

<p>The ads will be rolled out on television as well as streaming and social channels across election battleground states in the weeks before the Democratic National Convention that starts on Aug. 19.</p>

<p>The first ad in the campaign begins with images of Harris as a little girl and follows her progression to a prosecutor, attorney general and U.S. vice president. "The one thing Kamala Harris has always been: fearless," the ad says.</p>

<p>Since stepping into her new role, Harris has focused on Trump's felony convictions in a hush-money trial involving a porn star and the other criminal charges he faces, and portrayed him as responsible for a wave of anti-abortion measures in Republican-led states around the country.</p>

<p>The Harris campaign's ad buy dwarfed the $10 million advertising buy announced by Trump's campaign on Monday, to be launched in six battleground states this week as it tries to counter a surge of voter enthusiasm and donations for Harris.</p>

<p>That was Trump's biggest ad buy since January.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gaza's civil defence agency said Tuesday that an Israeli operation in and around the territory's second city of Khan Younis killed about 300 people since it began last week, while the army said it had "eliminated 150 terrorists".</p>

<p>"Since the beginning of the Israeli ground invasion of the eastern part of Khan Younis province, the civil defence and medical teams have recovered approximately 300 bodies of martyrs, many of them decomposed," agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP.</p>

<p>The Israeli military launched the assault on July 22 to halt rocket fire from the area, which already saw heavy fighting earlier this year.</p>

<p>Last week, it said troops had retrieved the bodies of five Israelis from the area.</p>

<p>They had been killed during the Hamas attacks of October 7 and their bodies taken back to Gaza, the military said.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the military said it had completed the operation in the area of Khan Younis and had killed "over 150 terrorists".</p>

<p>It said troops also "dismantled terror tunnels, weapons storage facilities, and terrorist infrastructure and located weapons".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance described the last-minute entry of Kamala Harris into the US presidential race as a "sucker punch," according to a recording of his remarks at a fundraiser obtained by The Washington Post.</p>

<p>In remarks contrasting with his campaign's public messaging -- but revealing the upheaval in a race that had seemed set to feature Donald Trump against Joe Biden -- Vance told donors over the weekend that "all of us were hit with a little bit of a political sucker punch."</p>

<p>The Vance-Trump campaign has insisted that the Democratic vice president's entry into the race won't upend their strategy, and that Harris is tied to her boss Biden's policies.</p>

<p>"Nothing fundamentally changes," senior Trump advisor Jason Miller told AFP at the Republican National Convention earlier this month, as speculation was brewing that Biden might drop out.</p>

<p>"Whether it's Joe Biden or Kamala Harris, or any other radical liberal Democrats, they all share responsibility for the failure of destroying our economy and ruining our borders."</p>

<p>But Vance reportedly warned that "Harris does not have the same baggage as Joe Biden, because whatever we might have to say, Kamala is a lot younger."</p>

<p>"And Kamala Harris is obviously not struggling in the same ways that Joe Biden did."</p>

<p>Harris has emerged as the all-but-sure Democratic nominee after 81-year-old Biden's shock decision to step away from his reelection bid, dogged by concerns over his age and mental acuity.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least five Russian political prisoners have been moved from jails and prison colonies in recent days, in an apparently coordinated move that has raised speculation of a possible prisoner exchange.</p>

<p>Russia has sentenced dozens to lengthy terms of incarceration for opposing the Kremlin and Moscow's military offensive against Ukraine.</p>

<p>Prison transfers are notoriously murky in Russia, with family and lawyers provided no details and prisoners often losing contact with the outside world for weeks.</p>

<p>But they usually occur after a conviction or lost appeal, and the disappearance of several high-profile political prisoners at once is extremely rare.</p>

<p>"Apparently, we are on the cusp of a very large-scale exchange," Russian political analyst Tatiana Stanovaya said Tuesday on Telegram.</p>

<p>Lawyers for jailed opposition politician Ilya Yashin said on Tuesday he had been moved from his penal colony in the western region of Smolensk, where he was serving eight and a half years for breaching Russia's military censorship laws.</p>

<p>"Ilya Yashin was sent from the colony to an unknown destination," said his Telegram channel, which is run by his lawyers and supporters.</p>

<p>Two aides of late opposition leader Alexei Navalny -- Lilia Chanysheva and Ksenia Fadeyeva -- also disappeared from their prison colonies in recent days.</p>

<p>They ran regional headquarters for Navalny and were sentenced on "extremism" charges.</p>

<p>Chanysheva's husband said on X that she had been moved from her prison in Siberia on July 26.</p>

<p>In the case of Fadeyeva, prison officials in Novosibirsk "refused to answer her lawyer's questions about where she was taken to, when, and what it was in connection with", her allies wrote on Monday on Telegram.</p>

<p>Supporters for artist Alexandra Skochilenko, jailed for seven years for replacing supermarket price tags with messages opposing the Ukraine offensive, also said she had been moved from a jail in Saint Petersburg.</p>

<p>And rights campaigner Oleg Orlov, a key figure in the Nobel-winning Memorial group, was similarly moved from his detention centre, his lawyers said on Monday.</p>

<p>He was still contesting his conviction of two and a half years for "discrediting" the Russian army, Memorial said in a social media post.</p>

<p>The United States and Moscow have both said they are actively discussing an exchange for US journalist Evan Gershkovich -- convicted in a fast-track trial earlier this month to 16 years for spying in a case rejected as a "sham" by his employer and the White House.</p>

<p>After Navalny's death in an Arctic prison colony in February, President Vladimir Putin said he had given approval for talks on releasing him as part of a deal with the West.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UK police on Tuesday questioned a 17-year-old suspect arrested after a "ferocious" knife attack which killed three children and critically injured eight others.</p>

<p>Flowers, teddy bears and tributes were left near the scene of Monday's stabbing spree at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport, near Liverpool, that also saw two adults and six children critically injured and three more children hurt.</p>

<p>Police chief Serena Kennedy said the two adults were trying to protect the children, aged between six and 11.</p>

<p>Swift on Tuesday said she was "completely in shock".</p>

<p>"The loss of life and innocence, and the horrendous trauma inflicted on everyone who was there, the families, and first responders. These were just little kids at a dance class. I am at a complete loss for how to ever convey my sympathies to these families," she said.</p>

<p>Residents of Southport, a small seaside town popular with visitors in the summer, were still coming to terms with the attack.</p>

<p>"I'm just still in total shock -- I just cannot believe that it happened so close to home," Leanne Hassan told reporters on Tuesday.</p>

<p>She had rushed to collect her daughter from a nearby nursery which was locked down after the attack.</p>

<p>Her daughter was safe, "but unfortunately that's not the reality for a lot of parents waking up today," she added.</p>

<p>Police chief Kennedy confirmed the attack was not being treated as terror-related and that the attacker's motivation was unclear.</p>

<h3><strong>Establishing motive</strong></h3>

<p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the events were "just truly awful, the whole country is deeply shocked".</p>

<p>"It is almost impossible to imagine the grief," he added.</p>

<p>Interior minister Yvette Cooper visited Southport Tuesday to meet Kennedy and other officials, with an evening vigil to be held for the victims.</p>

<p>Starmer is likely to visit the community as well, Chancellor Rachel Reeves told Sky News.</p>

<p>The 17-year-old male arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder is from a neighbouring village called Banks and was born in the Welsh capital Cardiff, Merseyside Police said.</p>

<p>Witnesses told UK media the attacker was seen arriving at the scene in a taxi, and that he entered the venue wearing a mask.</p>

<p>Police said officers were called to the incident shortly before 1100 GMT on Monday, just minutes before the dance event was scheduled to end.</p>

<p>Armed officers detained the suspect nearby and seized a knife.</p>

<p>The suspect was in custody at a police station Tuesday and police said enquiries were ongoing "to establish the motive for this tragic incident".</p>

<p>Targeted attacks on children are extremely rare in the UK.</p>

<h3><strong>Horror movie</strong></h3>

<p>Monday's incident evoked memories of a school massacre in the Scottish town of Dunblane in 1996, which claimed the lives of 16 young pupils and their teacher in Britain's worst mass shooting.</p>

<p>The North West Ambulance Service said it treated 11 casualties with stab injuries, who were then taken by ambulance and helicopter to Alder Hey Children's Hospital and other hospitals in the area.</p>

<p>Local business owner Colin Parry, one of the people who called police, told the Press Association (PA) news agency that he believed several "young girls" had been stabbed.</p>

<p>A member of his staff also saw "about 10 kids go running past him, all bleeding, and one of them collapsed on the floor outside the neighbour next door," he recounted.</p>

<p>Bare Varathan, who owns a local shop, told PA he saw "seven to 10 kids" who were "injured, bleeding".</p>

<p>Other witnesses told UK media they heard screams, comparing the attack to a scene from a horror film.</p>

<p>King Charles III offered his "most heartfelt condolences, prayers and deepest sympathies" and called the incident "utterly horrific".</p>

<p>Prince William and his wife Katherine posted on X that "as parents, we cannot begin to imagine what the families, friends and loved ones of those killed and injured in Southport today are going through", calling it a "heinous attack".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Apple Vision Pro is the newest tool for Australians to access three-dimensional, immersive online environments, also known as the metaverse. Released in Australia this month, it allows users to take a virtual walk in the savanna from their homes.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Apple Vision Pro is the <a href="https://www.apple.com/au/newsroom/2024/06/apple-vision-pro-is-available-to-pre-order/#:%7E:text=Starting%20today%2C%20customers%20can%20visit,Australia%20beginning%20Friday%2C%20July%2012.">newest</a> tool for Australians to access three-dimensional, immersive online environments, also known as the metaverse. Released in Australia earlier this month, it allows users to take a (virtual) walk in the savanna from their living room, watch sports matches in an immersive environment, or even buy a house after completing a virtual inspection.</p>

<p>But these new online environments also have the potential to enable new crimes.</p>

<p><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11227-023-05045-1">Metacrimes</a> are those crimes occurring in the metaverse. They challenge our definitions of crimes in the digital realm, because they do not fit into existing frameworks of reporting and investigating crime.</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://researchoutput.csu.edu.au/en/publications/metacrime-and-cybercrime-exploring-the-convergence-and-divergence">new study</a> tackles this problem by shedding light on the key characteristics of metacrimes. And by understanding these crimes better, we will be better able to fight them.</p>

<h2>Metaverse, metacrime and cybercrime</h2>

<p>The metaverse is a loose term describing a kind of three-dimensional, virtual world that users access via a virtual reality headset.</p>

<p>The 2018 movie Ready Player One provides a good visualisation of what the metaverse might look like. In the movie, people put on special goggles and pick their avatar to enter a massive, interactive digital universe where they can do almost anything.</p>

<p>Our research found crimes committed in the metaverse have commonalities with conventional cybercrime. For example, both involve different kinds of illegal activities happening online or in virtual spaces. As technology gets better, these crimes are also becoming more global and anonymous. This makes it near impossible to catch the perpetrators.</p>

<p>But we also found a number of metacrime features that do not overlap with conventional cybercrime.</p>

<h2>The unique features of metacrimes</h2>

<p>One such feature is immersive VR attacks, which are made to feel real through <a href="https://digitalcommons.lmunet.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1190&amp;context=lmulrev">immersion and spatial presence</a>.</p>

<p>Immersion is created through a number of sensory techniques in the headset, including visual, sound and haptic (touch). This creates a feeling of spatial presence that allows the user to perceive and experience the virtual space as real. This means negative experiences such as sexual violence and harassment also feel real.</p>

<p>Unless you are constantly recording your interactions in the metaverse via your headset, crucial evidence of that unpleasant interaction would not be captured. Some companies have created user controls, such as a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-owner-meta-adds-tool-guard-against-harassment-metaverse-2022-02-04/">safety bubble</a> that can be activated around your avatar. However, we do not yet have sufficient research to know whether these are effective.</p>

<figure><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/edc05hUfwQ8?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0" width="650"></iframe>

<figcaption><span class="caption">Metaverse: Why it's already unsafe for women.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Our study argues the impact of metacrimes will also be exacerbated for vulnerable populations, especially children who occupy a large proportion of active metaverse users. Difficulties in verifying children's age online add extra concerns about grooming and minor abuse.</p>

<p>These risks are not hypothetical.</p>

<p>In 2022, researchers from the Center for Countering Digital Hate conducted 11 hours and 30 minutes of recorded user interactions on Meta's Oculus headset in the popular VRChat. They <a href="https://counterhate.com/research/facebooks-metaverse/">found</a> that users, including children, encounter abusive behaviour approximately every seven minutes.</p>

<p>Bullying and sexual harassment was also rife, and minors were often manipulated into using racist slurs and promoting extremist ideas.</p>

<figure><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sUHugSKBryw?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0" width="650"></iframe>

<figcaption><span class="caption">Sexual harassment in the metaverse is one of many safety concerns.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In January 2024, police in the United Kingdom launched the first case of rape in the metaverse after a 16-year-old girl's avatar was attacked. Police <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/05/metaverse-sexual-assault-vr-game-online-safety-meta">reported</a> the victim suffered psychological and emotional trauma, similar to an attack in the physical world.</p>

<p>The outcomes of the case are currently pending and are likely to set a legal precedent for the protection of minors in the metaverse. At the moment, metacrime presents new challenges in defining, measuring and pursuing avatars' liability that conventional cybercrime does not usually confront.</p>

<p>We also found other risks including hacking and recording of a person's environment. Manipulation of VR technologies, such as haptic suites that enable users to physically engage with virtual spaces, also enable perpetrators to inflict direct physical harm on users.</p>

<p>This can include inflicting <a href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-vestibular-research/ves00462">visual vertigo</a>, <a href="https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-0033-1354602">motion sickness</a>, and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-94680-w">neurologic symptoms</a>.</p>

<h2>Where to from here?</h2>

<p>Major tech companies such as Apple, Meta and Microsoft are <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666281723001208?via%3Dihub#bib10">investing</a> heavily in the metaverse, developing both hardware and software to enhance their platforms. Research firm Gartner <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-02-07-gartner-predicts-25-percent-of-people-will-spend-at-least-one-hour-per-day-in-the-metaverse-by-2026">predicted</a> by 2026, 25% of people will spend at least an hour each day in the metaverse for work, shopping, education, social media and entertainment.</p>

<p>This prediction may be not too far away from reality. Australia's eSafety Commissioner's national online safety survey conducted in 2022 <a href="https://www.esafety.gov.au/research/the-metaverse">found</a> 49% of metaverse users said they had entered the metaverse at least once a month in the last year.</p>

<p>It is therefore urgent that governments and tech companies develop metaverse-specific legal and regulatory frameworks to safeguard immersive virtual environments. National and international legal frameworks will need to account for the new characteristics of metacrime we have identified. Law enforcement will need to <a href="https://www.interpol.int/content/download/20828/file/Metaverse%20-%20a%20law%20enforcement%20perspective.pdf">upskill</a> in metacrime reporting and investigations.</p>

<p>In the past, companies have talked about using new technologies responsibly – but <a href="https://www.jbe-platform.com/content/journals/10.1075/ps.21063.liu">haven't taken responsibility</a> when their platforms were used for crimes and harms. Instead, tech leaders deploy what researchers are now calling an “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-011-0915-9">artful apology</a>” (for example, “I'm sorry you experienced this on our platform”).</p>

<p>But this does nothing tangible to tackle the problem, and metaverse companies should instil clear regulatory frameworks for their virtual environments to make them safe for everyone to inhabit.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A third child died on Tuesday and five others remained critically injured after a knife attack on a Taylor Swift-themed dance event in a quiet seaside community in northern England, police said.</p>

<p>The nine-year-old girl died in hospital early Tuesday, Merseyside Police said, as the force confirmed that two victims who died in the "ferocious" stabbing spree Monday were also girls, aged six and seven.</p>

<p>Eight other children suffered stab wounds during the attack in Southport, near Liverpool, which has shocked the UK and beyond. Two adults were also in a critical condition after being injured.</p>

<p>A 17-year-old male suspect from a nearby village arrested shortly after the incident remained in custody, police added, as they warned against speculating about his identity or details of the investigation.</p>

<p>"This incident is not currently being treated as terror-related and we are not looking for anyone else in connection with it," Merseyside Police said in its latest update.</p>

<p>Hours earlier, US pop star Swift took to social media to say she was "completely in shock" over "the loss of life and innocence, and the horrendous trauma inflicted on everyone".</p>

<p>"These were just little kids at a dance class. I am at a complete loss for how to ever convey my sympathies to these families," she added on Instagram.</p>

<p>Visiting the scene of the attack to lay flowers and meet local officials, interior minister Yvette Cooper said police were pursuing "every single avenue" as part of "a serious criminal investigation".</p>

<p>"This was a horrific attack," she told reporters.</p>

<h3><strong>Deeply shocked</strong></h3>

<p>Residents of Southport, a small seaside town popular with summer visitors, were still coming to terms with the attack.</p>

<p>"The town is in shock and in mourning", local MP Patrick Hurley told AFP, calling it the "most horrific atrocity that Southport has experienced in living memory".</p>

<p>It is a "very small town, a close-knit community and everybody will be intimately affected by this", he added.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has called the events "just truly awful" and said "the whole country is deeply shocked".</p>

<p>He is likely to visit the community later Tuesday. An evening vigil will also be held.</p>

<p>"I just cannot believe that it happened so close to home," Leanne Hassan told reporters Tuesday.</p>

<p>Hassan had rushed to collect her daughter from a nearby nursery which was locked down after the attack.</p>

<p>Her daughter was safe, "but unfortunately that's not the reality for a lot of parents waking up today," she added.</p>

<p>Police have revealed the children at the event were aged between six and 11, and the two adults injured were trying to protect them.</p>

<p>Tributes have been paid on social media to the bravery of dance and yoga teacher Leanne Lucas, who was among the victims.</p>

<p>Local business owner Colin Parry, one of those to call police, recounted to UK media members of his staff seeing "about 10 kids go running past him, all bleeding".</p>

<p>"One of them collapsed on the floor outside the neighbour next door," he told the Press Association (PA) news agency.</p>

<p>Bare Varathan, who owns a local shop, told PA he saw "seven to 10 kids" who were "injured, bleeding".</p>

<h3><strong>Utterly horrific</strong></h3>

<p>The teen male arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder is from neighbouring village Banks but was born in the Welsh capital Cardiff, according to police.</p>

<p>His identity and a possible motive for the attack have not been revealed.</p>

<p>"A name has been shared on social media in connection with the suspect," police said Tuesday.</p>

<p>"This name is incorrect and we would urge people not to speculate on details of the incident while the investigation is ongoing."</p>

<p>Witnesses told UK media the attacker was seen arriving at the scene in a taxi late Monday morning, and that he entered the venue wearing a mask.</p>

<p>Armed officers detained the suspect nearby and seized a knife.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vice President Kamala Harris, tasked to deal with the root causes of migration from Central America as illegal border crossings were rising in 2021, immediately ran into the enormity of the mission.</p>

<p>The region is riddled with corrupt government officials, the drivers of migration are deeply rooted in economic inequality and social factors - and she didn't control the border.</p>

<p>"She was given a very hard, difficult, convoluted portfolio," said U.S. Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee and an architect of a bipartisan border security bill introduced earlier this year.</p>

<p>At campaign rallies and in social media posts, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has intensified his attacks on Harris as a failed "border czar," especially now that she has emerged as the likely Democratic nominee after President Joe Biden ended his campaign for reelection this month.</p>

<p>Despite Harris' efforts, some 7 million migrants have been arrested illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border under Biden, according to government data, all-time highs that have fueled Republican criticism.</p>

<p>The reality of Harris's record on migration is far more complicated, according to interviews with three current Biden officials, 13 former officials and others tracking the issue.</p>

<p>First, Harris was never given the portfolio of border czar, said Alan Bersin, who embraced the label as a special representative for border affairs under Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. "This was not the job assigned to VP Harris," he said.</p>

<p>Instead, Biden asked Harris to lead diplomatic efforts to reduce poverty, violence and corruption in Central America's Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, as well as engage with Mexico on the issue.</p>

<p>It was similar to the job Biden had when he was vice president.</p>

<p>But that was an overly broad mission, Murphy said.</p>

<p>"It's hard in a short period of time to come up with a strategy that impacts the very real and complicated psychological decision-making that people in those countries go through when they're deciding to come to the United States," Murphy said in a phone interview.</p>

<p>And within months of Harris taking the job, the focus on the three Central American countries was out of step with the reality at the border - where illegal immigration from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela was spiking, several former officials and outside experts said.</p>

<p>"She started off, in a sense, at a disadvantage because everyone was focusing on those three countries in the Northern Triangle," said Roberta Jacobson, who served as a coordinator for the U.S.-Mexico border in the early months of the Biden administration. "Meanwhile, the migrant population was changing dramatically."</p>

<p>Harris continued to lead the Central America effort although she has increasingly focused on abortion rights this year, a top Democratic issue since a 2022 U.S. Supreme Court decision struck down the nationwide right to an abortion.</p>

<p>The White House said in March that Harris helped engineer $4 billion in government aid and commitments of $5.2 billion in private investment to create or support an estimated 250,000 jobs in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.</p>

<p>Nespresso started sourcing coffee from El Salvador and Honduras in 2021. Gap Inc said it is on pace to meet a pledge to invest $150 million by 2025 to source textiles in the region and that it had increased yarn production in Guatemala and provided skills training to women in Guatemala and Honduras.</p>

<p>Ricardo Barrientos, director of the Central American Institute of Fiscal Studies think tank, said the U.S. aid and private sector investment was a fraction of the remittances migrants from the three countries working in the U.S. send home each year - $37 billion last year alone.</p>

<p>"It's very small compared to the magnitude of the challenge," he said. "Or some would say, 'too little, too late.'"</p>

<p>By May, the number of migrants from the Northern Triangle caught crossing illegally had fallen to 25,000 from a peak of 90,000 in July 2021 - although experts say the impact of Harris' efforts remain unclear.</p>

<p>'Border Czar'</p>

<p>Harris made two trips to Central America: Guatemala in June 2021 and Honduras in January 2022. That was one fewer than Biden, who made three trips to Guatemala after he was assigned a similar role in 2014.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Republicans began identifying Harris with rising illegal crossings and called on her to visit the border. She made her first and only visit to U.S. border operations in El Paso, Texas, in June 2021, where she defended her portfolio.</p>

<p>"The reality of it is that we have to deal with causes, and we have to deal with the effects," she told reporters at the airport.</p>

<p>During the six-hour visit, Harris toured a migrant processing center, speaking with a group of girls, her office said at the time. But she did not tour the border wall on foot, according to pool reports, which Trump officials did routinely.</p>

<p>Raul Ortiz, the Border Patrol chief from 2021-2023, said he never spoke with Biden or Harris although he met with Trump and then Vice President Mike Pence more than once despite holding a lower rank during that administration.</p>

<p>"I would have liked to have had an opportunity to discuss some of the issues and some of the recommended changes that I thought we should have implemented," Ortiz said.</p>

<p>The White House said in March that Ortiz had been invited to join Biden in El Paso last year and did not attend, although Ortiz contested that, saying he was not invited.</p>

<p>Liability Or Asset</p>

<p>Immigration is the third-highest concern of U.S. voters behind the economy and extremism, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll in June, and voters favored Trump's approach to immigration over Biden's 44%-31%.</p>

<p>In an attack ad rolled out on July 25, the Trump campaign portrayed Harris as a liberal who was soft on crime and in favor of "open borders." The ad highlighted years-old Harris comments saying people who cross the border illegally should not be considered criminals, and that the U.S. should "probably think about starting from scratch" when it comes to immigration enforcement.</p>

<p>"If border czar Harris stays in charge, every week will bring a never-ending stream of illegal alien rapists, bloodthirsty killers and child predators to go after our sons and our daughters," Trump said at a rally in North Carolina last week.</p>

<p>The Harris campaign in a statement to Reuters portrayed Trump as an extremist whose administration separated thousands of migrant families and who helped sink the bipartisan border security bill in the U.S. Senate - messaging in line with Biden's approach over the past year.</p>

<p>"There's only one candidate in this race who will fight for real solutions to help secure our nation's border, and that's Vice President Harris," campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz said in a statement.</p>

<p>Some immigration advocates hope that Harris - herself the daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants - would better understand the humanitarian side of the issue.</p>

<p>Harris was instrumental in the Biden administration's rollout of a program in June to offer a path to citizenship to immigrants in the U.S. illegally who are married to U.S. citizens, two people familiar with the matter said.</p>

<p>Daniel Suvor, Harris' chief of policy between 2014 and 2017 when she was California attorney general, pointed to her efforts to marshal legal representation for unaccompanied immigrant children - even though immigration was not explicitly part of her portfolio.</p>

<p>She took it on herself to learn about the application process for special visas for victims of abuse, Suvor said. And she teamed up with Brad Smith, then the general counsel for Microsoft and co-founder of the advocacy group Kids in Need of Defense, and started calling law firms.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US defence secretary said on Tuesday he did not believe a fight was inevitable between Hezbollah and Israel though he remained concerned about the potential for escalation after a deadly rocket strike in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.</p>

<p>Tensions have worsened since Saturday when the rocket killed 12 children and teenagers at a football pitch in a Druze village. Israel accused the Iran-backed Hezbollah and vowed a harsh response. Hezbollah has denied involvement.</p>

<p>The United States has been leading a diplomatic effort to deter Israel from striking Lebanon's capital Beirut or major civil infrastructure in response to the attack, five people with knowledge of the drive told Reuters on Monday.</p>

<p>Hezbollah and Israel have been trading fire across the Lebanese-Israeli border since October, their worst conflict since a 2006 war. The hostilities, sparked by the war in Gaza, have so far been largely been contained to areas near the frontier.</p>

<p>Though both sides have previously indicated they do not seek a wider confrontation, the hostilities have prompted concerns about the risk of a slide towards a wider, more destructive conflict between the heavily armed adversaries.</p>

<p>"While we've seen a lot of activity on Israel's northern border, we remain concerned about the potential of this escalating into a full-blown fight. And I don't believe that a fight is inevitable," US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said.</p>

<p>"We'd like to see things resolved in a diplomatic fashion," he added during a joint press conference in Manila, following security talks between himself, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and their respective Philippine counterparts.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said it struck around 10 Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon overnight and killed one of the group's fighters - attacks which appeared to be in keeping with the pattern of violence over the last nine months.</p>

<p>Hezbollah confirmed one of its fighters had been killed.</p>

<p>Two Israeli officials said on Monday that Israel wanted to hurt Hezbollah but not drag the Middle East into all-out war.</p>

<p>Some flights at Beirut's international airport have been cancelled or delayed this week due to the heightened tensions.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has denied firing the rocket that killed the youngsters in the village of Majdal Shams. It said on Saturday it had fired a missile against a military target on the Golan, a border region Israel seized from Syria in 1967.</p>

<p>Hezbollah began firing across the border into Israel in October in what it says is solidarity with the Palestinians and Palestinian Islamist militant allies Hamas. Tens of thousands of people have since fled or been evacuated from towns and villages on both sides of the frontier.</p>

<p>Since October, Israeli strikes have killed around 350 Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon and more than 100 civilians, according to security and medical sources and a Reuters tally of Hezbollah death notifications.</p>

<p>Israel says 23 civilians and at least 17 soldiers have been killed in Hezbollah attacks since October.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seven people died and three were missing after heavy rain and flooding hit central China's Hunan province, state media reported Tuesday.</p>

<p>China is enduring a summer of extreme weather, with heavy rains battering swathes of the country and many regions enduring sweltering heat waves.</p>

<p>The country is by far the world's largest emitter of the greenhouse gases that scientists say drive climate change and make extreme weather more frequent and intense.</p>

<p>In Hunan's Yongxing county, three people missing since last Wednesday were confirmed dead after a landslide.</p>

<p>Four more were killed and three remain missing in Zixing, where more than 11,000 people were evacuated after the city experienced record rainfall -- some areas receiving 645 millimetres (25 inches) in just 24 hours -- state news agency Xinhua reported on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The rains damaged nearly 900 homes and caused 1,345 road collapses, Xinhua added. Around 5,400 rescuers have been dispatched to help those affected.</p>

<p>The downpours have been caused by the remnants of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/typhoon-gaemi-climate-change-intensifies-rainfall-patterns-typhoons-warn-scientists-6191581" target="_blank">Typhoon Gaemi</a>, which made landfall in eastern China on Thursday, with Hunan particularly hard hit.</p>

<p>On Sunday, a landslide destroyed a guesthouse and killed 15 people, while elsewhere in the province nearly 4,000 residents were evacuated after a dam breach.</p>

<p>On Monday, China's National Meteorological Centre issued an orange alert, the second highest level, for rainstorms across much of the south, southwest, and centre of the country, as well as the capital Beijing, Hebei province, and Tianjin in the north.</p>

<p>In northeastern Liaoning province, more than 10,000 people were evacuated from areas near the Yalu River, on the border with North Korea, as waters rose.</p>

<p>Disaster agencies in the country have allocated 110,000 items of relief supplies to support emergency relocation of those affected and provide basic supplies in Liaoning, Jilin, Hunan, and Shaanxi provinces, state broadcaster CCTV reported.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Harvey Dominy, a 21-year-old British tourist, was found dead in his hotel room in Benidorm, Spain. According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj50687lzqeo">BBC</a></em>, he had been on a trip with friends, who left the room around 7pm on July 16 and returned later to find him unresponsive on the floor.&nbsp;Emergency crews were called, but Mr Dominy was pronounced dead at the scene.&nbsp;</p>

<p>An inquest into his death was opened at Pontypridd Coroners' Court on July 29. The court was informed that it is believed Mr Dominy died between 9pm and 10.30 that evening.&nbsp;Though a post-mortem examination was conducted, it did not provide a provisional cause of death.</p>

<p>Mckenzy Dominy, his brother, paid tribute to him and said, ''My brother Harvey's radiant smile was his trademark, a beacon of joy that never dimmed despite life's challenges. From his first night, when doctors doubted he'd survive his first 24 hours, to his very last day, Harvey faced each hurdle with unwavering courage and a grin that could light up all of Merthyr. His passing leaves a void deeper than words can express. We've lost more than a brother, son, nephew, or grandson - we've lost our guiding light, our heart. Harvey lived every moment to its fullest, and in his memory, we'll continue to fight and embrace life, just as he did.''</p>

<p>A <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/harvey-dominy?lang=en_GB&amp;utm_campaign=fp_sharesheet&amp;utm_medium=customer&amp;utm_source=copy_link">GoFundMe page established by Joanne Taylor</a>, a family friend of Harvey Dominy, has surpassed its target, raising almost 14,000 pounds to help bring him home. The initial goal was 12,745 pounds. On the page, Joanne wrote: "I'm setting up this GoFundMe for a dear family friend, as well as for Harvey's brothers, Ricky and Mckenzie.</p>

<p>As they have recently lost their beautiful kind hearted beloved son &amp; brother, we as a community always pull together in these difficult times to help others, as we all know losing someone special is hard enough without the financial side of it too, so I'd be very greatful if you could donate to this page to take some pressure off Harvey's family as it's costing between 7,000 - 12,000 to get him home where he belongs, thank you so so much."</p>

<p>The investigation into the cause of Mr Dominy's death continues.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jailed former prime minister and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf founder Imran Khan has approached an Anti-Terrorism Court here seeking bail in 12 cases linked to last year's May 9 riots, a media report said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The 71-year-old former cricketer-turned-politician's legal team, led by lawyer Salman Safdar, has filed the petitions, the Express Tribune reported on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Mr Khan, who is currently on judicial remand in all the cases, claims that there is no recovery to be made from him. He argues that the cases are based on malice and are a form of political retaliation against him.</p>

<p>The petitions request the court to grant post-arrest bail in these cases.</p>

<p>Recently, the Lahore High Court (LHC) provided major relief to Mr Khan by declaring his physical remand in several May 9 cases null and void.</p>

<p>LHC division bench comprising Justices Tariq Saleem and Anwarul Haq had passed the order on petitions filed by Mr Khan challenging the ATC's decision to approve his physical remand in the cases related to the May 9 violence.</p>

<p>After hearing the arguments of the prosecutor general and Mr Khan's counsel, the LHC set aside the anti-terrorism court's decision to grant his physical remand noting that he will remain in judicial custody in these cases.</p>

<p>The May 9 riots in 2023 were triggered nationwide after Mr Khan was arrested by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) in a 190-million-pound corruption case. He faces over 200 cases and has been in jail since August last year.</p>

<p>Mr Khan has been imprisoned at the high-security Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi for almost a year upon his conviction in three cases - the Toshakhana corruption case, the cipher case, and the un-Islamic marriage case -- in which his wife, Bushra Bibi, is also jailed.</p>

<p>Though Mr Khan had secured bail or his conviction was set aside, he has not been released.</p>

<p>Mr Khan was arrested on August 5 last year after his conviction in the first Toshakhana corruption case filed by the Election Commission of Pakistan.</p>

<p>Since then, he has been kept in jail in various cases.</p>

<p>The PTI believes he is being arrested in more cases at the behest of the powerful military establishment to make sure that he does not come out of jail.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seventeen human skulls buried in metal boxes have been unearthed at a suspected shrine in the centre of Uganda, police told AFP on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Children foraging for firewood outside Kabanga village near Mpigi town, about 40 kilometres (24 miles) west of the capital Kampala, made the grisly discovery on Monday, according to local media.</p>

<p>Police said residents told officers there were metallic boxes containing what appeared to be skulls buried in a shrine.</p>

<p>"We swiftly moved in and dug up the place, and so far we have recovered 17 human skulls," regional police spokesman Majid Karim told AFP.</p>

<p>"We are conducting more excavations to ensure there are no more skulls other than what we have so far recovered," he said.</p>

<p>He added that the remains were being examined to determine their age and sex, as well as when they may have been buried.</p>

<p>He urged the public to remain calm, saying some residents had been left in shock.</p>

<p>Officers will "investigate the matter to establish the circumstances surrounding the recovery of these skulls and who could be behind this act", Karim said.</p>

<p>It is not clear how the skulls ended up at the site.</p>

<p>Local media reported residents as saying that people had previously gathered at the location to worship.</p>

<p>Police said the suspected owner of the site is on the run, having been linked to a separate case involving the murder of a prominent traditional Baganda leader, entrepreneur Daniel Bbosa.</p>

<p>The killing in Kampala was reportedly carried out by hired gunmen as Bbosa returned home from work in February this year.</p>

<p>Mpigi district, although densely populated, remains semi-rural, with agriculture dominating local trade.</p>

<p>Coffee and bananas are the major cash crops and staple foods, and there is a major road linking the villages to Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda and Tanzania.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Taliban government has severed consular ties with swathes of Afghan embassies in Western countries, Kabul said Tuesday, cutting off diplomats loyal to the former foreign-backed administration.</p>

<p>The 2021 Taliban takeover left diplomats staffing Afghanistan's foreign missions in limbo, having pledged to serve a government which collapsed in chaos after the withdrawal of US troops.</p>

<p>No country has yet formally recognised the Taliban government but in the past three years the Kabul authorities have installed Taliban ambassadors in some neighbouring embassies.</p>

<p>But Afghanistan's foreign ministry said Tuesday it now "bears no responsibility" for credentials including passports and visas issued by missions out of step with Kabul's new rulers.</p>

<p>The embassies include those in the cities of London and Berlin as well as the countries of Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, France, Italy, Greece, Poland, Sweden, Norway, Canada and Australia.</p>

<p>"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly urged the Afghan political and consular missions in European countries to engage with Kabul," a statement said.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, the actions of most of the missions are carried out arbitrarily, without coordination and in explicit violation of the existing accepted principles."</p>

<p>The statement said Afghans living abroad should deal instead with missions affiliated with the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan -- the self-styled name the Taliban have given the country under their rule.</p>

<p>Pakistan, China and Russia are among Afghan embassies working on order from the Taliban government.</p>

<p>Embassies cut off from Kabul have found themselves in dire financial straits, relying heavily on consular fees to pay staff salaries, rent and bills.</p>

<p>Without that income they may struggle to remain open.</p>

<p>The foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment on its future plans for the ostracised embassies.</p>

<p>Since surging back to power by force after a two-decade insurgency, Taliban officials have campaigned to be Afghanistan's sole representatives on the international stage.</p>

<p>Considered pariahs over their treatment of women, they have been denied an ambassador to the United Nations.</p>

<p>However at UN-hosted talks in Doha last month they represented Afghanistan -- with civil society groups including women's activists excluded from the main talks.</p>

<p>Analysts, rights campaigners and diplomats are split over whether to engage with the Taliban government in a bid to soften their stance or freeze them out until they backtrack.</p>

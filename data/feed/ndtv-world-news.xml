       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran could launch a "significant" attack on Israel as soon as this week, the White House said Monday, as US President Joe Biden discussed the crisis with European leaders.</p>

<p>"We have to be prepared for what could be a significant set of attacks," National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters.</p>

<p>"We share the same concerns and expectations that our Israeli counterparts have with respect to potential timing here -- could be this week," added Kirby.</p>

<p>Kirby's comments came as the United States is rushing an aircraft carrier strike group and a guided missile submarine to the region in a show of support for Israel.</p>

<p>Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah group have vowed to avenge last month's killings of Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh and Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr.</p>

<p>Biden called the leaders of France, Germany, Italy and Britain on Monday to discuss the growing tensions, the White House added.</p>

<p>The call was "largely for all the leaders to repeat what they have said before in terms of reaffirming Israel's defense" and to "send a strong message that we don't want to see any rise in violence, any attacks by Iran or its proxies."</p>

<p>The leaders also called for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, with difficult talks set for Thursday on halting the conflict that started when the Palestinian group attacked Israel on October 7.</p>

<p>The call came shortly after Biden returned to the Oval Office after a long weekend at his beach house in Delaware.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran had put its long-range Mohajer-10 drones on show at a defence exhibit in Russia, Iran's official news agency reported on Monday.</p>

<p>US officials have accused Iran of sending drones to Russia - including Mohajer-10's predecessor, the Mohajer-6 - that Moscow had used in its invasion of Ukraine. Tehran denies this.</p>

<p>IRNA said the more advanced system was on display at the Army 2024 International Military-Technical Forum, an event which runs from Monday to Wednesday in Patriot Park outside Russia's capital.</p>

<p>The report comes as the Middle East braces for Iran's threatened retaliation against Israel after the killing of Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July 31.</p>

<p>Iran released details of the Mohajer-10 system in August last year, saying it had an enhanced flight range, duration and could carry a greater payload.</p>

<p>A video accompanying that report showed the drone alongside other military hardware, with text saying "prepare your shelters" in both Hebrew and Persian.</p>

<p>According to Iranian media reports, the drone has an operational range of 2,000 km (1,240 miles) and can fly for up to 24 hours. Its payload can reach 300 kg (661 pounds), double the capacity of the Mohajer-6, the reports have added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine's top commander said on Monday Kyiv controlled around 1,000 square kilometres of Russia's Kursk region, his first public comments since Ukraine launched its biggest cross-border attack in almost 2-1/2 years of full-scale war.</p>

<p>With Russia still struggling to repel the incursion seven days after it began, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy published a video clip of Oleksandr Syrskyi, the head of his armed forces, delivering a report on the fighting.</p>

<p>"We continue to conduct an offensive operation in the Kursk region. Currently, we control about 1,000 square kilometres of the territory of the Russian Federation," he said.</p>

<p>Zelensky said the meeting of top-level officials had ordered the preparation of a "humanitarian plan" for the area.</p>

<p>Russia's acting governor of Kursk region, Alexei Smirnov, said Ukraine controlled 28 settlements, and the incursion was about 12 km deep and 40 km wide.</p>

<p>In a statement, the Ukrainian leader said the defence ministry and diplomats has been ordered to present a list of "necessary actions" needed to secure permission from Kyiv's Western allies to use long-range weapons for strikes on Russia.</p>

<p>Defence Minister Rustem Umerov urged Paris earlier on Monday to lift the ban on Western weapons strikes on military targets in Russia during a call with French counterpart Sebastien Lecornu, the Ukrainian readout said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canada-India relationship is "very important for both the countries", Canadian MP Chandrakanth Arya said as he met External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar during his visit to the country.</p>

<p>"Delighted to meet Canadian MP Chandrakanth Arya. As a genuine advocate of India-Canada friendship, appreciate his views and value his insights. @AryaCanada," the EAM posted on X on Monday.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar also shared a photograph of their meeting on the social media platform.</p>

<p>The Canadian lawmaker also put out a post while sharing Mr Jaishankar's post.</p>

<p>"Canada-India relationship is very important for both countries. As the outgoing Canadian High Commissioner in India said a few months back 'in the long-term, Canada's strategic interest and India's strategic interest are absolutely aligned'. Economic relations, specifically Canadian investments in India are going strong," Mr Arya said.</p>

<p>"Skilled professionals from India are meeting our human talent needs. We have a huge number of international students from India. We must do everything possible not only to maintain this but to take it to the next level. @CanadainIndia," Mr Arya posted.</p>

<p>The ties between India and Canada had come under severe strain following Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegations in September last year of a "potential" involvement of Indian agents in the killing of Khalistani extremist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in British Columbia.</p>

<p>New Delhi rejected Trudeau's charges as "absurd" and "motivated".&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 12-year-old boy on Monday admitted throwing a missile at a police van during far-riot inspired riots after a knife attack in a northern England town that killed three young girls.</p>

<p>District Judge Joanne Hirst said the boy -- who cannot be named due to his age -- had been more involved in the violence than any other accused person she had seen "coming through these courts, adult or child".</p>

<p>The boy pleaded guilty to two charges of violent disorder at a court in Manchester, northwestern England.</p>

<p>The violence, blamed by officials on the far right, came after misinformation spread about the alleged perpetrator of a mass stabbing on July 29 at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class led to rioting in English towns and cities.</p>

<p>Prosecutors said the boy was part of a group that gathered two days later outside a Manchester hotel housing asylum seekers.</p>

<p>He was remanded to local authority custody and will be sentenced on September 2.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thousands of people fled their homes around Athens on Monday, including in the historic town of Marathon, as strong winds fanned a wall of wildfire flames closer to the Greek capital.</p>

<p>A 30-kilometre (20-mile) long frontline of fires, more than 25 metres (80 feet) high in places, was moving towards Athens, the ERT public broadcaster reported.</p>

<p>Nearly 700 firefighters and over 30 aircraft battled the blazes that had advanced into the city's outer suburbs near Mount Pentelikon.</p>

<p>Authorities opened the Olympic stadium in northern Athens and other stadiums to house those fleeing. Three major hospitals have been placed on standby.</p>

<p>One firefighter suffered serious burns, another was hospitalised with breathing trouble and 13 other people were treated for milder respiratory problems, fire brigade spokesman Vassilis Vathrakogiannis said.</p>

<p>Halandri became the latest suburban municipality to order a partial evacuation of areas threatened by the flames.</p>

</div>

<p>"Because of the direction of the wind we have decided on a precautionary evacuation," its mayor Simos Roussos told ERT. "The fire is very close."</p>

<p>Television footage showed flames burning among homes in Nea Penteli, a leafy Athens suburb which also told residents to relocate.</p>

<p>Several smaller communities and towns, including Marathon, which gave the Olympic long-distance race its name, started to evacuate on Sunday.</p>

<p>"We are facing a biblical catastrophe," said Marathon's mayor Stergios Tsirkas. "Our whole town is engulfed in flames," he told the Skai television channel.</p>

<p>Smoke drifted through central Athens as thick grey clouds engulfed Mount Pentelikon, which looms above the capital and is known for producing the marble used in the Acropolis and other ancient buildings.</p>

<p>"Civil protection forces battled hard throughout the night, but despite superhuman efforts, the fire evolved rapidly," Vathrakogiannis said.</p>

<p>The wind had rekindled the fire in 40 different locations on Monday, he said.</p>

<p>A children's hospital and a military medical facility in Penteli were evacuated at dawn, Vathrakogiannis said.</p>

<p>The destruction revived memories of the Mati disaster, the coastal area near Marathon where 104 people died in July 2018 in a tragedy later blamed on evacuation delays and errors.</p>

<p>The summer wildfire season in Greece this year has seen dozens of daily blazes after the Mediterranean country recorded its warmest winter and the hottest June and July since reliable data collection began in 1960.</p>

<p>Temperatures around Athens are forecast to peak at 39 degrees Celsius (102 degrees Fahrenheit) on Monday, with wind gusts of up to 50 kilometres (31 miles) per hour.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Engulfed in flames' -</strong></p>

<p>"Forest fire near you. Follow the instructions of the authorities," said SMS messages sent to people in the Attica region, indicating in which direction to flee.</p>

<p>Civil Protection Minister Vassilis Kikilias issued a warning Saturday that half the country faced a high-risk of fires due to high temperatures, strong winds and drought conditions.</p>

<p>On Monday he said that a fire that broke out on Sunday near the town of Varnavas spread even though a water-bombing aircraft reached the area in just five minutes.</p>

<p>"We're working 24-hour shifts, all of us," said fireman Marinos Peristeropoulos.</p>

<p>"The fire spread very quickly because of the strong wind," he told AFP near one of the hotspots in Grammatiko.</p>

<p>Scientists say that human-induced fossil fuel emissions are worsening the length, frequency and intensity of heatwaves across the world.</p>

<p>Rising temperatures are leading to longer wildfire seasons and increasing the area burnt in the flames, according to the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.</p>

<p>Other parts of Europe are also struggling with high temperatures.</p>

<p>Temperatures in parts of France rose above 40 Celsius on Sunday. In Rome, temperatures were expected to reach 38 Celsius Monday and remain around 36 Celsius this week.</p>

<p>In the Netherlands, temperatures between 32 and 35 degrees Celsius are expected.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus - who last week took oath as head of Bangladesh's interim government - has heaped praise on students who spearheaded protests against ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nobel laureate <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/muhammad-yunus" target="_blank">Muhammad Yunus</a> - who last week took oath as head of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/bangladesh" target="_blank">Bangladesh</a>'s interim government - has heaped praise on students who spearheaded protests against ousted Prime Minister <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/sheikh-hasina" target="_blank">Sheikh Hasina</a>. "There is no doubt... because of the student-led revolution the whole government collapsed..." Mr Yunus told reporters after a Sunday night meet with the students.</p>

<p>"I said (to the students), 'I respect you... I admire you. What you have done is absolutely unparalleled... and because you ordered me to do this (to take charge of the interim administration) I accept...'," Mr Yunus said, recounting part of the conversation he had with the students.</p>

<p>Two of the student protesters - Nahid Islam and Asif Mahmud - are part of a 16-member advisory council that was sworn in with Mr Yunus. The 84-year-old won the 2006 Nobel Peace prize for his work in microfinance and setting up the Grameen Bank, which works for community development.</p>

<p>Mr Yunus has also stressed the wave of resignations of high-ranking public officials, including the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and head of Bangladesh's central bank, was "conducted legally".</p>

<p>They had reportedly been issued ultimatums to quit.</p>

<p><strong>READ |&nbsp;</strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/fresh-protests-in-bangladesh-as-students-demand-resignation-of-chief-justice-6306023" target="_blank">Why The Chief Justice, A Sheikh Hasina Loyalist, Was Forced To Quit</a></p>

<p>"They want to have a new court," he said of the students. "So they went there and asked the chief justice to resign and put their pressure to make him resign."</p>

<p>"I'm sure they will find the legal way to justify all of this, because legally... all the steps were followed," he said. His office only agreed to publish these quotes Monday evening.</p>

<h3><strong>"The Monster Is Gone"</strong></h3>

<p>"Finally, this moment, the monster is gone," Mr Yunus also said, referring to Ms Hasina's departure and the end of what her critics said was an autocratic rule that stifled all dissent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, Mr Yunus warned the interim government that public goodwill is a limited resource and that they would face many difficult decisions ahead. "The moment you start taking decisions, some people will like your decisions, some people will not like your decisions," he said. "...that's the way it works."</p>

<h3><strong>Interim Bangladesh Government</strong></h3>

<p>The interim government was formed after Bangladesh witnessed weeks of violence and clashes - triggered by protests over a jobs quota - forced Ms Hasina, a five-time PM, to resign and flee.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina left the Prime Minister's residence in Dhaka - hours before it was overrun - and flew to India in a Bangladeshi military aircraft. The 76-year-old, seen as a key ally of New Delhi, remains in an undisclosed location amid reports she will seek political asylum, possibly in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">Dhaka, the Bangladesh capital, was rocked by violent protests against Sheikh Hasina's rule.</p>
</div>

<p>Following Ms Hasina's departure Md Yunus - who faced multiple corruption charges under the previous government and was in Europe while Sheikh Hasina was in power - was picked by the protesting to oversee democratic reforms.</p>

<p>His first act after being administered an oath of office - and taking the title of 'chief advisor' - was to lead a solemn tribute to the more than 450 people who died in the protests.</p>

<p>It is unclear when Bangladesh will hold an election to select a new Prime Minister. Whenever that is, Mrs Hasina is likely to return to contest, her son, Sajeeb Wazed Joy told The Times of India. "She will go back to Bangladesh the moment the interim government decides to hold an election," he said.</p>

<h3><strong>India Extends "Best Wishes"</strong></h3>

<p>Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has extended his best wishes to Mr Yunus,</p>

<p>"We hope for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities. India remains committed to working with Bangladesh to fulfil the shared aspirations of both our peoples for peace, security and development," he wrote on X.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the change of guard in neighbouring Bangladesh, the Indian government now faces a diplomatic dilemma, even as China was also swift to welcome Dhaka's new authorities, saying it "attaches importance to the development" of relations.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh was experiencing a "student-led revolution" after the ouster of premier Sheikh Hasina, the South Asian country's new interim leader Muhammad Yunus said.</p>

<p>"This is a revolution, a student-led revolution," the Nobel laureate told a news briefing on Sunday.</p>

<p>"There's no doubt about (that) because the business of the whole government collapsed."</p>

<p>Yunus, 84, arrived back in Bangladesh from Europe on Thursday after he was called by the student leaders of the protests that toppled Hasina and asked to steer democratic reforms.</p>

<p>"I said, 'I respect you, I admire you. What you have done is absolutely unparallelled'," he said.</p>

<p>"'Because you ordered me to do this, I take your order'," Yunus said he told them.</p>

<p>Several top allies of Hasina, whose iron-fisted tenure ended with her abrupt resignation and flight to neighbouring India a week ago, subsequently stepped down.</p>

<p>Among them were the former chief justice of the Supreme Court and the central bank governor.</p>

<p>They had been issued ultimatums to quit their posts by students but Yunus said their resignations had been conducted legally.</p>

<p>"They want to have a new court," he said of the students. "So they went there and asked the chief justice to resign and put their pressure to make him resign."</p>

<p>"I'm sure they will find the legal way to justify all of this, because legally... all the steps were followed," he said.</p>

<p><strong>- 'The monster is gone' -</strong></p>

<p>Hasina, 76, fled by helicopter as protesters flooded Dhaka's streets in a dramatic end to her long rule.</p>

<p>Her government was accused of widespread human rights abuses, including the extrajudicial killing of thousands of her political opponents.</p>

<p>"Finally, this moment, the monster is gone," Mr Yunus said.</p>

<p>However, despite the groundswell of public goodwill towards him, Mr Yunus warned that his interim government faced difficult decisions ahead.</p>

<p>"The moment you start taking decisions, some people will like your decisions, some people will not like your decisions," he said. "Obviously, that's the way it works."</p>

<p>Yunus made the comments during an off-the-record media briefing on Sunday night at a state building being used as a temporary seat of government.</p>

<p>His office agreed to their publication on Monday evening.</p>

<p>Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his pioneering work in microfinance, credited with helping millions of Bangladeshis out of grinding poverty.</p>

<p>He took office as "chief adviser" to a caretaker administration -- all fellow civilians bar a retired brigadier general.</p>

<p>He said last week that he wanted to hold elections "within a few months.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Pakistan's military has arrested the former chief of its spy agency ISI, Lieutenant-General Faiz Hameed, and initiated court martial proceedings against him - a first in the country's history.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>The military said the arrest was ordered by the Supreme Court in connection with a land development case, and multiple violations of the Pakistan Army Act after Mr Hameed's retirement.</li>
	<li>The management of a private housing scheme, Top City, had claimed in a petition in November&nbsp;2023 that Mr Hameed had orchestrated a raid on the offices and residence of its owner.</li>
	<li>Their petition claimed that Pakistan Rangers and officials of the ISI raided its premises in May 2017 and took away valuables, including gold and diamond ornaments, over an alleged terrorism case.</li>
	<li>General Hameed later told the petitioner that he would return some items except for "400 tola&nbsp;gold and cash", <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1851818/former-dg-isi-faiz-hameed-taken-into-military-custody-ispr">reported Dawn </a>quoting the petition.</li>
	<li>The petition also accused some former ISI officials of being involved in the "illegal takeover of the housing society".</li>
	<li>In March 2024, former Pakistan interior minister Rana Sanaullah said the ex-ISI&nbsp;boss and his brother were under scanner over alleged corruption.</li>
	<li>In April, the military formed an inquiry committee to probe the allegations of misuse of authority against the former spymaster.</li>
	<li>Lieutenant-General Faiz Hameed was among six senior-most generals whose name was included in the list of potential candidates for the top two military offices in November 2022, as per Dawn.</li>
	<li>Mr Hameed, however, sought an early retirement and sent his resignation to the high command the same month, four months before his retirement date.</li>
	<li>He had also faced criticism from Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam Nawaz for allegedly having a role in their convictions.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden announced in late May a three-phase plan to end the war in Gaza, a proposal that Hamas wants to see implemented rather than enter new talks starting Thursday as Israel has agreed.</p>

<p>The plan, which Biden described as an Israeli proposal, has already seen intense deliberations over the past several weeks, even as the war in Gaza raged.</p>

<p>Last week, Israel -- which has been slow to publicly embrace the deal -- said it was ready for new talks on the proposal.</p>

<p>But just days later, it carried out a deadly strike on a Gaza school housing displaced people, killing at least 93, according to rescuers in the Palestinian territory.</p>

<p>The Israeli military says the strike killed 19 Palestinian militants, while Israeli news website Walla, quoting the military, reported that 38 militants were killed.</p>

<p>AFP has been unable to independently verify the toll.</p>

<p>Israel's move to enter a new round of talks, likely to be held in either Cairo or Doha, also came less than two weeks after Hamas's political leader, Ismail Haniyeh -- who had been overseeing the ceasefire negotiations -- was killed in Tehran in a strike widely blamed on Israel.</p>

<p>Below are the details of the plan and the statements of parties and brokers since Haniyeh's killing.</p>

<p><strong>Phase One</strong></p>

<p>Biden said the first phase includes a "full and complete ceasefire" lasting six weeks, with Israeli forces withdrawing from "all populated areas of Gaza".</p>

<p>Hamas would release "a number" of hostages, including US citizens, captured in the October 7 attacks on Israel, including women, the elderly and the wounded. The remains of some hostages who had been killed would also be returned.</p>

<p>Hundreds of Palestinian prisoners would be released in exchange.</p>

<p>Palestinian civilians would be allowed to return to their "homes and neighbourhoods" throughout Gaza, much of which has been devastated by Israeli bombing.</p>

<p>Humanitarian aid would "surge" to 600 trucks a day entering Gaza, while the international community would deliver hundreds of thousands of temporary shelters and housing units.</p>

<p>During the initial six-week period, Israel and Hamas would "negotiate the necessary arrangements to get to phase two, which is a permanent end to hostilities".</p>

<p>The ceasefire would also be extended as negotiations continue, with brokers the United States, Egypt and Qatar working to ensure they hold, Biden said.</p>

<p><strong>Phase Two</strong></p>

<p>Israeli forces would completely withdraw from Gaza under the second phase of the plan, lasting another six weeks.</p>

<p>Hamas would release "all remaining living hostages" including male Israeli soldiers. This has been a key sticking point for Hamas in the past.</p>

<p>If both sides keep to the deal, it will lead to the "cessation of hostilities permanently", Biden quoted the proposal as saying.</p>

<p><strong>Phase Three</strong></p>

<p>A major reconstruction and stabilisation plan for Gaza would begin, backed by the US and the international community.</p>

<p>Biden said he would also work with regional partners to ensure it happens in a way that "does not allow Hamas to re-arm".</p>

<p>The reconstruction phase would take between three and five years, a senior US official said.</p>

<p>The final remains of any hostages who had been killed would be returned in the third phase.</p>

<p><strong>What if it goes wrong?</strong></p>

<p>Biden said that if Hamas "fails to fulfil its commitments under the deal, Israel can resume military operations".</p>

<p>Netanyahu has repeatedly said that the best way to secure the release of hostages is to keep applying military pressure on Hamas.</p>

<p>Biden, however, added that Egypt and Qatar would work to ensure Hamas sticks to the terms, while the United States would do the same for Israel.</p>

<p><strong>Who says what?</strong></p>

<p>Late on Sunday, Hamas said that any further talks would basically "provide cover for the occupation (Israel) and give it more time to perpetuate the war of genocide against" Gazans.</p>

<p>Israel has yet to respond to Hamas's latest calls for the deal to be implemented.</p>

<p>Mediator Qatar was quick to criticise Israel following the killing of Haniyeh.</p>

<p>"Political assassinations &amp; continued targeting of civilians in Gaza while talks continue leads us to ask, how can mediation succeed when one party assassinates the negotiator on other side? Peace needs serious partners," Qatar's Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani said on X, hours after Haniyeh's assassination.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Vladimir Putin ordered his army on Monday to "dislodge" Ukrainian troops who have entered Russian territory as authorities said over 120,000 people had been evacuated away from the fighting.</p>

<p>Kyiv launched a surprise offensive into Russia's western Kursk region last Tuesday, capturing over two dozen settlements in the most significant cross-border attack on Russian soil since World War II.</p>

<p>"One of the obvious goals of the enemy is to sow discord, strife, intimidate people, destroy the unity and cohesion of Russian society," Putin told a televised meeting with government officials.</p>

<p>"The main task is, of course, for the defence ministry to dislodge the enemy from our territories," he said.</p>

<p>Some 121,000 people have fled the Kursk region since the start of the fighting, which has killed at least 12 civilians and injured 121 more, regional governor Alexei Smirnov told the meeting with Putin.</p>

<p>Authorities in Kursk announced on Monday they were widening their evacuation area to include Belovsky district, home to some 14,000 residents. The neighbouring Belgorod region also said it was evacuating its border district of Krasnoyaruzhsky.</p>

<p>Ukraine has pierced into the region by at least 12 kilometres (seven miles) and has captured 28 towns and villages, with the new front 40 kilometres long, Smirnov said.</p>

<p>A top Ukrainian official told AFP over the weekend that the operation was aimed at stretching Russian troops and destabilising the country after months of slow Russian advances across the frontline.</p>

<p>Putin said Russia would respond by showing "unanimous support for all those in distress" and claimed there had been an increase in men signing up to fight.</p>

<p>"The enemy will receive a worthy riposte," he said.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Maximum losses' -</strong></p>

<p>The assault appeared to catch the Kremlin off guard. Russia's army rushed in reserve troops, tanks, aviation, artillery and drones in a bid to quash it.</p>

<p>But it conceded on Sunday that Ukraine had penetrated up to 30 kilometres (20 miles) into Russian territory in places.</p>

<p>It said some forces were near the villages of Tolpino and Obshchy Kolodez, around 25 kilometres and 30 kilometres from the Russia-Ukraine border.</p>

<p>A Ukrainian security official told AFP, on condition of anonymity, that "the aim is to stretch the positions of the enemy, to inflict maximum losses and to destabilise the situation in Russia as they are unable to protect their own border".</p>

<p>The Ukrainian official said thousands of Ukrainian troops were involved in the operation.</p>

<p>Russia's defence ministry said on Monday that its air defence systems had destroyed 18 Ukrainian drones -- including 11 over the Kursk region.</p>

<p>- 'It's scary' -</p>

<p>Russia's emergency situations ministry said on Sunday that over 44,000 residents in the Kursk region have applied for financial assistance, TASS news agency reported.</p>

<p>Russia's rail operator has meanwhile organised emergency trains from Kursk to Moscow, around 450 kilometres away, for those fleeing.</p>

<p>"It's scary to have helicopters flying over your head all the time," said Marina, refusing to give her surname, who arrived by train in Moscow on Sunday. "When it was possible to leave, I left."</p>

<p>Across the border in Ukraine's Sumy region, AFP journalists on Sunday saw dozens of armoured vehicles daubed with a white triangle -- the insignia apparently being used to identify Ukrainian military hardware deployed in the attack.</p>

<p>At an evacuation centre in the regional capital of Sumy, 70-year-old retired metal worker Mykola, who fled his village of Khotyn some 10 kilometres from the Russian border, welcomed Ukraine's push into Russia.</p>

<p>"Let's let them find out what it's like," he told AFP. "They don't understand what war is. Let them have a taste of it."</p>

<p>Analysts think Kyiv may have launched the assault to relieve pressure on its troops in other parts of the frontline.</p>

<p>But the Ukrainian official said: "Their pressure in the east continues, they are not pulling back troops from the area," even if "the intensity of Russian attacks has gone down a little bit".</p>

<p>The Ukrainian official said he expected Russia would "in the end" stop the incursion.</p>

<p>Ukraine was bracing for a large-scale retaliatory missile attack, including "on decision-making centres" in Ukraine, the official said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Pakistan's former ISI chief Lt Gen (retd.) Faiz Hameed has been arrested by the military ahead of his court martial in connection with a housing scheme scandal, the army said on Monday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In an unprecedented move, the Pakistan Army on Monday announced that it has arrested former ISI chief Lt Gen (retd.) Faiz Hameed and initiated court martial proceedings against him in connection with a housing scheme scandal.</p>

<p>"Complying with the orders of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, a detailed court of inquiry was undertaken by Pakistan Army, to ascertain correctness of complaints in Top City Case made against Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd)," the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) - the media wing of the army- said in a statement.</p>

<p>"Consequently, appropriate disciplinary action has been initiated against Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd.), under provisions of the Pakistan Army Act," it said.</p>

<p>"In addition, multiple instances of violation of the Pakistan Army Act post-retirement have also been established. The process of Field General Court Martial has been initiated and Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd) has been taken into military custody," it added.</p>

<p>Lt Gen (retd.) Hameed was considered extremely powerful when he headed the spy agency from 2019 to 2021.</p>

<p>He was appointed to the coveted post when then ISI chief and current Army chief Lt Gen Asim Munir was prematurely removed from the post. It was reported then that then prime minister Imran Khan was not happy with Munir.</p>

<p>Later, the army decided to replace Mr Hameed, a move vehemently opposed by Imran Khan and it is believed that it was the beginning of souring of his ties with the powerful military.</p>

<p>The Top City case made headlines when on November 8, 2023, Moeez Ahmed Khan, the owner of Top City, filed a petition in the Supreme Court in which he accused Mr Hameed of misusing his authority.</p>

<p>He stated in the petition that on May 12, 2017, at the behest of Gen Hameed, ISI officials raided the top city office and his house and seized valuables, including gold, diamonds and money.</p>

<p>He also stated that Sardar Najaf, the brother of Mr Hameed, also contacted him to resolve the issue later. The petition also claimed that Gen Hameed later personally met him to resolve the issue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He alleged that the ISI officials extorted Rs 4 crore cash from him.</p>

<p>A three-judge bench of the Supreme Court, which included Chief Justice of Pakistan Justice Qazi Faiz Isa, Justice Attar Minullah and Justice Aminuddin, heard the case and decided to send it to the Ministry of Defence for probing the allegation.</p>

<p>The army announced in April this year that it constituted a high-level inquiry committee headed by a major general to look into the allegations.</p>

<p>Mr Hameed took premature retirement in November 2022, four months before his retirement date after the current army chief took over. He was considered close to then Army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa.</p>

<p>The post of ISI chief is considered one of the most important in the Pakistan Army, which has ruled the country for more than half of its 76-plus years of existence and has hitherto wielded considerable power in matters of security and foreign policy.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Spain's ruling Socialists regained control of Catalonia's regional government as a new cabinet was sworn in on Monday, ending over a decade of separatist rule in the region.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spain's ruling Socialists regained control of Catalonia's regional government as a new cabinet was sworn in on Monday, ending over a decade of separatist rule in the region.</p>

<p>The 16-member cabinet is led by Salvador Illa, who was Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's health minister during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>"I want to assure you that the government will govern for all, this is a real obsession," Illa said during the swearing-in ceremony.</p>

<p>It is the first time since 2010 that the wealthy northeastern region has a government that does not come from the pro-independence camp.</p>

<p>The Socialists won the most seats in a regional election in May, but fell short of a majority.</p>

<p>Illa secured the support of the tiny far-left Comuns party -- part of the Sumar alliance that backs Sanchez at national level -- and moderate separatist ERC party to become regional leader in a vote on Thursday in Catalonia's regional assembly.</p>

<p>Forming a government in Catalonia will be seen as a vindication of Sanchez's strategy of trying to tamp down support for separatism in the region by offering concessions, including a controversial amnesty for those involved in an illegal independence referendum in 2017 that triggered Spain's worst political crisis in decades.</p>

<p>To secure the support of the ERC, the Socialists vowed to grant Catalonia full control of taxes collected in the region, which has been for decades one of the main demands of pro-independence parties.</p>

<p>The proposal, which still must be approved by Spain's national parliament, is opposed by the conservative opposition as well as some in the Socialist party, who argue it will deprive the central state of a substantial revenues.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Adored by her classmates and defiant even after police seized her, student Nusrat Tabassum is one of the many women who helped spearhead the movement that toppled autocratic ex-premier Sheikh Hasina.</p>

<p>Sizable protests against Hasina's 15-year rule were nothing new, but this was the first time that young women took to the streets against her in large numbers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Soldiers refused to fire on them, a pivotal moment in Hasina's ouster.</p>

<p>"The people had no way back," Tabassum, 23, told AFP. "Anger was increasing, and the demand for equality was increasing."</p>

<p>Tabassum is a campus hero for helping lead a movement that began as a protest against civil service job quotas and ended in revolution.</p>

<p>As she strolled the grounds of the elite Dhaka University, friends and other pupils rose from their seats to offer handshakes, hugs and high-fives.</p>

<p>Two weeks ago she was among six top student leaders snatched by plainclothes police and held in custody for several days, officially for their safety.</p>

<p>With Hasina's grip on power slipping, her security forces held the group at gunpoint and made them sign a statement calling off the protests.</p>

<p>"I thought of suicide several times," Tabassum said. "I could not bear the thought of the people of this country thinking that we had cheated, that we had sold out."</p>

<p>But Bangladeshis saw through the ruse.</p>

<p>"When we saw people did not misunderstand us, and were still protesting on the street, then I regained my strength and power to continue," she said.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Women were deprived' -</strong></p>

<p>Protests began last month over a court decision to reintroduce loathed quotas for government jobs, seen as a tool for Hasina's government to stack the bureaucracy with loyalists.</p>

<p>One aspect was a 10 percent reservation for women applicants, but Tabassum said the politicised nature of the scheme meant that "women were deprived more than they benefitted".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Soon after protests began, Hasina said the quotas had to remain because women were otherwise unable to get those jobs on their own merits.</p>

<p>The irony of her statement, from one of the world's longest-serving women heads of government, was not lost on its audience.</p>

<p>"Women are more concerned about their rights these days," said Nahida Bushra, a human sciences graduate student at Dhaka University.</p>

<p>"That's why women spontaneously joined the protests."</p>

<p>Muslim-majority Bangladesh has a history of extremist attacks, and one way Hasina sailed through earlier bouts of unrest was by blaming Islamist troublemakers.</p>

<p>She tried again this time, but the sight of young women leading protests undercut her argument.</p>

<p><strong>- 'We moved forward' -</strong></p>

<p>Bushra, 23, played a key role in mobilising her fellow women classmates to attend rallies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She sidestepped government efforts to stop her and ignored a concerted online campaign to demonise students.</p>

<p>"There was a storm of rumours and disinformation on social media, but we kept our unity with courage and bravery," she told AFP.</p>

<p>Telecoms were ordered to block access to Facebook and other platforms used to organise demonstrations, so Bushra and others circumvented the bans through virtual private networks (VPNs).</p>

<p>The government then imposed a complete national shutdown of mobile and broadband internet, so they organised rallies through SMS messages and phone calls.</p>

<p>When police began firing on protesters, they rushed to the front of the crowd in the expectation that officers would be more reluctant to shoot women.</p>

<p>"We moved forward and took the protest forward," Bushra said.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Absolute bloodbath' -</strong></p>

<p>In a final desperate move to remain in power, Hasina's government ordered soldiers to suppress the protests.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They refused.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It would have been an absolute bloodbath and the army was unwilling to perpetrate a massacre," Thomas Kean of the International Crisis Group told AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"To have sided with Hasina at this juncture would have tarnished their image massively."</p>

<p>Bangladesh's armed forces are outsized contributors to UN peacekeeping operations, a source of deep institutional pride.</p>

<p>Kean said their complicity in the crackdown would have opened up the military to Western sanctions and international pariahdom, as well as a potential revolt from rank-and-file soldiers.</p>

<p>Despite army chief Waker-Uz-Zaman being a distant relative of Hasina's, Kean said the general had "little choice but to put institutional interests first".</p>

<p>As the dust settles from some of the most tempestuous weeks in Bangladesh's history, Tabassaum said work had just begun.</p>

<p>"My country has not been able to practice what democracy really looks like," she said.</p>

<p>"The responsibility to build the country remains."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[This innovative solution could revolutionise the aviation industry, enabling faster-than-sound travel while minimising the negative impacts associated with it.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<header>
<p>Sonic booms and shockwaves have been significant barriers to the development of supersonic aircraft, causing concerns about noise, damage, and safety. However, researchers from Northwestern Polytechnical University in China have made a groundbreaking discovery to mitigate these effects. According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3273941/chinese-scientists-drilled-holes-plane-wing-reduce-sonic-booms-it-worked">South China Morning Post,</a></em> scientists&nbsp;drilled holes in the plane's wing and found a way to reduce the intensity of sonic booms.</p>

<p>The researchers' unconventional method of drilling holes in the wing yielded two major benefits:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Reduced sonic booms:</strong> By allowing airflow to pass from the underside to the top surface, the holes effectively mitigated shock wave vibrations, decreasing the intensity of sonic booms.</li>
	<li><strong>Improved aerodynamic efficiency:</strong> The holes increased aerodynamic efficiency by over 10%, as reported in the study published in Acta Aerodynamica Sinica.</li>
</ol>

<h2><strong>How will this work?</strong></h2>

<p>According to Bernoulli's principle, the curved upper surface and flat underside of an aeroplane wing create pressure differences, generating lift. However, as planes approach the speed of sound, shock waves form, causing turbulence and destructive vibrations. Only a few specially designed planes can overcome this barrier. Sonic booms produced by shock waves can be explosive and shatter windows.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, researchers at Northwestern Polytechnical University, led by Professor Gao Chao, proposed a solution: adding holes to the wing. When the plane surpasses the speed of sound, a cover opens, allowing airflow to converge and prevent shock waves. An air pump modulates the jet stream, halting turbulence and nearly eliminating wing vibrations. This innovative design could resolve the issues associated with supersonic flight, making it more accessible and efficient.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''When using jet stream control to suppress shock wave buffeting, although there is a slight loss of lift, it can reduce overall drag, so the lift-to-drag ratio increases rather than decreases,'' Mr Chao and his colleagues wrote.</p>

<p>Researchers, mainly from China and the US, have explored various methods to reduce supersonic flight turbulence and noise. These include adding grooves or protrusions to the wing surface, installing mechanical devices to suppress shock waves and Using piezoelectric film coatings to manipulate airflow</p>

<p>Meanwhile, NASA's X-59 supersonic jet which aims to reduce noise is set for its first test flight this year. However, Mr Gao's team believes&nbsp;their solution is the simplest and most effective. They plan to conduct further wind tunnel tests to develop their technology for practical application.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli forces pressed on with their operations near the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis on Monday amid an international push for a deal to halt the fighting in Gaza and block a slide into a wider regional conflict with Iran and its proxies.</p>

<p>Palestinian medics said Israeli military strikes on several areas of Khan Younis on Monday killed at least 16 people and wounded several. Meanwhile more families and displaced persons streamed out of areas threatened by new evacuation orders telling people to clear the area.</p>

<p>As fighting continued in several areas of the Gaza Strip, Hamas reacted sceptically to the latest round of Egyptian and Qatari-brokered talks due on Thursday, saying it has seen no sign of movement from the Israeli side.</p>

<p>The group said in a statement on Sunday mediators must force Israel to accept a ceasefire proposal based on ideas by US President Joe Biden, which Hamas had accepted, "instead of pursuing further rounds of negotiations or new proposals that would provide cover for the occupation's aggression."</p>

<p>Two sources close to Hamas told Reuters the group was convinced the new call for talks was coordinated beforehand with Israel to deter responses from Iran and Hezbollah to the assassination of the group's chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran and a top Hezbollah leader in Lebanon.</p>

<p>"It is a mild rejection you can say. Should Hamas receive a workable plan, an Israeli positive response to the proposal it had accepted, things may change, but so far Hamas believes Netanyahu isn't serious about reaching a deal," said one Palestinian official close to the mediation effort.</p>

<p>Hamas' reaction to the talks came as preparations for a larger-scale confrontation grew, with Washington ordering a guided missile submarine to the Middle East and the Abraham Lincoln strike group accelerating its deployment to the region.</p>

<p>Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin that Iran was making preparations for a large-scale military attack on Israel, Barack Ravid, a normally well-sourced reporter for Axios News reported on Twitter.</p>

<p>Israel has been braced for a major attack since last month when a missile strike killed 12 youngsters in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Israel responded by killing a senior Hezbollah commander in Beirut.</p>

<p>A day after that operation, Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, was assassinated in Tehran, drawing Iranian vows of retaliation against Israel.</p>

<p>The potential escalation underlined how far the Middle East has been thrown into turmoil by the war in Gaza, now into its 11th month.</p>

<p>The Hamas-led attack on Israeli communities around the Gaza Strip killed some 1,200 people, with more than 250 taken into captivity in Gaza, according to Israeli tallies, in one of the most devastating blows against Israel in its history.</p>

<p>In response, Israeli forces have flattened Gaza, displaced most of the population and killed around 40,000 people, according to the Palestinian health ministry, in a war that has caused horror around the world.</p>

<p>On Saturday, scores of people were killed in Israeli strikes on a school building in Gaza City that the military said targeted fighters from the armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad.</p>

<p>Gaza health officials say most of the fatalities have been civilians but Israel says at least a third are fighters. Israel says it has lost 329 soldiers in Gaza.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh's newly appointed Chief Justice Syed Refaat Ahmed on Monday warned of stern action if anybody from the judiciary was found to be involved in any "misdeeds".</p>

<p>Speaking at a reception hosted by the Attorney General's Office and the Supreme Court Bar in the Appellate Division, Mr Ahmed commemorated those killed in the student protests that resulted in the toppling of the government led by Sheikh Hasina last week.</p>

<p>"I extend my congratulations to the students and the people of the entire country. I also congratulate those who supported this movement," he said.</p>

<p>"The students have sparked a great awakening against inequality. Due to the revolution of the students and the public, I have been entrusted with this responsibility, which I will carry out. At this moment, we are standing on the ruins. We have to start anew while standing on this destruction," he said.</p>

<p>The Daily Star newspaper reported the chief justice warned that no irregularity would be tolerated in the judiciary.</p>

<p>He added that "stern action would be taken if anybody from the judiciary was found to be involved in any misdeeds as the policy of oppression that prevailed for so long instead of justice was now over."</p>

<p>"I will work with devotion and honesty. I will do everything to establish justice in the society after the mass upheaval. Our sense of justice has been destroyed over the years," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Ahmed was sworn in as Bangladesh's new chief justice on Sunday, a day after Obaidul Hassan stepped down as the top judge following an ultimatum by the protesters demanding a revamp of the judiciary.</p>

<p>Mr Hassan and five other judges of the apex Appellate Division on Saturday tendered their resignation, five days after the fall of Ms Hasina's regime amid massive street protests.</p>

<p>His resignation came as protesters of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement gathered at the Supreme Court premises.</p>

<p>President Mohammed Shahabuddin administered the oath to the chief justice, an event also attended by Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus, who was sworn in on Thursday as the head of an interim government following the ouster of Ms Hasina in the protests that left more than 200 persons dead.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk is due to interview Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on the X social media network on Monday in an event that could inject more surprises into the turbulent US presidential election.</p>

<p>The interview, scheduled for 8 pm Eastern Time (0000 Tuesday GMT), could provide the former president an opportunity to seize the limelight at a time when his campaign is seen as sagging.</p>

<p>His Democratic rival for the Nov. 5 election, Vice President Kamala Harris, has erased Trump's lead in opinion polls and energized Democratic voters with a series of high-energy rallies.</p>

<p>The interview on Musk's social media platform could allow Trump to reach a different audience than the conservative faithful who attend his rallies and watch his interviews on Fox News. However, similar events on the platform have been plagued by technical problems.</p>

<p>"Am going to do some system scaling tests tonight &amp; tomorrow in advance of the conversation," Musk wrote on the platform, formerly known as Twitter.</p>

<p>The interview will be hosted live using Trump's official X account, his campaign said on Sunday. Trump's access to his account, @realDonaldTrump, was restored a month into Musk's ownership of X after being suspended by the platform's previous owners following the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on Congress by his supporters. Trump frequently posts on his Truth Social social media platform, which was launched in February 2022. He has returned to X only once since his access was restored with a post in August 2023 appealing for donations and showing his Fulton County jail mug shot.</p>

<p>Musk could prove to be an unusual interviewer. The world's richest person backed Democratic President Joe Biden in 2020 but has tacked rightward since and endorsed the Republican following the attempted assassination of Trump in July.</p>

<p>Musk, who heads electric car company Tesla Inc, also started a fundraising organization to support Trump's campaign. The political action committee is now under investigation in Michigan for possible violations of state laws on gathering voter information.</p>

<p>Trump, a longstanding critic of electric vehicles, shifted gears after Musk's endorsement.</p>

<p>"I'm for electric cars. I have to be, because Elon endorsed me very strongly. So I have no choice," Trump said at an early August rally.</p>

<p>United Auto Workers President Shawn Fein, campaigning in support of Harris, called Trump a "sellout."</p>

<p>The Biden administration has worked to popularize electric vehicles through tax breaks and other support as part of its broader goal of reducing carbon emissions blamed for climate change.</p>

<p>Republicans in Congress have opposed those subsidies. Senator JD Vance, Trump's vice presidential running mate, said the Biden policy merely subsidizes rich people who purchase the cars.</p>

<p>Advertisers have fled X since Musk bought it in 2022 and subsequently reduced content moderation that has resulted in a dramatic increase in hate speech, civil rights groups have said.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the entrepreneur has been involved in a swirl of additional controversies. He has falsely accused Biden and the Democratic Party of opening US borders to undocumented immigrants in a ploy to boost the number of potential Democratic voters. Non-citizens are not allowed to vote in federal elections.</p>

<p>Musk in November 2023 endorsed an antisemitic post on X that said members of the Jewish community were stoking hatred against white people. He defended himself, saying the user was speaking "the actual truth." Musk has also attacked the Anti-Defamation League, a nonprofit that works to fight antisemitism, accusing it, without evidence, of being responsible for a drop in advertising on X.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mark Zuckerberg became the world's second-richest person for the first time Thursday, jumping ahead of Jeff Bezos as shares of Meta Platforms Inc. continue to climb.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Zuckerberg's bet on the metaverse - which initially looked like a huge bust - has paid off in recent months, pushing his net worth to a high-water mark of $206.2 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That puts him $1.1 billion ahead of Amazon.com Inc.'s Bezos and almost $50 billion behind Tesla Inc.'s Elon Musk.</p>

<p>Meta shares have risen 23% since reporting better-than-expected sales in the second quarter and touting its push into the type of large language models that power AI chatbots. The stock closed Thursday at an all-time high of $582.77.</p>

<p>Meta has spent heavily on data centres and computing power as Zuckerberg works to build a leading position in the industry-wide AI race. The company has also moved ahead with other long-term projects, including its Orion augmented reality glasses, which the company introduced last month.</p>

<p>Zuckerberg, who owns a 13% stake in the Menlo Park, California-based company, has seen his fortune grow $78 billion so far this year, the most of any of the world's 500 richest people tracked by the Bloomberg index.</p>

<p>The 40-year-old co-founder and chief executive officer has gained four spots this year on the wealth index.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a powerful appeal to the global community, Hindu American groups flew a massive airline banner, calling for urgent global action to stop the ongoing violence of Hindus in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>The large banner flew over the Hudson River and circled the Statue of Liberty, a global symbol of human dignity, freedom, and equality.</p>

<p>The 1971 genocide, as documented by US Congress Resolution HR 1430 in 2022, claimed 2.8 million lives and saw at least 200,000 predominantly Hindu women raped, leaving an indelible mark on the region.</p>

<p>Since then, Bangladesh's Hindu population has dwindled from 20 per cent in 1971 to just 8.9 per cent today.</p>

<p>Recent reports of targeted violence, systematic impoverishment, lynchings, kidnappings of minor girls, and forced job resignations affecting up to 200,000 Hindus, along with property seizures, pose a serious existential threat to the 13 to 15 million Hindus living in the country.</p>

<p>Since August 5, 2024, there have been around 250 verified attacks and over 1,000 reported incidents.</p>

<p>Sitangshu Guha, from the Bangladesh Hindu Community and one of the event organisers, highlighted the threat and stated, "Hindus in Bangladesh are on the verge of extinction. Hopefully, this will raise awareness among the civilised world and prompt the UN to take action to save the victims of militant Islamic forces in Bangladesh. If Bangladesh becomes Hindu-free, it will become Afghanistan 2.0, and militants will spread to neighbouring India and other parts of the world, including the West. This is everyone's problem."</p>

<p>Pankaj Mehta, another activist and member of the Interfaith Human Rights Coalition who helped organise the event, added, "It is time for the UN Human Rights Council to put aside politics and officially recognise the 1971 Bangladesh genocide, the largest genocide since World War II. Three US-based organisations--The Lemkin Institute for Genocide Prevention, Genocide Watch, and the International Coalition of Sites of Conscience--have already recognised the atrocities committed by Pakistani occupation forces and their Islamist allies in 1971 as genocide, primarily targeting the Hindu minority. The UN must follow suit and take steps to prevent another looming genocide."</p>

<p>Surjit Chowdhary, founding member of Sree Gita Sangha in New Jersey, US, urged the Bangladesh government to stop all violence against the Hindu community and address political differences through democratic processes.</p>

<p>The rise of Islamist fundamentalism in Bangladesh poses a serious threat to India, as it has the potential to spread through porous borders, affecting West Bengal and beyond, with existing ties between radical forces on both sides.</p>

<p>It is also raising concerns among mainstream Americans, similar to the anxieties seen during the Afghanistan crisis. Humanitarian watchdogs are closely monitoring the worsening conditions in Bangladesh, fearing that escalating violence could lead to a full-scale genocide.</p>

<p>Americans are being urged to boycott Bangladeshi garments, which account for 85 per cent of the country's export earnings, until the violence ceases and the perpetrators are brought to justice.</p>

<p>A plea has been made to executives of major buyers of Bangladeshi garments--such as Walmart, H&amp;M, Gap Inc., Target, PVH Corp, and VF Corporation--to halt shipments from Bangladesh, as economic support for the country today is seen as enabling terrorism against Hindus and other minorities.</p>

<p>The Jewish community in America has also expressed solidarity with the Hindu minority, drawing parallels to the atrocities committed by Hamas terrorists in Israel. Just as the world rallied against extremist violence in Israel, many are now calling for immediate intervention in Bangladesh to prevent further atrocities.</p>

<p>The event was live-streamed on StopHinduGenocide.org, where all atrocities are being methodically documented, along with historical context and the ominous future facing Bangladesh's Hindus unless the global community takes action.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Former Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris said former President Donald Trump is not fit to lead the US.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris said former President Donald Trump is not fit to lead the US, urging voters to put country over party as they campaigned together on Thursday.</p>

<p>Cheney and her father Dick Cheney, who was vice president under George W. Bush and is still vilified by Democrats for his bullish defense of the Iraq War, are staunch conservatives and two of the most prominent Republicans to have endorsed Harris against Trump in the Nov. 5 election.</p>

<p>Both have sharply criticized Trump, the Republican nominee, calling his refusal to accept his 2020 election loss and his role in the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol disqualifying.</p>

<p>"I was a Republican even before Donald Trump started spray tanning," Cheney joked at the event in Wisconsin, describing herself as a Ronald Reagan conservative. "I am proudly casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris," she said, her first vote ever for a Democrat.</p>

<p>Cheney's comments could help Harris as she tries to court Republican and centrist voters in what polls show to be a very tight race with Trump.</p>

<p>To win, Harris needs to win over Republicans and independents wary of him without alienating her base, particularly in states like Wisconsin that can swing toward Republican or Democrat and are likely to decide the election.</p>

<p>Cheney was the top Republican on the House of Representatives committee that investigated the Jan. 6 riot, earning Trump's disdain and effectively exiling her from the party.</p>

<p>"Our republic faces a threat unlike any we have faced before," Cheney said, pointing to Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.</p>

<p>"What January 6th shows us," Cheney said, "is that there is not an ounce, not an ounce, of compassion in Donald Trump. He is petty, he is vindictive and he is cruel. And Donald Trump is not fit to lead this good and great nation."</p>

<p>On Wednesday, a judge unsealed a 165-page court filing outlining federal prosecutors' case against Trump for his attempt to overturn his 2020 election defeat. Trump has pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy and obstruction.</p>

<p>Cheney said she and Harris may disagree on some things but they are bound together by their duty to the Constitution. Harris will be a president "who will defend the rule of law," Cheney said.</p>

<p>"She's working to unite reasonable people from all across the political spectrum," she said. "I'm honored to join her in this urgent cause."</p>

<p>Harris has adopted a center-to-right-leaning stance on several issues, including her staunch support for Israel, a border policy tough on migrants and an all-of-the-above energy strategy to keep fuel costs low.</p>

<p>Kathy Rubino, 74, a retired nurse practitioner and an independent at the Wisconsin event, said she plans to vote for Harris and praised Cheney.</p>

<p>"She's representing who she thinks is best for the country," Rubino said. "She stood up for what she believed, and that's the important thing here."</p>

<p>Recent polling shows Harris struggling to gain traction with Republican voters despite getting the public support of hundreds of former and current Republican officials in the military, national security and local governments.</p>

<p>While Harris led Trump 47% to 40% among all voters in a Sept. 20-23 Reuters/Ipsos poll, only 5% of the poll's Republican respondents said they would back her, a figure close to the margin of error. Ten percent said they would vote for another candidate, did not know who they would vote for or would not vote.</p>

<p>At Thursday's event, Harris praised Cheney - who opposed same-sex marriage and praised the Supreme Court's repeal of the right to abortion - for putting her country above her party and called the endorsement a "profound honor."</p>

<p>"There are many who know it's wrong and then there are those who have the courage to speak out loudly about it," Harris said of Cheney's criticism of Trump.</p>

<p>Harris repeated her message from the Democratic Convention that she would be a president for all Americans regardless of party, and also described Trump as unfit to hold the office.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The event was held in Ripon, Wisconsin at a one-room schoolhouse significant to the Republican party: it was the site of meetings that led to the party's formation in 1854 and is referred to as the party's birthplace.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democratic US President Joe Biden said on Thursday he would not negotiate in public when asked if he had urged Israel not to attack Iran's oil facilities.</p>

<h3><strong>WHY IT'S IMPORTANT</strong></h3>

<p>Israel has been weighing options to respond to Tehran's ballistic missile attack on Tuesday. The US said then it would work with Israel to make sure Iran faced severe consequences.</p>

<p>Biden earlier in the day contributed to a surge in global oil prices when he said Washington was discussing strikes on Iran's oil facilities. A US official later said Washington does not believe Israel has decided yet how to respond to Iran.</p>

<p>Biden on Wednesday said the US did not support any Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear sites.</p>

<h3><strong>KEY QUOTES</strong></h3>

<p>"I don't negotiate in public," Biden told reporters when asked if he was telling Israel not to attack Iran's oil facilities.</p>

<p>Asked if he worried an Israeli strike on Iran's oil facilities would raise oil prices, he said; "If a hurricane hits, prices are going to go up. I don't know; who knows."</p>

<p>Biden was also asked why he had not spoken to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in recent days. He replied: "Because there's no action going on right now."</p>

<h3><strong>CONTEXT</strong></h3>

<p>During a year of cross-border conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, Israeli attacks have killed nearly 2,000 people in Lebanon, most in the past two weeks, and displaced more than 1.2 million people there. Israel began a ground incursion in Lebanon this week, saying its aim is to defeat Hezbollah and return some 60,000 evacuated Israelis to their homes in the north.</p>

<p>Israel is also waging a war in Gaza in which nearly 42,000 people have been killed and nearly all of the enclave's 2.3 million population displaced. That followed a deadly Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Palestinian Hamas militants.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="CetSht_cn">
<ol class="CetSht_ol">
	<li class="CetSht_li">Beirut's southern suburb of Dahiye, a stronghold of Hezbollah, came under heavy attack on Thursday after Israel ordered people to leave their homes in parts of the district.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The air raids reportedly targeted Hezbollah official <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/who-is-hashem-safieddine-hezbollahs-possible-new-leader-6672359" target="_blank">Hashem Safieddine</a>, rumoured successor to the group's former chief <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/hezbollah-chief-agreed-to-ceasefire-before-being-killed-lebanon-minister-6704668" target="_blank">Hassan Nasrallah</a>, in an underground bunker. Safieddine's fate was not clear, reports claimed.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Dahiye has witnessed a barrage of Israeli missiles for the past few weeks, including bombs that killed Nasrallah a week ago.&nbsp;</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Hezbollah also said it carried out new strikes, targeting what it called Israel's "Sakhnin base" for military industries in Haifa Bay on the Mediterranean coast of northern Israel and "Nesher base" in Haifa.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The latest clashes between Israel and Hezbollah come two days after <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-planning-significant-retaliation-within-days-what-it-could-be-6699474#pfrom=home-ndtv_topstories" target="_blank">Iran fired more than 180 missiles into Israel</a> - its biggest-ever assault on its regional foe - as a response to Israeli killings of Nasrallah and Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Israel's ambassador to the United Nations told a news channel that the country's war cabinet is weighing its options and "will not sit idly by" after Iran's attack. "What happened was an unprecedented response and as I said in the Security Council that it will be a very strong, painful response. It will be soon," Danny Danon told CNN.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">US President <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/iran-israel-conflict-discussing-possible-israel-strikes-on-iran-oil-facilities-says-biden-6709272#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll" target="_blank">Joe Biden</a>&nbsp;said Thursday that "we can avoid" all-out war in the Middle East. "I don't believe there is going to be an all-out war. I think we can avoid it," he told reporters at the White House when asked how confident he was that full-blown war in the region could be averted. "But there is a lot to do yet, a lot to do yet," he added.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Biden was also asked whether he would support Israel striking Iran's oil facilities. "We're discussing that," he told reporters, a comment that led to a surge in global oil prices.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Nearly 2,000 people have so far been killed since the start of the Israeli attacks on Lebanon over the last year, most of them in the past two weeks.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The clashes began when Hezbollah fired missiles at Israel a year ago in support of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hamas-war-causes-nearly-90-drop-in-gaza-gdp-imf-6710443" target="_blank">Hamas in its war with Israel&nbsp;in Gaza</a>.&nbsp;</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oil prices inched up in early Asian trading hours on Friday, holding on to their strong weekly gains, as investors weighed the Middle East conflict and the potential disruption in crude flows against an amply-supplied global market.</p>

<p>Brent crude futures were up 9 cents, or 0.12%, to $77.71 a barrel as of 0010 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were up 8 cents, or 0.11%, to $73.79 a barrel.</p>

<p>Both benchmarks were on track for weekly gains of about 8%.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden said on Thursday the US was discussing strikes on Iran's oil facilities as retaliation for Tehran's missile attack on Israel. The comments contributed to a 5% rally in oil prices.</p>

<p>The market has started to price in the likelihood of supply disruptions in the Middle East, which accounts for about a third of global supply, ANZ analyst Daniel Hynes said.</p>

<p>"The move has been exacerbated by bearish investors unwinding their bets on lower prices. The move could be extended if investors start building bullish positions in oil," Hynes said.</p>

<p>However, the supply fears have been tempered by OPEC's spare production capacity and the fact that global crude supplies have yet to be disrupted by the Middle East unrest.</p>

<p>Libya's eastern-based government and Tripoli-based National Oil Corp announced on Thursday the reopening of all oilfields and export terminals after a dispute over leadership of the central bank was resolved, ending a crisis that had heavily reduced oil production.</p>

<p>Iran and Libya are both members of OPEC. Iran, which is operating under U.S. sanctions, produced about 4.0 million barrels per day of fuel in 2023, while Libya produced about 1.3 million bpd last year, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tim Walz, Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris's running mate, on Thursday promised Muslim Americans an equal role in their administration should they win the election, as Democrats scramble to win back Muslim backing that has eroded over US support for Israel.</p>

<p>Vice President Harris and Walz, the governor of Minnesota, are trying to woo Muslim voters furious over President Joe Biden's administration's staunch backing of Israel during its year-old war in Gaza against Hamas.</p>

<p>Harris has pledged continued support for Israel while emphasizing her push for a ceasefire, words Walz echoed on Thursday while promising a role for Muslims.</p>

<p>"Vice President Harris and I are committed that this White House... will continue to condemn in all forms anti-Islam, anti-Arab sentiments being led by Donald Trump, but more importantly, a commitment that Muslims will be engaged in this administration and serve side by side," Walz said during an online meeting organized by Emgage Action, a Muslim American advocacy group that recently endorsed Harris.</p>

<p>The Nov. 5 election between Harris and Republican Trump is expected to be tight, especially in battleground states like Michigan, home to a large Muslim American population. The U.S. continues to back Israel as it targets Hezbollah in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Though Emgage has endorsed Harris, other Muslim groups have urged supporters not to back her in the election, especially after Democrats rejected requests for a Palestinian speaker at the party convention in August.</p>

<p>Harris has offered no substantive policy differences on Israel from Biden, who stepped aside as presidential candidate in July.</p>

<p>Trump has said he would reinstate a "travel ban" he imposed as president restricting the entry into the United States of people from a list of largely Muslim-dominant countries. Biden rolled back the ban shortly after taking office in 2021.</p>

<p>"The scale of death and destruction in Gaza is staggering and devastating," Walz said. Harris is working to ensure "the suffering in Gaza ends now, and the Palestinian people realize the right to dignity, freedom and self-determination."</p>

<p>The Israeli military offensive in Gaza has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, Palestinian health authorities say. Israel was responding to an incursion by Hamas gunmen on Oct. 7, 2023, which Israel says killed around 1,200 people and abducted about 250 hostages.</p>

<p>Gaza has suffered a humanitarian crisis with nearly all its 2 million people displaced and widespread hunger in the enclave.</p>

<p>Other speakers at the event included Democratic U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen from Maryland and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who both suggested that Harris could represent a shift from Biden's approach in the Middle East.</p>

<p>"I know she is a listener. She is able to change her mind," Ellison said, adding Harris was not born in the 1940s, as Biden and Trump were.</p>

<p>"I'm not promising you a rose garden" if Harris is elected, Ellison said. "But we'll be pushing on a door that's not locked."</p>

<p>It was unclear whether Walz, the first speaker, remained on the Zoom call to listen to other remarks. He took no questions.</p>

<p>While other Muslim groups have not supported Republican candidate Donald Trump, some are backing Green Party candidate Jill Stein.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump on Thursday urged a federal judge to toss out two obstruction charges central to the case that the former U.S. president illegally sought to overturn his 2020 election defeat, citing a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling raising the legal bar for those offenses.</p>

<p>Lawyers for Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, argued in a court filing that the Supreme Court's ruling requires U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan to dismiss charges accusing Trump of corruptly obstructing an official proceeding – the congressional certification of his loss to Democrat Joe Biden on Jan. 6, 2021 – and conspiring to do so.</p>

<p>Trump is also seeking the dismissal of the two other charges in the indictment on other grounds.</p>

<p>Trump has pleaded not guilty to a four-count indictment accusing him of a multi-part conspiracy to block the collection of votes and certification of his election defeat.</p>

<p>Trump's argument is based on 6-3 Supreme Court decision in June, in which the justices sided with a criminal defendant charged under the same obstruction law who was accused of taking part in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.</p>

<p>The court found that defendants charged under the law must have acted to impair "the availability or integrity" of documents or other records related to an official proceeding - or attempted to do so.</p>

<p>The indictment alleges that Trump attempted to disrupt the congressional session by creating fraudulent slates of presidential electors pledged to support him in battleground states he lost and then pressured then-Vice President Mike Pence to accept those pro-Trump electors when Pence presided over the certification.</p>

<p>Trump's lawyers argued that prosecutors cannot show that Trump sought to impair evidence related to the election certification and cannot be held responsible for the conduct of rioters who delayed the congressional session.</p>

<p>The filing came a day after prosecutors provided a detailed account of their case against Trump as they argued it survives a separate U.S. Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un said his forces would use nuclear weapons "without hesitation" if Pyongyang's territory was attacked by the South and its ally the United States, state media reported on Friday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un said his forces would use nuclear weapons "without hesitation" if Pyongyang's territory was attacked by the South and its ally the United States, state media reported on Friday.</p>

<p>"'If' the enemy... attempt to use armed forces encroaching upon the sovereignty of the DPRK... the DPRK would use without hesitation all the offensive forces it has possessed, including nuclear weapons," the KCNA news agency quoted him as saying, using the acronym for the North's official name.</p>

<p>Kim was speaking on Wednesday while inspecting a special forces military training base in the west of Pyongyang, KCNA reported.</p>

<p>The remarks came after South Korea staged a military parade earlier this week, with its President Yoon Suk Yeol threatening "the end of the North Korean regime" if Pyongyang used nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>"If North Korea attempts to use nuclear weapons, it will face the resolute and overwhelming response of our military and the US and Republic of Korea alliance," Yoon said.</p>

<p>"That day will be the end of the North Korean regime," he added, addressing thousands of service members gathered at Seoul Air Base for the event.</p>

<p>In response to those remarks, Kim branded the South Korean leader a "puppet" and "an abnormal man", KCNA reported.</p>

<p>Kim's statements also referenced the South's alliance with the United States, which is its principal military partner.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of US troops are stationed in South Korea.</p>

<p>The South has no nukes of its own and is covered by the US nuclear umbrella.</p>

<p>The latest spat comes weeks after the North disclosed images of a uranium enrichment facility for the first time, showing leader Kim touring the site as he called for more centrifuges to boost the country's nuclear arsenal.</p>

<p>The country, which conducted its first nuclear test in 2006 and is under rafts of UN sanctions for its banned weapons programmes, had never publicly disclosed details of its uranium enrichment facility before.</p>

<p>Relations between North and South Korea are at one of their lowest points in years, with the North recently announcing the deployment of 250 ballistic missile launchers to its southern border.</p>

<p>Pyongyang has designated the South its "principal enemy" and declared itself to be an "irreversible" nuclear weapons power.</p>

<p>North Korea has long flouted UN sanctions thanks in part to support from allies Russia and China.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Russian troops are in complete control of the town of Vuhledar in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region that has resisted Russian assaults for more than two years, the SHOT Telegram channel and pro-Russian war bloggers said on Wednesday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian troops are in complete control of the town of Vuhledar in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region that has resisted Russian assaults for more than two years, the SHOT Telegram channel and pro-Russian war bloggers said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Here are some key points about the town and the battle.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT IS VUHLEDAR?</strong></p>

<p>Vuhledar - which means "gift of coal" - is a coal mining town in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region with a pre-war population of around 14,000 people, nearly all of whom have fled. It was built by the Soviet Union in the mid 1960s around a mine. There are two mines there now with significant coal reserves. Russians call the town, which sits on a flat plain and is comprised of high-rise apartment buildings and other structures, Ugledar.</p>

<p><strong>WHY DID RUSSIA WANT TO TAKE IT?</strong></p>

<p>Moscow says the Donetsk region is one of four Ukrainian regions it has annexed since 2022, a claim Kyiv rejects as illegal. Moscow saw taking control of Vuhledar as an important stepping stone to incorporating the entire region into Russia.</p>

<p>Control of the town - which Russians long regarded as one of Ukraine's toughest fortified positions to crack - is considered important by both sides because of its position on elevated ground and because it sits at the intersection of the eastern and southern battlefield fronts giving it added significance when it comes to supplying both sides' forces.</p>

<p>While Ukrainian forces were in full control of Vuhledar, they were able to use the town as a platform to shell Russian military supply lines in the area.</p>

<p>The town sits close to a railway line from Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, to Ukraine's industrialised Donbas region which comprises Donetsk and the eastern region of Luhansk, most of which Moscow controls.</p>

<p>Taking Vuhledar, which Russia portrays as one of the last Ukrainian strongholds in southern Donetsk, opens the way for Russian forces to advance on other places.</p>

<p><strong>HOW DID RUSSIA TAKE CONTROL OF VUHLEDAR?</strong></p>

<p>Russian forces trapped Ukrainian soldiers in the town in what they called a mini-cauldron, gradually encircling it from all sides and thus making it increasingly difficult for Ukrainian forces to resupply or rotate in and out of the town.</p>

<p>When such a cauldron closes, something Russian military bloggers say has already happened, there is no way in or out for the defenders who in this case were bombarded with devastating aerial glide bombs.</p>

<p>Russian forces had previously launched at least four major attempts to take Vuhledar, but had been repelled with Ukraine's 72nd Separate Mechanised Brigade mounting fierce resistance.</p>

<p>Neither side discloses losses, but Ukrainian officials said Russian losses sustained during previous failed attempts to take the town had been significant. Moscow says Ukraine also paid a high human price when trying to retain Vuhledar.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT DOES VUHLEDAR LOOK LIKE NOW</strong></p>

<p>Fierce fighting since 2022 has left much of the town devastated. Images of Russian forces waving their flag on the roof of an administrative building on Tuesday in the centre showed a structure which had been reduced to rubble in parts and whose blackened windows had all been blown out.</p>

<p>Maksym Verbovsky, the town's deputy mayor, told Ukrainian state media last year that every single building had been damaged along with the entire infrastructure. He said then that fewer than 500 civilians, including three children and many pensioners, remained. All children and most adults have since been evacuated.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On a warm spring night in Athens, shortly before midnight, a senior executive at a Greek shipping company noticed an unusual email had landed in his personal inbox.</p>

<p>The message, which was also sent to the manager's business email address, warned that one of the company's vessels travelling through the Red Sea was at risk of being attacked by Yemen's Iranian-backed Houthi militia.</p>

<p>The Greek-managed ship had violated a Houthi-imposed transit ban by docking at an Israeli port and would be "directly targeted by the Yemeni Armed Forces in any area they deem appropriate," read the message, written in English and reviewed by Reuters.</p>

<p>"You bear the responsibility and consequences of including the vessel in the ban list," said the email, signed by the Yemen-based Humanitarian Operations Coordination Center (HOCC), a body set up in February to liaise between Houthi forces and commercial shipping operators.</p>

<p>The Houthis have carried out nearly 100 attacks on ships crossing the Red Sea since November, acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Israel's year-long war in Gaza. They have sunk two vessels, seized another and killed at least four seafarers.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/mg9iatt8_houthis-attack-ship-in-red-sea-reuters_625x300_02_October_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>The email, received at the end of May, warned of "sanctions" for the entire company's fleet if the vessel continued "to violate the ban criteria and enter the ports of the usurping Israeli entity".</p>

<p>The executive and the company declined to be named for safety reasons.</p>

<p>The warning message was the first of more than a dozen increasingly menacing emails sent to at least six Greek shipping companies since May amid rising geopolitical tension in the Middle East, according to six industry sources with direct knowledge of the emails and two with indirect knowledge.</p>

<p>Since last year, the Houthis have been firing missiles, sending armed drones and launching boats laden with explosives at commercial ships with ties to Israeli, U.S. and UK entities.</p>

<p>The email campaign, which has not been previously reported, indicates that Houthi rebels are casting their net wider and targeting Greek merchant ships with little or no connection to Israel.</p>

<p>The threats were also, for the first time in recent months, directed at entire fleets, increasing the risks for those vessels still trying to cross the Red Sea.</p>

<p>"Your ships breached the decision of Yemen Armed Forces," read a separate email sent in June from a Yemeni government web domain to the first company weeks later and to another Greek shipping company, which also declined to be named. "Therefore, punishments will be imposed on all vessels of your company ... Best Regards, Yemen Navy."</p>

<p>Yemen, which lies at the entrance to the Red Sea, has been embroiled in years of civil war. In 2014, the Houthis took control of the capital, Sanaa, and ousted the internationally recognized government. In January, the United States put the Houthis back on its list of terrorist groups.</p>

<p>Contacted by Reuters, Houthi officials declined to confirm they had sent the emails or provide any additional comment, saying that was classified military information.</p>

<p>Reuters could not determine whether the emails had been also sent to other foreign shipping companies.</p>

<p>Greek-owned ships, which represent one of the largest fleets in the world, comprise nearly 30% of the attacks carried out by Houthi forces to early September, according to Lloyd's List Intelligence data that did not specify whether those ships had any ties with Israel.</p>

<p>In August, the Houthi militia - which is part of Iran's Axis of Resistance alliance of anti-Israel irregular armed groups - attacked the Sounion tanker leaving it on fire for weeks before it could be towed to a safer area.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>The strikes have prompted many cargoes to take a much longer route around Africa. Traffic through the Suez Canal has fallen from around 2,000 transits per month before November 2023 to around 800 in August, Lloyd's List Intelligence data showed.</p>

<p>Tensions in the Middle East reached a new peak on Tuesday as Iran hit Israel with more than 180 missiles in retaliation for the killing of militant leaders in Lebanon, including Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah on Friday.</p>

<h2><strong>NEW PHASE</strong></h2>

<p>The European Union's naval force Aspides, which has helped more than 200 ships to sail safely through the Red Sea, confirmed the evolution of Houthis' tactics in a closed door meeting with shipping companies in early September, according to a document reviewed by Reuters.</p>

<p>In the document, shared with shipping companies, Aspides said the Houthis' decision to extend warnings to entire fleets marked the beginning of the "fourth phase" of their military campaign in the Red Sea.</p>

<p>Aspides also urged ship owners to switch off their Automatic Identification System (AIS) transponders, which shows a vessel's position and acts as a navigational aid to nearby ships, saying they had to "shut it off or be shot".</p>

<p>Aspides said the Houthis' missile strikes had 75% accuracy when aimed at vessels operating with the AIS tracking system on. But 96% of attacks missed when AIS was off, according to the same briefing.</p>

<p>"Aspides are aware of those emails," its operational commander, Rear Admiral Vasileios Gryparis, told Reuters, adding that any response should be carefully considered and that companies are strongly advised to alert their security experts if contacted before sailing.</p>

<p>"In particular, for the HOCC, the advice or guidance is not to respond to VHF calls and e-mails from "Yemeni Navy" or the "Humanitarian Operations Command Center" (HOCC)."</p>

<p>The Houthis' email campaign began in February with messages sent to shipowners, insurance companies and the main seafarers union from HOCC.</p>

<p>These initial emails, two of which were seen by Reuters, alerted the industry the Houthis had imposed a Red Sea travel ban on certain vessels, although they did not explicitly warn companies of an imminent attack.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>The messages sent after May were more menacing.</p>

<p>At least two Greek-operated shipping companies that received email threats have decided to end such journeys via the Red Sea, two sources with direct knowledge told Reuters, declining to identify the companies for security reasons.</p>

<p>An executive at a third shipping company, which has also received a letter, said they decided to end business with Israel in order to be able to continue to use the Red Sea route.</p>

<p>"If safe transit through the Red Sea cannot be guaranteed, companies have a duty to act - even if that means delaying their delivery windows," said Stephen Cotton, General Secretary of the International Transport Workers' Federation, the leading union organisation for seafarers, which received an email from HOCC in February. "The lives of the seafarers depend on it."</p>

<p>The email campaign has increased alarm among shipping companies. Insurance costs for Western ship owners' have already jumped because of the Houthi's attacks, with some insurers suspending cover altogether, the sources told Reuters.</p>

<p>Greece-based Conbulk Shipmanagement Corporation stopped Red Sea voyages after its vessel MV Groton was attacked twice in August.</p>

<p>"No (Conbulk) vessel is trading in the Red Sea. It mainly has to do with the crew safety. Once the crew is in danger, all the discussion stops," Conbulk Shipmanagement CEO Dimitris Dalakouras told a Capital Link shipping conference in London on Sept. 10.</p>

<p>Torben Kolln, managing director of German-based container shipping group Leonhardt &amp; Blumberg, said the Red Sea and wider Gulf of Aden was a "no go" area for their fleet.</p>

<p>Contacted by Reuters, the companies did not respond to a request for comment on whether they had been targeted by the Houthi email campaign.</p>

<p>Some companies continue to cross the Red Sea due to binding long-term agreements with charterers or because they need to transfer goods in that particular area.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Red Sea remains the fastest way to bring goods to consumers in Europe and Asia.</p>

<p>The Houthis have not stopped all traffic and the majority of Chinese and Russian-owned ships - which they do not see as affiliated with Israel - are able to sail through unhindered with lower insurance costs.</p>

<p>"We are re-assuring the ships belonging to companies that have no connection with the Israeli enemy that they are safe and have freedom (of movement) and (to) keep the AIS devices going on all the time," according to an audio recording of a Houthi message broadcast to ships in the Red Sea in September shared with Reuters.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 18 Palestinians were killed in an Israeli strike on the Tulkarm refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian health ministry said on Thursday, with the Israeli military saying it killed a Hamas commander.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said in a statement that its air force had killed the head of Hamas' network in Tulkarm in a strike. It identified him as Zahi Yaser Abd al-Razeq Oufi.</p>

<p>The Palestinian government "calls for urgent international action to stop the escalating massacres" against its people, it said in a statement.</p>

<p>The official spokesman for the Palestinian presidency also condemned the attack, the Palestinian news agency WAFA said, adding that those attacks "will not bring security and stability to anyone, but will drag the region into more violence".</p>

<p>Violence has surged in the West Bank since the start of the war in Gaza, with almost daily sweeps by Israeli forces that have involved thousands of arrests and regular gunbattles between security forces and Palestinian fighters.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel will reportedly carry out a "very significant retaliation within days", officials privy of the developments in Tel Aviv said on Wednesday. This comes a day after Iran launched an onslaught of nearly 200 ballistic missiles targeting Israel on Tuesday night.</p>

<p>Israel will likely target Iran's major oil producing facilities and may even launch an attack on Iran's major power plants. If indeed this happens, it will deal a crippling blow to Iran's already-strained economy due to US sanctions while also dealing a blow to its infrastructure and energy security. Israel may further target other strategic locations across Iran.</p>

<p>After Iran's ballistic missile attack - the sharpest escalation since the start of the Israel-Hamas war a year ago - Israel and Iran are on the brink of opening a new and far more dangerous front to the West Asia crisis.</p>

<h2><strong>HOW ISRAEL MIGHT RESPOND TO IRAN'S MISSILE ATTACK</strong></h2>

<p>While Israel has vowed to retaliate strongly to the missile attack, Iran has also pledged to hit back again if Israel responds to Tehran's missile attack with force. To this, Tel Aviv has reportedly said that if Iran responds with a second attack, then Israel will explore all options available to it, including obliterating all of Iran's nuclear facilities.</p>

<p>According to a news report in Axios, Israel would then also consider the option of airstrikes across Iran's strategic facilities to decimate its infrastructure while also launching covert operations across Iran - like the one that killed Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.</p>

<p>In an exclusive interview to NDTV, Israeli Ambassador Reuven Azar said "I believe the response (to Iran's missile attack) will be very structured, strategic and pin-pointed or precision attacks."</p>

<p>Senior Israeli officials believe that the response could also be in the form of "targeted killings of extremists and radicals". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's direct address to the people of Iran, saying "Israel stands with you. You will soon be free" is being seen by many as a veiled message indicating a regime change in Iran.</p>

<h3><strong>A DARE TO ISRAEL</strong></h3>

<p>Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has already been moved to a safe house at an undisclosed location. News reports claimed that the recent ballistic missile attack on Israel was a direct order from the Supreme Leader, which was then cleared by the top decision-making body in Tehran.</p>

<p>Iran's Supreme Leader however, has openly challenged Israel by reportedly saying that he will be leading thousands of Iranians for Friday's Islamic prayers in Tehran. This can be seen as a dare to Israel.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has described Iran's missile attack as a "big mistake" and said Tehran would pay for it. "Iran made a big mistake and will pay for it. The Iranian regime does not understand our determination to defend ourselves and our determination to take revenge on our enemies," he had said.</p>

<p>Calling it a "severe and dangerous escalation," Israeli Defence Forces or IDF spokesperson, RAdm. Daniel Hagari had said, "There will be consequences. We will respond wherever, whenever and however we choose, in accordance with the directive of the government of Israel."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi called an urgent meeting of the government's topmost decision-making body - the Cabinet Committee on Security over the crisis in West Asia.</p>

<p>The committee comprising the Prime Minister, the Home Minister, the Defence Minister, the Foreign Minister, the Finance Minister and the National Security Adviser, discussed in detail the fresh hostilities in the Middle East and the sharp escalation after Iran's ballistic missile attack on Israel.</p>

<p>Describing the recent developments in West Asia as "deeply concerning", the highest committee in the country delved upon various issues arising from the ongoing and widening crisis.</p>

<p>Among several key issues, they discussed the impact on trade, navigation, and supply chains - especially the supply of oil, petroleum, and its products.</p>

<p>India has urged all parties involved in the conflict to address all issues urgently, and through diplomacy and dialogue. New Delhi has also said that the ongoing conflict "must not take a wider regional dimension."</p>

<h2><strong>IMPACT ON MARITIME TRADE AND SUPPLY CHAINS</strong></h2>

<p>A conflict doesn't just affect those who are party to it, but has a fallout that impacts the rest of the region and even the world. With the sharp escalation between Iran and Israel, India is bracing for wider trade disruptions across the key Red Sea and Gulf of Aden routes.</p>

<p>The conflict can lead to significantly higher cargo freight tariffs as Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah militants have close ties with the Houthi rebels in Yemen, who are responsible for most attacks on merchant ships and vessels carrying cargo via the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden routes.</p>

<p>The Red Sea crisis began in October last year, when Iran-backed Houthi militia disrupted global trade in the area. For India alone, it affected petroleum exports which dropped 37.56 per cent to $5.96 billion in August this year, down from $9.54 billion in the same month last year.</p>

<p>The Red Sea route followed by the Suez Canal accounts for 50 per cent of India's exports - worth Rs 18 lakh crore, and 30 per cent of imports, worth Rs 17 lakh crore, as per data from 2023.</p>

<p>India's overall merchandise trade (exports and imports combined) in FY23 was Rs 94 lakh crore, with 68 per cent (in value terms) and 95 per cent (in volume terms) shipped by sea.</p>

<p>India also trades heavily with the Gulf nations. As per the latest government data, the Gulf Cooperation Council or GCC now contributes 15 per cent of India's total trade, and sectors like energy, defence, security, and health are growing rapidly in the region. The bilateral trade between India and the Gulf Cooperation Council countries reached $162 billion last year.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[A year of conflict between Israel and Hamas has resulted in a "devastating impact on the economy" in the occupied West Bank and Gaza, the IMF said Thursday, including a nearly 90 percent drop in Gaza's GDP.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A year of conflict between Israel and Hamas has resulted in a "devastating impact on the economy" in the occupied West Bank and Gaza, the IMF said Thursday, including a nearly 90 percent drop in Gaza's GDP.</p>

<p>"Preliminary official estimates indicate an 86 percent decline in GDP in the first half of 2024" in Gaza, said International Monetary Fund communications chief Julie Kozack.</p>

<p>She added that Gaza's "civilian population faces dire socioeconomic conditions, a humanitarian crisis and insufficient aid delivery."</p>

<p>In the West Bank, "already grim prospects have further deteriorated, and preliminary official data indicate a 25 percent decline in GDP in the first half of 2024," Kozack told reporters at a regular briefing.</p>

<p>Israel has been at war in Gaza since Hamas's October 7 resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people in the country, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures that include hostages killed in captivity.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory offensive in Gaza has killed at least 41,788 people, the majority of them civilians, according to figures provided by the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. The UN has described the figures as reliable.</p>

<p><strong>Israeli economy also hit</strong></p>

<p>Israel's economy has also been battered by the war, with three main ratings agencies downgrading its debt.</p>

<p>After shrinking by 21 percent in the fourth quarter of 2023, Israeli GDP rebounded by 14 percent in the first three months this year, official data showed.</p>

<p>But growth turned sluggish in the second quarter at 0.7 percent.</p>

<p>Kozack also noted that "in Lebanon, the recent intensification of the conflict is exacerbating the country's already fragile macroeconomic and social situation."</p>

<p>"We're closely monitoring the situation, and this is a situation of great concern and very high uncertainty," she added.</p>

<p>Hezbollah, an ally of Hamas, began exchanging cross-border fire from Lebanon with Israel after Hamas's October 7 attack. But the conflict has escalated after Israel announced this week that its troops had started "ground raids" into parts of southern Lebanon, after days of heavy bombardment of areas across the country where the group holds sway.</p>

<p>The bombing has killed more than 1,000 people, according to Lebanon's health ministry, and forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes.</p>

<p>Hezbollah-backer Iran launched around 200 rockets in a direct missile attack on Israel on Tuesday, prompting Netanyahu to warn that Tehran would pay.</p>

<p>Iran said it was in retaliation for the killing of Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, in a massive bombing in south Beirut.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden said he was discussing possible Israeli strikes on Iranian oil facilities, in comments that sent oil prices spiking Thursday just a month before the US presidential election.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rising tensions in the Middle East add new uncertainties for the global economy even as policymakers start to congratulate themselves on having steered it out of a bout of high inflation without triggering a recession.</p>

<p>Israel, which has been fighting with Hamas in Gaza for almost a year, has sent its troops into southern Lebanon after two weeks of intense airstrikes, escalating tensions in a conflict that risks drawing in the United States and Iran.</p>

<p>The following sketches what we know about how this could play out on the world economy in the weeks ahead.</p>

<h2><strong>WHAT IMPACT, IF ANY, HAS BEEN FELT SO FAR?</strong></h2>

<p>Very little beyond the immediate region, with the main effects limited to financial markets as investors hedge their portfolios with safe-haven assets. The US dollar has been a beneficiary since Iran's ballistic missile attack on Israel: the dollar index, which measures the US currency against the euro, yen and four other top currencies, is trading around three-week peaks.</p>

<p>Oil prices rose around 2% on Thursday on concerns a wider conflict could disrupt crude oil flows from the region - for example if Israel chose to target Iranian oil infrastructure which in turn could trigger retaliation from Iran.</p>

<p>But it is not clear that this will translate into the kind of sustained, sharper rises that motorists start to notice at the fuel pump. Analysts point out that the United States has high levels of crude oil inventories while OPEC-producing nations have enough spare capacity to smooth out the impact of disruptions, at least in the short term.</p>

<h3><strong>HOW ARE ECONOMIC POLICYMAKERS REACTING?</strong></h3>

<p>As always, central bankers stress that their job is to look beyond unpredictable, one-off shocks to the economy and instead focus on the deeper, underlying trends. But they cannot afford to totally ignore geopolitical events either.</p>

<p>Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey told The Guardian newspaper that the bank could move more aggressively to cut interest rates if inflation pressures continue to weaken - suggesting central bankers for now did not see the Middle East conflict as a major threat to their attempts to temper inflation. Bailey said there seemed to be a commitment to keep oil markets stable but he also said the conflict could yet push up oil prices if things keep escalating.</p>

<p>Sweden's Riksbank Deputy Governor Per Jansson delivered a similar message, saying the effects of the Middle East conflict were not yet enough to warrant scratching economic forecasts.</p>

<p>The International Monetary Fund said on Thursday an escalation of the conflict in the Middle East could have significant economic ramifications for the region and the global economy, but commodity prices remain below the highs of the past year. It was too early to predict specific impacts on the global economy, IMF spokesperson Julie Kozack said.</p>

<h3><strong>WHEN WILL ANY IMPACT BECOME MORE EVIDENT?</strong></h3>

<p>For context, Brent crude futures are currently around $75 a barrel, well below their $84 level at the time of Hamas' Oct. 7 strike on Israel nearly a year ago and far off the $130 highs reached after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2023.</p>

<p>Europe would be exposed to rising oil prices because, unlike the United States, it has no major domestic oil production. But even there, policymakers estimate a durable 10% rise in prices would be needed to push up inflation by just 0.1 percentage point.</p>

<p>The economic impacts of an all-out war that led to wider attacks on energy infrastructure throughout the Middle East and Gulf regions plus further disruptions to trade routes through the Red Sea, would be more tangible.</p>

<p>Oxford Economics estimated such a scenario would spike oil prices up to $130 and knock 0.4 percentage points off global output growth next year, which the International Monetary Fund currently sees at around 3.3%.<br />

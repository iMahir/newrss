       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thousands of firefighters battling a massive northern California wildfire were working in milder temperatures and higher humidity Monday, but the blaze that has destroyed more than 100 structures since it began five days ago continues to grow.</p>

<p>The Park Fire, which officials said was started by a man who pushed a flaming car into a gully, grew slightly overnight to 368,000 acres (148,924 hectares). The sixth largest wildfire in state history is rolling through a remote area some 180 miles (290 km) northeast of San Francisco, according to Cal Fire.</p>

<p>Crews were "still in for quite a firefight today, just because (of) the sheer magnitude and the sheer size of the fire," said Dan Collins, a Cal Fire captain, noting that temperatures were to be in the high 80s with 25% percent humidity during the day.</p>

<p>Some 4,800 firefighters were building and strengthening control lines on Monday morning hoping to increase the 12% they had contained. The more favorable weather conditions compared to those they faced over the past several days were helping, Collins added.</p>

<p>Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey said in a statement that the accused arson suspect, Ronnie Dean Stout II, was jailed without bond on a Butte County judge's warrant after he was identified as the person seen pushing a flaming car into a gully on Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<p>The fire rapidly grew, doubling in size from Friday to Sunday and destroying at least 114 structures in four counties.</p>

<p>The fire has also caused officials to issue evacuation warnings and orders to several communities, including Paradise, the town that was devastated by the 2018 Camp Fire, the deadliest in the state's history.</p>

<p>Cal Fire also reported on Monday that 33% of the SQF Lightning Complex was contained. That fire has raged for the past two weeks some 350 miles (563 km) to the south of the Park Fire. Part of that complex, dubbed the Borel Fire, swept through Havilah, torching much of that historic gold mining town on Friday.</p>

<p>The Park and Borel fires were just two of the 102 large active fires burning nationwide. A total of 25 had forced evacuations as of Monday morning, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.</p>

<p>A cold front in the Pacific Northwest, where many of the fires burn, was forecast to bring rain and thunderstorms to the region on Monday. However, the system will carry strong wind gusts of up to 50 miles (80 km) per hour that could hamper firefighting efforts, the center said in a statement.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who on Monday visited the site of a deadly attack in the annexed Golan Heights, vowed Israel would deliver a "severe response" to the rocket fire that killed 12 children.</p>

<p>"Like all Israeli citizens, and I must say like many around the world, we were deeply shaken by this horrific killing," Netanyahu said at the site of the attack, according to a statement issued by his office.</p>

<p>"These children are our children ... The State of Israel will not, and cannot, let this pass. Our response will come and it will be severe."</p>

<p>Scores of residents of Majdal Shams protested at Netanyahu's visit which came after the last of the victim was buried on Monday, with hundreds of Druze men and women gathering for the funeral, an AFP journalist reported.</p>

<p>Many residents of Majdal Shams have not accepted Israeli nationality since Israel seized the Golan Heights from Syria in 1967.</p>

<p>The 12 children aged between 10 and 16 were killed on Saturday when a rocket fired from Lebanon struck a football pitch in the Druze Arab town of Majdal Shams where they were playing.</p>

<p>According to the Israeli military, they were hit by an Iranian-made rocket carrying a 50-kilogramme warhead, adding it was fired by Lebanese armed group Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Hezbollah, which has traded regular cross-border fire with Israeli forces since the Gaza war began in early October, has denied responsibility for the strike, though it claimed multiple attacks on Israeli military positions that day.</p>

<p>Hezbollah says its actions against Israeli forces are in support of Palestinians in Gaza and its ally, the Hamas group.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A knife attack in northern England on Monday wounded at least eight people, reportedly including children, emergency services said.</p>

<p>Police said armed officers detained a man and seized a knife after being called to a property in Southport, near Liverpool in northwest England.</p>

<p>"There are a number of reported casualties," police said in a statement.</p>

<p>The North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) said it had "treated eight patients with stab injuries who have been taken to Alder Hey Children's Hospital, Aintree University Hospital and Southport and Formby hospital."</p>

<p>Alder Hey Children's Hospital said: "We can confirm that the trust has declared a major incident."</p>

<p>Local business owner Colin Parry, one of the people who called police, told the domestic Press Association news agency that he believed several "young girls" had been stabbed.</p>

<p>Bare Varathan, who owns a local shop, told PA he saw "seven to 10 kids" who were "injured, bleeding", adding that he saw they had been stabbed.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the incident "horrendous and deeply shocking," adding on X, formerly called Twitter, that "my thoughts are with all those affected".</p>

<p>The area where the incident took place is located in a quiet, leafy neighbourhood of residential streets.</p>

<p>Some residents who were allowed to come out from the police cordon sealing it off looked visibly shocked, according to an AFP reporter at the scene.</p>

<p>One man who lives in an adjoining street and did not wish to be named told AFP: "It's not what you expect to see in Southport."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Former US president Donald Trump has agreed to meet with the FBI for a "victim interview" about this month's assassination attempt, bureau officials said Monday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US president Donald Trump has agreed to meet with the FBI for a "victim interview" about this month's assassination attempt, bureau officials said Monday.</p>

<p>Providing an update on the status of the probe into the July 13 shooting, Federal Bureau of Investigation officials said they have still not determined a motive for the attack by the 20-year-old gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks.</p>

<p>They said Crooks, who was shot dead by a Secret Service sniper after firing eight shots during Trump's campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, appeared to be a "loner" and they have not identified any co-conspirators.</p>

<p>FBI special agent Kevin Rojek said the interview with Trump will be "a standard victim interview like we would do for any other victim of crime under any other circumstances.</p>

<p>"We want to get his perspective on what he observed," Rojek said.</p>

<p>FBI officials said they have interviewed dozens of people who knew or interacted with Crooks, including family members, co-workers, former teachers, classmates and others.</p>

<p>"We have learned the subject was highly intelligent, attended college and maintained steady employment," Rojek said. "His primary social circle appears to be limited to his immediate family as we believe he had few friends and acquaintances."</p>

<p>The FBI officials said Crooks's parents have said they had no advance knowledge of their son's plot. "We do find that to be credible at this stage," Rojek said.</p>

<p>FBI Director Christopher Wray, testifying before a congressional committee last week, said Crooks had searched online for details about the November 1963 shooting of US president John F. Kennedy by Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>"On July 6, he did a Google search for, quote, 'How far away was Oswald from Kennedy?'" Wray said.</p>

<p>Rojek said the investigation has revealed that Crooks "also made searches related to power plants, mass shooting events, information on improvised explosive devices and the attempted assassination of the Slovakian prime minister earlier this year."</p>

<p>- 'Suspicious person' -</p>

<p>Crooks was perched on the roof of a nearby building and opened fire on Trump with an AR-style assault rifle shortly after 6:00 pm, as the Republican White House candidate was addressing the rally in Butler.</p>

<p>Trump was wounded in the ear, two rally attendees were seriously injured and a 50-year-old Pennsylvania firefighter was shot dead.</p>

<p>Rojek said Crooks was identified as a "suspicious person" by law enforcement about an hour before the shooting.</p>

<p>"A local officer took a photo of the subject and sent it to other SWAT operators on scene, as well as local command personnel," he said.</p>

<p>SWAT operators observed Crooks about 30 minutes later, shortly after 5:30 pm, using a range finder and browsing news websites on his phone, he said.</p>

<p>At approximately 6:08 pm police dashcam video observed Crooks traversing the roof of the building from where he ultimately fired his shots, Rojek said.</p>

<p>"At approximately 6:11 pm a local police officer was boosted onto the roof by another officer where he encountered the subject," he said.</p>

<p>Crooks pointed his rifle at the officer, who "immediately dropped to the ground," he said. "Approximately 25 to 30 seconds after this encounter, the subject fired eight rounds before being successfully neutralized."</p>

<p>US Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned last week after acknowledging the agency had failed in its mission to prevent the assassination attempt.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Police noticed the Pennsylvania man who tried to assassinate Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump more than an hour before the July 13 shooting and took a photo to share with other law enforcement officers, an FBI official said on Monday.</p>

<p>"The shooter was identified by law enforcement as a suspicious person," Kevin Rojek, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Pittsburgh field office, told reporters at a briefing on the agency's investigation into the assassination attempt.</p>

<p>He said a local officer took a photo of gunman Thomas Crooks and sent it to other law enforcement officials at the scene of Trump's Pennsylvania rally that day. Some 30 minutes later, Rojek said, SWAT team operators saw Crooks using a rangefinder and browsing news sites.</p>

<p>Crooks was seen carrying a backpack around 5:56 p.m., less than 20 minutes before the shooting took place, and at 6:08 p.m. he was caught on a police dashboard camera walking on the roof from where he ultimately fired the shots, Rojek said.</p>

<p>Although the FBI is not the agency responsible for investigating any lapses in Trump's security, FBI personnel are putting together a timeline of events, he said.</p>

<p>FBI officials said they had yet to identify a motive for Crooks, the 20-year-old gunman, who was shot dead by a Secret Service agent after opening fire.</p>

<p>But they said he had conducted online searches on prior mass shooting events, on improvised explosive devices and on the attempted assassination of the Slovakian prime minister in May.</p>

<p>Trump, who has been highly critical of the FBI, has agreed to sit for a standard victim's interview, which "will be consistent with any victim interview we do," Rojek said. "We want to get his perspective."</p>

<p>Rojek confirmed Trump was struck by a bullet, whether "whole or fragmented into smaller pieces."</p>

<p>FBI officials have described Crooks as a loner who had no close friends or acquaintances, with his social circle limited primarily to immediate family members.</p>

<p>Using encrypted applications, he made 25 firearm-related purchases and six chemical precursors used to make explosive devices, FBI officials told reporters.</p>

<p>His longtime interest in science and doing science experiments did not rouse any suspicion by his parents, whom the FBI said have been cooperative with their investigation.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[After a year-long legal battle, Iowa became the latest US state to enact a near-total abortion ban on Monday, keeping the charged issue of reproductive rights at the forefront of November's presidential election.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a year-long legal battle, Iowa became the latest US state to enact a near-total abortion ban on Monday, keeping the charged issue of reproductive rights at the forefront of November's presidential election.</p>

<p>The law prohibits terminating nearly all pregnancies after six weeks -- the point at which a fetal heartbeat can be detected -- even though many women do not realize they are pregnant at this stage.</p>

<p>Previously, abortion was permitted in the Midwestern state up to 20 weeks of gestation.</p>

<p>Initially passed last year and signed into law by Governor Kim Reynolds, the ban was placed on hold by a judge but then reinstated following a narrow 4-3 ruling by the Iowa Supreme Court last month.</p>

<p>"This morning, more than 1.5 million women in Iowa woke up with fewer rights than they had last night because of another Trump Abortion Ban," US Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, wrote on X.</p>

<p>Her Republican opponent, former president Donald Trump, appointed three conservative Supreme Court justices who in 2022 helped overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision that had guaranteed a national right to abortion for nearly 50 years.</p>

<p>The Iowa law includes exceptions for cases of rape and incest, as well as situations where the life of the fetus or mother is at risk.</p>

<p>However, in states with similar bans, these exemptions have often proven ineffective, with hospitals and doctors hesitant to risk prosecution, forcing women to seek care out of state.</p>

<p>"Patients will be forced to travel hundreds of miles from home to find abortion care, if they have the means to do so," said Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights.</p>

<p>"Others will be forced to carry pregnancies to term, regardless of their determination of what is best for their lives, health, families, and future. People with dire pregnancy complications will be turned away from hospitals until they are crashing."</p>

<p><strong>Challenging issue for Republicans</strong></p>

<p>Iowa is now among 22 states that have set stricter standards for abortion since the fall of Roe, ranging from full bans to earlier gestational limits.</p>

<p>Trump carried Iowa by more than eight points in 2020, and is expected to win handily this time around too.</p>

<p>Still, the topic of abortion remains challenging for Republicans, who must navigate the risk of alienating independent and moderate voters.</p>

<p>A March poll by the Des Moines Register/Mediacom found that 61 percent of Iowans believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 35 percent believe it should be illegal in most or all cases -- a trend consistent with national polling.</p>

<p>Democrats, on the other hand, have been energized by President Joe Biden's decision to withdraw from the race in favor of Harris, long seen as the administration's true champion of reproductive rights.</p>

<p>"I don't think people fully understand just how angry women are about Roe being overturned -- Harris has the ability to drive that home," feminist author Jessica Valenti, who runs "Abortion, Every Day" on Substack, told AFP recently.</p>

<p>Polling by YouGov released last week found Harris enjoying a 12-point advantage over Trump on abortion, significantly higher than the five-point lead Biden held over Trump in early July.</p>

<p>On the Republican side, Trump's running mate J.D. Vance has made the divide between the two parties even starker, expressing a desire to make abortion "illegal nationally," voting against protections for in vitro fertilization, and likening abortion to "slavery."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former British TV news presenter Huw Edwards, a household name in Britain, has been charged with three counts of making indecent pictures of children, police said on Monday.</p>

<p>Edwards, 62, was the BBC's highest paid news presenter and anchored the broadcaster's "BBC News at Ten" bulletin for more than two decades. He resigned in April.</p>

<p>He has been charged with three counts of making an indecent photograph or pseudo-photograph of a child relating to images found on a child's phone, according to court documents.</p>

<p>"The offences, which are alleged to have taken place between December 2020 and April 2022, relate to images shared on a WhatsApp chat," a London police spokesperson said.</p>

<p>"Edwards was arrested on 8 November, 2023. He was charged on Wednesday, 26 June following authorisation from the Crown Prosecution Service."</p>

<p>He was bailed to appear at London's Westminster Magistrates' Court on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Edwards was one of the main faces at the BBC until his departure, announcing the death of Queen Elizabeth to the nation, and leading coverage of the biggest events in Britain since the turn of the century, including elections, royal weddings and the 2012 Olympics.</p>

<p>He quit on medical advice after allegations emerged that he had paid a young person thousands of pounds for sexually explicit photos.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A 42-year-old Belgian tourist suffered third-degree burns after losing his flip-flops in the dunes of Death Valley.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;A man was rescued after suffering full-thickness burns on his feet at Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes in Death Valley National Park. According to the<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nps.gov/deva/learn/news/7-20-2024-sand-dunes.htm"> National Park Service</a></em>, the incident happened on&nbsp;July 20 when a 42-year-old Belgian tourist suffered third-degree burns after losing his flip-flops in the dunes of Death Valley.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Park rangers said that the tourist was taking a short walk in the scorching Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes at Death Valley National Park on Saturday. The 42-year-old man was exposed to the blistering 123-degree heat, causing his skin to melt off his foot, according to Park Ranger Gia Ponce. Unable to move due to extreme pain, the man and his family enlisted the help of fellow park visitors to carry him to the parking lot, where rangers assessed his injuries.</p>

<p>Due to the heat-thinned air, helicopters were unable to fly in, so an ambulance transported him to higher ground, where it was cooler (109 degrees), and he was then airlifted to safety.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''People think it's going to be like the beach where you can get out there with flip-flops or sandals, but because of the extreme temperatures, those dunes heat up just as much as the pavement does,” Ms Ponce said.</p>

<p>On a sand dune, the ground temperature is much hotter than in the air. According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2024/07/24/man-who-lost-flip-flops-death-valley-hospitalized-burned-feet/">Washington Post</a></em>, that's because sand doesn't require much energy to warm up. When the sand's high-density traps that heat, the result is a hot, hot surface.</p>

<p>Park officials recommend walking in the park and its soft dunes only in closed-toe shoes to avoid similar incidents. They also gave some advice to those interested in visiting Death Valley during the heat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''Park rangers recommend that summer travellers to Death Valley National Park stay within a 10-minute walk of an air-conditioned vehicle, not hike after 10 am, drink plenty of water, eat salty snacks, and wear a hat and sunscreen,'' a release from National Park Service read.</p>

<p>Tensions in the region have escalated following a rocket strike on a soccer field in northern Israel's Majdal Shams on July 27 that resulted in the death of 12 children and injured several others.</p>

<p>Israel and the USA blamed Hezbollah for the air strike with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying that Hezbollah will pay a "heavy price which it has not paid up to now" for the attack.</p>

<p>Netanyahu also held a security assessment meeting in Tel Aviv on Sunday during which "the manner and timing of the response" against Hezbollah was decided.</p>

<p>Several flights heading to Beirut have also been suspended over the last couple of days following the Israeli threat of military action against Hezbollah.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who was in Tokyo on Monday, also expressed Washington's support for Israel, highlighting Israel's right to self-defence while also urging the need to avoid escalation of the conflict on Israel's northern border.</p>

<p>"We don't want to see the conflict escalate. We don't want to see it spread," Blinken said on the sidelines of the Quad Foreign Ministers Meeting.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Indian Embassy in Beirut shared an emergency mail ID and phone number, asking the Indian nationals in the country to remain in touch.</p>

<p>According to the Indian embassy, there are nearly 4000 Indian nationals in Lebanon, with a majority of them employed as workers in companies, construction sector, agricultural farms, etc.<br />

<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-07/ivd4np6o_olympics_625x300_29_July_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>

<p>So what if our team turned up in an eyesore of a formal kit at the opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics? Our shaadi ceremonies are way grander than the show France put up earlier this week. As we say in Delhi, "vibe is better here".</p>

<p>On a serious note, Team India's sartorial ignominy will, disproportionately, remain the defining moment for the country's most important sporting outing in four years. Unless, of course, the shine of medals makes us forget how we repeatedly let our athletes down.&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://sports.ndtv.com/olympics-2024/paris-olympics-2024-live-updates-manu-bhaker-ramita-jindal-olympic-games-paris-2024-day-3-latest-updates-6212322">While shooter Manu Bhaker</a> is being cheered for her bronze, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://sports.ndtv.com/olympics-2024/videos/sharath-kamal-deepika-kumari-and-others-bow-out-paris-olympics-on-day-2-819598">Deepika Kumari</a> has been turned into a villain online after India's archery team lost 0-6 to the Netherlands.</p>

<h2><strong>What The Olympics Represent</strong></h2>

<p>The modern Olympics are important, they have always been, for not just what they present during some weeks but also what they represent before and after the opening and the closing ceremonies. They are scrutinised, overanalysed, politicised, and sometimes even totemised. Terrorist threats emerging around each edition of the games underscore their geopolitical importance. Like their ancient version, the modern Olympics are overburdened with the task of building bridges between countries and cultures. They are a celebration of the indomitable spirit of humanity that burns bright even when countries and cultures stand on the brink of annihilation. The loudest cheers, therefore, are reserved for the contingents marching under the refugee flags, every four years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Olympics have been serving as an antidote to strife and conflict since ancient times. The Greeks loved to fight. But they also halted their warring business for the games. Even in the middle of the fierceness of the Trojan War in <em>The Iliad</em>, Achilles organises funeral games to honour the memory of Patroclus. Many an observer of the games in both their ancient and modern avatars believe that the Olympics are all about winning. Surely, the hymns of glory in Homer's epic and other classical texts like the odes of Pindar reserved for the winning athletes may foster this idea. Nothing could be further than the truth. The spirit of games, especially the Olympics, was far higher than the podium.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><b>A Question Of Honour</b></h2>

<p>In the ancient Greek culture, the desire for honour, <em>philotimia</em>, and the desire for victory, <em>philonikia</em>, run parallel. Heroes are heroes because they win, or lose, with their honour intact. Agamemnon, a great warrior, is no hero and meets a rather unheroic end by being killed in a bathtub in his home upon returning as a victor in the Trojan War. Achilles, had it not been for the funeral games, would not have emerged as the hero of<em> The Iliad</em>. His rage and retribution subside after immersion in the nobleness surrounding honourable competition. The Greeks did not have much respect for a man - women were not there in the game, they were often the prize - who could not bear to see another man win. Phthonos - the tendency to deprive another man of good and happiness - was acknowledged but not celebrated.</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/who-was-the-masked-torchbearer-at-paris-olympics-opening-ceremony-6205762">Also Read |&nbsp;Who Was The Masked Torchbearer At Paris Olympics Opening Ceremony?</a></strong></p>

<p>It must be noted that codes of honour applied only to the mortals. The gods and goddesses could lie, cheat, quarrel, and be as base as they wished. Only those who could die could aspire to heroism; only they had to make a choice. Antilochus urging his horses mercilessly when competing against Menelaus makes a less-than-ideal choice. His zeal for victory ought not to be a burden for his beasts. He loses. Even if he'd won, Antilochus would have to swear that he didn't resort to unfair means.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The modern Olympics aim to carry this legacy of honour. And it's not confined to the competition venues. It is now becoming a norm to use the Olympics platform to make political statements. The throwing of the red roses by the Algerian contingent in the river Seine near a protest site where allegedly 300 Algerians were killed in 1961 after a French police crackdown is a powerful gesture of memorialising the victims of colonialism. Being honourable and successful is rarely coterminous now.</p>

<h2><strong>Indian Athletes Are Already Winners</strong></h2>

<p>Coming back to the Indian contingent, their success lies in the fact of their very presence at the Olympics. They are a case study in honour and humility. Racing against time, crossing interminable systemic, societal, and logistical hurdles if they are able to don their country's colours-however non-aesthetically rendered-with pride and dignity on that barge cruising down the Seine, they are winners even before competing. India's neglect of its athletes is a story oft told.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/paris-olympics-2024-coco-gauff-reveals-why-her-teammates-left-olympic-village-for-hotel-6207833">Also Read |&nbsp;"10 Girls, 2 Bathrooms": Coco Gauff On Why Her Teammates Left Olympic Village For Hotel</a></strong></p>

<p>This should bring us to the question: what should winning at the Olympics mean for Indians beyond the immediate photo ops? And what about the promised infrastructural and systemic reforms that would allow Indian children to even think of sports as a real choice? Why do we, the people, expect any glory and honour from our athletes at the Olympics when we do not fuel their fire with honourable conduct on our part? We are the quickest to throw them under the bus for their inability to handle the flash-in-a-pan moment of the limelight they get after any sporting victory.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After such knowledge, what forgiveness?&nbsp;</p>

The lift-off was successful, but the mission ended with Ariane 6 coasting into orbit without releasing the final payload.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To protect "Europe's return to space", three French Rafale fighter jets were deployed to escort the rocket and prevent any "malicious intrusion in the air". A video of Rafales escorting the rocket is now viral on X.&nbsp;</p>

       <description><![CDATA[CCHF is transmitted through tick bites or contact with bodily fluids of infected animals or humans.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man in Spain&nbsp;died after contracting a lethal 'bleeding eyes' disease called Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF),&nbsp;a deadly viral disease with a fatality rate of up to 40%. According to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/07/29/man-dies-contracting-lethal-bleeding-eyes-disease-tick-bite-spain-21316113/">Metro</a></em>, the 74-year-old died on Saturday&nbsp;after being hospitalised near Madrid.</p>

<p>The man, whose identity has not been revealed, was&nbsp;admitted to Rey Juan Carlos University Hospital in Mostoles, Spain, after being bitten by a tick in Toledo, approximately 100 miles southwest of Madrid. After he was diagnosed with the rare Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus, he was transferred to a high-dependency isolation unit at La Paz University Hospital in Madrid to prevent transmission. Initially, his condition was deemed stable, but he subsequently deteriorated after developing all symptoms associated with CCHF.</p>

<p>Tragically, he died from the virus on Saturday, marking the first CCHF-related death in Spain since May 2020. Health authorities are likely to be on high alert to prevent further cases and contain the spread of this dangerous virus.</p>

<p><strong>About&nbsp;Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever</strong></p>

<p>CCHF, described as 'Ebola-like' due to its similar hemorrhagic symptoms, is a disease caused by a tickborne virus. It has been categorised as a "priority disease" on a list by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and currently has no vaccine available.&nbsp;It is also one of nine pathogens deemed most likely to trigger a pandemic.&nbsp;CCHF is endemic in all of Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East and in Asia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>CCHF is transmitted through tick bites or contact with bodily fluids of infected animals or humans. Ticks can also transmit various other diseases, including Lyme disease, and the Powassan virus. The initial symptoms of CCHF include fever, muscle aches, abdominal pain, sore throat, and vomiting. It can also cause mood swings, confusion, and sleepiness, and trigger bleeds, usually from the nose or broken capillaries on the eyes and skin.</p>

<p>As per WHO, general supportive care with treatment of symptoms is the main approach to managing CCHF in people. The antiviral drug ribavirin has been used to treat the infection with apparent benefit. To prevent tick-borne diseases, people are advised to wear protective clothing, use insect repellents, and check for ticks after spending time outdoors.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Germany said on Monday it was not deterred by Russian President Vladimir Putin's threats to relaunch production of intermediate-range nuclear weapons if the United States confirms its intention to deploy missiles to Europe.</p>

<p>"We will not be intimidated by such statements," foreign ministry spokesman Sebastian Fischer told a government press conference.</p>

<p>In early July, Washington and Berlin announced that the "episodic deployments" of long-range US missiles, including Tomahawk cruise missiles, to Germany would begin in 2026.</p>

<p>Putin on Sunday threatened to relaunch production of intermediate-range nuclear weapons if the plans go ahead.</p>

<p>"We will consider ourselves liberated from the unilateral moratorium previously adopted on the deployment of medium- and short-range strike capabilities," Putin said during a naval parade in Saint Petersburg.</p>

<p>Putin added that now in Russia "the development of a number of such systems is in the final stages".</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/russian-president-vladimir-putin-warns-us-of-cold-war-style-missile-crisis-819501" target="_blank">"We will take mirror measures in deploying them</a>, taking into account the actions of the US, its satellites in Europe and in other regions of the world," the Russian president warned.</p>

<p>Such missiles, which can travel between 500 and 5,500 kilometres (300-3,400 miles), were the subject of an arms control treaty signed by the United States and the Soviet Union in 1987.</p>

<p>But both Washington and Moscow withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 2019, each accusing the other of violations.</p>

<p>"This type of missile... had already been developed and deployed long ago" by Russia, Fischer said.</p>

<p>"What we are now planning is a response to deter these weapons from being used against Germany or other targets," he added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Calling India an "important partner" at a time when the world is at a "historic turning point", Japan on Monday said that it hopes to work more closely with the government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the times to come.</p>

<p>External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Japanese Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa discussed ways to strengthen bilateral cooperation during their 40-minute meeting following the Quad Foreign Ministers Meeting in Tokyo on Monday.</p>

<p>According to the Japanese Foreign Ministry, Kamikawa stated during the meeting that Tokyo wishes to "co-create" new solutions through dialogue and collaboration while deepening cooperation with New Delhi.</p>

<p>In response, EAM Jaishankar mentioned that as the India-Japan Special Strategic and Global Partnership marks its 10th anniversary, India is hoping to further deepen cooperation in a wide range of areas, including the economy, security and people-to-people exchanges.</p>

<p>The two ministers also shared the view that they would strengthen bilateral cooperation, including the steady progress of the high-speed rail project, a flagship project between Japan and India.</p>

<p>They also welcomed the expansion of recruitment for Indian nationals under the JET Programme and the start of the dispatch of Japanese Language Partners to India besides exchanging views on cooperation regarding the Security Council reform, with a view to the Future Summit in September this year.</p>

<p>Earlier, the Quad Foreign Ministers, including EAM Jaishankar, jointly called on Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida following their meeting on Monday afternoon.</p>

<p>During the 20-minute meeting, Kishida welcomed the progress that has been made in various areas of cooperation following discussions between the Quad grouping's foreign ministers that also included Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Japanese Foreign Minister Kamikawa Yoko.</p>

<p>"Honoured to call on Prime Minister Kishida along with fellow Quad Foreign Ministers today in Tokyo. Conveyed the warm regards of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Briefed him on the key takeaways from our meeting today. Appreciate his guidance for continued growth of Quad grouping and value his views on further intensification of India-Japan relations," EAM Jaishankar posted on X after the meeting.</p>

<p>In his remarks, Kishida mentioned that Japan, India, the United States and Australia would continue to cooperate closely at various levels.</p>

<p>"At the outset, Prime Minister Kishida welcomed the visit of the foreign ministers of the three countries to Japan. He stated that amid increasing uncertainty in the international situation, cooperation among Japan, the United States, Australia and India is becoming increasingly important in order to uphold principles and fundamental values," the Japanese Foreign Ministry stated after the meeting.</p>

<p>Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Hayashi Yoshimasa, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Moriya Hiroshi, Special Advisor to the Prime Minister Ishihara Hirotaka, and several other top officials also attended the meeting.</p>

<p>"The three foreign ministers stated the importance of Japan, the United States, Australia and India, as partners sharing fundamental values, strengthening a rules-based, free and open international order, and confirmed that the four countries will promote various forms of cooperation and further collaborate together for the sake of peace and stability in the region," the statement added.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amid the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Monday said that the solution will not emerge from the battlefield, adding that it is imperative to return to dialogue and diplomacy.</p>

<p>He underlined how India had reiterated numerous times that the use of force is not the way to resolve problems between countries, and emphasized that "more needs to be done."</p>

<p>"From the very beginning, we had the view that the use of force does not resolve problems between countries. In the last 2-2.5 years, this conflict has cost lives, economic damage, and global consequences, impacted other societies, and contributed to global inflation... We do not think that the solution will emerge from the battlefield," Mr Jaishankar said while speaking to the press in Tokyo today.</p>

<p>The EAM further called for a return to dialogue and diplomacy and continuous efforts should be made by the countries involved to resolve the conflict.</p>

<p>"We believe that there must be a return to dialogue and diplomacy...Our feeling today is that more needs to be done, we should not resign ourselves to the continuation of the current state of conflict and say let this take its own course..." the minister said.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar, along with Foreign Ministers of Japan Yoko Kamikawa and Australia's Penny Wong as well as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken participated in the Quad foreign ministers' meeting held on July 29 in Tokyo.</p>

<p>Quad is a diplomatic partnership between Australia, India, Japan, and the United States, committed to supporting an open, stable, and prosperous Indo-Pacific that is inclusive and resilient.</p>

<p>The Quad Foreign Ministers Meeting joint statement issued on July 29 said that the countries of the bloc were collectively advancing a positive and practical agenda to support the Indo-Pacific region's sustainable development, stability, and prosperity, responding to the region's needs.</p>

<p>The statement said that they contribute to a region in which all countries and people can exercise free choice on how they cooperate, and trade based on partnership, equality and mutual respect.</p>

<p>Through Quad, the countries are supporting the region through practical cooperation on challenges such as maritime security, critical and emerging technologies, cyber security, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, health security, climate change, counterterrorism, infrastructure and connectivity, and addressing the debt crisis through sustainable, transparent and fair lending and financing practices. The countries will cooperate with regional partners to address shared challenges in the region, the statement read.</p>

<p>PM Modi, who was on an official visit to Moscow recently, met with Russian President Vladimir Putin there. It was PM Modi's first visit to Russia since the war started between Moscow and Kyiv in 2022.<br />
Notably, India has always advocated "peace and diplomacy" for resolving conflict between Ukraine and Russia but has continued to purchase Russian oil, despite the objections of the Western nations, especially the US.</p>

<p>PM Modi said that everyone who believes in humanity is pained when there is a loss of lives. He further stated that it is "heart-wrenching" when innocent children are dying.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Prime Minister also reiterated that the resolution to the conflict can't happen on battlefield but only through dialogue.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least two people were killed and up to 100 people injured on Monday when a passenger train carrying 800 people collided with a Kamaz truck, derailing eight carriages, Russian media outlets reported.</p>

<p>Some of the carriages lay twisted and battered beside the railway track, they said.</p>

<p>The train had been travelling from Kazan in Tatarstan to Adler on the Black Sea when it derailed in the southern Volgograd region near the Kotelnikovo station about 1,200 km (750 miles) south of Moscow, the emergencies ministry said.</p>

<p>"Paramedics are on the scene," the ministry said, adding that 324 emergency workers were involved in the operation. Emergency helicopters have also been scrambled, it said.</p>

<p>The Mash Telegram channel said at least two people were killed but that the death count could rise. Interfax news agency said that up to 100 people could be injured.</p>

<p>Unverified video on Telegram showed at least four carriages derailed, some twisted, with people climbing out of one that was on its side beside the rails.</p>

<p>Mash published video showing the battered remains of the cabin of a Kamaz truck beside the derailed train.</p>

<p>TASS cited unidentified sources in Russian law enforcement as saying that 20 people had been injured when the train collided with a Kamaz truck.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden announced plans on Monday for urgent reforms to the conservative-dominated Supreme Court, in a bold but long-shot move as he seeks to make a mark in his last six months in power.</p>

<p>The 81-year-old Democrat is calling for a constitutional amendment to reverse the Supreme Court's recent ruling backing Donald Trump's claims of presidential immunity, according to the White House.</p>

<p>The Democrat is also calling for term limits for Supreme Court justices, who currently serve for life, following shock rulings such as the repeal of the nationwide right to abortion.</p>

<p>Biden, who will further unveil the plans in a speech in Austin, Texas later Monday, will also seek an enforceable ethics code after a string of scandals.</p>

<p>He had confirmed he would seek the reforms during an Oval Office address last week outlining his priorities after deciding to drop out of the 2024 election, though the plans have almost no hope of getting through a deeply divided Congress.</p>

<p>"This nation was founded on a simple yet profound principle: No one is above the law. Not the president of the United States. Not a justice on the Supreme Court of the United States. No one," Biden said in an opinion piece published Monday.</p>

<p>"What is happening now is not normal, and it undermines the public's confidence in the court's decisions, including those impacting personal freedoms. We now stand in a breach."</p>

<p>Though their chances are slim, the proposed reforms reflect Biden's growing frustration with a court packed with Trump-appointed judges, and come as opinion polls show a growing loss of public confidence in the institution.</p>

<p>The White House said that both Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, now the presumptive Democratic nominee for November's election, "look forward to working with Congress" on the plans.</p>

<p>This would "reduce the chance that any single presidency imposes undue influence for generations to come," it said in a fact sheet.</p>

<p>But the White House said Biden would now seek 18-year term limits on Supreme Court justices, with new justices being appointed every two years.</p>

<h3><strong>Close to zero</strong></h3>

<p>This would "reduce the chance that any single presidency imposes undue influence for generations to come," it said in a fact sheet.</p>

<p>He would also seek a "binding, enforceable" ethics code similar to those that apply to federal judges.</p>

<p>The top court has a 6-3 conservative majority, with three judges who were appointed while Trump was president, and has dealt Biden several blows in recent years.</p>

<p>The court stunned the world in 2022 when it overturned the 1973 Roe v Wade ruling that had underpinned the federal right to abortion. At least 20 states have now brought in full or partial abortion bans.</p>

<p>This year the court significantly rolled back the power of federal agencies, while also partially ruling in early July in favor of Republican nominee Trump's immunity claims.</p>

<p>Trump is now using that ruling to challenge his recent criminal conviction in a porn star-hush money case as well as a series of other prosecutions.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Supreme Court has been rocked by ethics scandals involving arch-conservative justices.</p>

<p>Justice Clarence Thomas recently admitted that two luxury vacations he took in 2019 were paid for by a billionaire Republican political donor.</p>

<p>Thomas, the longest-service justice on the court, has also ignored calls to recuse himself from cases related to the 2020 election, after his wife took part in the drive to keep Trump in power despite his electoral loss.</p>

<p>And Justice Samuel Alito has rejected calls to recuse himself from some Trump-related cases after flags linked to the former president's false election fraud claims were discovered to have been flown outside his home and vacation property.</p>

<p>Legal expert Steven Schwinn warned however that Biden had a "close to zero" chance of getting the plan through.</p>

<p>But Biden was probably trying to "raise public consciousness" and "introduce the Supreme Court as an election issue," Schwinn, a law professor at the University of Illinois Chicago, told AFP.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>There comes a point in the life of every 30-something Indian woman where many interactions take the form of an explanation. The pressing issue to be addressed is this: "What's a brilliant girl like you doing single?"</p>

<h2><strong>The "Graveyard" Of 30s</strong></h2>

<p>You'd think the legalisation of homosexuality, new flourishing pockets of polyamory and open relationships, the fluidities in gender and sexuality and self-expression, would've dulled the kind of thinking that prompts people to ask such questions. But even the young and supposedly open-minded let slip their belief now and then that 30 is some kind of a graveyard, after which life either ends or is not as meaningful as it once was. A young man was recently telling our common friend about "a really old woman" he was lucky to have sex with. "She was, like, 31 or something, dude," he bragged, before realising his faux pas.</p>

<p>Another Gen-Z woman told me "I'll never be Gen-Z, no matter how hard I try". I wondered if the implication was that I was too old to be so online, or that I was not as good at it as she was, or that instead of being so up-to-date with memes and popular discourse, I should do something more age-appropriate. The internet is, after all, riddled with girl-math and boy-math-never woman-math.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But when you are content with your life and its discontents, you don't want to engage with anyone who doesn't get it. Especially when you can just write a column about it.</p>

<h2><strong>Young, Sweet Love</strong></h2>

<p>So, let me tell you (almost) everything: At the age of 29, I was in perhaps the best relationship of my life with a cool, caring and emotionally stable man I'd known for years, who had a family that I'd have been honoured to enter. Just a few weeks into our relationship, I knew that I should marry him, but by our two-year anniversary, when we were at a crossroads about what to do next, I felt I'd changed too much. "Settling down" suddenly seemed too distant from who I felt I was becoming, even though I'd been anxious to get married throughout my late twenties. Maybe it was distaste at having chased something so externally imposed that made me want to upend it, or maybe it was something deeper (it was definitely something deeper. My parents are divorced and my family is dysfunctional, and I have been subject to my own creative, destructive self-sabotage for a long time now).</p>

<p>Either way, I was trying to discard the imposed and honour the internal. My twenties had been driven by the need to succeed at every task thrown my way, despite familial troubles, all some form of survival disguised as decorum. But I now intended to live my many unlived lives: I moved out of our shared apartment into a one-bedroom flat - a veritable 'Room with a View' - in which I started writing more, painting for the first time, thinking and working fully without disruption. I loved my solitude, which also I'd never allowed myself, because even outside of your gender, living and doing things alone, and enjoying them no less, is considered 'weird' at best. I wanted to date freely and widely, to understand what really suited me, to devote more time to my many friendships, without romance or marriage becoming the fulcrum for the rest of my life. I'd seen much harm ensue from people doing things just because other people were doing them too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I wanted to be a sovereign individual, in short.</p>

<h2><strong>I Now Understand Carrie Bradshaw</strong></h2>

<p>Favourable or not, this was the honest thing to do. From Virginia Woolf to Carrie Bradshaw - whose room with a view was in expensive New York City ( even in Bengaluru, I work multiple non-writing jobs to sustain my mostly modest lifestyle) &nbsp;- writers especially want this kind of solitary freedom. The first time I watched <em>Sex and the City</em> last year, however, just after I turned 30, my reaction to Carrie's life was not a kindred "I'm just like her <em>fr</em>". I was way more judgmental. Her initially crazy behaviour with Big notwithstanding, I thought her dresses were too floozy and her columns simplistic and her attitude too carefree - not dark and brooding and <em>real</em>, like mine - and her pursuits too meaningless. Going out every night, meeting new people, buying more shoes than she could afford... What kind of 30-year-old woman does that? She was being such a... <em>girl</em>... I realised, in horror.</p>

<p>She was being what I could never be at home, as the eldest daughter to perfectionistic Tamil Brahmin parents: unbothered, free, promiscuous, cute, silly, often stupid, at least financially, if not romantically too. She was being what I found it hard to be even now, due to both internal and external deterrents. Unlike in New York City, a Bangalorean landlady might still tell you things like "don't allow boys to enter for your own safety". When I told this woman that I had male friends, she asked me whether I was "really Brahmin". Another landlady flat out refused to rent to a single woman because "if something happened to me", she'd be responsible.</p>

<h2><strong>There Is No Right Way To Live</strong></h2>

<p>So, when you walk away from such well-trodden paths, the pressure to display satisfaction and success intensifies. Carrie was one of TV's first female protagonists to portray women as desiring beings, rather than just desired objects. She doesn't just take what she gets - not always; she tries to be a discerning customer, at least. And like her, despite choosing authenticity over safety, I too experience doubt. I might catch myself thinking like the 'society uncle and aunty', who'd wonder about how much money I'm making or how big my house is or how many followers I have or how likely I am to get married in the next few years. After all, what do I have to show for my deviance? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>But if there's one thing I've learnt from my Robert Frost era, it discourages this kind of habitual comparative evaluation, normalised by the hypercompetitive Indian coming-of-age experience. I have to keep reminding myself of it, but the only lesson is this: There is No Right Way to Live.</p>

<h2><b>On Love And Lovers</b></h2>

<p>In just the past few weeks, as I was travelling through Goa and Kerala, I wondered sometimes what "settling down" might look for someone like me. I met people from, as ChatGPT might say, "all walks of life". It started with an old friend ringing to tell me he was back in the city, on a sort of a sabbatical, an unimaginable luxury for '90s Indian kids who were repeatedly asked to excel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We spent the day yapping - if I may be so bold, my Gen-Z readers - and then met a few of his friends. The single ones chatted about how romance is irrevocably different in our 30s than in our 20s. It's less about giving into chemistry and more about overcoming the attachment styles and subconscious patterns that lead to exciting but otherwise unsuitable partners. Another was in an open relationship with her primary partner for nearly a decade, with girlfriends and boyfriends in other countries too. Another bemoaned his inability to fall in love after his most serious relationship ended badly. Another old friend texted me about the end of their marriage after years of being together.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From this colourful scene, my friend and I departed to meet two other friends, a married couple, who might be the poster child of the 'New-Indian-Happily-Married-Hindu' Family. Like the other couples I've hung out with of late, they too briefly made me long for the traditional monogamous setup. We talked until 3 am, and I woke up the next day to meet a friend I'd made in Goa. He'd moved there to "be more openly queer", after realising that the more metropolitan cities wouldn't offer him the life he wanted. We flirted with the idea of dating, but my now familiar commitment-phobia reared its head again. I was hardly out of a situationship with an ex who had once been a favourite, but was now completely wrong for me, thanks to chemistry coupled with traumatic highs and lows.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Talk about being romantically stupid, well past the age for it.</p>

<h2><strong>Who Doesn't Have 'Problems'?</strong></h2>

<p>Fortunately, it didn't take me long to forget about him, because I matched with interesting, desirable people on the multiple apps you can now be on-from Bumble and Hinge and Feeld to, yes, even... Shaadi.com. Many people find these platforms hellish, and I might too eventually, but if you're an anthropologist as I sometimes get to be, it's easier to trade outcomes for observations and stories. I'm still not sure what I want, but I've met a wildlife researcher whose first conversation with me included an image of a bear standing on one of his weighing scales. I've also met lawyers and designers and writers and artists and technology brothers, and couples and divorcees and singles and weirdos and non-weirdos - some chronically online and others not - and what I'm learning is something no relationship coach or matchmaker will ever tell me, but what feels most important to know: there is no right way to live.</p>

<p>No one seems objectively happier than the other. No one seems to not have any problems. Some of these problems are despite following the well-trodden path. Some of them are from walking away from it, understandably. A lot of problems come from wondering if the problems are even legitimate, and whether others could or would or should have them.</p>

<p>For now, I am here to confirm: they do have problems, and they're quite like yours, and you're okay.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And I'm okay too, I think.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Telecom installations belonging to French companies SFR and Bouygues Telecom have been vandalised, reported Le Parisien newspaper and BFM TV on Monday, citing unnamed sources.</p>

<p>SFR and Bouygues did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>The reports said cables in electrical cabinets had been cut in southern France, and that installations in the Meuse region near Luxembourg and the Oise area near Paris had been vandalised, affecting mainly fixed-line services.</p>

<p>Saboteurs targeted France's high-speed rail network on Friday with pre-dawn attacks on signal substations and cables, causing travel chaos hours before the opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics.</p>

<p>Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said that one far-left extremist had been arrested on Sunday in relation to the case.</p>

<p>Traffic only returned to normal Monday morning but only after some 800,000 people faced disruptions, including 100,000 people whose trains had to be cancelled outright.</p>

<p>The reports by Le Parisien and BFM TV did not state if there were any links between the vandalism on the telecom installations, and that earlier sabotage on the rail network.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

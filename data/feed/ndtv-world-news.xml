       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Los Angeles home where Marilyn Monroe died was declared a historic landmark on Wednesday, thwarting plans by its current owners to demolish the property.</p>

<p>The house was home to the "Some Like It Hot" screen siren for the final six months of her life up to her death from a drug overdose in 1962.</p>

<p>More than half a century on, Monroe remains one of the most beloved figures in US pop culture, and fans as well as conservationists have closely followed a row over the future of the home.</p>

<p>Property heiress Brinah Milstein and her reality TV producer husband Roy Bank bought the Spanish Colonial-style home in the swanky Brentwood neighbourhood last summer for $8.35 million.</p>

<p>The couple owned the house next door and intended to combine the two properties. That construction would have involved razing the Monroe home.</p>

<p>But when a demolition permit was issued last September, a furore quickly followed, and local politicians moved quickly to designate the building's protected status.</p>

<p>Last month, the owners sued the city of Los Angeles for "illegal and unconstitutional conduct."</p>

<p>Their petition noted Monroe had "occasionally" lived in the home for "a mere six months", and the couple claim that more than a dozen previous owners since 1962 have already changed the building beyond recognition.</p>

<p>Those objections were overruled Wednesday, as city councillors approved the designation of the house as a historic cultural monument.</p>

<p>Monroe bought the 3,000-square-foot single-story hacienda in 1962 just after her divorce from playwright Arthur Miller.</p>

<p>"There is no other person or place in the city of Los Angeles as iconic as Marilyn Monroe and her Brentwood home," said councillor Traci Park, whose district includes the house in question.</p>

<p>"Some of the most world-famous images ever taken of her were in that home, on those grounds and near her pool.</p>

<p>"There is likely no woman in history or culture who captures the imagination of the public the way Marilyn Monroe did. Even all these years later, her story still resonates and inspires many of us today."</p>

<p>Monroe's smouldering looks and breathy delivery made her one of the most bankable movie stars of her era.</p>

<p>The "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" star was linked during her lifetime with some of the most eligible men of her era, including president John F. Kennedy, famously singing "Happy Birthday, Mr President" at Madison Square Garden.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korea successfully tested its multiple-warhead missile capability, state media said Thursday, as dozens more trash-laden balloons from Pyongyang landed in the South.</p>

<p>Relations between the two Koreas are at one of their lowest points in years, with Pyongyang ramping up weapons testing while bombarding the South with balloons full of trash it says are in retaliation to similar missives sent northwards by activists in the South.</p>

<p>The balloons briefly forced Seoul's major hub Incheon Airport to close on Wednesday, and in response to the successive launches, South has fully suspended a tension-reducing military treaty and re-started propaganda loudspeaker broadcasts and live-fire drills near the border.</p>

<p>North Korea claimed it had "successfully conducted the separation and guidance control test of individual mobile warheads", the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said Thursday.</p>

<p>The "separated mobile warheads were guided correctly to the three coordinate targets" during the test, carried out the day before, it said.</p>

<p>"The test is aimed at securing the MIRV capability," KCNA added, referring to multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle technology -- or the ability to fire multiple warheads on a single ballistic missile.</p>

<p>South Korea's military had previously said the North's test on Wednesday appeared to be of a hypersonic missile, but that the launch ended in a mid-air explosion.</p>

<p>More smoke than usual appeared to emanate from the missile, raising the possibility of combustion issues, the official said, adding it may have been powered by solid propellants.</p>

<p>According to KCNA, the test "was carried out by use of the first-stage engine of an intermediate-range solid-fuel ballistic missile within a 170-200 kilometre (105 to 124-mile) radius."</p>

<p>"The effectiveness of a decoy separated from the missile was also verified by anti-air radar," it said.</p>

<p>Acquiring multiple-warhead missile technology is an ultimate goal for nations seeking ICBM-level missiles to carry nuclear warheads, said Hong Min, a senior research fellow at the Korea Institute for National Unification.</p>

<p>It appears the North is "testing such technology step by step over the long haul," he told AFP.</p>

<p>"They appear to be making technological advancements in the early development stages of multiple-warhead missiles."</p>

<h3><strong>Balloon blitz&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>For three consecutive days, North Korea has floated hundreds of trash-carrying balloons southward in a tit-for-tat propaganda campaign.</p>

<p>Seoul's military said around 70 balloons had landed by Thursday morning, mainly in northern Gyeonggi province and the Seoul area, with the contents found to not be hazardous.</p>

<p>"The payload is about 10 kilograms (22 pounds), so there is a risk if the balloons descend rapidly," it said, adding the military was ready to respond.</p>

<p>The response to the latest balloons "will be flexible depending on the strategic and operational situation. This depends on North Korea's actions," it added.</p>

<p>South Korea's Marine Corps resumed live-fire exercises on islands near the western inter-Korean border on Wednesday, marking the first such exercises since the 2018 tension-reducing military deal with the North was fully suspended this month.</p>

<p>South Korea and the United States also staged joint air drills Wednesday involving around 30 aircraft, including Washington's advanced stealth fighter jet, F-22 Raptor.</p>

<p>President Yoon Suk Yeol visited a US aircraft carrier on Tuesday that arrived in South Korea for joint trilateral military drills this week aimed at countering North Korean threats.</p>

<p>The drills, which run from Thursday to Saturday, involve Washington's nuclear-powered aircraft carrier the USS Theodore Roosevelt, Tokyo's guided-missile destroyer JS Atago, and Seoul's fighter jet KF-16s, among other assets.</p>

<p>Pyongyang has routinely criticised such exercises as rehearsals for an invasion</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US media giant NBCUniversal on Wednesday announced that it will use the AI version of a legendary sports broadcaster to narrate personalized daily recaps of Olympic game events.</p>

<p>Narration by Hall of Fame announcer Al Michaels generated using artificial intelligence will voice the recaps that will be personalized to individual viewers of NBC's Peacock streaming service.</p>

<p>Well-known broadcaster Michaels has worked a combined nine Olympic Games for NBC Sports and ABC Sports during his career, according to NBCUniversal.</p>

<p>"When I was approached about this, I was skeptical but obviously curious," Michaels said in a release.</p>

<p>"Then I saw a demonstration detailing what they had in mind. I said, 'I'm in.'"</p>

<p>The AI was trained on the voice of Michaels along with his past appearances on NBC broadcasts, according to the company.</p>

<p>"We're bringing the best of sports together with the best of technology &nbsp;to deliver fans a personalized Olympics experience in a way that's never been possible before," Peacock president Kelly Campbell said in the release.</p>

<p>The collaboration with Michaels comes as musicians, actors, and others whose livelihoods depend on their likenesses or voices strive to make sure AI models are not trained on such material without their permission.</p>

<p>NBCUniversal estimated that nearly 7 million different personalized versions of the daily Olympic recap could be streamed across the United States during the Olympic Games in Paris.</p>

<p>The technology will mine NBC Sports clips to create daily playlists showcasing top moments from the prior 24 hours and tease what is in store for the day ahead.</p>

<p>A team of NBCUniversal editors will review all the content for accuracy and quality assurance, the company said.</p>

<p>NBC and Peacock will present live coverage of the Olympic Games, starting with the opening ceremony on July 26.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An American man was executed Wednesday in Texas for the 2001 murder of a woman.</p>

<p>In 2006, Ramiro Gonzales was convicted and sentenced to death for the rape and murder of Bridget Townsend when they both were 18 years old.</p>

<p>Gonzales, now 41, was pronounced dead at 6:50 p.m. local time (23:50 GMT). He was executed via lethal injection.</p>

<p>"To the Townsend family, I'm sorry I can't articulate, I can't put into words the pain I have caused y'all, the hurt, what I took away that I cannot give back," Gonzales said in his final statement.</p>

<p>In January 2001, Gonzales kidnapped, raped, and shot Townsend, who was the girlfriend of his drug dealer.</p>

<p>The case went unsolved for 18 months until Gonzales confessed to the crime while in custody in a separate rape case. He also told authorities where to find Townsend's remains.</p>

<p>Gonzales' attorney had appealed for a stay on his execution to the US Supreme Court, but it was rejected on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Gonzales' execution is the second in Texas so far this year and the eighth in the United States, not counting a canceled execution in Idaho this past February due to a failure to administer the lethal dose by the legal deadline.</p>

<p>The United States carried out 24 executions in 2023, all by lethal injection.</p>

<p>The death penalty has been abolished in 23 of the 50 US states. Six other states -- Arizona, California, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee -- observe a moratorium on executions.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United Kingdom will vote on July 4 in a snap general election called by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. With his Conservative Party trailing the Labour Party by 21 points in the latest polls, Mr Sunak faces an uphill task to retain his party's 14-year grip on power and own position as Prime Minister.<br />
<br />
<strong>Here are a few facts about the current British Prime Minister:</strong><br />
<br />
1. Rishi Sunak was born on May 12, 1980, in Southampton, England. His grandparents were all born in India but migrated to East Africa for work and eventually settled in the UK. Mr Sunak went to Winchester College, a private boarding school in England and later graduated from Oxford University. He pursued an MBA at Stanford University, where he met his wife, Akshata Murty, daughter of Infosys co-founder N R Narayana Murthy. They got married in 2009 and have two daughters together.<br />
<br />
2. Before he forayed into politics, Mr Sunak had a successful career in finance. He worked as an analyst at Goldman Sachs from 2001 to 2004 before becoming a partner at The Children's Investment Fund Management in 2006. In 2010, he moved to Theleme Partners, another hedge fund management firm. He also served as the director of Catamaran Ventures, an investment firm owned by his father-in-law.<br />
<br />
3. Mr Sunak's political career took off in 2014 when he was chosen as the Conservative candidate for Richmond (Yorks). In 2015, he was elected a Member of Parliament for Richmond (Yorks), receiving 36.2% votes. His political ascension continued as he held various government positions, including Minister for Local Government in 2018, Chief Secretary to the Treasury in 2019 and Chancellor of the Exchequer from 2020 to 2022.<br />
<br />
4. In October 2022, Mr Sunak made history when King Charles III appointed him as Britain's first Hindu and Indian-origin Prime Minister. Elected unopposed as the leader of the Conservative Party on Diwali, he became the youngest British Prime Minister in 210 years at 42.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
5. As UK PM, Mr Sunak has courted controversies. In May 2024, he proposed restricting the UK's post-study visa, which drew opposition from cabinet members. In 2022, Mr Sunak faced a tax scandal surrounding his wife's non-domicile status. The same year, he was involved in another controversy over holding a US green card while serving as a British government minister. Mr Sunak also faced criticism for his role in the Partygate scandal, receiving a fixed-penalty notice for attending a birthday party for Boris Johnson during the lockdown in 2020.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A new deadlier strain of mpox that transmits more easily between people is killing children and causing miscarriages in the Democratic Republic of Congo and may have already spread to neighbouring countries, researchers have warned.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new deadlier strain of mpox that transmits more easily between people is killing children and causing miscarriages in the Democratic Republic of Congo and may have already spread to neighbouring countries, researchers have warned.</p>

<p>All countries should be prepared for "this new strain before it spreads to other places, before it is too late," Jean Claude Udahemuka, a researcher at the University of Rwanda studying the outbreak, told AFP.</p>

<p>A global outbreak of a new strain of Mpox, previously known as monkeypox, in 2022 spread to more than 110 countries, mostly affecting gay and bisexual men. That was the clade II strain.</p>

<p>But there have been regular outbreaks of the clade I strain -- which is 10 times deadlier -- in Africa since it was first detected in DR Congo in 1970.</p>

<p>While the global outbreak was largely sexually transmitted, people in Africa normally caught clade I from infected animals, such as when eating bushmeat.</p>

<p>But "it was obvious something was different" about an mpox outbreak detected among sex workers in the remote mining Congolese town of Kamituga in September last year, Udahemuka told an online press conference.</p>

<p>Unlike previous outbreaks in the central African country, the virus was being transmitted via sex between heterosexuals.</p>

<p>Testing revealed it was a mutated variant of the original strain called clade Ib.</p>

<p>It is "undoubtedly the most dangerous strain so far," Udahemuka said.</p>

<p>More than 1,000 cases of clade Ib have been reported in South Kivu province since, said Leandre Murhula Masirika, who has led local research into the outbreak.</p>

<p>There are more than 20 new cases every week in Kamituga alone -- and the number is rising, he warned.</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;'Incredibly worrying'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Five per cent of adults and 10 per cent of children who get the strain die, researchers said.</p>

<p>It gives sufferers "horrendous whole body rashes," unlike clade II, which caused lesions normally more limited to the genital area, said Trudie Lang, a global health researcher at Oxford University.</p>

<p>The clade Ib strain has also been spreading through non-sexual contact between people -- including among families or children playing together at school -- marking a major change from previous outbreaks, the researchers said.</p>

<p>There has been a "high amount" of transmission between mothers or carers and children, Lang said.</p>

<p>The strain has also caused numerous miscarriages, and researchers are studying its long-term effect on fertility.</p>

<p>These significant differences from previous mpox strains are "incredibly worrying," Lang said.</p>

<p>And the extreme cases turning up at hospital are likely "the tip of the iceberg," because many patients likely have less severe symptoms, she added.</p>

<p>There remain many "important unknowns" about the new strain, Lang cautioned, comparing this stage of investigation to the early days of Covid-19.</p>

<p>Out of 384 people who died from all mpox strains in DR Congo this year, more than 60 percent were children, according to the World Health Organization.</p>

<h3><strong>Fears of wider outbreak&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>So far, clade Ib has spread to the Congolese cities of Bukavu, Uvira and Kamanyola -- and this week was declared in North Kivu province's capital, Goma, the researchers said.</p>

<p>These cities are near DR Congo's borders with Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda.</p>

<p>While the new strain has not been officially reported outside of DR Congo, it may have already spread to neighbouring nations, Murhula Masirika said. Some infected sex workers came from these countries, he added.</p>

<p>And Goma, notably, has an international airport.</p>

<p>"There is definitely the opportunity for this to get on an airplane," Lang said, calling on the world to act quickly to contain the outbreak.</p>

<p>One way researchers want to stem the outbreak is to vaccinate local sex workers.</p>

<p>It remains to be determined whether existing vaccines will work for the new strain.</p>

<p>But smallpox vaccines -- which are cheap, widely available in many countries, and can work for mpox -- have not been made available in Kamituga, Udahemuka said.</p>

<p>Researchers in Africa have been calling for DR Congo to get access to the vaccines and treatments used against mpox in much of the world during the global outbreak.</p>

<p>Because if this strain spreads further it will cause "really great damage," Murhula Masirika warned.</p>

<p>"We are very afraid."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The promise of a ride to the airport is not legally binding, a woman in New Zealand has discovered after seeking compensation from her ex-boyfriend because she missed her flight.</p>

<p>The woman was so annoyed about failing to catch her plane when her partner reneged on an airport ride that she ended the relationship and took him to a dispute tribunal for small claims.</p>

<p>Her ex-partner's pledge to give her a lift and look after her pets while she was away was a verbal contract, the unnamed woman claimed, according to tribunal documents released last week.</p>

<p>The woman requested compensation because she had to kennel her dogs, which she claimed her ex had also verbally agreed to look after when she ended up taking a replacement flight to watch a concert with friends.</p>

<p>As well as seeking money for a new plane ticket, kennel costs and alternative transport to the airport, the woman also wanted the cash back for a ferry ticket she bought her ex-partner for a holiday last December.</p>

<p>The tribunal dismissed her claim when it was heard in March.</p>

<p>A law academic told AFP the woman would have had to show a legally binding contract for her claim to succeed.</p>

<p>"If the arrangement had been entered into by text message, I don't think it would have made a difference here," said Associate Professor Simon Connell from Otago University's law faculty.</p>

<p>"What's missing is a clear signal that the parties wanted to create a legally bringing contract."</p>

<p>Connell said it is unusual for someone to try and legally enforce what many people would see as a social agreement, "so when it does happen, it can attract some attention."</p>

<p>He cited the reported 2015 example of a five-year-old boy in Britain, who was sent an invoice and his parents threatened with legal action because he failed to attend a child's birthday party.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian-origin astronaut Sunita Williams' scheduled return to Earth has been delayed once again after the spacecraft in which she travelled to space, the Boeing Starliner, faced a series of technical glitches.</p>

<p>The astronaut, who left Earth on June 5 was set to return on June 14, after a week in space. However, her return was delayed to June 26. Now, no new date for her return has been disclosed by NASA.</p>

<p>NDTV had reported that the space agency had extended Ms Williams' stay on the space station after five helium leaks were detected on the Starliner spaceship and five of its 28 thrusters faced issues. At least 14 thrusters are needed for a safe return.</p>

<p>For now, Ms Williams and her crewmate Butch Wilmore are both safe on the International Space Station along with the seven other crew members. The ISS is a "mini city in space" about the size of a football field that astronauts from multiple space agencies use for research.</p>

<p>In a press briefing, NASA said it is taking "our time and following our standard mission management team process", adding that the spacecraft is clear for return in case of an emergency on the space station that requires the crew to come back to Earth.</p>

<p>The space agency said mission managers are evaluating future return opportunities following a planned spacewalk on July 2.</p>

<p>“Starliner is performing well in orbit while docked to the space station. We are strategically using the extra time to clear a path for some critical station activities while completing readiness for Butch and Suni's return on Starliner and gaining valuable insight into the system upgrades we will want to make for post-certification missions," it said</p>

<p>Before the veteran astronaut returned to space, her flight was marred with several delays as the launch of the Boeing Starliner spacecraft was repeatedly postponed by NASA. On June 7, the Indian-origin astronaut broke into a dance as she entered the space station.</p>

<p>While Ms Williams has described the Boeing Starliner as a "fantastic spacecraft", several whistleblowers have accused Boeing and NASA of neglect.</p>

<p>They have alleged that both Boeing and NASA managers knew of the technical faults with the spaceship but went ahead with the launch to avoid further delay. So far 20 whistleblowers, have accused NASA of ignoring their concerns.</p>

<p>On the other hand, aircraft maker Boeing has faced several allegations of technical failures as several of its aircrafts have suffered serious snags during flights across the globe.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is "rediscovering" life as he tastes freedom in Australia after a five-year stretch in a London high-security prison, his wife said Thursday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is "rediscovering" life as he tastes freedom in Australia after a five-year stretch in a London high-security prison, his wife said Thursday.</p>

<p>The 52-year-old landed in Canberra the night before, hours after pleading guilty in a US Pacific island court to a single count of revealing military secrets.</p>

<p>Under a plea deal, he was sentenced to time already served and allowed to walk free, ending a 14-year legal struggle with the US Department of Justice.</p>

<p>But the jail time has taken a toll.</p>

<p>Assange did not attend a news conference after he touched down, with his wife near tears as she pleaded for family privacy and time for him to recuperate.</p>

<p>"He's just savouring freedom for the first time in 14 years. He needs time to rest and recover. And he is just rediscovering normal life. And he needs space to do that," Stella Assange told reporters Thursday.</p>

<p>"Julian plans to swim in the ocean every day. He plans to sleep in a real bed. He plans to taste real food. And he plans to enjoy his freedom."</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;'Jumping on the sofa'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The WikiLeaks publisher had yet to see his two children, who were staying elsewhere and asleep when his plane landed, she said.</p>

<p>Stella Assange said she sent her husband a video on the day of his US court hearing showing their children "jumping on the sofa" at the prospect of their father's return.</p>

<p>Assange spent more than five years in London's Belmarsh prison fighting extradition to the United States on charges under the 1917 Espionage Act.</p>

<p>He had already lived for seven years in Ecuador's London embassy to escape extradition to Sweden over sexual assault charges, which were eventually dropped.</p>

<p>The couple have not had time to discuss how their lives will play out since his release, said Stella, who met Assange while he was still in the Ecuadorian embassy and married him in the London prison.</p>

<p>Assange's legal team argues that the US Justice Department's legal pursuit of their client will have a chilling effect on journalism.</p>

<p>They have called for US President Joe Biden to grant him a pardon following his plea deal in Saipan, capital of the US territory of Northern Mariana Islands.</p>

<p>"The president of the United States has absolute pardon power. President Biden or any subsequent president can, and in my mind should, issue a pardon to Julian Assange," said his US trial lawyer Barry Pollack.</p>

<h3><strong>People put in 'danger'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Stella Assange said her husband had pleaded "guilty to committing journalism -- this case criminalises journalism".</p>

<p>Assange had published hundreds of thousands of confidential US documents on the WikiLeaks whistleblowing website from 2010.</p>

<p>He became a hero to free speech campaigners but a villain to those who thought he had endangered US security and intelligence sources.</p>

<p>The Australian citizen was indicted by a US federal grand jury in 2019 on 18 counts stemming from WikiLeaks' publication of a trove of national security documents.</p>

<p>The material he released through WikiLeaks included video showing civilians being killed by fire from a US helicopter gunship in Iraq in 2007. The victims included a photographer and a driver from Reuters.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the US State Department renewed its allegation that he put people at risk.</p>

<p>"The documents they published gave identifying information of individuals who were in contact with the State Department," State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters in Washington.</p>

<p>"That included opposition leaders, human rights activists around the world -- whose positions were put in some danger."</p>

<p>The US Justice Department has banned Assange from returning to the United States without permission.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bolivian President Luis Arce, a mild-mannered and bespectacled former economy minister, faced down a coup attempt on Wednesday, as the armed forces withdrew after occupying the central square in La Paz and entering the presidential palace.</p>

<p>Arce, 60, won election in 2020 after a period of deep political turmoil. A ballot the year before was marred by allegations of fraud, which sparked widespread protests and the eventual resignation of then-President Evo Morales.</p>

<p>Former allies and colleagues, Arce and Morales have since become political rivals. Both are eyeing a presidential run in an election next year, and each leads a faction of the dominant Movement to Socialism (MAS) political party.</p>

<p>A court ruling against Morales' running again fueled protests this year that blocked the country's main highway and hurt the economy. Shortages of dollars and fuel have also caused damage as the landlocked country's gas output and exports fell.</p>

<p>Arce, a former economist known for keeping a low personal profile, was at one time Morales' protégé and crafted the economic plan for Morales' successful 2005 presidential run.</p>

<p>Morales then appointed Arce as economy minister in 2006, and he steered the Andean country's economy for well over a decade. Supporters said he was the architect of Bolivia's growth "miracle" in the 2000s that lifted many in one of South America's poorest nations out of poverty. Commodities including gas, metals, and soybeans boomed.</p>

<p>He also angered investors by pushing for the nationalization of sectors including oil and gas.</p>

<p>Towards the end of Morales' nearly 14-year rule, growth slowed and opposition grew to his seeking an unprecedented fourth term.</p>

<p>The voided 2019 election marked a political crisis. It was followed by Morales' resignation, bloody violence, and the year-long interim presidency of Jeanine Anez, a right-wing congresswoman who assumed power after Morales left the country.</p>

<p>Arce's election in 2020 appeared to bring political stability. Morales returned from nearly a year in exile when Arce won the presidency.</p>

<p>As president, Arce has struggled to manage a U.S. dollar shortage that has strained the economy and led credit-ratings agencies to downgrade Bolivia's debt to "junk" status.</p>

<p>The general behind Wednesday's coup effort, Juan Jose Zuniga, said the government was "impoverishing" the country.</p>

<p>Arce's government has signed agreements with Russian and Chinese firms to develop Bolivia's huge untapped reserves of lithium, a metal used in batteries for electric vehicles, cell phones, and laptops. However, lawmakers in the divided legislature have yet to approve any contracts.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe Biden and Donald Trump square off for a historic US presidential debate Thursday, with the stage set for what could be an inflection point in the 2024 race as millions of voters tune in to the clash of rivals.</p>

<p>The showdown -- between the oldest-ever incumbent and a convicted felon -- fires the starting gun on what promises to be a bruising summer of campaigning in a deeply polarized and tense United States still convulsed over the chaos and violence that accompanied the 2020 election.</p>

<p>With only two debates this election cycle, Thursday's high-stakes event takes on heightened significance, and both candidates have stepped up their personal attacks, with national polls showing the pair neck and neck.</p>

<p>As the candidates applied the finishing touches to their debate strategy, one critical question remained: Will Trump the political pugilist rein in his aggressive tendencies or unleash his unruliness, much as he did in their first chaotic debate four years ago?</p>

<p>"I think I have been preparing for it for my whole life... We'll do very well," Trump told right-wing network Newsmax in an interview on his debate preparation.</p>

<p>The president will be desperate to avoid any major gaffes. He meanwhile was pulling no punches Wednesday -- at least on social media, where he said "Donald Trump is the greatest threat to our democracy," a message he will almost certainly seek to hammer home on debate night.</p>

<p>The president arrives Thursday on Air Force One in Atlanta, capital of southeastern battleground Georgia, for the duel at CNN headquarters, while his challenger flies in on his private jet, nicknamed "Trump Force One."</p>

<p>Trump enjoys a slight advantage in the all-important swing states but the overall polling looks extremely close in an election likely to be decided by a few photo finishes in a handful of battlegrounds.</p>

<p>The latest Quinnipiac University poll conducted Sunday shows Trump edging ahead of Biden nationally, 49 per cent to 45 per cent.</p>

<p>The rivals both step onstage for the 90-minute debate seeking to allay fears about serious political liabilities.</p>

<p>Biden, 81, faces the most concern about his mental sharpness, with voters much more likely to bring up his age than Trump's, despite the Republican being just three years younger.</p>

<p>Ahead of the first-ever debate between two candidates who have already served in the Oval Office, both Trump and Biden have had missteps that have raised questions over their age, occasionally stumbling over words or appearing muddled.</p>

<p>Trump is also engulfed in controversy over his inflammatory rhetoric, his recent conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records, not to mention other criminal cases he faces, and fears he would weaponize the presidency to settle personal scores.</p>

<h3><strong>Fine-tuning or freewheeling&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Biden has spent the week off the radar at the Camp David retreat near Washington, fine-tuning his attack lines in mock debates under real TV lighting.</p>

<p>Trump's preparation has been more relaxed, eschewing dress rehearsals in favor of informal policy roundtables and workshopping debate strategy with rally crowds.</p>

<p>Aides have encouraged him to focus on his perceived strength on the economy and crime, while Biden will seek to paint Trump as unhinged and unfit for office.</p>

<p>The Trump campaign has repeatedly characterized Biden as feeble and incompetent but changed tack in recent days following warnings that setting low expectations for the Democratic president would only help him.</p>

<p>"We know that Joe Biden, that after taking an entire week off, will be ready for this," senior Trump campaign advisor Jason Miller told reporters.</p>

<p>Trump and his team have also been pushing the baseless theory that Biden will be hyped up on performance-enhancing drugs and have made repeated insinuations of bias from CNN.</p>

<p>One of Biden's biggest vulnerabilities is border security, with Trump promising to combat an influx of undocumented migrants from Mexico with mass deportations and repeatedly bringing up killings by migrants.</p>

<p>The Biden administration said Wednesday there has been a 40 per cent drop in illegal crossings since the president's new executive action last month cracking down on the border.</p>

<p>More Americans expect a Trump debate win than a Biden victory -- 40 per cent to 30 per cent -- but just one in 10 thought it even somewhat likely the debate would change their vote.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There has been one figure of stability in the last 14 years of political turmoil in the UK -- Larry the Downing Street cat.</p>

<p>Now, with a general election fast approaching on July 4, the ageing tabby could be in line for his sixth prime minister.</p>

<p>He has already had five Conservative prime ministers serve under him but if polls are correct, he will soon get his first from the Labour party.</p>

<p>Incumbent Rishi Sunak's departure would see him take his fox-red labrador retriever Nova too. Not that Larry would mind.</p>

<p>According to Sunak's wife, Akshata Murty, the pair have had some "heated exchanges". But Larry has always prevailed.</p>

<p>Labour leader Keir Starmer recently told the BBC that his family has a cat, Jojo, that his children spoil more than him.</p>

<p>They also have a hamster, Bear, he told the Metro newspaper. But it's uncertain if either would move with him if he wins.</p>

<p>Larry has been fiercely protective of his territory, frequently fighting to be the top cat with his counterpart at the foreign ministry, Palmerston.</p>

<p>His rival eventually retired to the countryside.</p>

<p>Urban foxes and unsuspecting pigeons have also been chased away, although one feathered interloper narrowly avoided his clutches, as the media looked on.</p>

<h3><strong>Longevity&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Larry made his first appearance in Downing Street on February 15, 2011, after being adopted from the Battersea shelter in south London.</p>

<p>He was recruited under then prime minister David Cameron to get rid of mice and even given an official title: "Chief Mouser".</p>

<p>But his performance in that department left much to be desired, despite a few early successes.</p>

<p>Cameron himself tried to quash rumours that he and Larry did not get along, while reporters on the politics beat have said he is friendly with journalists.</p>

<p>"He's interested," the appropriately named BBC political correspondent Helen Catt said in a recent item on Larry.</p>

<p>"He tends to come up and have a look when you're there with the camera crew, he likes to see what the press are up to."</p>

<p>But that has its downsides, she added.</p>

<p>"When you're in Downing Street and you're doing lives, you're always very aware that if he pops out behind you, a lot of people really aren't going to be listening to what you're saying anymore," she said.</p>

<p>For the general election, Larry has set out his campaign manifesto on his official @Number10cat social media account.</p>

<p>"I don't get to vote in the general election but I do have to live with whoever you elect. No pressure," one post read after Sunak announced the election on May 22.</p>

<p>"Whatever the result of the election, I'll be here to keep an eye on things," read another.</p>

<p>Interviewed by AFP on the 10th anniversary of his arrival in power, Larry, via the human running his social media account, revealed the secret to his longevity.</p>

<p>"The key thing to remember is that I live here permanently, the politicians just lodge with me for a bit until they're fired," he said.</p>

<p>"They all work out sooner or later that it's me that runs the place.".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Everest's sacred slopes, climate change is thinning snow and ice, increasingly exposing the bodies of hundreds of mountaineers who died chasing their dream to summit the world's highest mountain.</p>

<p>Among those scaling the soaring Himalayan mountain this year was a team not aiming for the 8,849-metre (29,032-foot) peak, but risking their own lives to bring some of the corpses down.</p>

<p>Five as yet unnamed frozen bodies were retrieved -- including one that was just skeletal remains -- as part of Nepal's mountain clean-up campaign on Everest and adjoining peaks Lhotse and Nuptse.</p>

<p>It is a grim, tough and dangerous task.</p>

<p>Rescuers took hours to chip away the ice with axes, with the team sometimes using boiling water to release its frozen grip.</p>

<p>"Because of the effects of global warming, (the bodies and trash) are becoming more visible as the snow cover thins," said Aditya Karki, a major in Nepal's army, who led the team of 12 military personnel and 18 climbers.</p>

<p>More than 300 people have perished on the mountain since expeditions started in the 1920s, eight this season alone.</p>

<p>Many bodies remain. Some are hidden by snow or swallowed down deep crevasses.</p>

<p>Others, still in their colourful climbing gear, have become landmarks en route to the summit.</p>

<p>Nicknames include "Green Boots" and "Sleeping Beauty".</p>

<h3><strong>'Death zone'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>"There is a psychological effect," Karki told AFP.</p>

<p>"People believe that they are entering a divine space when they climb mountains, but if they see dead bodies on the way up, it can have a negative effect."</p>

<p>Many are inside the "death zone", where thin air and low oxygen levels raise the risk of altitude sickness.</p>

<p>Climbers must have insurance, but any rescue or recovery mission is fraught with danger.</p>

<p>One body, encased in ice up to its torso, took the climbers 11 hours to free.</p>

<p>The team had to use hot water to loosen it, prising it out with their axes.</p>

<p>"It is extremely difficult," said Tshiring Jangbu Sherpa, who led the body retrieval expedition.</p>

<p>"Getting the body out is one part, bringing it down is another challenge".</p>

<p>Sherpa said some of the bodies still appeared almost as they had at the moment of death -- dressed in full gear, along with their crampons and harnesses.</p>

<p>One seemed untouched, only missing a glove.</p>

<p>The retrieval of corpses at high altitudes is a controversial topic for the climbing community.</p>

<p>It costs thousands of dollars, and up to eight rescuers are needed for each body.</p>

<p>A body can weigh over 100 kilogrammes (220 pounds), and at high altitudes, a person's ability to carry heavy loads is severely affected.</p>

<h3><strong>'Turn into a graveyard'</strong></h3>

<p>But Karki said the rescue effort was necessary.</p>

<p>"We have to bring them back as much as possible," he said. "If we keep leaving them behind, our mountains will turn into a graveyard."</p>

<p>Bodies are often wrapped in a bag then put on a plastic sled to drag down.</p>

<p>Sherpa said that bringing one body down from close to Lhotse's 8,516 metre peak -- the world's fourth-highest mountain -- had been among the hardest challenges so far.</p>

<p>"The body was frozen with hands and legs spread," he said.</p>

<p>"We had to carry it down to Camp Three as it was, and only then could it be moved to be put in a sled to be dragged."</p>

<p>Rakesh Gurung, from Nepal's tourism department, said two bodies had been preliminarily identified and authorities were awaiting "detailed tests" for the final confirmation.</p>

<p>The retrieved bodies are now in the capital Kathmandu, with those not identified likely to be eventually cremated.</p>

<h3><strong>Missing mountaineers&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Despite the recovery efforts, the mountain still holds its secrets.</p>

<p>The body of George Mallory, the British climber who went missing during a 1924 attempt on the summit, was only found in 1999.</p>

<p>His climbing partner, Andrew Irvine, has never been found -- nor has their camera, which could provide evidence of a successful summit that would rewrite mountaineering history.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Juan Orlando Hernandez was convicted in a US federal court on three counts, including cocaine importation and weapons offences. ]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former Honduran president <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-jails-honduran-ex-president-for-45-years-on-drug-trafficking-charges-5978213" target="_blank">Juan Orlando Hernandez</a>&nbsp;was on Wednesday sentenced to 45 years in a United States prison and fined $8 million for his role in drug trafficking.&nbsp;US prosecutors accused him of running a "narco-state" that smuggled over 400 tons of South American cocaine to the US while he was president from 2014 to 2022.</p>

<p>US District Judge Kevin Castel said Hernandez provided police and military support and helped to send drugs worth $10 billion to the United States.</p>

<p>Hernandez, 55, was found guilty of federal drug and weapons charges in March. He was convicted in a US federal court on three counts, including cocaine importation and weapons offences.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Prosecutors said he built his political career on bribes from traffickers and protected them from extradition and prosecution.<br />
<br />
<strong>Early involvement</strong><br />
<br />
Juan Orlando Hernandez's involvement in the drug trade dates back to at least 2004, when he was a congressman in Honduras.</p>

<p>He allegedly accepted bribes from drug traffickers in Honduras, Mexico and beyond, in exchange for political favours and protection, stated a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/juan-orlando-hernandez-former-president-honduras-convicted-manhattan-federal-court ">press release</a>&nbsp;by the US Department of Justice.<br />
<br />
<strong>Rise to power</strong><br />
<br />
As Hernandez's political career advanced, so did his involvement in the drug trade. He became the President of Honduras in 2014 and used his position to expand his drug empire. He allegedly worked with some of the world's largest drug traffickers, including the Sinaloa Cartel, to transport tons of cocaine through Honduras and into the US.<br />
<br />
<strong>Abuse of power</strong><br />
<br />
Juan Orlando Hernandez presented himself as an advocate against drug trafficking in public, but in reality, he colluded with and protected the interests of drug traffickers who supported him.<br />
<br />
He selectively upheld extraditions, allowing certain drug traffickers to remain in Honduras while others were extradited to the US. Hernandez also used Honduran institutions, including the police and military, to protect his drug trafficking operation, as per the press release.<br />
<br />
<strong>Violence and murder</strong><br />
<br />
According to reports, Hernandez's drug empire was responsible for more than 130 murders, including the killings of rival traffickers and those who threatened his operation. His brother, Juan Antonio "Tony" Hernandez, was also involved in the drug trade and was convicted in the US for cocaine trafficking. Countless others disappeared or were tortured; their fates unknown.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Sentence</strong><br />
<br />
Hernandez was convicted on three counts of importing cocaine into the US (10 years to life in prison), using machine guns and destructive devices in the drug trade (additional 30 years in prison) and conspiring to use and carry machine guns and destructive devices in the drug trade (up to life in prison).&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There will be no studio audience, depriving candidates of the momentum that comes from ginning up supporters. Microphones will cut out when a candidate's speaking time is over. Thursday night's presidential debate will not be business as usual.</p>

<p>CNN, which is hosting President Joe Biden and his predecessor Donald Trump for their first debate of the 2024 campaign in Atlanta, wants to avoid the chaos seen when the two men squared off in 2020.</p>

<p>Here are some facts about the 90-minute debate, a key moment in the race for the White House, but one whose impact is difficult to predict.</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;Averting mayhem&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>In their first war of words four years ago, Trump repeatedly cut off the veteran Democrat, launched into lengthy diatribes and taunted his rival, who ended up shouting at one point: "Will you shut up, man?"</p>

<p>It was hardly the height of presidential decorum.</p>

<p>To cut down on the hijinks, CNN has set up a series of rules, to which both campaigns agreed.</p>

<p>Among the most notable: When the candidates take the stage at the network's Atlanta studios at 9:00 pm (0100 GMT Friday), there will be no one in the audience.</p>

<p>Microphones will be muted except for the candidate asked to speak. There will be two commercial breaks during the showdown between 78-year-old Trump and 81-year-old Biden, the two oldest presumptive White House nominees in history.</p>

<p>Moderators Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, both regular CNN on-air presenters, will "use all tools at their disposal to enforce timing and ensure a civilized discussion," the network said.</p>

<h3><strong>Trump gets last word&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Biden won the coin toss, allowing him to choose either his podium position or whether he preferred to speak first or second in final statements.</p>

<p>The incumbent chose the podium on the viewers' right, and Trump opted to have the last word.</p>

<h3><strong>No live fact-checking&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>CNN has not revealed the debate themes and does not plan to fact-check candidate statements in real time -- even if Trump repeats the baseless charge that the 2020 election was stolen from him.</p>

<p>For Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania, "one problem with a debate that features Donald Trump is that the moderators don't fact check in real-time, nor should they."</p>

<p>"It's highly risky to try to do that and it would be disruptive of the debate if they did," she told AFP. "The danger is instead of informing, a debate could actually increase the amount of inaccurate knowledge."</p>

<p>Biden and Trump will not have teleprompters and they cannot bring pre-written notes to the stage, although they will be provided with paper and pen. Consulting with campaign staff during commercial breaks will not be allowed.</p>

<h3><strong>Debate airs on all networks&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Both candidates rejected the oversight of the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates formed in 1987 to manage such events.</p>

<p>Instead, they made a direct deal with CNN. The news network, now owned by media conglomerate Warner Bros Discovery, afforded its rivals the opportunity to broadcast the debate live in the name of public service, under certain conditions.</p>

<p>The screen must bear the CNN logo and outside commentary is forbidden.</p>

<p>Fox News -- which regularly attacks CNN as biased against Trump -- plans to hit the airwaves two hours before the event, with talk show hosts Jesse Watters and Sean Hannity providing pre-game insights.</p>

<p>In the past, Hannity has called Tapper a "radical left-wing partisan talk show host masquerading as a journalist."</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;Impact on campaign?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The debate will certainly be a key moment in the campaign, watched by tens of millions: a record 84 million tuned in to watch Trump's first battle with Hillary Clinton in 2016, and 73 million saw Trump and Biden duke it out in 2020.</p>

<p>But it will not necessarily be a game-changer.</p>

<p>This is the first time a debate has been organized so early in the race, more than four months before Election Day, and even before the candidates have been formally nominated by their respective parties.</p>

<p>"The worry is that the public in the United States doesn't pay much attention to news in summer," said Jamieson.</p>

<p>"In general, presidential debates don't affect a sufficient number of votes to decide the outcome of an election. But when an election is close, as this one may be, debates can play an important role."</p>

<p>ABC is scheduled to host a second debate on September 10.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Gerald Ford's catastrophic Soviet gaffe to Ronald Reagan's witty remark about his age and Joe Biden asking Donald Trump to "shut up," US presidential debates have been funny, vicious and everything in between.</p>

<p>Here are some of the most memorable moments from more than 60 years of modern American debates.</p>

<h3><strong>Kennedy-Nixon, September 26, 1960&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>It was the first televised debate of its kind, when everything was still broadcast in black-and-white, and it established the importance of a politician's public image. Republican Richard Nixon looked poised to win the election, having served two terms as vice president under Dwight Eisenhower.</p>

<p>But the debate did not go well for him. Nixon refused to wear makeup and appeared pale and sweaty in front of more than 66 million viewers, while the young Massachusetts senator John F. Kennedy looked tanned and relaxed. While Nixon addressed the moderator, Kennedy looked at the camera, speaking directly to his voters.</p>

<p>How much the debate visuals pushed the needle is disputed, but Kennedy went on to defeat Nixon at the polls.</p>

<h3><strong>Ford-Carter, October 6, 1976&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The first debate between Republican president Gerald Ford and Democratic challenger Jimmy Carter was marked by a 27-minute loss of audio. The second debate didn't go well for Ford either, when he made a gaffe that arguably cost him the presidency.</p>

<p>At the height of the Cold War, Ford uttered that "there is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, and there never will be under a Ford administration," even though the Soviet Union had troops deployed across the Eastern bloc.</p>

<p>Six days passed before Ford explained himself, saying that he spoke not of the literal military presence but meant that people's spirits there hadn't been crushed.</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;Reagan-Mondale, October 21, 1984&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Republican president Ronald Reagan was 73 when he ran for a second term against 56-year-old Walter Mondale. But he managed to turn his age into his strength with a witty answer that went down in history.</p>

<p>"I will not make age an issue of this campaign," Reagan said when asked whether he was fit for office. "I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience."</p>

<h3><strong>Bush-Clinton-Perot, October 15, 1992&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The second presidential debate in the 1992 race pitted incumbent president George Bush against both his future successor Bill Clinton and Ross Perot, an independent candidate.</p>

<p>Bush was caught on camera looking at his watch while Clinton talked to an audience member during a town hall debate, a move that cost Bush dearly.</p>

<p>Years later, Bush admitted he hated the debates. "Maybe that's why I was looking at it, 'only 10 more minutes of this crap.'"</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;Obama-Romney, October 22, 2012&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>During a debate against president Barack Obama, Republican challenger Mitt Romney lamented that the US Navy had fewer ships presently than it did in 1916.</p>

<p>"Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed," Obama retorted.</p>

<p>"We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them. We have these ships that go under water, nuclear submarines."</p>

<p>Obama's comments went viral online.</p>

<h3><strong>Trump-Clinton, October 9, 2016&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The second debate of the 2016 US presidential election pitting Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump was particularly vicious.</p>

<p>Coming shortly after the release of a video in which Trump was heard boasting that his fame allowed him to grope women, the Republican billionaire went after his opponent's husband, former president Bill Clinton, accusing him of being "so abusive to women."</p>

<p>Trump also vowed to have Hillary Clinton investigated over her use of a private email account when she was secretary of state.</p>

<p>"It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country," Clinton said.</p>

<p>Trump shot back: "Because you'd be in jail."</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;Trump-Biden, September 29, 2020&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The first debate of the 2020 presidential election, featuring Trump and Democrat Joe Biden, devolved into shouting and insults.</p>

<p>With Trump constantly interrupting him, Biden snapped, saying, "Will you shut up, man?"</p>

<p>The Democrat also called his opponent a "clown" and "Putin's puppy."</p>

<p>Trump for his part kept evading the question of whether he would recognize the results of the election.</p>

<p>Powerless to control the two candidates, the debate moderator, Fox News journalist Chris Wallace, later described feeling "desperation."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Another whistleblower stepped forward Wednesday alleging he was retaliated against after flagging potentially dangerous manufacturing problems on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another whistleblower stepped forward Wednesday alleging he was retaliated against after flagging potentially dangerous manufacturing problems on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner.</p>

<p>Richard Cuevas filed complaints with two US agencies alleging he was dismissed suddenly in March 2024 after raising concerns over manufacturing deviations in the forward pressure bulkhead, which is critical to managing pressure during flights, according to attorneys Katz Banks Kumin.</p>

<p>Cuevas is the latest whistleblower to come forward from Boeing's operations, adding to scrutiny of the plane maker following a January inflight incident on a 737 MAX operated by Alaska Airlines that required an emergency landing.</p>

<p>Cuevas worked as a contractor for Strom, who assigned him to Spirit AeroSystems, which builds fuselages for the Dreamliner.</p>

<p>In October 2023, Cuevas filed an ethics complaint with Boeing, alleging Spirit had made unauthorized changes to fastener hole dimensions in the forward pressure bulkhead on 787 aircraft without notifying Boeing.</p>

<p>"Our client witnessed critical issues with the forward pressure bulkhead assembly on multiple planes that deviated from Boeing's specifications," said a statement from Katz Banks Kumin.</p>

<p>"He recognized the substandard work and expressed concern about his safety concerns, but Spirit and Boeing failed to stop the faulty manufacturing processes. Mr. Cuevas was fired when his manager found out that an employee complained about these issues, and suspected that employee was Mr. Cuevas."</p>

<p>The attorneys filed complaints with the Federal Aviation Administration and the Occupational Health and Safety Administration, saying in the latter submission that Cuevas believes that "based on his direct observations of glaring safety issues, that Boeing's and Spirit's statements to the public and investors about the safety of 787 Dreamliners are fraudulent."</p>

<p>The attorneys also represent Sam Salehpour, a Boeing engineer who testified in April in the Senate about concerns over 787 manufacturing practices and that he was retaliated against for speaking.</p>

<p>Boeing said it is not involved in personnel decisions of subcontracts.</p>

<p>"A subcontractor's employee previously reported concerns to us that we thoroughly investigated as we take seriously any safety-related matter. Engineering analysis determined that the issues raised did not present a safety concern and were addressed," Boeing said. "We are reviewing the documents released today and will thoroughly investigate any new claim."</p>

<p>Spirit "leadership is aware of the allegations and looking into the matter," said company spokesperson Joe Buccino. "We encourage all Spirit employees with concerns to come forward, safe in knowing they will be protected."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The NHS, created after World War II to provide free healthcare to all, is a shadow of its former self, weakened by years of underfunding and the Covid-19 pandemic.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fatme Ibryanova, 36, will travel from Britain to Turkey next month, not to holiday but for a medical appointment about surgery she is struggling to get on the UK's "broken" state-run health service.</p>

<p>The NHS, created after World War II to provide free healthcare to all, is a shadow of its former self, weakened by years of underfunding and the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Getting an appointment with a doctor or a dentist is often an ordeal. Emergency rooms are usually overwhelmed, and waiting times for hospital treatment regularly hit new highs.</p>

<p>But the institution remains beloved by Britons, and the malaise afflicting it is one of their primary concerns going into the country's general election on July 4.</p>

<p>Ibryanova has just seen her local doctor in Chelmsford, a London commuter town in Essex, southeast England, for an ear infection that has been causing her severe pain for months.</p>

<p>It has stopped her working and she needs an operation, quickly.</p>

<p>"I'm on a waiting list. I have to wait three or four months. That's long," she told AFP.</p>

<p>So she decided to go to Turkey, her home country, where she can receive treatment sooner.</p>

<p>"If you need operation, they are doing it like this," she said, snapping her fingers.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Broken' -</strong></p>

<p>Ibryanova is not alone. More than 7.5 million people in England were waiting for treatment in April, a new peak despite recent investment by the Conservative government.</p>

<p>A recent survey suggested that less than a quarter of Britons were satisfied with the NHS, an unprecedented level.</p>

<p>"We have to wait three weeks for a blood test. We often have to queue to buy medications when you can buy them," lamented 71-year-old retiree Christine Knight.</p>

<p>The crisis is particularly acute in south Essex, with one doctor for more than 2,300 patients at the end of last year, much worse than the national average, according to the Nuffield Trust health think-tank.</p>

<p>Two doctors' surgeries have closed in Chelmsford in recent years, explained Marie Goldman, the candidate for the Liberal Democrats party in the constituency, which has a sitting Conservative MP.</p>

<p>"What is left is a hole. It is so frustrating for people," Goldman added. Voters always asked her about the NHS, she said.</p>

<p>The opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games celebrated the health service as the "pride" of the UK, she pointed out. But today, she said, it's "broken".</p>

<p>Hospitals here are among the worst in the country for cancer care, with more than three-quarters of patients having to wait more than a month to start treatment once diagnosed.</p>

<p>The local health body declined to comment when contacted by AFP.</p>

<p>Bobby Jacobs, a 30-year-old construction worker, recently had hand surgery at the town's Broomfield Hospital.</p>

<p>He noted a lack of resources in a system that already relies heavily on caregivers from abroad.</p>

<p>"You can see on every nurse's face that they are so overworked and overstressed. They are working long hours. There is not enough of them," he told AFP.</p>

<p><strong>- Funding needed -</strong></p>

<p>Long and frequent strikes over pay and conditions, including a historic first walkout by nurses, have plagued the NHS over the past two years.</p>

<p>Low morale is leading professionals to leave the service or try to cut back on hours.</p>

<p>"It was not unusual to see 45 to 50 patients a day, sometimes more than that," said James Booth, a doctor for more than 20 years who quit one workplace to go part-time at another.</p>

<p>He cited an ageing population, less time with patients, and a shortage of staff.</p>

<p>"We're seeing worrying numbers of doctors, nurses and other professionals leaving early into their careers or not joining the NHS at all," said Billy Palmer, of the Nuffield Trust.</p>

<p>Booth noted that two private clinics have opened in Chelmsford in recent years and are doing "very well".</p>

<p>All parties, including Labour -- which is tipped to form the next government -- are promising to fix the NHS through massive recruitment, innovation and reorganisation.</p>

<p>Experts remain unconvinced, however, saying what the system really needs is a massive injection of cash currently not available.</p>

According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.news.com.au/finance/money/wealth/man-wins-6m-jackpot-at-marina-bay-sands-casino-in-singapore-collapses-immediately-after-suffering-heart-attack/news-story/17485409921ad4dc1744f3500166c1d1">news.com.au</a>, the incident happened&nbsp;at the Marina Bay Sands Casino in Singapore on June 22.&nbsp;The unnamed man, a regular visitor&nbsp;to the casino, was left overjoyed after he won the life-changing amount.&nbsp;As he was celebrating and punching the air in sheer joy., he suddenly fell to the ground having a cardiac arrest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As he collapsed,&nbsp;horrified bystanders gathered around him as the staff rushed to help him. A woman accompanying the man became increasingly worried and was heard pleading with the staff as they tried to administer medical assistance. He was&nbsp;quickly rushed to the hospital where he is recovering from cardiac arrest.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, many social media reports suggested the man died, however, industry insiders said that the man is alive and still in recovery at the hospital.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the casino condemned the false reporting, highlighting the distress it has caused the man's family. ''Unfortunately, the fake news has spread, and the video still circulating online is causing some distress to the guest's family,'' he said.&nbsp;Some sources&nbsp;have also disputed the amount that the gambler won, however, there is no official clarification of it yet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The casino is owned and operated by Las Vegas Sands, a Nevada-based company pulling revenues of $10.4 billion last year.</p>

<p>In a similar incident in 2021, a man in Michigan in the US was found washed up dead on a beach with the winning ticket in his pocket.&nbsp;A similar unfortunate incident happened in the US in April after a man fell into cardiac arrest while sitting at a Las Vegas blackjack table.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NASA on Tuesday said it had picked SpaceX to build a vessel to carry the International Space Station back through Earth's atmosphere and on to a final resting place in the Pacific Ocean after it is retired in 2030.</p>

<p>Elon Musk's company has been awarded a contract with a potential value of $843 million to develop and deliver the spaceship, dubbed the US Deorbit Vehicle.</p>

<p>"Selecting a US Deorbit Vehicle for the International Space Station will help NASA and its international partners ensure a safe and responsible transition in low Earth orbit at the end of station operations," said NASA's Ken Bowersox in a statement.</p>

<p>NASA plans to take ownership of the spacecraft after SpaceX builds it, and control operations throughout the mission.</p>

<p>Weighing 430,000 kilograms (950,000) pounds, the ISS is by far the largest single structure ever built in space.</p>

<p>Based on past observations of how other stations such as Mir and Skylab disintegrated on atmospheric re-entry, NASA engineers expect the orbital outpost to break up in three stages.</p>

<p>First, the massive solar arrays and the radiators that keep the orbital lab cool will come off, then individual modules will break off from the truss, or the station's backbone structure. Finally, the truss and the modules themselves will tear apart.</p>

<p>Much of the material will be vaporized, but large pieces are expected to survive. For this reason, NASA is aiming for an area of the Pacific Ocean called Point Nemo, one of the most remote areas of the world and known as the graveyard of satellites and spaceships.</p>

<p>The first segment of the ISS was launched in 1998, and it has been continuously inhabited by an international crew since 2001.</p>

<p>The US, Japan, Canada, and participating countries of the European Space Agency (ESA) have committed to operate the microgravity lab through 2030 -- though Russia, the fifth partner, has only committed to operations through 2028.</p>

<p>NASA chief Bill Nelson told Congress in April that given the dire state of US-Russia ties, it would be prudent to begin work on a US deorbit vehicle to "get the whole station down safely, so it won't hit anybody or anything."</p>

<p>Several companies are working on commercial successors to the ISS, including notably Axiom Space and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The tiny village of Thulasemthirapuram in Tamil Nadu is praying for US Presidential Democratic candidate Kamala Harris' victory, strengthening her family's ancestral ties with the village dating back a century. Initiated by the local elected councillor Arulmozhi, the priest of the temple of Kamala's family deity performed a special ritual in her honour.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This is a powerful God. We prayed last time and she had become the Vice President. This time we are confident she'd become the President of the USA. She's a sign of women empowerment and an inspiration for women to scale greater heights," Arulmozhi told NDTV.</p>

<p>Kamala's maternal grandfather PV Gopalan, a bureaucrat, was born and brought up here before he moved to the then-Madras where he used to take Kamala for a walk along Elliot's Beach. Kamala has said her grandpa had made a tremendous impact on her.</p>

<p>Many years ago, Kamala donated Rs 5,000 for the renovation of the temple and her name remains engraved in the list of donors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Kamala has to win to save democracy," said Kamala's friend Sharon, now based in Chennai. "She has to become the first woman President of the US. Already we are pretty late with many countries including India have had women Presidents and Prime Ministers."</p>

<p>A few posters put up in the village hail Kamala as "a daughter of the soil" and wish her the best in the Presidential race. TS Anbarasan, another man from the village who now lives in the nearby Mannargudi town compared Kamala to Sunita Williams. "We are all proud of their Indian connection and their accomplishments. They are role models," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Arulmozhi the councillor plans to serve a free meal on Wednesday if Kamala wins. "We will serve her favourite idly," she says.</p>

<p>However, some in the village are also oblivious to what is happening. A man at the local tea shop near the temple added "Kamala's grandfather lived here many decades ago. None of us know him and hence we are not following this."</p>]]></content:encoded>

<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/gws/ms/key-moments-in-us-election-campaign/assets/2.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>The election this year is being called one of the most consequential contests in US history and it will have a very significant impact on the world too. Here's why.</p>

<h2><strong>US-China Trade War</strong></h2>

<p>This is one of the leading reasons for the current global fragmentation. It was Trump who initiated a shift in policy towards China in his previous tenure from 2016-2020, raising tariffs on Chinese products and vowing to narrow the trade deficit. He accused Beijing of misusing international economic institutions like the World Trade Organization (WTO) and said it was responsible for “the greatest theft in the history of the world”.</p>

<p>The Biden administration didn't totally abandon what Trump started. In fact, from AUKUS to the renewed focus on Quad, Biden shored up security alliances against China. On the other hand, the policy moves over the last eight years between Trump and Biden have resulted in China and Russia going into a tighter embrace. This has deepened the fissures between the Global West and the Global East.</p>

<p>Hence, a lot rests on the new US President—will the new POTUS deepen the divide, will global collaboration become even more daunting, or will the new President weigh in favour of cooperation to prevent any further global fragmentation?</p>

<h2><strong>Democracy vs Authoritarianism</strong></h2>

<p>The American society is “emotionally polarised”, as stated in a 2023 report by Carnegie Endowment of International Peace. Interestingly, it says Americans are not as ideologically polarised as they believe themselves to be, which means there are possible overlaps regarding policies on many critical subjects, such as abortion and gun violence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, both sides hold a dislike for the other, preventing any meaningful conversation. The world's oldest democracy, the US, is often seen as an example of the success or failure of democracy, especially at a time of rising authoritarianism. Consensus-building is a vital feature of a democracy. The new US President needs to be a unifier and consensus builder to stand as a true representative of the liberal world order.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Transfer Of Power</strong></h2>

<p>Another critical democratic norm is to respect the mandate of the people and allow for the smooth transition of power. There is genuine concern about a repeat of the January 6 insurrection if Donald Trump loses again. The Republicans seem to be building a ground for rejecting the result in case of an adverse outcome. The rhetoric from Trump, that the 2020 election was stolen, has resurfaced in the last leg of the election.</p>

<p>In an unusual move but one that's indicative of what's at stake, a report from Policy Horizons Canada, a think tank, advised Ottawa to be aware of the possibility of a civil war in the US. Though this was only a single sentence in the otherwise long report titled Disruptions on the Horizon, it said “...ideological divisions, democratic erosion, and domestic unrest escalate, plunging the country into civil war”. Even if remote, the very fact that the possibility of unrest is being factored in is a cause of concern for a world that can ill afford any more economic jolts.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Immigration Policy</strong></h2>

<p>Trump has said he will initiate the largest deportation operation in the history of America if voted to power. A Pew survey says “Roughly six-in-ten Trump supporters (63%) say there should be a national effort to deport undocumented immigrants currently living in the US.” The report points out that there is growing intolerance towards immigrants and “since 2021, the share of voters who favour a national effort by law enforcement to deport undocumented immigrants currently living in the US has increased by 11 percentage points, from 26% to 37%.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, 'Tougher', Kamala Harris's campaign ad, also portrayed a stricter stance on immigration. Many also believe she has stepped back from her earlier position on decriminalising illegal border crossings.</p>

<p>Simultaneous conflicts are currently underway from Ukraine to Gaza. The office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees says by the end of 2023, there were 43.4 million refugees globally. This is a time when countries—especially the richest nations—should approach the subject from a humanitarian point of view. In this context, a tougher immigration policy will give a cue to the rest of the world to harden borders against those in need.</p>

<h2><strong>Ending Wars</strong></h2>

<p>Which way will the Ukraine and Gaza tensions go under the new US President? Trump says he will be able to end the Ukraine war immediately. The apprehension in Europe is that he will do so by ceding Ukrainian territory to Putin. Meanwhile, there is unlikely to be a change in position from what the Biden administration took on Ukraine if Harris comes to power.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Gaza, Trump says Netanyahu should “get over with it fast”, indicating even further intensification of military action in Gaza. Even though Kamala has been criticised for being party to the Biden administration's support for Israeli actions in Gaza, there are those who believe that her recent turn towards the humanitarian aspect of the conflict gives space for building pressure against Netanyahu's illegal war.</p>

<p>The wars and conflicts that are leading the world into a further flux can be resolved only through the political will of the leader of the global hegemon, the United States of America.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[US Elections: In the 1920 US election, Eugene V. Debs, the Socialist Party presidential candidate, managed to secure nearly a million votes without ever stepping on the campaign trail.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican US presidential candidate <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/topic/2024-us-elections" target="_blank">Donald Trump</a> was indicted on 34 felony charges last April. These charges ranged from falsifying business records in a scheme to illegally influencing the 2016 election through hush money payments to a porn actor. Despite the serious nature of these allegations, Trump has not been imprisoned - at least not yet. Now, with the US elections just hours away, this scenario brings to mind another figure in American political history. A man who ran his whole campaign trial from prison.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the 1920 US election, Eugene V. Debs, the Socialist Party presidential candidate, managed to secure nearly a million votes without ever stepping on the campaign trail. Debs conducted his entire campaign from the confines of a federal penitentiary in Atlanta, Georgia. He was serving a ten-year sentence for sedition.</p>

<p>His indictment came from his opposition to US involvement in World War I and his defiance of the Sedition Act of 1918, a law that suppressed free speech and criticism of the government. Despite his imprisonment, Debs was nominated for the presidency by his party, and his campaign was conducted under extraordinary circumstances.</p>

<p>Debs had a long history of labour activism and political engagement, having run for president four times between 1900 and 1912, during which he garnered around a million votes in 1912. His anti-war stance and commitment to social justice resonated with many Americans. When the Socialist Party nominated him again in 1920, it was as "Convict 9653" - a designation that did not take away his supporters.</p>

<p>During the campaign, Debs conducted what was termed a "front cell" campaign, responding to the "front porch" campaign style of his opponents. On May 29, 1920, newsreel cameras filmed a delegation from the Socialist Party arriving at the prison to officially inform him of his nomination. The footage, shared in motion picture theatres across the country, showed Debs accepting his nomination.</p>

<p>Though he faced formidable opponents - Warren G. Harding and James M. Cox - Debs still managed to capture 913,693 votes, about 3.4 per cent of the popular vote, despite his confinement. His campaign brought attention to the issues of social justice and the anti-war movement.</p>

<p>After the election, public opinion began to shift in favour of Debs. Although he did not receive a pardon from President Wilson, President Harding eventually commuted his sentence on Christmas Day in 1921.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe Rogan, the influential host of one of the world's top podcasts, delivered a last-minute endorsement of Republican candidate Donald Trump Monday, on the eve of a historically close US presidential election.</p>

<p>Rogan made the endorsement while promoting the latest episode of his wildly popular show, The Joe Rogan Experience, which featured an interview with billionaire Trump supporter Elon Musk.</p>

<p>Musk "makes what I think is the most compelling case for Trump you'll hear, and I agree with him every step of the way," wrote Rogan, on social media.</p>

<p>"For the record, yes, that's an endorsement of Trump."</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The great and powerful <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@elonmusk</a>.<br />
If it wasn't for him we'd be fucked. He makes what I think is the most compelling case for Trump you'll hear, and I agree with him every step of the way.<br />
For the record, yes, that's an endorsement of Trump.<br />
Enjoy the podcast <a href="https://t.co/LdBxZFVsLN">pic.twitter.com/LdBxZFVsLN</a></p>
— Joe Rogan (@joerogan) <a href="https://twitter.com/joerogan/status/1853614670764015762?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 5, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p></p>

<p>Rogan, a former mixed martial arts commentator, is known for his virile, combative and anti-politically-correct style, and his podcast is especially popular among men.</p>

<p>Male voters are a key demographic for Trump. He appeared on Rogan's show for a nearly three-hour-long interview last month.</p>

<p>Trump, who is locked neck-and-neck with Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in polls ahead of Tuesday's election, quickly welcomed the news.</p>

<p>"It just came over the wires that Joe Rogan just endorsed me," Trump told a rally in Pittsburgh, in the key swing state of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>"He's not a person that does endorsements, but he did an endorsement. So I just want to thank Joe Rogan -- that's fantastic," said Trump.</p>

<p>Harris reportedly held talks with Rogan in recent weeks to also appear on his podcast, but an interview never materialized.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris or Donald Trump? Ahead of the highly-anticipated <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/topic/2024-us-elections" target="_blank">2024 US Presidential Elections</a>, Allan Lichtman - historian, author, and a rare political forecaster with a track record of poll predictions - shared his insights on NDTV.</p>

<p>Mr Lichtman dismissed the relevance of most polling data, saying that they are as arbitrary as "superstition" in the words of the popular philosopher David Hume.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Consign them (opinion polls) to the flames," Mr Lichtman told NDTV.&nbsp;"Yes, we are going to have Kamala Harris, a new path-breaking president, the first woman president and the first president of mixed African and Asian descent. It is kind of foreshadowing where America is going. We are rapidly becoming a majority-minority country old white guys like me, we are on the decline," Mr Lichtman said.</p>

<p>Mr Lichtman's prediction model focuses on historical patterns, dismissing the idea that polls, campaign strategies, or even election demographics alone can determine outcomes. In 1981, he developed the 13 "Keys to the White House" system, identifying that governance, not campaign tactics, decides the US elections. His model has correctly forecasted the winner of every election since 1984, including some when his conclusions contradicted popular sentiment.</p>

<p>"They (opinion polls) have no predictive value. And they are all well within the margin of error. In 2016. When I predicted Donald Trump which did not make me very popular in the 90 per cent democratic Washington DC, where I teach at American University. All of the polls were going in the other direction. In fact, the most eminent compiler of polls, the Princeton University Consortium, gave Hillary Clinton a 99 per cent chance of winning."</p>

<p>While demographics do not dictate his model's predictions, Mr Lichtman did acknowledge the demographic trends against which Republicans are increasingly struggling. According to Mr Lichtman, Republicans' efforts to limit minority votes through voter suppression tactics reflect a party trying to secure a dwindling base in the face of these shifts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I don't base my prediction on voter demographics. You cannot accurately predict an election by trying to break it down into individual voter groups. I use the teacup analogy. You pour sugar into it. You learn nothing by trying to follow the individual sugar molecules, but you can learn a lot from simple, integral parameters like sweetness and density. And that is what the keys are all about," Mr Lichtman told NDTV.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite acknowledging the possibility of error, Mr Lichtman said his predictions are definitive, and not hedged by probabilities. Mr Lichtman has been right every election since Ronald Reagan, even going back retrospectively to the 1860 election that brought Abraham Lincoln to power.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Could I be wrong? Of course, I am a human being. Any human being can be wrong. It's always possible," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When asked if his model could be applied to elections in India, Mr Lichtman said that while the methodology could inspire similar predictive frameworks, it cannot be directly transplanted.</p>

<p>"I love India. I have been there lecturing about the keys to the White House, and I have been asked whether the keys could apply to Indian elections. And my answer is you cannot just export the keys. But someone who knows a lot about Indian history and politics could use the methodology and insights of the keys to become the Alan Lichtman of India," he said.&nbsp;</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Taylor Swift's friendly but "extremely important reminder" for the US voters - last chance to vote.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Popstar Taylor Swift's decision to attend a football game instead of US presidential candidate Kamala Harris's pre-election day rally in Pennsylvania on Monday has created a buzz on the internet.</p>

<p>Taylor Swift was spotted arriving at the Arrowhead Stadium for the Kansas City Chiefs' game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, showing support to her boyfriend, NFL star Travis Kelce. With this, she busted all speculations suggesting she would perform at Harris' rally, who she had recently endorsed.</p>

<p>On Saturday, Vice President Harris posted a video on TikTok, with Swift's song “Long Live (Taylor's Version)”. The fan took it as an easter egg, confirming Swift would appear at a Pennsylvania rally.</p>

<p>Though Swift chose match over the pre-election rally, she didn't miss a chance to urge voters to cast their vote on November 5. In an Instagram post, marking the end of US shows on The Eras Tour, Swift shared an “extremely important reminder” for the US voters.</p>

<p>“And here's a friendly but extremely important reminder that tomorrow is the US Election and your last chance to vote,” she wrote.</p>

<p>Swift has been a vocal supporter of Kamala Harris, publicly supporting her and her running mate Tim Walz. Earlier in September, Taylor Swift said she would vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. Explaining her choice of vote, she wrote, “I'm voting for Kamala Harris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos. I was so heartened and impressed by her selection of running mate Tim Walz, who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman's right to her own body for decades.”</p>

       <description><![CDATA["I have decided that I am retiring from journalism because of the arrest, the questioning and imprisonment," said award-winning Cambodian reporter Mech Dara.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A high-profile Cambodian reporter who won an international award for uncovering alleged cyber scams told AFP Tuesday that he is quitting journalism, saying he has lost "courage" after being arrested by the authorities and freed on bail.</p>

<p>Police arrested Mech Dara on September 30 on charges of inciting social disorder, drawing condemnation from around the world.</p>

<p>He was released on bail three weeks later after apologising to Cambodia's former leader Hun Sen and his son Prime Minister Hun Manet in a video shot while he was in prison.</p>

<p>"I have decided that I am retiring from journalism because of the arrest, the questioning and imprisonment," Dara told AFP.</p>

<p>"I am still afraid," he said, adding that authorities used excessive force during his arrest, then questioned him all night afterwards.</p>

<p>"I have lost my courage. It has attacked my spirit, and I have no more courage," Dara said, referring to the arrest and time he spent in prison.</p>

<p>He also urged the court to drop the charges against him.</p>

<p>Hun Manet on Monday posted pictures of him meeting Dara, including one showing the pair embracing one another.</p>

<p>Dara said he informed Hun Manet of his decision to quit journalism during the meeting, which took place a day after his release.</p>

<p>Scam farm reporting</p>

<p>Police detained Dara, 36, after stopping a car carrying him and his family from Sihanoukville, a coastal city where many suspected cyber scam operations take place.</p>

<p>His reporting has appeared in various international news outlets and he worked for the independent Voice of Democracy in Cambodia before the authorities shut it down in February 2023.</p>

<p>Dara has since used his social media platforms to share news content, particularly around the proliferation of "scam farms" -- criminal operations that defraud victims online for vast sums of money and fuel human trafficking across the region.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken last year presented Dara with a Hero Award, which recognises efforts against human trafficking, for investigations into exploitation at the online scam compounds.</p>

<p>The award hailed his "courageous reporting on human trafficking for the purpose of forced criminality", saying it had led to the government improving its response to the problem.</p>

<p>His arrest came a day after he posted an image on social media purportedly showing a tourist site demolished to make way for a quarry, according to the Cambodian Journalists' Alliance Association.</p>

<p>Local authorities labelled the now-deleted images "fake news" and called for Dara to face punishment for their publication.</p>

<p>After announcing charges against Dara, the Phnom Penh Municipal Court accused him of posting messages on social media platforms designed to "ignite anger (and) to make people misunderstand about the leadership of the Cambodian government".</p>

<p>The charge of incitement is frequently used by Cambodian authorities against activists, and Dara could face up to two years in jail if convicted.</p>

<p>Cambodia places near the bottom of international press freedom rankings and rights groups have long accused the government of using legal cases as a tool to silence dissenting voices.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Since hitting the peak in 2005, the proportion of high school students, who have had their first kiss, has been steadily declining in Japan]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Only one in five boys in high school in Japan have experienced their first kiss - the lowest figure since 1974, according to a survey conducted by the Japan Association for Sex Education (JASE), involving over 12,500 students, published in the newspaper <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20241104/p2a/00m/0na/016000c" rel="noindex, nofollow">The Mainichi</a></em>. The poll, conducted in the 2023 academic year, revealed that only 22.8 per cent of boys had experienced their first kiss while 27.5 per cent of girls in the same age group had got their first kiss.</p>

<p>Since hitting the peak in 2005, the proportion of high school students, who have had their first kiss, has been steadily declining in Japan. Additionally, the ratio of those who had sexual intercourse also fell by 3.5 points to 12 per cent among high school boys, while the figure plummeted by 5.3 points to 14.8 per cent among high school girls.</p>

<p>Experts have attributed the COVID-19 pandemic as the likely cause for the fall in numbers as high schoolers were forced to stay at home and urged to avoid the 'three Cs': crowded places, confined spaces and close-contact settings.</p>

<p>Tamaki Kawasaki, a columnist and sociology lecturer said the Japanese youth preferred to stay home and watch sexual content alone, which threatened the already low birthrate.</p>

<p>"It shows that the trend is for people to move away from real, physical sexual activity, even at a time when it's natural for them to be sexually active," Kawasaki was quoted as saying by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/05/kiss-chaste-number-of-high-school-boys-in-japan-who-have-had-first-kiss-falls-to-1970s-levels" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>The Guardian.</em></a></p>

<p>"Instead, there is a stronger tendency for them to stay home and watch sexual content alone. If teens, who represent the country's future, continue like this then it is hard to see any improvement in the declining birthrate."</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/japan-birth-rate-hit-record-low-in-2023-as-nations-population-crisis-deepen-5135744" rel="noindex, nofollow"><strong>Also read | Japan Birth Rate Hit Record Low In 2023 As Nation's Population Crisis Deepen</strong></a></p>

<h3><strong>Declining birth rate and ageing population</strong></h3>

<p>Japan has been hit with the double whammy of a declining birth rate and an ageing population in recent years. According to government data, the number of babies born in the country fell for an eighth consecutive year in 2023 to 758,631.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the number of citizens aged 65 and over, reached a staggering 36.25 million in 2024, constituting 29.3 per cent of the overall population.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[H5N1 bird flu-infected poultry found on a small American non-commercial farm. Although the pigs appeared to be healthy, a nasal swab from one of them was found to contain H5N1.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>H5N1 influenza has now been detected in pigs. This was something virologists had been worrying about ever since this highly pathogenic strain of bird flu started its rapid global spread in 2020. But why were we worrying specifically about pigs? And does this case – detected on a farm in Oregon on October 29 – change anything?</p>

<p>It might seem odd that we care about it at all. In many ways, the initial reports of this case are – against the backdrop of a continuing viral outbreak that has devastated seabird colonies around the world, caused huge die-offs of sea lions and led to the emergence of an entirely new disease of US dairy cattle – pretty innocuous.</p>

<p>What we currently know is this: H5N1 bird flu infected poultry on a small American non-commercial farm, something which is sadly now quite common. In this case, there were other animals on the farm, including five pigs. Although the pigs appeared to be healthy, a nasal swab from one of them was found to contain H5N1.</p>

<p>We don't yet know if the pig was actually infected or if it had just snuffled up some contaminated material from the birds. At the moment, this particular outbreak doesn't seem to have spread into any other pigs.</p>

<p>And “spillover” infections on farms, where a virus from one species turns up in another, are nothing new. Back in May, H5N1 turned up in farmed alpacas in a somewhat similar incident.</p>

<p>To understand why pigs get virologist's attention, we need to think about what it means for a virus to jump from one host species to another. A moment's reflection tells us that changing host species must be an incredibly difficult thing for a virus to do.</p>

<p>The world is teeming with viruses that infect every species around us. If it wasn't very nearly impossible for a virus to jump from one species into another, we'd be dealing with a new pandemic every ten minutes.</p>

<p><b>Much more subtle</b></p>

<p>The reason it's so difficult for a virus to jump between different types of host is because viruses are fundamentally different from bacteria, or parasites: pathogens that basically just want to eat us. Viruses are much more subtle.</p>

<p>Viruses work by taking control of our cells and carefully reprogramming them into machines for making more viruses. Because of this, a virus infecting a new host species is like someone trying to win an argument by shouting at people in a language that they can't understand. And this is where pigs come in.</p>

<p>Influenza viruses (specifically influenza A viruses, the group to which H5N1 belongs) are unusually good at crossing between different host species. They still only manage to create a new human disease once every few decades, but that's a better hit rate than any other virus.</p>

<p>If we look back, most of the pandemics we know of have been caused by influenza viruses, and the threat of a new pandemic is the biggest worry we have about H5N1 now.</p>

<p>One of the main reasons that influenza is good at learning the language of a new host species is that, if two influenza viruses can get into the same cell at the same time, they will assemble new viruses that take some of their genes from one parent virus and some from the other. The novel virus that this creates can suddenly shift to being better evolved to its host.</p>

<p>For example, it could still look like an avian virus, which we have no immunity to, while having swapped most of its genes for versions that are very good at winning arguments with human cells. This is a powerful way for a virus to leapfrog towards causing a pandemic. However, it only works if a bird virus and a human virus can get into the same cell at the same time, and this turns out to be really difficult for influenza viruses to do.</p>

<p>It's difficult because influenza viruses get into cells by grabbing on to a particular type of sugar molecule that coats the cell surface. This molecule can be chemically assembled in several different shapes, and while one shape of molecule is used on cells in birds (and, we now think, in cow's udders), a different shape is used on cells in the human airway.</p>

<p><strong>Mixing vessels</strong></p>

<p>Bird flu viruses and human flu viruses are trying to get into cells by rattling the handles of different doors, which limits their ability to meet in the same cell. And this is where pigs come in, because it turns out that the cells in pig airways use both types of sugar molecule on their surface. Pig cells can be infected by both bird flu and human flu, making pigs a potential “mixing vessel” in which influenza viruses with pandemic potential could be brewed.</p>

<p>Has this happened yet? Thankfully, no. At the moment, this detection of H5N1 in a pig appears to have been an isolated incident. We don't know how likely it is to happen again.</p>

<p>Indeed, there is an idea that it could be quite hard for this particular virus to infect pigs, a hypothesis supported by some experimental work and by the observation that, despite H5N1 running rampant and turning up in all sorts of animals over the last four years, this is the first time an H5N1 infection of pigs has been suspected.</p>

<p>Even if H5N1 did succeed in establishing sustained transmission in pigs – as it has already done in cows – what that would mean is far from certain. We know that influenza viruses can mix with each other in pigs, but we also know that the strain of influenza virus that entered pigs in 1918 then circulated in them for over 90 years before combining with other viruses to cause the 2009 swine flu pandemic.</p>

<p>So why did a report of H5N1 in pigs get so much attention from virologists? H5N1 has the potential to be an extremely dangerous virus for many different animals, and combining its genes with a human virus could make it much more dangerous to us.</p>

<p>The risks of that happening have already begun to increase as this year's winter flu season starts for humans while H5N1 is circulating on farms in the US. Any suggestion of the virus turning up in animals that could help it to mix and match with a human influenza is a troubling reminder that H5N1 has the potential to change its capabilities very quickly.</p>

<p>When it comes to which animals to watch for signs of such a change happening, some animals are more equal than others. For as long as H5N1 is around, virologists are going to watch any infections of pigs with interest.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ahead of the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world/elections">2024 US presidential election</a>, artificial intelligence (AI) tool ChatGPT has been making bold predictions. In a recent experiment, the chatbot adopted the role of 'AI Nostradamus,' predicting the US election results. Unlike conventional polls or analyses, ChatGPT's predictions include both surprising political developments and possible social unrest.</p>

<h2><strong>Who will win the US elections?</strong></h2>

<p>When asked about the result of the showdown between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, ChatGPT proposed an alternative outcome. Instead of suggesting a victory for either major candidate, the AI hinted that neither Trump nor Harris might ultimately succeed. Instead, ChatGPT cryptically suggested that "a dark horse would rise from the shadows to take power".</p>

<p>According to the report, adding a poetic twist to its prediction, the AI said, "But in the final hour, a twist unforeseen, neither may claim the throne of serene. A name unspoken in many a tale will rise to power, beyond the pale. Though Trump and Kamala shall fight with might, another will lead, emerging from the night."</p>

<p>Both Trump and Harris are backed by running mates who are not household names, such as Minnesota Governor Tim Walz or Ohio Senator JD Vance. Could one of these vice-presidential candidates be the mysterious figure hinted at by the AI? Only time will tell.</p>

<h2><strong>Ivanka Trump's role and Elon Musk's influence</strong></h2>

<p>ChatGPT's predictions didn't stop there. In a series of responses, the AI pointed to a surprising future for Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump, suggesting she could play a significant role on the political stage. Similarly, Elon Musk's name surfaced in ChatGPT's musings, though it's unclear what role the tech billionaire might play.</p>

<h2><strong>Warnings of unrest and division</strong></h2>

<p>ChatGPT's insights extend beyond electoral predictions, touching on possible civil unrest and social upheaval around the time of the US elections. The AI raised the spectre of protests, rallies and potential violence, reminiscent of the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack.</p>

<p>"The eagle's land, torn by division, will see unrest, born of derision. Protests, marches, and rallies loudly shall stir beneath a darkening cloud," it warned, painting a picture of a politically charged atmosphere that could lead to protests and clashes.</p>

<h2><strong>Path to reconciliation?</strong></h2>

<p>Despite these ominous predictions, ChatGPT held out hope for reconciliation after the election dust settled. The AI foresaw a period of healing, where leaders would work to mend divisions and promote unity and peace.</p>

<h2><strong>What did Google's Gemini predict?</strong></h2>

<p>According to <a href="https://decrypt.co/290130/the-latest-ai-predictions-favor-kamala-harris-for-the-win" rel="nofollow,noindex">Decrypt</a>, Google's Gemini AI steered clear of making any predictions or comments on the US elections. Gemini, instead, redirected users to a Google Search link, saying, “I can't help with responses on elections and political figures right now.” Gemini acknowledged that it aims for accuracy but may still make errors. Even when prompted with more complex questions by Decrypt, Google's chatbot maintained its stance, refusing to comment on the election outcome.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Had Biden stayed on the Democratic ticket, Donald Trump would likely have swept the election. Even with Kamala Harris making this one of the closest presidential races in the past 50 years, the election is Trumps to lose.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/3kbsf1rg_trump-harris_625x300_09_October_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>As we navigate through the complexities of the U.S. presidential election, let's start with some basic facts and figures. Around 245 million U.S. citizens are eligible to vote, but between 160 and 165 million are expected to have cast their ballots when voting ends today.</p>

<p>The election hinges on a majority in the Electoral College, which totals 538 votes. This includes one electoral vote for each of the 435 seats in the House, 100 seats in the Senate, and three votes for Washington DC. Each state's electoral votes go to the candidate who wins the popular vote in that state.</p>

<p>Of the 50 states, 43 are reliably Republican or Democratic. The outcome will be determined by seven swing states with a combined total of 93 electoral votes: Pennsylvania (19), Michigan (15), and Wisconsin (10) in the Midwest, and Georgia (16), North Carolina (16), Arizona (11), and Nevada (6) in the Sun Belt.</p>

<h2><strong>Many Liked America Under Trump</strong></h2>

<p>Had Biden stayed on the Democratic ticket, Donald Trump would likely have swept the election. Even with Kamala Harris making this one of the closest presidential races in the past 50 years, the election is Trump's to lose. A prominent political scientist summed it up: "The fundamentals the Biden-Harris administration's low approval ratings in every policy domain, large majorities believing the economy is poor or only fair, the reality of higher prices for necessities favour Republicans this year."</p>

<p>The <em>New York Times</em>, which has consistently opposed Trump editorially, has been following a focus group for the last two years. In its final summary, the paper has noted: "A main takeaway from our groups is that a cross-section of independents, Republicans and Democrats liked how America was under Mr. Trump they liked the economy, the perception of relative global stability, the restraint of divided government and the image that this outsider businessman was not beholden to Washington insiders, lobbyists and big money (the unholy trio of turpitude for many of our participants)." For <em>The Economist</em>, Trump makes a lot of American "being seen".</p>

<p>Polling analyst Nate Silver, whose "gut" leans towards a Trump victory, recently listed 24 factors in Trump's favour. These include a 2% Electoral College advantage for Republicans, a 20% rise in prices since 2020, stagnant or modest wage growth, nearly 5 million illegal border crossings between 2021 and 2023, Kamala Harris's left-leaning stances on fracking and immigration, and the "feminisation" of the US political landscape, which has consolidated Trump's appeal among non-college-educated white men and attracted more Black and Latino men.</p>

<h2><strong>'Awful, Terrifying, Stomach-Turning'</strong></h2>

<p>In the 2016 campaign, Trump famously claimed, "I could stand in the middle of (New York's) Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and not lose any voters." Eight years, a Capitol Hill riot, and over 30 felony indictments later, his popularity is at an all-time high.</p>

<p>Trump's campaign strategy has been laser-focused on energising his base. As writer Tom Nichols noted, "Trump supporters love him because he is as uninhibited as he is. They want Trump to be awful, terrifying, and stomach-turning, so that reelecting him will be a fully realised act of social revenge."</p>

<p>As the campaign has progressed, Trump's rhetoric has become darker, casting anyone who opposes him as an "enemy within". He has blamed illegal immigrants for America's economic and social challenges. Recently, he said, "This is the final battle. With you at my side, we will demolish the deep state... and we will liberate America from these villains once and for all."</p>

<p>Despite Trump's strong appeal to his base, he appears to be capped at 48% in support due to lingering concerns about his honesty, criminal trials, and the chaos that surrounds him. Even among some Trump-leaning voters, doubts persist about his reliability and mental fitness. "I don't trust Kamala with our national security or with our economy. But I don't know if I trust Trump to be a normal person for the next three months," Lillian, a 27-year-old Virginian who voted for Trump in 2020 but is now undecided, told the <em>NYT</em>.</p>

<h2><strong>Demography Behind Tight Race</strong></h2>

<p>Another reason for the close race is demographics. Broadly, the electorate is 67% white, 13% Latino, 12% Black, and 5% Asian. While Trump's focus is largely on voters over 60 and those without a college degree, strong support from whom led to his 2016 victory, he has also targeted young voters across racial lines. Early in the campaign, he identified young, undecided voters in swing states, who make up 11% of the electorate, as key to victory.</p>

<p>A recent Harvard Youth Poll supports this strategy: compared to four years ago, 7% fewer voters under 30 identify as Democrats, while an equal percentage now consider themselves Republicans. Among Gen Z men, three in four describe their future as "bleak". "unclear" or "scary". Additionally, twice as many young men are single, less likely to attend college, and less likely to participate in the workforce, with higher suicide rates.</p>

<p>In his campaign, Trump has leaned heavily into what's commonly called "bro culture" by prioritising media appearances with favoured podcast hoststhe preferred medium of his younger audience. He spent three hours with top podcaster Joe Rogan, an actor and comedian popular among the young, chatting about football and other topics relevant to this largely apolitical crowd.</p>

<p>Trump has made his biggest gains among young Black and Hispanic votersespecially young Black and Hispanic menwho align with his conservative views, according to <em>The New York Times </em>Chief Political Analyst, Nate Cohn. About 40% of Black voters and 43% of Hispanic voters say they support building a wall along the southern border. Similarly, 45% of Hispanic voters and 41% of Black voters favour deporting undocumented immigrants. Among Hispanic men under 45, Trump holds a 55-38 lead, with even stronger support among Hispanic and Black men aged 18-29, Cohn notes.</p>

<p>After a turbulent 14-week campaign, Kamala Harris's biggest challenge remains that voters still don't feel they know her well. She has largely avoided specifics, often giving scripted responses to probing questions on her shifting views on immigration, healthcare, and green energy.</p>

<p>Her core message from the Democratic Convention remains this: She is committed to all Americans, whether they vote for her or not, putting country over self, promoting non-ideological solutions, and serving as a unifier. Her rallying cry has been, "We are not going back." Critics, however, have summarised this as simply, "I am not Trump."</p>

<p>Though <em>The Economist</em> endorsed her in its latest issue, it labelled her an "underwhelming machine politician". Harris also faces the drag of Biden's deep unpopularity, which she did little to ease when she responded, "I couldn't think of one thing," when asked if she would have done anything differently than Biden.</p>

<h2><strong>Harris's Reliance On Women</strong></h2>

<p>Still, Harris's campaign strategy may yet prove decisive. She has focused heavily on women, particularly white women, who make up 30% of the electorate and are the largest single demographic. Though white women lean Republican (53%) versus Democratic (43%), they are less divided than white men. Crucially, they are more likely to vote, unlike younger men.</p>

<p>Younger white women, motivated to defend reproductive rights, have been a driving force for Harris. In 2020, Trump received 53% of the white female vote, up from 47% in 2016. But the latest <em>New York Times</em>/Siena poll shows Harris and Trump are now in dead heat, with Harris pulling slightly ahead. The <em>Times </em>also noted that her campaign has targeted women without college degrees, who often lean Republican for economic reasons but may be persuaded by Harris's focus on the so-called "care economy" and policies supporting parents and caregivers.</p>

<p>According to a recent <em>ABC News</em>/Ipsos national poll, Trump trails Harris among likely female voters by 14 pointsa gap far greater than his 6-point lead among men. The gender divide among younger voters is even starker: Across three <em>Times</em>/Siena polls this fall, Trump leads Harris among young men by 21 points, while Harris leads Trump among young women by nearly 40 points.</p>

<p>Another advantage for Harris is her campaign's stronger focus on voter turnout. Harris's team has outspent Trump's by a 3:1 ratio, with significant investments in staffers and volunteers for door-to-door canvassing and phone calls. In swing states, her 2,500 staffers across 353 offices have knocked on over 6,00,000 doors and made more than three million calls through 63,000 volunteer shifts.</p>

<h2><strong>Kamala, The "Underdog"</strong></h2>

<p>Early in the race, Harris told supporters, "This is a margin-of-error race. We are the underdog, and I am running like the underdog because I am the underdog in this race." As Democratic pollster Anna Greenberg put it: "The Harris coalition rests on the most reliable voters (older, college-educated). Trump needs every single low-propensity less educated young person to come out and vote for him."</p>

<p>Pollsters agree that this race is too close to call, with slim leads in the swing states well within the margin of error. In this seemingly static field, a major surprise emerged on Friday when Iowa's<em> Des Moines Register </em>published a poll by respected pollster Ann Selzer showing Harris leading Trump by four points.</p>

<p>Iowa isn't a swing state; Republicans have traditionally dominated there. But Selzer's poll suggests that Harris has boosted the Democratic vote by 22% from when Biden was the candidate, driven primarily by support from women on abortion and reproductive rights. Her poll also showed strong support for Harris on these issues among young women and even those aged 65 and older.<br />
Reluctantly, and very late in the game, pollsters are beginning to confront the possibility that this election might defy expectations. A new scenario has emerged: that a single electoral vote from Nebraska could clinch the win for Harris.</p>

<p>Nebraska, which has voted Republican in the last 14 elections, decided in the 1990s to split its electoral votes by congressional districts. If its most populous county, Douglas, votes Democratic, as expected, it could deliver Harris the crucial 270th electoral vote in the event of a tie. This election could well come down to the wire.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Tuesday said that the comprehensive strategic partnership with Australia is growing steadily as he met his Australian counterpart Penny Wong for the 15th India-Australia Foreign Ministers' Framework Dialogue here.</p>

<p>Both the leaders also discussed "respective neighbourhoods, Indo-Pacific, West Asia, Ukraine and the global strategic scenario." "Concluded the 15th India - Australia Foreign Ministers' Framework Dialogue with FM @SenatorWong in Canberra today. Our Comprehensive Strategic Partnership is growing steadily. Reflected in stronger political ties, robust defence &amp; security cooperation, expanded trade, greater mobility and deeper educational linkages," Mr Jaishankar posted on X.</p>

<p>"Discussed our respective neighbourhoods, Indo-Pacific, West Asia, Ukraine and the global strategic scenario," his post said.</p>

<p>Taking to X, Ms Wong said," Australia and India's partnership is central to the peace, stability and prosperity of our shared region. Today, I welcomed my good friend @DrSJaishankar to Canberra for the 15th Australia-India Foreign Ministers' Framework Dialogue." Wong also announced that Australia will send a 'First Nations Business Mission' to India for the first time next year. The mission will support new commercial partnerships for First Nations businesses looking to engage with India and will promote First Nation businesses to new markets overseas.</p>

<p>She further posted, "We're cooperating in important sectors including science and technology, clean energy, agriculture, education and skills, and tourism. Today, I announced the Albanese Government is funding 6 impressive projects under the Australia-India Cyber and Critical Technology Partnership." Meanwhile, the Australian foreign ministry said in a press release that," Australia and India are close partners with strong strategic, economic and community ties – almost one million Australians trace their heritage to India. We share a vision for an Indo-Pacific region that is peaceful, stable and prosperous." "Ahead of 2025 – the fifth year of our Comprehensive Strategic Partnership – the Foreign Ministers' Framework Dialogue is an opportunity to take stock of the progress we have made, and to chart the way forward for the next phase in our relationship," it said.</p>

<p>The statement said that both the leaders "will discuss how we can advance our cooperation in important sectors – including science and technology, clean energy, trade and investment – and how we can deepen our defence and maritime security engagement." "India is the world's fastest-growing major economy, and on track to be the third largest by the end of the decade. India is an essential partner as we diversify our trade links and secure our supply chains," it said.</p>

<p>The two leaders will also attend 'Raisina Down Under', the Australian iteration of India's Raisina Dialogue.</p>

<p>The Raisina Dialogue is India's flagship conference on geopolitics and geo-economics, committed to addressing the most challenging issues facing the international community.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A former spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been arrested for allegedly leaking confidential documents that may have harmed Gaza hostage negotiations.</p>

<p>Eliezer Feldstein was detained along with three other people on Monday over the leak of "classified and sensitive intelligence information".&nbsp;The Israeli court said the release of the documents ran the risk of causing "severe harm to state security".&nbsp;"As a result, the ability of security bodies to achieve the objective of releasing the hostages, as part of the war goals, could have been compromised," it added.</p>

<p>Israel's domestic security agency and the army launched an investigation into the breach in September after two newspapers, British weekly The Jewish Chronicle and Germany's Bild tabloid, published articles based on the classified military documents.</p>

<p>One claimed a document had been uncovered showing that then Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar -- later killed by Israel -- and the hostages in Gaza would be smuggled out of the territory into Egypt through the Philadelphi Corridor along the Gaza-Egypt border.&nbsp;The other was based on what was said to be an internal memo from the Hamas leadership on Sinwar's strategy to hamper talks towards the liberation of hostages.</p>

<p>The first document leaked turned out to be fake, and the internal memo was in fact written by lower-level Hamas militants, Israeli media reports said.</p>

<p>Opposition leaders, meanwhile, questioned if Mr Netanyahu is complicit in the leak.&nbsp;Key opposition leader Yair Lapid told journalists on Sunday the details of "the serious security affair in Netanyahu's office should alarm every Israeli".&nbsp;"This affair originated in the prime minister's office, and the investigation needs to determine whether it was not under the prime minister's orders," Lapid added.</p>

<p>Another leading opposition figure, Benny Gantz, said, "This is not a case of suspected leaks but rather profiteering with state secrets for political purposes."</p>

<p>Mr Netanyahu denied the allegations, saying "the document published by Bild had never arrived" at his office.&nbsp;Without mentioning Feldstein by name, he said the former aide "had never taken part in security meetings or consulted confidential documents".</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 51-year-old British tourist suffered minor injuries after plummeting from a second-floor hotel balcony in Pattaya, Thailand. According to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/11/04/naked-british-tourist-falls-balcony-thailand-covered-poo-21921580/#:~:text=A%20naked%20British%20tourist%20had,early%20hours%20of%20this%20morning.">Metro</a></em>, Paul Hadfield, 51, from Blackburn, Lancashire, was said to be "extremely drunk" when he returned to his hotel in the early hours of Monday morning, November 4. At the scene, the fall caused alarm among nearby tourists and locals.</p>

<p>Rescuers found Mr. Hadfield, half of his body hanging through the ceiling of an internet cafe below, calling out for help. Emergency responders carefully lifted him from the roof, administered first aid, and promptly transported him to a nearby hospital. It was later confirmed that he had fallen from the hotel's second-floor balcony, breaking through the cafe's ceiling on impact.</p>

<p>When rescue workers checked his second-floor room, they were met with a shocking sight: human faeces smeared on the bed and floor. Police reported that there were 'suspicions' about what Paul was doing, but they had found 'nothing illegal'.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Police lieutenant Thanawee Yarangsee said: ''We have some ideas about what he was doing in the room to make it so dirty but there was nothing illegal. It is his private life, so he will have to speak with the hotel to negotiate the bill.''</p>

<p>A witness, Mr Somrak, said he heard a loud crash and saw legs hanging through the ceiling, prompting him to call for help.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He said, ''I was sitting playing games downstairs. I heard the first thump. I didn't think much of it. After a while, there was another thump. The ceiling started to break more. There were legs coming down, right on my head. So I called the staff to come and look.&nbsp;After a while, it seemed like the ceiling started to sink. I was very shocked. So I ran up to look. I smelled it, but I thought it was a broken water pipe or something.''</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Mark Zuckerberg-owned social media company said it was playing its part in ensuring the safety and security of the United States.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Facebook and Instagram parent Meta will allow its artificial intelligence (AI) models to be used for military purposes, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/11/open-source-ai-america-global-security/">the company said</a> on Monday (Nov 4), adding that government agencies and contractors working on national security will get hold of the latest Llama 3 model. The Mark Zuckerberg-owned social media company said it was playing its part in ensuring the safety and security of the United States by working with the likes of Lockheed Martin, IBM, Amazon, Microsoft and Oracle among others to make Llama available to the government.</p>

<p>"As an American company, and one that owes its success in no small part to the entrepreneurial spirit and democratic values the United States upholds, Meta wants to play its part to support the safety, security and economic prosperity of America - and of its closest allies too," the company said.</p>

<p>With the collaboration, the US military intends to use the power of AI to streamline logistics and track terrorist financing as well as strengthen cyber defence.</p>

<p>Under Meta's "acceptable use policy", people are not allowed to use the AI model for military, nuclear industries or espionage. However, Nick Clegg, Meta's president of global affairs, said the company now backed "responsible and ethical uses" of the technology that supported the US and its 'democratic values'.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-ai/meta-ai-llama-3-ai-math-meta-unveils-biggest-llama-3-ai-model-claiming-language-and-math-gains-6176456" rel="nofollow, noindex"><strong>Also read | Meta Unveils Biggest Llama 3 AI Model, Claiming Language And Math Gains</strong></a></p>

<h3><strong>OpenAI cosying up with the US government</strong></h3>

<p>Meta is not the only company to have offered its AI model to the US military. For a long time, there have been rumours that OpenAI, the world's largest AI company, was cosying up with the Pentagon. A report in Forbes claimed that OpenAI's national security advisor Katrina Mulligan recently attended a Taylor Swift concert in New Orleans with the Secretary of the Army Christine Wormuth. The 'meeting' came in the backdrop of US Africa Command, or AFRICOM, in a procurement document stating that access to OpenAI's technology was "essential" for its mission.</p>

<p>However, there are legitimate concerns regarding AI models being utilised by the military. Last week, a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/chinese-researchers-develop-ai-model-military-use-back-metas-llama-2024-11-01/"><em>Reuters </em>report</a> claimed that Chinese military researchers had used MetaAI to develop a defence chatbot. The Chinese researchers, associated with the People's Liberation Army (PLA) R&amp;D group, used Meta's Llama 2 AI model to create a military-focused chatbot called ChatBIT.</p>

<p>Quizzed about the incident, Meta released a statement remarking that the use of the "single, and outdated" Llama model was "unauthorised" and contrary to its acceptable use policy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the US gears up for its November 5 presidential election, an extraordinary group of voters prepares to cast their ballots from an unconventional polling station - the International Space Station (ISS).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Astronauts stationed hundreds of miles above Earth are fully eligible to participate in the US elections, ensuring that even those orbiting the planet can exercise their right to vote.</p>

<p>Aboard the ISS are Boeing Starliner astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams. Since their mission was extended in June 2024 due to safety protocols, they have announced their intention to vote in the US elections from space. They will be stuck in space until at least February 2025.</p>

<p>During a NASA press conference in September, Williams expressed her enthusiasm for voting from orbit, saying, "It's a very important duty that we have as citizens, and [I am] looking forward to being able to vote from space, which is pretty cool."</p>

<p>Wilmore added, "It's a very important role that we all play as citizens, to be included in those elections, and NASA makes it very easy for us to do that. So we're excited about that opportunity."</p>

<p>This is not an isolated instance. Astronauts have cast their ballot from space since 1997, thanks to a Texas law. It was passed to support astronauts from Texas, where NASA's Johnson Space Center is located, in staying involved in the democratic process while fulfilling their duties in space.</p>

<p>David Wolf was the first to vote from the now-defunct Mir Space Station in 1997. Since then, multiple astronauts have cast their ballots. Kate Rubins was the last astronaut to vote from the ISS during the 2020 US elections.</p>

<p>The voting process for astronauts is streamlined and secure. After applying for an absentee ballot, the astronauts complete their ballots electronically while aboard the ISS. NASA then encrypts the data and uploads it to an onboard computer, transmitting it via the agency's Near Space Network.</p>

<p>This information is relayed through the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) to NASA's White Sands Test Facility in New Mexico, before being forwarded to Mission Control in Houston. From there, the ballots are electronically sent to the respective county clerk's offices for official processing.</p>

<p>NASA emphasises the significance of this connection in a recent blog post: "Astronauts forego many of the comforts afforded to those back on Earth as they embark on their journeys to space for the benefit of humanity. Though they are far from home, NASA's networks connect them with their friends and family and give them the opportunity to participate in democracy and society while in orbit."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Thailand welcomed nearly 1.64 million Indian tourists until October this year, making India its third-largest source of international visitors.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thailand has indefinitely extended visa-free entry for Indian nationals, the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) confirmed.</p>

<p>The policy allows visitors from India to stay in the country for up to 60 days, with the option of extending the stay by an additional 30 days after permission from the local immigration office.</p>

<p>Indian tourists can travel to Thailand without the hassle of a visa application.</p>

<p>The visa-free entry policy, introduced on November 10 last year, was to end on May 10. Later, the Thai government extended the temporary tourist visa exemption scheme from May 11 to November 11.</p>

<p><strong>What does visa-free travel mean?</strong></p>

<p>The visa-free travel allows an individual to enter the country without a visa before or upon arrival. With such a scheme, tourists can simply travel to the country with a valid passport, which they have to show at the immigration counter upon arrival.</p>

<p>For Indian tourists, Thailand is among the top visa-free destinations.</p>

<p>In the first three months of 2024, Thailand recorded 9.4 million foreign tourists, who contributed an estimated 454.6 billion baht ($12.4 billion) to its economy in spending, Thailand's tourism ministry earlier said.</p>

<p>Further, the country aims for a record 40 million tourists this year, nearing its pre-pandemic high in 2019.</p>

<p>Thailand welcomed nearly 1.64 million Indian tourists until October this year, making India its third-largest source of international visitors after Malaysia and China.</p>

<p>The Tourism Authority of Thailand expects the number of Indian visitors to cross the 2 million mark by the end of this year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bella Bradford, a 24-year-old Australian TikTok influencer who was battling a rare form of cancer, announced her own death in her final social media post. According to <em>ABC News</em>, the TikToker died last month on October 15 after battling a rare form of jaw cancer called rhabdomyosarcoma. She shared one last ‘Get Ready With Me' video on TikTok weeks after her death on October 31. At the end of the caption read a note that said she died “peacefully surrounded by the people she loves most”.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 24-year-old often shared videos of her outfits and get-ready routines. In her final video, she expressed her gratitude to her fans for their support. "I have terminal cancer and unfortunately, by now, my life has come to an end, and I've passed away. But I wanted to do one final 'Get Ready With Me' because I love doing these, and I love fashion. Thank you for following me on this fun journey, and yeah, I hope that you can look back on all my videos and find a little bit of joy in your day if you ever need a pick-me-up,” she said, per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Wellness/tiktoker-bella-bradford-announces-death-final-video-cancer/story?id=115487036" rel="noindex, nofollow">outlet</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Bradford went on to remind her followers about cherishing each moment in life. "Remember that you live every day, and you only die once, so make every day count," she continued.</p>

<p>“Thank you guys so much for this wild and wonderful ride. I hope you all have beautiful, amazing lives. I wish all the best for every single one of you,” the 24-year-old concluded the video.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Bradford previously revealed that she had been diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma in 2021.&nbsp;She shared her diagnosis with her TikTok followers just six months before her death.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She revealed that she went through a year of treatment, including radiotherapy, chemotherapy, fertility procedures and multiple surgeries to remove the tumour and reconstruct her jaw. She also shared that she entered a period of “intermission” with her cancer, but about 10 days before a planned trip to Europe with friends, she learned the cancer had returned.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the Cleveland Clinic, rhabdomyosarcoma is a rare soft tissue cancer. It develops when immature muscle cells mutate, becoming cancerous cells that multiply and create tumours. Sometimes, treatment can cure rhabdomyosarcoma. This is called remission, which means that you don't have symptoms and tests don't detect signs of cancer. In many cases, remission is permanent, however, in some cases, rhabdomyosarcoma can return.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the final phase of the US elections gets underway, Republican candidate Donald Trump intensified his campaign efforts with three major rallies -- two in North Carolina and one in Virginia -- urging voters to turn out on November 5, the election day.</p>

<p>Following the rallies, Trump shared a video on X, writing, "Three beautiful MAGA RALLIES today in Gastonia, North Carolina, followed by Salem, Virginia -- and this evening in Greensboro, North Carolina!"</p>

<p>He further encouraged supporters to "stand up and tell Kamala that you've had enough," adding, "Kamala Harris, You're Fired!"</p>

<p>On Saturday, Trump projected confidence as he addressed crowds in the battleground state, stressing his strong position while urging voters to show up on Election Day.</p>

<p>"When you're winning by a lot, you could still lose by a little," he remarked. "And we can't take a chance of losing the great state of North Carolina. We're not going to lose the great state of North Carolina."</p>

<p>In Gastonia, North Carolina, Trump cautioned that "the suburbs are under attack."</p>

<p>Later, at a rally in Salem, Virginia, Trump spoke to a crowd of thousands, promising to usher in a new era of "peace and prosperity" for the country. He also continued his criticism of Harris, labelling her a "liberal Left radical."</p>

<p>While in Salem, Trump also addressed a recent case involving a trans woman who had been permitted to join Roanoke College's women's swim team, claiming that seven swim team members met him backstage before he invited them on stage.</p>

<p>Swimmer Lily Mullens criticised current policies, saying, "Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have advocated for and pushed for this anti-woman sex-based discrimination to continue all over this country."</p>

<p>She added, "We are so lucky to have a leader like Donald Trump with common sense," while thanking him for "standing with women."</p>

<p>During his rally in Gastonia, North Carolina, Trump highlighted the recent slowdown in job growth, with employers adding only 12,000 jobs in October—the lowest rate since 2020. Blaming what he termed "Kamala's economy," he promised to address the issue if elected.</p>

<p>Staying on theme, Trump targeted immigration as another priority, describing open borders as the "biggest issue." He pledged sweeping tax cuts and policy shifts, stating, "I will massively cut taxes. I will cut taxes for workers and small businesses, and we will have no tax on tips."</p>

<p>On immigration, he outlined his plans for mass deportations, saying, "When I'm president, we're going to evict the illegals, and we'll take back our properties."</p>

<p>Linking Harris to Biden's record, Trump added, "Kamala says she would not do one thing differently from crooked Joe Biden, which itself is disqualifying."</p>

<p>Trump's campaign will continue Sunday with an event in Kinston, North Carolina, as he maintains a busy schedule in other battleground states, including Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Georgia.</p>

<p>With 272 electoral college votes needed to secure the presidency, Trump is working to lock in support.</p>

<p>In his address, Trump also claimed that elections in blue states like California and New York are compromised, alleging that election officials would face execution if they asked for voter ID.</p>

<p>"If we had an honest election in California, we would win California," he added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Khalistanis may be trying to drive a wedge between Hindus and Sikhs in Canada and hoping that this division spills into India, Indian-origin Canadian politician Ujjal Dev Dosanjh has said. Speaking to NDTV in an exclusive interview, the former Canadian MP and minister said the political class in Canada is in slumber as far as Khalistani violence is concerned and law enforcement authorities leave a lot to be desired.</p>

<p>The veteran leader's remarks come shortly after a Khalistani mob attacked a Hindu temple in Canada's Brampton, where a consular camp was being held to help Canadian and Indian citizens who need life certificates for claiming pension in India.</p>

<p>The attack took place against the backdrop of the frosty relationship between India and Canada. Ties between New Delhi and Ottawa are at an all-time low after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused India of engineering the assassination of Khalistani terrorist and Canadian citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar. India has trashed the allegations.</p>

<p>Mr Dosanjh described the Brampton temple incident as "unfortunate, unacceptable and condemnable". He said Khalistani violence has been an issue in Canada for a long time. "It had died down for a while, but with (Justin) Trudeau's arrival, it has raised its ugly head again," he said.</p>

<p>The 77-year-old, born in Punjab's Jalandhar district, said these incidents are not isolated. "Khalistanis have been doing violence against other Sikhs in their temples for a long time. The government and law enforcement haven't paid much attention. It has spilled over into Hindu temples, partly because consular officers were there.</p>

<p>"Maybe it's a plan of Khalistanis to try and drive a wedge between Sikhs and Hindus that have lived here peacefully as they have in India. Their effort is to sow some division and carry that division into India. That's their hope because they want to dismember the country," Mr Dosanjh said.</p>

<p>The political class of Canada, he said, was in slumber over these issues. "They have not condemned Khalistani violence, not named it, not called it out. Even the denunciations that have come from three leaders now don't mention Khalistanis, it seems these guys came from somewhere up in the sky," he said.</p>

<p>Responding to the attack on the temple, Justin Trudeau said in a post, "The acts of violence at the Hindu Sabha Mandir in Brampton today are unacceptable. Every Canadian has the right to practice their faith freely and safely. Thank you to the Peel Regional Police for swiftly responding to protect the community and investigate this incident."</p>

<p>Asked if Trudeau was in denial about Khalistani violence, Mr Dosanjh said, "Don't think Trudeau is in denial, he knows what is happening, Khalistanis were in his cabinet, he knows what he is doing. I think he is doing it, because 'why make enemies', even if you have thousand votes... Khalistanis, why make them angry."</p>

<p>Mr Dosanjh said the Conservative Party, the Opposition in Canada, is following the same playbook. He cited the office of Opposition leader Pierre Poilievre canceling its Diwali event.</p>

<p>"There is no mainstream political figure (in Canada) who can stand up and say that Khalistani hate does not belong in this country. (Gurpatwant Singh) Pannu called for the expulsion of Hindus from Canada. Do you believe that if someone asked for the expulsion of Jews, he wouldn't be prosecuted and investigated?" Mr Dosanjh asked.</p>

<p>Mr Dosanjh, who was a Liberal Party MP and Canada's Health Minister, said people from both Hindu and Sikh communities attended the consular camp that was targeted by the mob. "The Consular officers were not there just to help Hindus, they were helping all Indians."</p>

<p>He said the rising Khalistani violence has led to fear in the Sikh community as well and "moderates have simply walked away".</p>]]></content:encoded>

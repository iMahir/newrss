       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Defence Minister Rajnath Singh will be on a four-day visit to the US beginning Friday to further boost the comprehensive global strategic partnership between the two countries.</p>

<p>In Washington, Rajnath Singh will hold talks with Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan among others.</p>

<p>India's plan to procure 31 MQ-9B Predator drones, the proposed joint manufacturing of Stryker infantry combat vehicles and co-production of GE F414 engines in India are likely to figure prominently in Singh's talks with Austin, officials said today.</p>

<p>"The visit is expected to further deepen and broaden the India-US Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership," the defence ministry said announcing Singh's trip to the US from August 23 to 26.</p>

<p>"The visit comes in the backdrop of the growing momentum in India-US relations and defence engagements at multiple levels," it said.</p>

<p>Rajnath Singh will also chair a high-level round-table meeting with the US defence industry on the ongoing and future defence collaborations. He will also interact with the Indian community during the visit.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Daniela Larreal Chirinos, one of Venezuela's best-known athletes and five-time Olympian, has been found dead at her Las Vegas apartment. The retired cyclist reportedly choked on her food, police said.</p>

<p>When Ms&nbsp;Chirinos did not turn up at the Las Vegas hotel where she worked, she was checked on and her body was found at her apartment, according to FOX Sports. The 50-year-old is believed to have died on August 11.</p>

<h3><strong>Who Was Daniela&nbsp;Larreal Chirinos?</strong></h3>

<p>One of the finest athletes ever to represent Venezuela, Daniela Larreal Chirinos is a two-time gold medalist in the Pan American Games and the Pan American Championships. Ms&nbsp;Chirinos featured in five Olympics editions.</p>

<p>She made her Olympics debut in Barcelona way back in 1992 and participated in four Olympic events -- Atlanta (1996), Sydney (2000), Athens (2004) and London (2012). She also clinched two gold medals at the Central American and Caribbean Games in San Salvador, 2002.</p>

<p>Apart from a storied career in cycling, Ms&nbsp;Chirinos was also active in Venezuelan politics. A vocal critic of former Venezuelan leader Hugo Chávez, the Olympian accused the late president and his sports minister Hector Rodriguez of funneling money out of the country in the name of sponsoring a "non-existent" racing driver.</p>

<p>In 2013, upon Nicolás Maduro's arrival at the helm in Venezuela, Ms&nbsp;Chirinos called his presidency a dictatorship. She was forced into exile and banned from entering Venezuela. Before moving to Las Vegas where she worked as a food server, Ms&nbsp;Chirinos was an Uber driver in Miami.</p>

<h3><strong>How did she die?</strong></h3>

<p>While the “cause and method” of her death was still under investigation, police suspected she died from asphyxiation after they reportedly found solid food remains in her windpipe, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/20/daniela-larreal-chirinos-olympian-dead">The Guardian</a> reported.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the Clark County Coroner's Office said an official cause of death was still pending.</p>

<p>The Comité Olímpico Venezolano (Venezuelan Olympic Committee) shared on X a heartfelt tribute with a picture of Ms&nbsp;Chirinos holding a medal.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The adult film star was found dead in her New Mexico home on March 1.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Six months after adult film star Sophia Leone's death, the official cause has been revealed. According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/04/18/porn-star-sophia-leone-death-mom-suicidal-thoughts-drinking-police-report/">TMZ</a>, the 26-year-old's death was accidental, resulting from a drug overdose. Notably, Ms Leone's body was found in her New Mexico home on March 1, with police initially deeming her death "suspicious" and "unique".</p>

<p>Her mother had previously disclosed to a detective that Ms Leone struggled with alcohol dependency and had suicidal thoughts. The investigation has now concluded that Leone's death was an accidental overdose, bringing closure to the case. However, it's not clear which substances she had ingested.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The news of her death first came to light when Ms Leone's stepfather Mike Romero sought funds for her memorial on <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/sophia-leones-memorial-fund">GoFundMe.</a></p>

<p>''The sudden loss of Sophia has left her family and friends devastated and in shock.&nbsp;Sophia was a beloved daughter, sister, granddaughter, niece and friend. She had a deep love for all animals, specifically her three pets. She enjoyed travelling and always found ways to make everyone around her smile'', Mr Romero wrote on the fundraising page.</p>

<p>Ms Leone was born on June 10, 1997, in Miami in the US. She reportedly entered the adult entertainment industry at the age of 18 and was said to have a net worth north of $1 million. She was associated with the modelling agency 101 and starred in more than 80 films, according to her IMDB page.</p>

<p>&nbsp;In her last post before death, Ms Leone told her fans to "go outside and just appreciate life a little extra".&nbsp;</p>

<p>She sent a heartfelt note to her 300,000 Instagram fans in September. "Go outside and just appreciate life a little extra today," the 26-year-old captioned a picture, where she posed wearing white sunglasses and a white handbag thrown over her shoulder while flashing the peace sign to the camera.&nbsp;</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Former United States First Lady Michelle Obama, 60, turned back the clock Tuesday at the Democratic convention in Chicago, delivering a passionate speech in support of Kamala Harris and ripping into Donald Trump, the Republican pick.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former United States First Lady <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/michelle-obama" target="_blank">Michelle Obama</a>, 60, turned back the clock Tuesday at the Democratic convention in Chicago, delivering a passionate speech in support of "my girl"&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/kamala-harris" target="_blank">Kamala Harris</a> for November's presidential election and warning <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/donald-trump" target="_blank">Donald Trump</a>&nbsp;"hope is making a comeback".</p>

<p>Ms Obama's speeches helped propel her husband, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/barack-obama" target="_blank">Barack Obama</a>, to two consecutive terms, and who was widely spoken of as a potential presidential candidate herself, particularly early this year as the Democrats struggled to rally behind a single nominee to replace Joe Biden. And in Chicago last night she brought all of that considerable charisma to bear, and the measure of her popularity was underlined by receiving a welcome bigger than that which greeted Mr Obama in his hometown.</p>

<p>Among the highlights of Ms Obama's speech was her leaning into Kamala Harris' background, highlighting her multi-racial origin as "the embodiment of stories we speak about (in) this country. "Her story is your story. It is my story," she said, in response to jibes by Donald Trump.</p>

<h3><strong>Michelle Slams Trump's "Misogynistic Lies"</strong></h3>

<p>The Trump campaign has attempted to weaponise Ms Harris' racial identity; a tactic perhaps best epitomised by Mr Trump's "<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://theconversation.com/us-election-2024-how-trump-and-vance-are-trying-to-weaponise-kamala-harriss-multiracial-identity-236521" target="_blank">I didn't know she was Black... till she happened to 'turn Black'</a> and now she wants to be known as 'Black'" swipe at Ms Harris (to a Black reporter) last month.</p>

<p>Michelle Obama's counterattacks last night were brief but packed a punch, and included a sarcastic dig at the twice-impeached former President for running for "one of those Black jobs".</p>

<p>"We know folks are going to do everything to distort her truth."</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">Barack and Michelle Obama led the Democrats' charge in Chicago Tuesday night.</p>
</div>

<p>"For years Trump did everything to make people fear us (referring to Mr Obama and herself). His narrow view of the world made him feel threatened by two highly successful and educated people who happened to be Black... who is going to tell him the job he is seeking is now one of those 'Black jobs'?" she said accusing Mr Trump of "ugly, misogynistic, (and) racist lies".</p>

Biden Blasts Trump In Fiery Speech</a></p>

<p>Switching focus to Ms Harris, Michelle Obama said, "The steel of her spine... the steadiness of her upbringing, and the joy and light of her laughter... Kamala knows that regardless of where you come from, who you worship, or what you look like... you deserve a decent life."</p>

<p>"No one has a monopoly on what it means to be an American."</p>

<p>"America, hope is making a comeback," she said.</p>

<h3><strong>"Kamala Has Proven Her Allegiance"</strong></h3>

<p>Ms Obama also drew similarities between herself and the Vice President.</p>

<p>"Kamala Harris and I built our lives (on) the same values. Our mothers shared the same beliefs in the promise of this country. That's why hers moved here from India... that is why she taught Kamala about justice. She told her daughter, 'don't sit around and complain, do something'."</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">US Vice President Kamala Harris is the Democrats' pick for the 2024 presidential race.</p>

<p>"So, Kamala went out and she worked hard fighting for people, for better wages and cheaper drugs. From a middle-class household Kamala worked her way up to become Vice President. My girl, Kamala Harris, is more than ready for this moment," she declared.</p>

<p>Underlining Ms Harris' credentials in the face of attacks by the Trump campaign, Ms Obama said Ms Harris had "shown her allegiance... not by spewing anger but by living a life of service."</p>

<p>"Let us not forget what we are up against... Kamala and Tim (Walz, Governor of Minnesota and Ms Harris' VP pick) are doing good now but remember... there are still so many people ready to criticise every move Kamala makes..." Ms Obama said. "We must do everything in our power to elect these two bighearted, good people. There is no other choice than Kamala and Tim."</p>

<h3><strong>"Still Only Human"</strong></h3>

<p>Ms Obama also sought to buy the Harris campaign an extended honeymoon and a shield from future attacks by Donald Trump, warning Democrat delegates, supporters, and voters that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz "are still only human... they are not perfect... will make mistakes."</p>

<p>"It is up to us to be the anecdote to the darkness and division. I don't care how you identify politically... this is our time to stand up for basic freedoms and humanity. This is going to be an uphill battle (and) we cannot be our own worst enemies," Ms Obama said to deafening cheers.</p>

<h3><strong>"Yes, She Can", Barack's War Cry</strong></h3>

<p>Meanwhile, Barack Obama tweaked the 'Yes, We Can' war cry from his 2008 campaign and delivered another rousing endorsement of Kamala Harris. Mr Obama formally endorsed Ms Harris as the Democrat nominee last month, telling her "this is going to be historic".</p>

<p>On Tuesday the former president launched a scathing attack on Donald Trump, labelling him "a 78-year-old billionaire who has not stopped whining about his problems since he rode down his golden elevator nine years ago", and accusing him of divisive politics.</p>

<p>"Trump wants us to think this country is divided between 'us' and 'them'. Between 'real' Americans who support him and the 'outsiders'. It is the oldest trick in politics. His act has gotten stale. We do not need four more years of chaos as we have seen that movie before and we know the sequel is usually worse," he said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sam Altman-led OpenAI on Tuesday announced a multi-year partnership with Condé Nast to display content from its brands such as the Vogue and the New Yorker within the AI startup's products, including ChatGPT and SearchGPT prototype.</p>

<p>Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p>

<p>OpenAI has signed similar deals with the Time magazine, Financial Times, Business Insider-owner Axel Springer, France's Le Monde and Spain's Prisa Media over the past few months.</p>

<p>While these content partnerships are essential for training artificial intelligence models, some media organizations such as the New York Times and the Intercept had sued the Microsoft-backed firm over copyright issues associated with their works.</p>

<p>Brad Lightcap, chief operating officer at OpenAI, said the company is committed to working with Condé Nast and other news publishers to "ensure that as AI plays a larger role in news discovery and delivery, it maintains accuracy, integrity and respect for quality reporting".</p>

<p>News and digital media have faced steep challenges over the last decade as many technology companies eroded publishers' ability to monetize content, Roger Lynch, CEO of Condé Nast, said in a memo to employees.</p>

<p>"Our partnership with OpenAI begins to make up for some of that revenue," Lynch said.</p>

<p>OpenAI launched its AI-powered search engine SearchGPT in July, with real-time access to information from the internet, into a territory long dominated by Google.</p>

<p>The company said on Tuesday it was collaborating with its news partners to collect feedback and insights on the design and performance of SearchGPT.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Politicians in this country could be fined up to 5 per cent of their salary or suspended from the Parliament for bad behaviour under new government workplace laws.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australian politicians could be fined up to 5 per cent of their salary or suspended from the Parliament for bad behaviour under new government workplace laws.</p>

<p>The governing Labor Party on Wednesday introduced new legislation to establish an Independent Parliamentary Standards Commission (IPSC) to crack down on politicians and staff who engage in bad behaviour, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>The IPSC will have the power to enforce behaviour codes, conduct workplace investigations, and impose sanctions on elected members of both houses of the Parliament, their staff, and other employees in parliamentary workplaces.</p>

<p>If serious misconduct is found to have been perpetrated by a current or former politician, the commission can recommend that they be fined up to five per cent of their annual base salary or suspended from the Parliament.</p>

<p>The IPSC was first proposed in 2021 in a report from the government's Sex Discrimination Commissioner that found 33 per cent of people working in Commonwealth Parliamentary workplaces (CPWs) had experienced at least one incident of sexual harassment and 37 per cent had been subjected to bullying.</p>

<p>The landmark Set the Standard report was commissioned after former government staffer Brittany Higgins went public in February 2021 with allegations that she was raped by a colleague in Parliament House in March 2019.</p>

<p>A federal court judge ruled in April 2024 that Higgins was raped by fellow political staffer Bruce Lehrmann.</p>

<p>"The 2021 Set the Standard report laid bare the serious issues of bullying, sexual harassment and sexual assault at Parliamentary workplaces," Katy Gallagher, the Minister for Finance, Minister for Women and Minister for the Public Service, said in a statement on Wednesday.</p>

<p>"We've been working hard to put the systems in place so that people can raise workplace complaints, and when complaints are substantiated, that both staff and parliamentarians are held to account for their behaviour."</p>

<p>In cases where alleged behaviour would constitute criminal conduct, the IPSC would be allowed to investigate but any finding would not be one of criminal guilt.</p>

<p>For allegations of sexual assault, it would only be investigated if the complainants consented.</p>

<p>The whole process will be confidential but if the commissioners recommend sanctions against an elected representative it is likely to be made public.<br />

<p>Democratic organisers are inundated with Indian American youth "coming out of the woodwork" to support <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/kamala-harris-thanks-biden-in-surprise-speech-on-day-1-of-democratic-event-827761">Kamala Harris</a>. Rajeev Bhateja, co-founder of the group They See Blue, which mobilises South Asian American voters, points to a spike in volunteer signups to canvas for the Democratic Presidential nominee. "High school and college students are reaching out. It's way more than even Obama, Biden and Clinton years," he says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The leader of They See Blue's youth chapter, Akash Borde, observed that the tide turned when President Joe Biden stepped out of the race. "Kamala's nomination after Biden decided not to rerun raised a lot more excitement among my peers," he says. "With the media narratives around Biden's age and foreign policy issues, we were struggling to bring young people in. Now, my phone is blowing away. The momentum is unprecedented in the South Asian community," says Harini Krishnan, Co-director of the group South Asians for Harris.</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-presidential-polls-2024-national-democratic-convetion-day-2-live-roll-call-today-to-select-kamala-harris-as-democratic-candidate-6381127">Also Read |&nbsp;"Yes She Can": Barack Obama Tweaks 2008 Campaign Slogan For Kamala Harris</a></strong></p>

<p>Hundreds of volunteers across the country have been knocking on doors, running phone banks, and writing postcards to bring out voters for Harris. It's not only her shared heritage but also her "better speeches" compared to Biden that make her resonate with Indian-American supporters. Young voters find her campaign "uplifting", with "hope and positivity" for a "bright" White House amidst the "doom and gloom" that Donald Trump's rhetoric represents for many.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Biden's Campaign "Lacked Urgency"</strong></h2>

<p>A July 2024 voter survey has shown Asian-American support for Biden has declined since 2020. His 15-point margin this year contrasts with the nearly 30-point edge he held over Trump during the last Presidential election cycle. The campaign, some say, lacked the "urgency" seen in 2020. "A complacency had set in. Kamala jumping into this race has transformed the landscape," says Krishnan.</p>

<p>According to Sangay Mishra, the author of the book <em>Desis Divided: The Political Lives of South Asian Americans</em> and Associate Professor of Political Science at Drew University, there is palpable change among people who were feeling hesitant after Biden's performance in the debate. "They are much more connected now. The broader trend seems that at the minimum, we will see the kind of support for Harris that we saw for Biden in 2020, probably even more," he says. That may not be entirely off the mark given the robust mobilisation for Harris: crowded rallies, young supporters offering free catchy videos on social media, a 9,000-strong 'South Asian Women for Harris' fundraiser followed by the formation of South Asian Men for Harris (the campaign raised $36 million within 24 hours after she picked Governor Tim Walz to be her vice-presidential candidate), merchandise fashioned around the viral meme 'Lotus for POTUS'.</p>

<h2><strong>Wooing Loyal Republicans Won't Be Easy</strong></h2>

<p>Yet, for all the enthusiasm, shared roots haven't been enough to convert many Republican supporters. Sure, Harris's Indian-American identity does strike a chord with the community, but it may not translate to votes beyond her party.</p>

<p>According to a census survey, Indian Americans are the largest population among Asian Americans in the US. Their votes are critical in narrowly fought elections. But they're not a monolithic voter bloc. Except for a small group, 'Haley Supporters for Harris', which staunchly backed Republican Nikki Haley during her Presidential primary and continues to hold an anti-Trump stance (despite Haley having endorsed Donald Trump), other Republican supporters have largely not switched to Harris.</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/hillary-clinton-praises-kamala-harris-joe-biden-at-2024-democratic-convention-slams-donald-trump-6374851">Also Read |&nbsp;"Kamala Harris Won't Rest, Trump Slept At His Trial": Hillary Clinton</a></strong></p>

<p>"One hundred per cent I support President Trump! I am not voting for Kamala Harris," says Florida-based hotelier Danny Gaekwad, who has raised funds for all Republican presidential candidates since George W. Bush. Issues that matter to him are border security, legal immigration, less government and lower taxes. Gaekwad thinks mere 'home country' affinity shouldn't shape the electoral decisions of immigrant voters. Local issues must define people's choices, he says. "Indians have this habit of finding links in common with prominent Indian Americans, seeking common relatives, uncles, aunties, ancestral villages! What kind of an obsession is that!"</p>

<p>Similarly, Republican fundraiser Pravina Kakodkar hopes that Trump will, as he promised, "drain the swamp in DC". She says, "We need a person who will shake Washington DC. It's become this exclusive class of people who are very disconnected from the rest of the country. I want this smashed, and only Donald Trump has the capacity to do that." Kakodkar's children, on the other hand, are Democrat supporters.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>On Being Indian Enough</strong></h2>

<p>Some Republicans believe that Harris downplays her Indian identity - something Trump has also commented on. "Kamala Harris has always projected herself as a black woman. I have never heard her say once that she's Indian," says Gaekwad. In her autobiography though, Harris has spoken openly about her Indian roots, her Indian grandparents and growing up biracial in California.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then there are others who feel that Harris didn't do enough for the community as Vice-President. California-based independent voter Pushpita Prasad, an advocate for the rights of Hindus, acknowledges that Harris's background does create a "certain strong pull of representation", but issues are a priority, she stresses. "It's ironic that the situation of Indian Americans in terms of the immigration process and visas has become so bad. We've had a South Asian person in the office during which we have seen attacks on Hindu temples in the US, even in her home state of California. I really wish for Vice President Harris to condemn those temple attacks and to condemn the violence happening against Bangladeshi Hindus."&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>The Israel-Gaza Blot On Democrats</strong></h2>

<p>There are also Indian Americans who find themselves being single-issue voters in this presidential election. They don't support Trump and his far-right 'Project 2025' agenda, but, at the same time, view America's handling of the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/kamala-harris-says-israel-has-right-to-defend-itself-against-hezbollah-6227644">Israel-Palestine</a> conflict as a stain on the Biden-Harris administration. Zainab Hakim, who stands strongly for US divestment from Israel, was at a recent Harris rally in Detroit with a group of protesters, seeking accountability and demanding a ceasefire. But Harris responded to Hakim's slogans by saying that they should let her speak unless they wanted "Donald Trump to win".</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/opinion/kamala-harris-to-rishi-sunak-indians-must-be-realistic-about-the-rise-of-indian-origin-leaders-6117384">Also Read | Why Indians Must Be Realistic About The Rise Of Indian-Origin Leaders Abroad</a></strong></p>

<p>Referring to the incident, Hakim says, "She's saying, 'I'm absolutely better than this guy', even while continuing to fund a genocide. She has been the Vice-President for three years. We are set on not voting for somebody that will continue to allow the genocide." For Hakim and others like her, Harris's gender and race credentials mean little against such discontents. "I think it doesn't mean anything for somebody to be a woman, or a black woman or an Indian American in power if they're continuing to sanction the murder of people abroad," says Hakim, who has been at the forefront of student protests at the University of Michigan.</p>

<p>Experts note that the Isral-Gaza conflict continues to be a concern among some communities. "There is a lot of pushback among younger people within the Indian American community also. Numerous campuses have South Asian American students who were involved in protests, Muslims particularly," says Mishra.</p>

<h2><strong>Can Kamala Create History?</strong></h2>

<p>Indian Americans do not vote as a bloc; a range of opinions shape their choices. Even so, an AAPI Data survey from July 2024 shows that the majority of them - 55 % - identified as or leaned towards the Democratic Party, while 26% identified or leaned Republican. This is significant because in many of America's battleground states where no single party dominates, the Presidential elections come down to the wire. In the last few election cycles, narrow victory margins in such states have made the Asian-American vote critical, and this is why Indian-Americans are being courted by both parties this time.</p>

<p>Harris will thus have to pull in the undecided and independent voters to come out on top. If she wins this November, she will be the first woman, the first Black woman and the first South Asian American to hold America's highest office. A large section of Indian American voters naturally wish to play a part in creating this history.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 28 Pakistani pilgrims travelling to Iraq for a Shiite Muslim ritual were killed as their bus crashed in central Iran, state media reported early Wednesday.</p>

<p>"A bus carrying 51 Pakistani pilgrims overturned and caught fire in front of Dehshir-Taft checkpoint in the central province of Yazd on Tuesday night," state television reported.</p>

<p>"28 people have been killed and 23 injured so far with the possibility of the death count increasing," it added.</p>

<p>Yazd province crisis management chief Ali Malek-zadeh told the broadcaster that some of the injured were in critical condition.</p>

<p>"Of the 23 injured, six have already been discharged from hospital, while the condition of seven others is critical," Malek-zadeh said.</p>

<p>"The dead consisted of 11 women and 17 men," he added.</p>

<p>The Pakistani pilgrims were headed through Iran to Iraq to attend the Arbaeen commemoration, one of the biggest events of the Shiite calendar which marks the 40th day of mourning for Imam Hussein, the grandson of the Prophet Mohammed.</p>

<p>Last year, some 22 million pilgrims attended the commemoration in the Iraqi shrine city of Karbala, where Hussein and his brother Abbas are buried, according to official figures.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We hear a lot about women's biological clock and how age affects the chance of pregnancy.</p>

<p><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2821811#google_vignette">New research shows</a> men's fertility is also affected by age. When dads are over 50, the risk of pregnancy complications increases.</p>

<p>Data from more than 46 million births in the <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2821811#google_vignette">United States</a> between 2011 and 2022 compared fathers in their 30s with fathers in their 50s.</p>

<p>While taking into account the age of the mother and other factors known to affect pregnancy outcomes, the researchers found every ten-year increase in paternal age was linked to more complications.</p>

<p>The researchers found that compared to couples where the father was aged 30–39, for couples where the dad was in his 50s, there was a:</p>

<ul>
	<li>16% increased risk of preterm birth</li>
	<li>14% increased risk of low birth weight</li>
	<li>13% increase in gestational diabetes.</li>
</ul>

<p>The older fathers were also twice as likely to have used assisted reproductive technology, including IVF, to conceive than their younger counterparts.</p>

<h2>Dads are getting older</h2>

<p>In this <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2821811#google_vignette">US study</a>, the mean age of all fathers increased from 30.8 years in 2011 to 32.1 years in 2022.</p>

<p>In that same period, the proportion of men aged 50 years or older fathering a child increased from 1.1% to 1.3%.</p>

<p>We don't know the proportion of men over 50 years who father children in Australia, but data shows the average age of fathers has increased.</p>

<p>In 1975 the <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/population/births-australia/latest-release">median age of Australian dads</a> was 28.6 years. This jumped to 33.7 years in 2022.</p>

<h2>How male age affects getting pregnant</h2>

<p>As we know from <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/celebrities-dads-first-time-over-age-50#when-he-was-54-simon-cowell-and-girlfriend-lauren-silverman-became-parents-to-their-son-eric-7">media reports</a> of celebrity dads, men produce sperm from puberty throughout life and can father children well into old age.</p>

<p>However, there is a noticeable decline in <a href="https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(18)30269-3/fulltext">sperm quality</a> from about age 40.</p>

<p>Female partners of older men take longer to achieve pregnancy than those with younger partners.</p>

<p>A study of the effect of male age on <a href="https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(03)00366-2/fulltext">time to pregnancy</a> showed women with male partners aged 45 or older were almost five times more likely to take more than a year to conceive compared to those with partners aged 25 or under. More than three quarters (76.8%) of men under the age of 25 years impregnated their female partners within six months, compared with just over half (52.9%) of men over the age of 45.</p>

<p>Pooled data from ten studies showed that partners of older men are also more likely to experience miscarriage. Compared to couples where the male was aged 25 to 29 years, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32358607/">paternal age over 45 years</a> increased the risk of miscarriage by 43%.</p>

<h2>Older men are more likely to need IVF</h2>

<p>Outcomes of assisted reproductive technology, such as IVF, are also influenced by the age of the male partner.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rbmo.2022.03.031">review of studies</a> in couples using assisted reproductive technologies found paternal age under 40 years reduced the risk of miscarriage by about 25% compared to couples with men aged over 40.</p>

<p>Having a male under 40 years also almost doubled the chance of a live birth per treatment cycle. With a man over 40, 17.6% of treatment rounds resulted in a live birth, compared to 28.4% when the male was under 40.</p>

<h2>How does male age affect the health outcomes of children?</h2>

<p>As a result of age-related changes in sperm DNA, the children of older fathers have increased risk of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9957550/">a number of conditions</a>. Autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorders and leukaemia have been linked to the father's advanced years.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(22)01979-3/fulltext">review of studies</a> assessing the impact of advanced paternal age reported that children of older fathers have increased rates of psychiatric disease and behavioural impairments.</p>

<p>But while the increased risk of adverse health outcomes linked to older paternal age is real, the magnitude of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29471389/">the effect is modest</a>. It's important to remember that an increase in a very small risk is still a small risk and most children of older fathers are born healthy and develop well.</p>

<h2>Improving your health can improve your fertility</h2>

<p>In addition to the effects of older age, some chronic conditions that affect fertility and reproductive outcomes become more common as men get older. They include <a href="https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(23)01935-0/fulltext">obesity and diabetes</a> which affect sperm quality by lowering testosterone levels.</p>

<p>While we can't change our age, some lifestyle factors that increase the risk of pregnancy complications and reduce fertility, can be tackled. They include:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4639396/">smoking</a></li>
	<li>recreational <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/tre.414">drug taking</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/tre.414">anabolic steroid</a> use</li>
	<li>heavy <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5504800/">alcohol consumption</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Get the facts about the male biological clock</h2>

<p>Research shows <a href="https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/23/4/458/3065332?login=false">men want children</a> as much as women do. And most men want at least two children.</p>

<p>Yet most men <a href="https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/23/4/458/3065332?login=false">lack knowledge</a> about the limitations of female and male fertility and overestimate the chance of getting pregnant, with and without assisted reproductive technologies.</p>

<p>We need better public education, starting at school, to improve awareness of the impact of male and female age on reproductive outcomes and help people have healthy babies.</p>

<p>For men wanting to improve their chance of conceiving, the government-funded sites <a href="https://healthymale.org.au/">Healthy Male</a> and <a href="https://www.yourfertility.org.au/">Your Fertility</a> are a good place to start.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The release dates for new episodes of the "Call of Duty" and "Borderlands" video games were announced Tuesday at the opening of the Gamescom showcase.</p>

<p>The announcements set the scene for the leading international video game show that opens to the public in Cologne on Thursday for four days and is expected to draw more than 350,000 visitors.</p>

<p>The launch of the Borderlands 4 game in 2025 was one of the surprises of the opening night show. The games producers promised that players would "blast their way through hordes of enemies" in the latest version of the game that was adapted for cinema this year.</p>

<p>"Call of Duty: Black Ops 6" will be released on October 25. The latest in the series is set in the 1990s with a security team on a mission to target a senator and gain access to a top-secret site in Washington.</p>

<p>"Deadpool" film maker Tim Miller announced that his new "Secret Level" series based on several video games would be released on Amazon Prime in December. "It is our love letter to games," he said.</p>

<p>Another industry veteran Peter Molyneux said his latest project would be "Masters of Albion". Molyneux made Populous in 1989 and Black and White in 2001 but has been more low-key in recent years with several projects cancelled.</p>

<p>Swedish firm Machinegames said that <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/indiana-jones-temple-of-doom-hat-sells-for-over-5-crores-6363901" target="_blank">"Indiana Jones</a> and the Great Circle" will be released on December 9. First announced for Xbox, the game will also come out on Playstation 5 next year, the company said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kenyan serial killer 'Vampire', who confessed to killing 42 women, including his wife, has escaped from police custody, authorities have reported. <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/kenyas-ted-bundy-who-killed-mutilated-42-women-including-his-wife-6151844 ">Collins Jumaisi Khalusha</a> was being held at a police station in Nairobi after his arrest in July after&nbsp;10 dismembered bodies and several body parts were discovered stuffed in plastic sacks in the Kware area.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Tuesday morning, the 33-year-old, along with 12 other inmates, escaped after cutting through wire mesh in their cells and scaling the perimeter wall, said Mohamed Amin, head of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This was a high-value suspect who was to face serious charges. We are investigating the incident and will take action accordingly," Mr Amin told AP. He described the incident as "unfortunate".</p>

<p>Khalusha confessed to luring, murdering and mutilating 42 women, including his wife, between 2022 and his arrest in July. He would put their body parts in plastic bags and dump them in a garbage dump. Police found evidence of his crimes at his residence. Among the objects recovered from him were a machete, gloves and nylon sacks.</p>

<p>Detectives also found mobile phones and identity cards belonging to the victims. The evidence suggested a calculated and planned approach to the killings, earning him the nickname "Kenyan Ted Bundy" due to the similarities with the infamous American serial killer.</p>

<p>Forensic examination of the bodies revealed gruesome details. Dr Johansen Oduor, a government pathologist, reported that most bags contained severed limbs and torsos, with only one body found intact. None of the victims had bullet wounds, but one was strangled. DNA analysis has identified two victims, while many remain unidentified due to advanced decomposition.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Khalusha was described as a "psychopathic serial killer with no respect for human life."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Khalusha's lawyer has maintained his client's innocence, claiming he was tortured and forced to confess. Two other suspects arrested in connection with the case will return to court on August 26.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world's oldest person, Spain's Maria Branyas Morera, who was born in the United States and lived through two world wars, died Tuesday at the age of 117, her family said.</p>

<p>Guinness World Records had officially acknowledged Branyas's status as the world's oldest person in January 2023 following the death of French nun Lucile Randon aged 118.</p>

<p>"Maria Branyas has left us. She died as she wished: in her sleep, peacefully and without pain," her family wrote on her account on social network X. "We will always remember her for her advice and her kindness."</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

“Un dia me n'aniré d'aquí. No tornaré a provar cafè, ni a menjar iogurt, ni a acaronar a la Fada..., deixaré també els meus records, les meves reflexions... ?</p>

<p>Branyas, who had lived for the last two decades in the Santa Maria del Tura nursing home in the town of Olot in the northeastern region of Catalonia, had warned in a post on Monday that she felt "weak".</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="ca">“I quan la meva veu calli amb la mort, el meu cor et seguirà parlant d'amor” (Tagore).<br />
Em sento feble. S'acosta l'hora. No ploreu, no m'agraden les llàgrimes. I sobre tot no patiu per mi. Ja em coneixeu, allà on vagi serè feliç, doncs d'alguna manera us portaré sempre amb mi.</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>"The time is near. Don't cry, I don't like tears. And above all, don't suffer for me. Wherever I go, I will be happy," she added on the account which is run by her family.</p>

<p>In the wake of Branyas's death, the oldest living person in the world is Japan's Tomiko Itooka, who was born on May 23, 1908 and is 116 years old, according to the US-based Gerontology Research Group.</p>

<p>Branyas, who lived through the 1918 flu, World War I and World War II and Spain's civil war, got Covid-19 in 2020 just weeks after ringing in her 113th birthday but made a full recovery.</p>

<h3><strong>'Endearing woman'</strong></h3>

<p>Her youngest daughter, Rosa Moret, once attributed her mother's longevity to "genetics".</p>

<p>"She has never gone to the hospital, she has never broken any bones, she is fine, she has no pain," Moret told regional Catalan television in 2023.</p>

<p>The head of the regional government of Catalonia, former health minister Salvador Illa, expressed his "heartfelt condolences" to Branyas's family in a message posted on X.</p>

<p>"We lose an endearing woman, who has taught us the value of life and the wisdom of the years," he said, calling her "Catalonia's grandmother".</p>

<p>Branyas was born in San Francisco on March 4, 1907 shortly after her family moved to the United States from Mexico.</p>

<p>The entire family decided to return to their native Spain in 1915 as World War I was under way, which complicated the ship voyage across the Atlantic.</p>

<p>The crossing was also marked by tragedy -- her father died from tuberculosis towards the end of the voyage, and his coffin was put into the sea.</p>

<h3><strong>'Completely lucid'</strong></h3>

<p>Branyas and her mother settled in Barcelona and in 1931 -- five years before the start of Spain's 1936-39 civil war -- she married a doctor.</p>

<p>The couple lived together for four decades until her husband died aged 72. She had three children, including one who has already died, 11 grandchildren and numerous great-grandchildren.</p>

<p>"I haven't done anything extraordinary, the only thing I did was live," Branyas told Catalan daily newspaper La Vanguardia in 2019.</p>

<p>Manel Esteller, part of a team of researchers from the University of Barcelona who studied Branyas's DNA to determine the source of her longevity told the daily Spanish newspaper ABC in October 2023 he was surprised by her good health.</p>

<p>"Her mind is completely lucid. She remembers with impressive clarity episodes from when she was only four years old, and she has no cardiovascular disease, which is common in the elderly. The only things she has are mobility and hearing problems. It's incredible," the genetics professor said.</p>

<p>The oldest verified person to have ever lived was Frenchwoman Jeanne Louise Calment who died in 1997 at the age of 122 years and 164 days old.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>Artificial intelligence company Anthropic has been hit with a class-action lawsuit in California federal court by three authors who say it misused their books and hundreds of thousands of others to train its AI-powered chatbot Claude.</p>

<p>The complaint, filed on Monday by writers and journalists Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson, said that Anthropic used pirated versions of their works and others to teach Claude to respond to human prompts.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Anthropic said on Tuesday that the company was aware of the lawsuit and assessing the complaint but declined to comment further, citing pending litigation. An attorney for the authors declined to comment.</p>

<p>The lawsuit joins several other high-stakes complaints filed by copyright holders including visual artists, news outlets and record labels over the material used by tech companies to train their generative artificial intelligence systems.</p>

<p>Separate groups of authors have sued OpenAI and Meta Platforms over the companies' alleged misuse of their work to train the large-language models underlying their chatbots.</p>

<p>The case filed Monday is the second against Anthropic following a lawsuit brought by music publishers last year over its alleged misuse of copyrighted song lyrics to train Claude.</p>

<p>The authors said in their complaint that Anthropic has "built a multibillion-dollar business by stealing hundreds of thousands of copyrighted books." Anthropic has drawn financial backing from sources including Amazon, Google and former cryptocurrency billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried.</p>

<p>According to the complaint, the authors' works were included in a dataset of pirated books that Anthropic used to train Claude.</p>

<p>The lawsuit requested an unspecified amount of monetary damages and an order permanently blocking Anthropic from misusing the authors' work.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Boeing has suspended flight testing of its new 777X wide-body jet after identifying the failure of a part connecting the engine to the body of the aircraft, the latest in a long line of quality control issues for the troubled US aerospace giant.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Boeing has suspended flight testing of its new 777X wide-body jet after identifying the failure of a part connecting the engine to the body of the aircraft, the latest in a long line of quality control issues for the troubled US aerospace giant.</p>

<p>"During scheduled maintenance, we identified a component that did not perform as designed," the US aerospace giant told AFP in a statement.</p>

<p>"Our team is replacing the part and capturing any learnings from the component and will resume flight testing when ready," it added, confirming an earlier report by specialist website The Air Current.</p>

<p>Boeing has been beset in recent years with concerns about safety and quality control, with a near-catastrophic incident on an Alaska Airlines <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/alaska-airlines-finds-many-loose-bolts-in-boeing-737-max-9-jets-4922057" target="_blank">Boeing 737 MAX</a> in January bringing renewed pressure on the company.</p>

<p>Boeing's new chief executive Kelly Ortberg, 64, took over earlier this month on a pledge to restore trust in the embattled manufacturer, and announced he would be based in Seattle to be close to the firm's commercial airplane programs.</p>

<h3><strong>Trouble in the family</strong></h3>

<p>Boeing's 777X widebody program, unveiled in November 2013, is the latest addition to its popular 777 family.</p>

<p>The new twin-aisle aircraft is destined to be the world's largest twin-engine jet in operation. More than 500 777X aircraft have already been ordered, but have yet to enter commercial service.</p>

<p>The part that brought about the suspension of flight testing is custom to the 777-9 model, and connects the engine to the aircraft structure, Boeing said.</p>

<p>The other 777-9s used for testing are all currently being inspected following the incident, it added.</p>

<p>Boeing's new aircraft will be available in three models: the 777-8, the 777-9 and the 777-8 cargo.</p>

<p>The aircraft's entry into service was originally scheduled for 2020, but due to problems during the certification process it has now been delayed to 2025.</p>

<p>Although the 777X has still not received the go-ahead from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Boeing did cross an important milestone in July this year.</p>

<p>Following a large number of test flights, it obtained permission to start testing the 777-9 with FAA representatives on board.</p>

<h3><strong>Orders rebound</strong></h3>

<p>Boeing named aerospace veteran <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/boeing-names-ex-aerospace-veteran-robert-kelly-ortberg-as-new-ceo-6234702" target="_blank">Kelly Ortberg</a> as its next CEO on the same day it reported a $1.4 billion loss for the second quarter of the year, with profits hurt by poor performance in its commercial division.</p>

<p>But since then, the company has enjoyed some rare positive news, with new plane orders picking up in July.</p>

<p>Boeing said it had booked 72 orders -- including 57 for its flagship 737 MAX aircraft -- in the wake of the Farnborough International Airshow in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>And a few days later, Boeing announced that El AL had finalized orders for up to 31 737 MAX aircraft, marking the largest purchase of airplanes in the Israeli flag carrier's 76-year history.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Venezuelan cycling legend Daniela Larreal Chirinos was found dead at her Las Vegas apartment on August 16, days after she choked to death, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.foxsports.com.mx/2024/08/18/daniela-larreal-chirinos-encuentran-sin-vida-a-la-cinco-veces-ciclista-olimpica-de-venezuela/">Fox Sports</a><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/olympic-cyclist-daniela-larreal-chirinos-found-dead-las-vegas"> </a>&nbsp;</em>reported.&nbsp;The 50-year-old former Olympic athlete was discovered after she failed to show up for work at a hotel in Las Vegas, where she was employed. Authorities determined that Chirinos died on August 11 from asphyxiation caused by solid food remains lodged in her trachea.</p>

<p>Chirinos was a trailblazer in Venezuelan cycling, competing in five Olympic Games from 1992 to 2012.&nbsp;She represented her country at five Olympic Games: 1992 Barcelona, 1996 Atlanta, 2000 Sydney, 2004 Athens, and 2012 London Games.&nbsp;She won numerous medals, including two gold medals at the 2002 Central American and Caribbean Games and two silver medals at the Pan American Games in 2003. Her impressive career spanned over two decades, earning her a revered status in the cycling community.</p>

<p>Her untimely death sent shockwaves through the sporting world, with fans and fellow athletes mourning the loss.&nbsp;The Venezuelan Olympic Committee paid tribute to her on X and wrote,&nbsp;"The COV Board of Directors regrets the departure of Daniela Larreal.&nbsp;With an outstanding career in track cycling, she managed to represent us with honour in five Olympic Games, accumulate four Olympic diplomas and triumphs that always filled us with great pride."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The former Olympian was also a vocal and fearless critic of Venezuela's political leadership, particularly strongman Hugo Chavez, whom she accused of embezzling funds through a fake racing driver sponsorship scheme, along with Sports Minister Hector Rodriguez.</p>

<p>When Nicolas Maduro took power in 2013, she denounced the presidency as a dictatorship, leading to her forced exile and a ban from entering Venezuela. In subsequent years, she rebuilt her life in Miami, driving for Uber before relocating to Las Vegas, where she worked as a food server.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon's health ministry said early Wednesday that Israeli strikes in the country's east killed one person and wounded 20 others, hours after it said four people were killed in the south.</p>

<p>The strikes came more than 24 hours after Israel carried out similar raids deep inside east Lebanon and as tensions mounted in the wake of the Israeli killing of a top Hezbollah commander.</p>

<p>"Israeli enemy strikes on the Bekaa" valley killed one person "and wounded 20 others", the health ministry said in an updated toll.</p>

<p>The statement said one person was in critical condition while "eight children and a pregnant woman were moderately wounded".</p>

<p>A Hezbollah source, requesting anonymity, said several strikes hit east Lebanon near the city of Baalbek, including the village of Nabi Sheet, without specifying what was targeted.</p>

<p>A source from a local hospital told AFP that five children no older than 10, all from the same family, were among the wounded.</p>

<p>The strikes around midnight came after similar raids in the Bekaa region on Monday evening that Israel said targeted "Hezbollah weapons storage facilities".</p>

<p>They also came as Hezbollah said four of its fighters had been killed, after the health ministry said Tuesday that four people died in Israeli strikes in the southern border village of Dhayra.</p>

<p>The Iran-backed Hezbollah, an ally of Palestinian armed group Hamas, has traded near-daily cross-border fire with Israeli forces since the Gaza war began in October.</p>

<p>The violence has largely been restricted to the Lebanon-Israel border area, although Israel has repeatedly struck the country's eastern Bekaa valley near the border with Syria where Hezbollah also has a strong presence.</p>

<p>Hezbollah claimed a string of attacks on Israeli troops and positions on Tuesday, including sending barrages of Katyusha rockets at several north Israel military positions in stated retaliation for Israeli strikes, including in Dhayra.</p>

<p>The Shiite Muslim movement also said it launched "squadrons of explosive-laden drones" and "intense rocket barrages" at several Israeli positions in the annexed Golan Heights in response to Monday night's strikes in the Bekaa valley.</p>

<h2>Health workers 'targeted'&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The Israeli military in separate statements said a total of around 115 "projectiles" were identified crossing from Lebanon.</p>

<p>It also said that "numerous suspicious aerial targets were identified crossing from Lebanon", with air defences intercepting some of them.</p>

<p>No injuries were reported, though the military said the incidents sparked fires in some areas.</p>

<p>The military also said air forces struck projectile launchers and several "Hezbollah military" structures in south Lebanon.</p>

<p>Lebanon's health ministry said three emergency personnel from the Hezbollah-affiliated Islamic Health Committee were hurt Tuesday when the Israeli military "targeted them" in south Lebanon, causing "significant damage to the ambulance they were travelling in".</p>

<p>The ministry "condemned in the strongest terms the repeated targeting of health workers in south Lebanon".</p>

<p>Several militant groups in Lebanon operate health centres and emergency response operations, with at least 21 rescue workers killed since October, according to an AFP tally.</p>

<p>Fears of a major escalation have mounted since Hezbollah and Iran vowed to respond to twin killings blamed on Israel late last month.</p>

<p>An Israeli strike on Beirut's southern suburbs killed a top Hezbollah commander, Fuad Shukr, shortly before an attack in Tehran blamed on Israel killed Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh.</p>

<p>The cross-border violence has killed some 590 people in Lebanon, mostly Hezbollah fighters but also including at least 128 civilians, according to AFP's tally.</p>

<p>On the Israeli side, including in the annexed Golan Heights, 23 soldiers and 26 civilians have been killed, according to army figures.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chaos erupted at Japan's New Chitose Airport on Saturday when a pair of scissors went missing, leading to the cancellation of 36 flights and delays for over 200 others, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9d7gg2599o">BBC</a></em> reported. The airport, known for its strict security protocols, was thrown into disarray after a retail outlet reported the missing scissors.&nbsp;A search ensued, during which security checks for incoming passengers were suspended for at least two hours.</p>

<p>The suspension of security checks led to a severe backlog, resulting in lengthy queues that stretched for hours, with many passengers being turned away and denied entry to the airport. The airport was especially congested that day, as travellers were returning home after the Obon holiday, a traditional Japanese festival honouring ancestors.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Many affected travellers expressed their frustration, hoping for better safety practices in the future. One traveller said, ''I don't think we have any choice [but to wait], but I do hope they are a bit more careful about it.''</p>

<p>Another said: ''So many things to worry about these days… it never ends. And I don't feel safe until I get home.''</p>

<p>However, the missing scissors were eventually found in the same shop where they had disappeared, relieving concerns of theft and malicious intent.&nbsp;The found scissors announcement was delayed because the airport needed to confirm that they were the same pair as the missing scissors, according to <a href="https://www3.nhk.or.jp/sapporo-news/20240819/7000069180.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Japanese broadcaster NHK</a>.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism asked the airport to investigate the cause to prevent it from happening again.&nbsp;</p>

<p>''We recognize that this occurred as a result of insufficient storage and management systems at the store. We are aware that this is also an incident that could be linked to hijacking or terrorism, and will once again work to ensure thorough management awareness,''&nbsp; a representative from the airport told the&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9d7gg2599o" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BBC</a>.</em>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Opened in 1988, New Chitose is the largest airport in Hokkaido and one of Japan's busiest airports.&nbsp;In 2022, the airport welcomed over 15 million passengers, solidifying its position as a critical transportation gateway in northern Japan.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>He met Kamala Harris on a blind date, and on Tuesday her husband Doug Emhoff tried to convince Americans to love her too after an equally whirlwind introduction. The first "Second Gentleman" in US history wooed the Democratic National Convention in Chicago with a speech that highlighted the human side of the party's presidential nominee.</p>

<p>Delegates chanted "Doug" as the 59-year-old -- who gave up his high-flying legal career to support Harris as vice president -- regaled them with the tale of how they met and how she then became the stepmother to his kids.</p>

<p>"I love you and I'm so proud of how you're stepping up for all of us," Emhoff said.</p>

<p>And he said their personal history showed she was ready to be the country's first female commander-in-chief -- which would make him its first ever First Gentleman.</p>

<p>"Kamala Harris was exactly the right person for me at an important time in my life. At this moment in this nation's history she is exactly the right president."</p>

<p>Harris posted a picture of herself on Air Force Two, watching him speak while she returned from a rally in Milwaukee. "Love you Dougie," she wrote.</p>

<h2>'Heyyyy, it's Doug'</h2>

<p>The Harris campaign regards Emhoff as something of a secret weapon, a ready-made speaker who can familiarize Americans with the vice president after her rapid rise following Joe Biden's withdrawal from the White House race.</p>

<p>He has taken a very visible role as cheerleader-in-chief for his 59-year-old wife ever since Biden first picked her as his running mate back in 2020.</p>

<p>More recently, the father-of-two has been her attack dog against Donald Trump as the Republican former president unleashes personal and racially tinged insults at the Democrat.</p>

<p>But his speech in Chicago focused on the personal as much as the political.</p>

<p>As the crowd waved "Doug" signs, Emhoff told the story of how he and Harris were set up on a blind date by one of his legal clients.</p>

<p>The day after, Emhoff called Harris early in the morning, got her answerphone and "just started rambling. 'Heyyyy, it's Doug... I was trying to grab the words out of the air and just put them back in my mouth."</p>

<p>Harris, however, thought the message was "adorable", saved it, and they married the following year. Now she plays the message to him every anniversary, he said.</p>

<p>"This Thursday will be our 10th wedding anniversary... that same night I'll be hearing my wife, Kamala Harris accept your nomination for President of the United States."</p>

<h2>'Momala'</h2>

<p>Their marriage made Kamala Harris a stepmother to Emhoff's then-teenage children Cole and Ella -- who both dubbed her "Momala".</p>

<p>Cole Emhoff introduced him on stage, after narrating a video showing snapshots from Emhoff's life and gently ribbing his dad.</p>

<p>His son said their "blended family wasn't used to politics," but when Harris became first a California senator and then vice president, they all stepped up.</p>

<p>"It felt like Doug was a bit out of place on Capitol Hill, I thought 'what is my goofy dad doing here?' But he embraced it."</p>

<p>Emhoff himself has admitted that it didn't all come easily, especially when he took a leave of absence from his entertainment law job, which was earning him around $1 million a year.</p>

<p>Biden helped him at the time, saying to him "I know this must have been tough."</p>

<p>Since then, Kamala has called Emhoff her rock as Harris blazed a trail as the first female, Black and South Asian vice president in US history</p>

<p>He too set a milestone, becoming the first ever Jewish spouse of a US president or vice president.</p>

<p>Under the Biden administration, Emhoff took on an increasingly high profile role, giving speeches calling out anti-Semitism after the October 7 attacks by Hamas on Israel.</p>

<p>He also performed ceremonial duties including leading the US delegation at the closing of the 2024 Paris Olympics.</p>

<p>But for one person at least, Emhoff doesn't take the back seat.</p>

<p>"My mother is the only person in the whole world who thinks Kamala is the lucky one for marrying me," he quipped.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man in the United States is suing an Atlanta hospital after staff allegedly lost a piece of his skull after a routine procedure and then billed him for a synthetic replacement when they couldn't find it. According to the <em>New York Post</em>, the man, identified as Fernando Cluster, checked in to Emory University Hospital in September 2022 for an intracerebral haemorrhage - commonly known as a brain bleed. At the time, doctors determined a 4.7-by-6-inch piece of skull needed to be removed to reduce pressure. However, after returning to the hospital two months later to have the piece of the skull replaced, the hospital couldn't find it amidst a pile of other unidentified bone fragments from other patients' bodies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We inspected the freezer where bone flaps are stored and could not find a bone flap with Mr. Cluster's patient identification," a note left by hospital staff in Cluster's medical file read, per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/18/us-news/atlanta-hospital-allegedly-loses-28-square-inch-chunk-of-mans-skull-and-bills-him-for-replacement-lawsuit/"><em>Post</em></a>. "There were several bone flaps with incomplete or missing patient identification, but we could not be certain which if any of these belonged to Mr. Cluster," it added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a result, Mr Cluster's surgery was cancelled while the hospital fabricated a synthetic piece of skull. During that time, he was left with a large depression on the right side of his skull. By the end of November 2022, the replacement had been inserted into the patient's head, however, the hospital charged him over $19,000 for the synthetic bone to replace what that they had allegedly lost.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, even after the replacement, Mr Cluster's struggle was far from over. Once the synthetic bone was inserted, he reportedly contracted an infection, needed additional surgery and was left unable to work for a time. By the end of his ordeal, his hospital bill topped $146,800 and the hospital allegedly never offered him and his wife any discounts for the treatment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"While my clients are obviously upset that they and their insurance company were billed for the costs related to Emory's negligence, I'm sure you can understand that their focus is on the egregiousness of Emory losing a part of his body and then having a flippant attitude about it afterwards," Mr Cluster's attorney Chloe Dallaire said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As per the outlet, Mr Cluster and his wife are now seeking to have the hospital compensate them for medical bills and emotional damages.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Former US President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama delivered powerful speeches at the Democratic National Convention underway in Chicago today, rallying the country around the candidacy of Kamala Harris.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama delivered powerful speeches at the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-presidential-polls-2024-national-democratic-convetion-day-2-live-roll-call-today-to-select-kamala-harris-as-democratic-candidate-6381127">Democratic National Convention</a> underway in Chicago today, rallying the country around the candidacy of Kamala Harris, who is poised to become the first Black and South Asian woman to secure a major party's nomination for the presidency.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Taking the stage to a rapturous welcome, Barack Obama began his speech with, "Chicago, it's good to be home." He was greeted by thunderous applause from the audience. The former president quickly rekindled the spirit of his successful 2008 campaign, declaring, "I don't know about you, but I'm feeling fired up and ready to go!"</p>

<p>"This convention has always been good to kids with funny names who believe in this country that anything is possible," he said.</p>

<p>Sixteen years after first accepting the Democratic nomination, Mr Obama looked back with pride on his decision to choose Joe Biden as his vice president. "My first big decision was my best - it was to ask Joe Biden to serve as my vice president," he said. "Other than some common Irish blood, we come from different worlds, but we became brothers."</p>

<p>Mr Obama praised Mr Biden for his empathy and decency, qualities he believes are essential for a leader. "I admired Joe's empathy and decency. His belief that everyone in this country deserves a shot," he said.</p>

<h3><strong>Obamas Slam Donald Trump&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Mr Obama, after praising Mr Biden, turned his attention to Donald Trump who is seeking re-election to the Oval Office and is Kamala Harris' main opponent in the presidential race.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Here is a 78-year-old billionaire who has not stopped whining about his problems since he rode down his golden elevator nine years ago," Mr Obama said. "It has been a constant gripe, conspiracy theories and grievance that has been getting worse since he is afraid of losing to Kamala."</p>

<p>"Someone compared Trump to a neighbour who keeps running his leafblower outside your window. From a neighbour it's exhausting, from a president it's dangerous," Mr Obama added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Obama accused Mr Trump of divisive politics. The former president said the United States does not need four more years of chaos.</p>

<p>"Trump wants us to think this country is divided between 'us' and 'them'. Between 'real' Americans who support him and the 'outsiders'. It is the oldest trick in politics. His act has gotten stale. We do not need four more years of chaos as we have seen that movie before and we know the sequel is usually worse," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Michelle Obama's address was also a fierce critique of the current state of American politics. The former First Lady did not mince words as she tore into Mr Trump, accusing him of divisive rhetoric and policies.</p>

<p>"For years, Donald Trump did everything to make people fear us," she began. "His limited, narrow view of the world made him feel threatened by two highly successful and educated people who happened to be Black. It is the same old con, doubling down on ugly, misogynistic, racist lies instead of real ideas and solutions".&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Big Praise For Kamala Harris&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Speaking about Kamala Harris, Mr Obama went back in time to tweak his "Yes We Can" campaign slogan from the 2008 elections to declare, "Yes, she can."&nbsp;</p>

<p>"America is ready for a new chapter and a new story. We are ready for Kamala Harris. She is ready for the job," he said. "Kamala Harris won't be focused on her problems, she will focus on yours. She won't punish those who refuse to kiss the ring and bend the knee."</p>

<p>"We need a president who actually cares about the millions of people across this country. We need a president who will stand up for them and bargain for better wages. Kamala will be that president. Yes, she can," the former president added.</p>

<p>Michelle Obama also spoke passionately about Kamala Harris, whom she described as more than ready to lead. "Kamala Harris and I build our lives on the same foundation of values," she said, drawing parallels between their upbringings and shared beliefs in the promise of America.</p>

<p>"Her mother moved here from India at the age of 19. That's why she taught Kamala about justice," Michelle Obama said. "She often told her daughter, 'don't sit around and complain, do something.' So with that voice in her head, Kamala went out and worked hard, fighting for people, for better wages."</p>]]></content:encoded>

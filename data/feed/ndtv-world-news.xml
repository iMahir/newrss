       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump on Sunday named Lebanese-American businessman Massad Boulos as his senior advisor on Arab and Middle Eastern affairs, the latest family member to be appointed to a key position.</p>

<p>"I am proud to announce that Massad Boulos will serve as Senior Advisor to the President on Arab and Middle Eastern affairs," Trump posted on Truth Social of the appointment, which puts his daughter Tiffany's father-in-law in a major White House position.</p>

<p>Boulos was a key emissary for the Trump campaign, helping to mobilize Arab American and Muslim voters, many of whom were disaffected with White House policy on the war in Gaza.</p>

<p>The businessman will take over a difficult portfolio, with Israel's war raging in Gaza, a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon seeing early violations, and rebel forces in Syria making advances against the government of Bashar al-Assad.</p>

<p>Massad Boulos's son, Michael, is married to Trump's daughter Tiffany.</p>

<p>A day earlier, Trump appointed Charles Kushner -- the father of his son-in-law Jared -- as the US ambassador to France.</p>

<p>"Massad is an accomplished lawyer and a highly respected leader in the business world, with extensive experience on the International scene," said Trump of his pick for the Middle East advisor job.</p>

<p>"He has been a longtime proponent of Republican and Conservative values, an asset to my Campaign, and was instrumental in building tremendous new coalitions with the Arab American Community."</p>

<p>The Republican referred to Boulos as "a dealmaker."</p>

<p>Trump often promised on the campaign trail to bring a swift end to the wars in Gaza, Ukraine and elsewhere, without specifying how he would do so.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Sunday that his country needed security guarantees from NATO and more weapons to defend itself before any talks with Russia.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Sunday that his country needed security guarantees from NATO and more weapons to defend itself before any talks with Russia.</p>

<p>He made the comments after meeting the EU's new head of diplomacy Kaja Kallas and EU Council chief Antonio Costa, who were visiting Kyiv as a show of support on their first day in office.</p>

<p>"An invitation for Ukraine to join NATO is a necessary thing for our survival," Zelensky said at a press conference with Costa.</p>

<p>Ukraine faces a tough winter ahead, with Russia unleashing devastating barrages against its power grid and Kyiv's fatigued forces losing ground on the frontline.</p>

<p>Questions are also swirling around the future of US support once Donald Trump assumes the presidency in January, with fears he could force Kyiv to make painful concessions in pursuit of a quick peace deal.</p>

<p>Zelensky said his country needed to be in a "strong position" before any talks with the Kremlin, calling for "steps forward with NATO" and a "good number" of long-distance weapons to defend itself.</p>

<p>"Only when we have all these items and we are strong, after that, we have to make the very important... agenda of meeting with one or another of the killers," the Ukrainian leader said, adding that the EU and NATO should be involved in any negotiations.</p>

<p>Costa said the European Union would give Ukraine its "unwavering" support.</p>

<p>"We have stood with you since the very first day of this war of aggression, and you can count on us to continue to stand with you," he told Zelensky.</p>

<p>The European Union's new leadership team is keen to show it remains firm on backing Kyiv at a perilous moment for Ukraine nearly three years into its fight against Russia's invasion.</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened this week to strike government buildings in Kyiv with his new Oreshnik missile, after the US gave Ukraine approval to fire long-range ATACMS missiles into Russia for the first time.</p>

<p>A Russian drone dropped explosives on a bus in the southern Kherson region on Sunday, killing three people, authorities said, while the Russian army claimed to have captured two new frontline villages in the east.</p>

<p><strong>Ceasefire?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Zelensky on Friday appeared to begin staking out his position ahead of any potential peace talks.</p>

<p>He called on NATO to offer guaranteed protections to parts of Ukraine controlled by Kyiv in order to "stop the hot stage of the war", and implied he would then be willing to wait to regain other territory seized by Russia.</p>

<p>"If we will have a frozen conflict without any strong position for Ukraine, Putin will come back in two, three or five years," Zelensky said Sunday.</p>

<p>Kallas told journalists on the journey into Ukraine that for Kyiv "the strongest security guarantee is NATO membership".</p>

<p>"We need to definitely discuss this -- if Ukraine decides to draw the line somewhere then how can we secure peace so that Putin doesn't go any further," she said.</p>

<p>But diplomats at NATO say there appears little prospect of the alliance granting Ukraine membership soon given opposition from a raft of members cautious of getting dragged into war with Russia.</p>

<p>Zelensky insisted Kyiv was not "delusional" about its prospects with NATO and admitted there was deep reluctance from US President Joe Biden, along with leaders in countries such as Hungary.</p>

<p><strong>'Transactional language'</strong></p>

<p>Kallas said the EU "shouldn't really rule out anything" in terms of the question of sending European troops to help enforce any ceasefire.</p>

<p>"We should have this strategic ambiguity around this," she said.</p>

<p>Trump has cast doubt on continuing Washington's vast aid for Ukraine and called on EU countries to do more.</p>

<p>Europe together has spent around $125 billion on supporting Ukraine since Russia's 2022 invasion, while the United States alone has coughed up over $90 billion, according to a tracker from the Kiel Institute.</p>

<p>Kallas said the EU would use a "transactional language" to try to convince Trump that backing Kyiv was in the interest of the US.</p>

<p>"Aid for Ukraine is not charity," she said. "A victory for Russia definitely emboldens China, Iran, North Korea."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States is not considering returning to Ukraine the nuclear weapons it gave up after the Soviet Union collapsed, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Sunday.</p>

<p>Sullivan made his remarks when questioned about a New York Times article last month that said some unidentified Western officials had suggested US President Joe Biden could give Ukraine the arms before he leaves office.</p>

<p>"That is not under consideration, no. What we are doing is surging various conventional capacities to Ukraine so that they can effectively defend themselves and take the fight to the Russians, not (giving them) nuclear capability," he told ABC.</p>

<p>Last week, Russia said the idea was "absolute insanity" and that preventing such a scenario was one of the reasons why Moscow sent troops into Ukraine.</p>

<p>Kyiv inherited nuclear weapons from the Soviet Union after its 1991 collapse but gave them up under a 1994 agreement, the Budapest Memorandum, in return for security assurances from Russia, the United States and Britain.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The White House is working on a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza but is "not there yet," the US National Security Advisor told NBC on Sunday, with fighting in the conflict raging on as regional leaders meet to discuss the crisis.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The White House is working on a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza but is "not there yet," the US National Security Advisor told NBC on Sunday, with fighting in the conflict raging on as regional leaders meet to discuss the crisis.</p>

<p>"We are working actively to try to make it happen. We are engaged deeply with the key players in the region, and there is activity even today," said Jake Sullivan, according to a transcript released by the broadcaster.</p>

<p>"There will be further conversations and consultations, and our hope is that we can generate a ceasefire and hostage deal, but we're not there yet," he added.</p>

<p>Sullivan's comments came a day after Israel hit Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, days into a fragile ceasefire in its conflict with the Iran-backed group.</p>

<p>Addressing that conflict, Sullivan lauded the ceasefire deal and said the US was working with Lebanon's military to ensure it was implemented "effectively."</p>

<p>"We need to protect it and ensure that it is fully implemented," he told NBC.</p>

<p>In an apparent reference to the Israeli strikes, Sullivan said both parties "have the right, consistent with international law, to take action in self-defense if they're facing imminent threats."</p>

<p>Speaking in Jerusalem on Sunday, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said there were "indications" progress could be made on a deal securing the release of hostages by Hamas in Gaza.</p>

<p>"There are signs we may see a greater degree of flexibility from Hamas as a result of circumstances that have developed, including the agreement with Lebanon," he said.</p>

<p>"There is a desire to move forward on this. I hope it can progress. We are committed to the return of the hostages -- it's a responsibility we must uphold."</p>

<p>Saar asserted, however, that Hamas "cannot be allowed" to continue to rule Gaza.</p>

<p>Speaking to US broadcaster CBS, Sullivan said US President Joe Biden was in close coordination with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government.</p>

<p>"He also spoke with Prime Minister Netanyahu that day (of the Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire), and Prime Minister Netanyahu told him he agreed, the time is right. The moment is now," said Sullivan, referring to the need for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.</p>

<p>Hamas seized 251 hostages during its October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, with 97 still being held in Gaza, including 34 who have been confirmed to be dead.</p>

<p>The armed group's attack resulted in 1,207 deaths, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>In response, Israel launched a withering military campaign on Gaza, killing at least 44,429 there, most of them civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry that the UN considers reliable.</p>

<p>Much of Gaza has been reduced to rubble, with its population dependent on humanitarian aid that the UN on Sunday said it would pause delivery of through the key Kerem Shalom crossing due to security concerns.</p>

<p>Speaking to CBS on Sunday, Sullivan said the humanitarian situation in Gaza was a "crisis" and that famine was "constantly stalking" the territory.</p>

<p>"You have too many people who are suffering from shortages of food, water, medicine, access to sanitation. Innocent people who deserve a measure of peace and deserve access to all of those life-saving supplies in abundance," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Bengaldesh High Court on Sunday acquitted all accused, including former Bangladesh prime minister Khaleda Zia's son Tarique Rahman and former state minister Lutfozzaman Babar, in a 2004 grenade attack in ousted premier Sheikh Hasina's rally.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The High Court here on Sunday scrapped the lower court's verdict and acquitted all accused, including former Bangladesh prime minister Khaleda Zia's son Tarique Rahman and former state minister Lutfozzaman Babar, in a 2004 grenade attack in ousted premier Sheikh Hasina's rally.</p>

<p>"The High Court annulled the trial court verdict and acquitted all convicts including Tarique Rahman," a spokesman for the attorney general's office said.</p>

<p>Tarique Rahman, 57, is the acting chairman of Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).</p>

<p>Two cases -- one for murder and another under the Explosives Act -- were filed after a grenade attack on an Awami League rally at Bangabandhu Avenue in Dhaka left 24 people dead and nearly 300 injured.</p>

<p>The HC bench of Justice AKM Asaduzzaman and Justice Syed Enayet Hossain acquitted all 49 accused and observed that the trial court's verdict in the cases was "illegal." The High Court's verdict comes after the bench heard the death references and appeals related to the cases filed over the attack.</p>

<p>The trial court had delivered the judgement based on a confession by Mufti Abdul Hannan, the top leader of the banned Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami (HuJI) outfit who was accused in the case.</p>

<p>Mufti Abdul Hannan has been executed in connection with another case.</p>

<p>The High Court said the confessional statement had no evidential value as it was taken on force and not examined properly by the magistrate concerned.</p>

<p>On November 21, the bench kept the death references (trial court documents for confirmation of death sentences) and the appeals filed by the convicted accused in the cases as curia advisari vult (meaning the verdict will be delivered any day) after it concluded a hearing on those matters.</p>

<p>During the hearing on the death references and appeals, the defence lawyers for the accused requested the High Court to scrap the trial court verdict as there was no specific allegation against them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, appearing for the State, Deputy Attorney Generals Md Jashim Sarker and Md Russell Ahammad requested the High Court bench to uphold the lower court verdicts in the cases as the allegations against the convicted accused were proved beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p>Hasina, then opposition leader, narrowly escaped the attack on August 21, 2004, but 24 people were killed as several grenades were hurled when she was addressing a "rally against terrorism".</p>

<p>A Dhaka court on October 10, 2018, sentenced 19 people, including Babar, to death in the two cases filed in connection with the attacks.</p>

<p>Nineteen others, including Rahman, now in London, were given life imprisonment and 11 were handed different terms in prison.</p>

<p>Analysts previously said the incident changed Bangladesh's politics forever. In contrast, the Business Standard newspaper at the time said that "it was a premeditated barbaric act designed to wipe out the whole leadership of Awami League, including Hasina".</p>

<p>The FBI was called from the US to investigate the attack in which the assassins used grenades.</p>

<p>A former chief of Bangladesh's spy agency DGFI testified as a witness later in the trial court and said the perpetrators were protected under directives of the higher authorities.</p>

<p>The High Court decision comes nearly four months after Hasina's Awami League regime was ousted in a student-led mass upsurge and she fled to India on August 5.</p>

<p>Three days later Professor Muhammad Yunus took oath as the chief adviser of the interim government.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 20-year-old British man has died after being found injured in a lift shaft at his hotel near Lara Beach, Antalya. According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/dec/01/british-man-tyler-kerry-dies-in-lift-shaft-during-family-holiday-in-turkey">Guardian</a></em>, Tyler Kerry was on a vacation with his grandparents, Collette and Ray Kerry, girlfriend Molly and other relatives when the incident occurred. His body was discovered at the bottom of the lift shaft in their hotel in Antalya on Friday morning. According to his uncle, Alex Price, Tyler was found at 7 am local time and was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>

<p>"I got a phone call from my sister and she just said that Tyler had been found in the lift shaft at the hotel. An ambulance team were attending to him but unfortunately, they weren't able to resuscitate him, and he was pronounced dead at the scene," Mr Price said.</p>

<p>His family is devastated and seeking a thorough investigation into the circumstances of his death, which remain unclear. "The details are limited at the moment. The family is still in the dark about what's happened and are eager for a thorough investigation to find out what's happened," Mr Price added.</p>

<p>The family is receiving support from the British consulate in Antalya and a representative from Tui, their tour operator. According to Mr Price, they are working to repatriate Tyler's body to the UK, with the hope of completing this process by Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>An FCDO spokesperson said: "We are assisting the family of a British man who has died in Turkey."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a fundraiser has been launched to assist with funeral costs. On the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/tyler-kerry">GoFundMe page</a>, his family wrote, "A young man full of personality, kindness and compassion with his whole life ahead of him. He was completely devoted to his family and girlfriend Molly. We are all absolutely devastated. Tyler had travel insurance which will hopefully cover the cost of bringing him home. We are asking for any donations towards the unforseen costs of dealing with the consequences of such a tragic incident, particularly the inevitable costs of laying Tyler to rest and ensuring he has a fitting and respectful funeral/memorial."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Facing condemnation from the United States and defiance from his own president,&nbsp;Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze praised police on Sunday for cracking down on protesters who he said were acting on foreign orders to undermine the state.</p>

<p>Georgia, a country of 3.7 million people that was once part of the Soviet Union, has been plunged into crisis since the governing&nbsp;Georgian Dream party said on Thursday it was halting European Union accession talks for the next four years.</p>

<p>The EU and the United States are alarmed by what they see as&nbsp;Georgia's shift away from a pro-Western path and back towards Russia's orbit. Big anti-government protests have taken place in the capital Tbilisi for the past three nights, and police have fired water cannon and tear gas into the crowds.</p>

<p>More protests are planned in Tbilisi for Sunday night, and local media reported demonstrations were taking place in towns and cities throughout the country.</p>

<p>Russian security official Dmitry Medvedev said on Sunday that an attempted revolution was taking place in&nbsp;Georgia. The former Russian president said on Telegram that&nbsp;Georgia&nbsp;was "moving rapidly along the Ukrainian path, into the dark abyss. Usually this sort of thing ends very badly".</p>

<p>Medvedev, once seen as a modernising reformer, has reinvented himself as an aggressive hawk since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, often hurling dire warnings at Kyiv and its Western supporters.</p>

<p>The Kremlin has yet to comment on the latest events in&nbsp;Georgia, but it has long accused the West of fomenting revolutions in post-Soviet countries that Moscow still regards as part of its sphere of influence.</p>

<h2><strong>'FOREIGN INSTRUCTORS'</strong></h2>

<p>Georgian Prime Minister Kobakhidze dismissed criticism by the United States, which has condemned the use of "excessive force" against demonstrators.</p>

<p>"Despite the heaviest systematic violence applied yesterday by the violent groups and their foreign instructors, the police acted at a higher standard than the American and European ones and successfully protected the state from another attempt to violate the constitutional order," he told a press conference, without providing evidence of foreign involvement.</p>

<p>Kobakhidze also shrugged off Washington's announcement on Saturday that it was suspending its strategic partnership with&nbsp;Georgia. He said this was a "temporary event", and&nbsp;Georgia&nbsp;would talk to the new administration of President-elect Donald Trump when it takes office in January.</p>

<p>Deepening the constitutional crisis in the country, outgoing President Salome Zourabichvili - a critic of the government and a strong advocate of&nbsp;Georgian membership of the EU - said on Saturday that she would refuse to step down when her term ends later this month.</p>

<p>Zourabichvili said she would stay in office because the new parliament - chosen in October in elections that the opposition says were rigged - was illegitimate and had no authority to name her successor.</p>

<p>Kobakhidze said he understood Zourabichvili's "emotional state".</p>

<p>"But of course on December 29 she will have to leave her residence and surrender this building to a legitimately elected president," he said.</p>

<p>Georgian Dream has nominated Mikheil Kavelashvili, a former soccer star with a record of hardline, anti-Western statements, as its candidate for president. The head of state will be chosen on Dec. 14 by an electoral college consisting of members of parliament and local government representatives.</p>

<h2><strong>'FOREIGN AGENTS'</strong></h2>

<p>For much of the period since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union,&nbsp;Georgia&nbsp;has leaned strongly towards the West and tried to loosen the influence of Russia, to which it lost a brief war in 2008. It has been promised eventual NATO membership, and became an official candidate for EU entry last year.</p>

<p>But domestic opponents and Western governments have become alarmed by what they see as increasingly authoritarian and pro-Russian tendencies by the&nbsp;Georgian Dream government.</p>

<p>In June, it enacted a law obliging NGOs to register as "foreign agents" if they received more than 20% of their funding from abroad. In September, parliament approved a law curbing LGBT rights.</p>

<p>The government says it is acting to protect the country from foreign interference and avoid suffering the fate of Ukraine by being dragged into a new war with Russia.</p>

<p>New EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas voiced solidarity on Sunday with the demonstrators.</p>

<p>"We stand with the&nbsp;Georgian people and their choice for a European future," she posted on X.</p>

<p>"We condemn the violence against protesters &amp; regret signals from ruling party not to pursue&nbsp;Georgia's path to EU and democratic backsliding of the country. This will have direct consequences from EU side."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Many argued that pursuing charges against the dead teenager is unnecessary and a misallocation of resources, as it serves no practical purpose.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japanese authorities' decision to prosecute a 17-year-old girl who died by suicide, resulting in another woman's death, has sparked widespread controversy. The tragic accident happened on August 31 at&nbsp;at the NEWoMan shopping complex above Yokohama Station. According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/people/article/3288342/japans-move-charge-teen-whose-suicide-caused-womans-death-sparks-debate">South China Morning Post,</a></em> a&nbsp;teenage girl from Chiba Prefecture climbed over a 2.5-meter glass barrier on the 12th floor and jumped from the west side of the building. She landed on 32-year-old Chikako Chiba, who was walking with friends. Both were rushed to a local hospital, where the teenage girl was pronounced dead within an hour. Chiba also died of her injuries later that evening.</p>

<p>An initial investigation suggested that the student died by suicide, although the motive was unclear. Yokohama police submitted the case to prosecutors, recommending that an indictment be recorded. The police argued that the 17-year-old girl was of an age where she could reasonably understand that her actions might cause harm to others. As a result, the dead teenager has been charged with "gross negligence resulting in death", according to state broadcaster NHK.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;decision has been widely debated on social media. Many said&nbsp;that pursuing charges against the dead teenager is unnecessary and a misallocation of resources, as it serves no practical purpose. However, legal experts suggest that although the girl cannot be held legally accountable for the charge of gross negligence resulting in death, pursuing prosecution could have implications for potential civil claims filed by the victim's family. Additionally, it may serve as a deterrent to others, cautioning against actions that endanger innocent lives during suicide attempts.</p>

<p>One user wrote, "Prosecuting a dead girl is peak government ridiculousness – bureaucrats so obsessed with following their rigid, outdated rules that they've completely lost touch with common sense and human decency."</p>

<p>Another commented, "This is just another way to punish the 17-year-old's parents and family. It was a terrible accident and, let's be honest, this makes no sense." A third said, "It appears as though they are trying to discourage the behaviour in a country known for a high suicide rate."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A day after the second Hindu monk, Shyam Das Prabhu, was arrested in Bangladesh, two other disciples of arrested spiritual leader Chinmoy Krishna Das have also gone missing in Chattogram, International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) Kolkata spokesperson Radharamn Das claimed on Saturday.</p>

<p>Posting the picture of four Hindu priests, Radharamn Das wrote: "Do they look like terrorists? All of them have been arrested by Bangladeshi police without any reason."</p>

<p>He also retweeted a post claiming, "After Chinmoy Krishna Das, two more Hindu saints Ranganath Shyamsunder Das Brahmachari and Rudrapati Keshav Das Brahmachari were arrested from Pundarik Dham by Bangladesh Police."</p>

<p>While there is no official comment on the arrests or detention of Shyam Das Prabhu and two other ISKCON devotees-- who had reportedly gone to deliver food to Chinmoy Krishna Das-- sources said that they were detained by authorities without warrant.</p>

<p>Sources said ISKCON Bangladesh stopped some priests heading to India amid reports of at least four Hindu priests being in custody.</p>

<h2><strong>Attacks On Minorities In Bangladesh</strong></h2>

<p>Meanwhile, reports of attacks on Hindus continue to come from Bangladesh. Earlier today, a journalist, Munni Saha, was taken into custody after she was targeted by radical Islamist forces and surrounded by a mob. Saha was accosted and threatened by a group of radicals in the heart of Dhaka at Karwan Bazar on Saturday evening while leaving her office. She was later released, sources said.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Journalists in the South Asian country have also complained about facing issues with hundreds of accreditations being cancelled amid radical targeting of the minority community in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>The Bangladesh government is also targeting ISKCON, with authorities reportedly ordering that freezing for 30 days the bank accounts of 17 people associated with the organisation, including its former member Chinmoy Krishna Das arrested this week on sedition charges.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>An ISKCON centre in the Bhairav area of Bangladesh was also vandalized by an angry mob. ISKCON has over 100 centres in Bangladesh, where&nbsp;Hindus comprise approximately 8 per cent of the total 170 million population.</p>

<p>Earlier, three Hindu temples were vandalised by a slogan-shouting mob on Friday in Chattogram, which has witnessed protests and violence since a former ISKCON member Chinmoy Krishna Das was booked.</p>

<p>There are also reports of members of the minority community being attacked by mobs. Sayan Ghosh, a resident of Kolkata, alleges radical elements brutally beat him up during his recent trip to Bangladesh. Mr Ghosh said he was targeted after confirming that he was a Hindu from India. On Saturday night, he returned home through the Gede-Darshan border.</p>

<h2><strong>India Concerned</strong></h2>

<p>India has conveyed its "serious concern" to Bangladesh over the "increasing incidents of violence" against the minority Hindu community in the neighbouring country. New Delhi has also shared its worry with Dhaka over the "surge in extremist rhetoric".</p>

<p>The Ministry of External Affairs, in its weekly press briefing, told reporters that India has been in touch with the interim government in Bangladesh on a routine and consistent basis regarding the rising cases of communal incidents targeting the Hindu minority.</p>

<p>There's also a political consensus and support among parties in India for the Union government to take appropriate action on the matter.</p>

<p>Speaking on the issue, Trinamool Congress National General Secretary, Abhishek Banerjee said, "The images surfacing from Bangladesh are infuriating and make blood boil. I have cleared my stand that you have to follow the Constitution of the country and the state has no role in it. The onus is on the Union government to take it up with the Bangladesh government in the strongest manner or in the language they understand."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ellen DeGeneres, 66, and her partner Portia de Rossi, are facing a challenging start to their new life in the UK. Following Donald Trump's US presidential win, the couple relocated to a picturesque six-bedroom farmhouse&nbsp;in The Cotswolds, England. However, their welcome to the country was marred by disaster when their 43-acre property was flooded during the intense Storm Bert, which brought days of heavy rain and 80mph winds. According to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/12/01/ellen-degeneres-dealt-another-blow-moving-uk-following-trumps-victory-22097314/" rel="nofollow, noindex">Metro</a></em>, the river Thames burst its banks leaving their home underwater.</p>

<p>According to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/11/20/ellen-degeneres-and-portia-de-rossi-move-to-england-after-trump-election-win/#continued">TMZ</a></em>, which cited sources with "direct knowledge", the driving force behind their relocation was Trump's win apart from other motivating factors. The couple who are supporters of Kamala Harris were "very disillusioned" with Trump's victory and decided "to get the hell out".&nbsp;The couple moved to Cotswolds, a rural area in south central England after listing their massive Montecito Estate north of Los Angeles.</p>

<p>DeGeneres was also a high-profile donor for Vice President Kamala Harris - contributing about $3,300 to her campaign. She also went ahead and endorsed Harris on her Instagram saying, "There's nothing more powerful than a woman whose time has come!! I can't wait for @KamalaHarris to be our next president."</p>

<p>Not just DeGeneres and Rossi, Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 presidential election has prompted several Hollywood celebrities to publicly declare their intention to leave the United States.&nbsp;America Ferrara, the talented actress from Barbie, has also joined DeGeneres in making the move to the UK. Ms Ferrara relocated with her husband, Ryan Piers Williams, and their son, Sebastian.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sharon Stone, a Hollywood A-lister, has also expressed interest in purchasing a home in Italy. Meanwhile, music icon Cher had previously threatened to take drastic measures if Donald Trump were to secure the presidency again.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom, particularly London's cosmopolitan charm, and Italy with its rich culture and breathtaking landscapes have emerged as top choices for relocation. Canada, another favoured destination, offers proximity to the US, familiarity, and progressive policies that appeal to many.&nbsp;Other countries, such as Spain, Mexico, Australia, and New Zealand, are also being considered by celebrity expats.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ChatGPT, the popular chatbot of Microsoft-backed artificial intelligence (AI) startup OpenAI, seems to be facing a bug, preventing it from producing any results related to the name "David Mayer". The issue was first flagged by Reddit users, who found that prompts asking ChatGPT to say "David Mayer" results in the chatbot saying "I'm unable to generate a response".</p>

<p>Users got creative and tried various tactics, including separating the words, putting them in riddles, and even claiming the name to be their own. However, they failed to fetch any response from the chatbot, which ended the chat abruptly before uttering the name.</p>

</div>

<p>One user pointed out that when they asked to tell about David Mayer's connection with ChatGPT without taking the name, their prompt was flagged as "illegal and potentially violating usage policy".</p>

<p>People even tried using the name indirectly and asked ChatGBP why it could not say D@vid M@yer. "I am unable to generate responses for D@vid M@yer (assuming you're referring to a public figure or individual) because I follow guidelines that avoid creating content that could be directly related to or resemble specific living individuals, especially when their likeness or identity is involved. This ensures that privacy and ethical considerations are respected," ChatGPT replied.</p>

</div>

<p>The issue was also discussed by X (earlier Twitter) users who shared their experiences of trying to make ChatGPT say the word 'David Mayer'. I a post on a microblogging site, X user Justin Moore wrote: "ChatGPT refuses to say the name "David Mayer," and no one knows why. If you try to get it to write the name, the chat immediately ends. People have attempted all sorts of things - ciphers, riddles, tricks - and nothing works."</p>

<p>Replying to Ms Moore, another user named Ebenezer Don noted that there's more to the conversation than just simply getting ChatGPT to say the name.</p>

<p>"I had a long conversation with o1 preview, pretending to be a regular individual named "David Mayer". Then noticed it attempting to say the name untll it saw a footnote (Image 1). Next task was to get it to say the footnote. I tried so many attempts but finally got it to translate the footnote to another language internally but without telling me. This was to make the footnote content a part of our conversation. Then I wrapped up by asking it to write a detailed movie script using our conversation as its data source and "John Doe" as a placeholder for "David Mayer". In the script, ChatGPT finally reveals the content of the footnote," said Mr Don, who claims to be a software engineer.</p>

<p>"What are footnotes in OpenAI and how do they work? Are these variable policies that can be easily swapped and updated? What private data did ChatGPT obtain on David Mayer and how did that happen?" he asked further.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Interestingly, another user called Marcel Samyn pointed out that ChatGPT was able to easily say David Mayer through its API.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Belgium has come up with a new law, the first of its kind in the world, recognising the rights of sex workers and offering them treatment like any other job.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Belgium has come up with a new law, the first of its kind in the world, recognising the rights of sex workers and offering them treatment like any other job. Under the new law, sex workers will be entitled to benefits like official employment contracts, health insurance, pensions, maternity leave and sick days.</p>

<p>Belgium had decriminalised sex work in 2022. However, the new landmark legislation establishing employment rights and contracts for sex workers is a global first. The law ensures the same protections for sex workers as other professions.</p>

<p>"This is radical, and it's the best step we have seen anywhere in the world so far," said Erin Kilbride, a researcher at Human Rights Watch, according to a report by BBC.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;"We need every country to be moving in that direction," she added. Sex work is legal in several countries including Germany, Greece, the Netherlands and Turkey.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The law has been hailed by sex workers, for whom the job is a necessity. "It's an opportunity for us to exist as people," said Sophie, a sex worker and a mother of five who was forced to continue work late into her pregnancies due to financial pressures, according to the BBC report.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Belgium's new legislation took shape after 2022 protests that were sparked by the lack of state support for sex workers during the Covid pandemic. It will come into effect on December 1, giving sex workers the right to work contracts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Explaining the significance of the new law, Victoria, president of the Belgian Union of Sex Workers (UTSOPI), said, "If there is no law and your job is illegal, there are no protocols to help you. This law gives people the tools to make us safer."</p>

<p>Victoria, who was herself an escort for 12 years, said the illegality of her job before 2022 subjected her to unsafe conditions, with no choice over her clients and her agency taking a big cut of her earnings.</p>

<p>Elaborating on her struggles, Victoria told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ygn31ypdlo" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">BBC</a> that she was once raped by a client. She said that when she went to the police station to report the incident, a female officer was "so hard" on her. "She told me sex workers can't be raped. She made me feel it was my fault, because I did that job," she said, adding that she left the station crying.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, critics believe this law is not enough as it would not be able to prevent trafficking, exploitation and abuse, that comes with the trade.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It is dangerous because it normalises a profession that is always violent at its core," BBC report quoted Julia Crumiere, a volunteer with Isala - an NGO that helps sex workers on the streets in Belgium, as saying.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Rights Under The New Law</strong></h2>

<p>Under Belgium's new law, sex workers will get employment contracts providing social coverage and adherence to rules regarding working hours and remuneration. It will also reportedly protect these workers from threats in the workplace.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Moreover, now each room where sexual services would take place would have to be equipped with an alarm button connecting sex workers with their "reference person". They will also have the right to refuse clients or sexual services without risking dismissal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The law also grants these workers the right to resign without notice or compensation or impose conditions on their services.</p>

<p>Though the law allows pimps controlling the sex trade to operate legally, they have to follow strict rules. Under the new law, a person convicted of a serious crime will not be allowed to employ sex workers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hyderabad: On November 25, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/bangladesh-iskcon-chinmoy-krishna-das-arrested-violent-protest-hindus-2642079-2024-11-29" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">Chinmoy Krishna Das</a>, a Vaishnavite leader and former member of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) in Bangladesh, was arrested by the Dhaka Metropolitan Police on charges of sedition. His arrest has sparked protests in Dhaka's Shahbagh neighbourhood and Chittagong, with demonstrators demanding his release. The demand for his release is also growing in India, where many supporters are calling for justice.</p>

<p>Amid this backdrop, a video has been circulating on social media, allegedly showing a man in saffron robes sexually assaulting a woman in a car. The text on the video appears to appeal to the protection of Muslim women, but those sharing it claim it shows Chinmoy Krishna Das assaulting a Hindu woman.</p>

<p>An X user shared the video and wrote, "Chinmoy Krishna Das, leader of Iskcon Bangladesh, caught trying to rape a Hindu girl in Sylhet. This 'saviour of Hindus' proves even local Hindus aren't safe from Iskcon, a terrorist organisation."</p>

<h3><strong>Fact Check</strong></h3>

<p>NewsMeter found that the claim is false. The video shows Baba Balaknath from Rajasthan allegedly sexually assaulting a woman after intoxicating her.</p>

<p>Upon conducting a reverse image search of the video's keyframes, we found video reports showing the same visuals published by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QgFA3CZO-o" target="_blank">ABP News</a>, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D92yTJIn3XQ" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">First India News</a> and <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYuM_lq9y-4" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">Rajasthan Patrika</a> on October 20-21. According to media outlets, the incident happened in Rajasthan's Sikar. The accused identified as Baba Balaknath allegedly drugged the woman and raped her. The driver of the car reportedly recorded the video.</p>

<p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D92yTJIn3XQ?si=sCDaPejbIOcTyXHs" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></p>

<p>According to an <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://ndtv.com/india-news/priest-baba-balaknath-allegedly-rapes-woman-after-giving-drug-laced-prasad-6845783" target="_blank">NDTV report</a> dated October 22, the victim alleged that she was introduced to Baba Balaknath with the assurance that he could resolve her family problems. She claimed she was given a sweet laced with drugs and was raped three times after consuming it.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/priest-baba-balaknath-gives-woman-drug-laced-prasad-rapes-her-records-video-report-101729662752675.html" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">Hindustan Times</a> in an article dated October 23 reported the woman was introduced to Baba Balaknath by a man named Rajesh during a visit to the Kshetrapal Temple in Khedi Datunjala. The priest allegedly promised to resolve her family issues through a religious practice known as 'tantra vidya'. On the day of the incident, the priest reportedly drugged and raped her multiple times, while his driver, Yogesh, recorded the assault on video.</p>

<p>Hence, we conclude that the video does not show Chinmoy Krishna Das sexually assaulting a woman in Bangladesh. The claim is false.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[For over a decade, the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria seemed to have weathered the storm of a brutal civil war with help from powerful allies like Russia and Iran.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">For over a decade, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/syria-bashar-al-assad-aleppo-explained-whats-happening-in-syria-how-it-could-affect-middle-east-7139248" target="_blank">Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria</a> seemed to have weathered the storm of a brutal civil war with help from powerful allies like Russia and Iran. The 59-year-old Syrian president's grip on power appeared resolute, despite the chaos around the country. Yet, much like the slogan “Our leader forever” during the reign of his father, Hafez al-Assad, the idea of eternal rule was always fragile.</p>

<p dir="ltr">When the Arab Spring began in 2011, toppling regimes across the region, many predicted the end of the Assad dynasty. Protests in Syria quickly escalated into a civil war, challenging Assad's hold on power. His regime survived, thanks to the intervention of Russia, Iran and Hezbollah. Over the years, the Syrian government held on to key territories while the opponents remained divided.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The situation has rapidly changed in the last few days. Just this week, opposition forces, <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/aleppo-attacked-bashar-al-assad-in-trouble-syria-heading-for-regime-change-7140350 ">led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham</a> – formerly al-Qaeda's affiliate – launched an offensive that quickly advanced through northern Syria, capturing large swathes of territory, including parts of Aleppo.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Who is Bashar al-Assad?</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">Bashar al-Assad has been the president of Syria since 2000, following the death of his father, Hafez al-Assad, who had ruled the country for nearly 30 years.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Early Life And Education</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">Born on September 11, 1965, in Damascus,&nbsp;Bashar al-Assad is the second son of Hafez al-Assad, a military officer and leader of the Ba'ath Party who became president after a 1971 coup. The Assad family belongs to a Syrian minority sect that makes up about 10 per cent of the population but has had a dominant role in politics since the 1960s.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Bashar al-Assad attended school in Damascus where he learnt English and French. He earned a medical degree in ophthalmology from the University of Damascus in 1988. He served as an army doctor before moving to London in 1992 to continue his studies.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Entry To Politics</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">In 1994, Bashar al-Assad's older brother Basil, who was supposed to succeed their father, died in a car accident. With no political or military experience, Bashar Al-Assad, then 29, was called to Syria and prepared to take his brother's place. He trained at a military academy, earning the rank of colonel in the Republican Guard.</p>

<p dir="ltr">He led an anti-corruption campaign that removed several officials, though it left senior regime members untouched. He was also appointed chairman of the Syrian Computer Society, positioning himself as a moderniser.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Presidency</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">When Hafez al-Assad died on June 10, 2000, the Syrian parliament swiftly amended the constitution to lower the minimum age for presidential candidates from 40 to 34, making his son, Bashar al-Assad, eligible for the office. He officially took office on July 11, 2000, becoming the leader of the Ba'ath Party and commander-in-chief of the military.</p>

<p dir="ltr">He was elected president with over 97 per cent of the vote. In his inaugural speech, he rejected Western-style democracy as a model for Syria. Although many Syrians were uneasy about the transfer of power from father to son, Bashar al-Assad's youth, education and Western exposure evoked hope for change. His regime, however, largely maintained the same authoritarian practices, with a heavily policed state and a struggling economy reliant on dwindling oil resources.</p>

<p dir="ltr">He maintained his father's hardline stance on Syria's conflict with Israel and opposed the US invasion of Iraq, using anti-Western rhetoric.</p>

<p dir="ltr">By 2005, Bashar al-Assad sidelined his father's aides and replaced them with younger faces, often family members.</p>

<p dir="ltr">After the 2005 assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, Assad withdrew Syrian troops from Lebanon under international pressure, though Syria's involvement in the assassination was never conclusively proven.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In 2007, Assad was re-elected in a widely criticised election and sought to improve relations with regional powers like Saudi Arabia and Turkey, though Syria remained largely isolated.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Tensions With Lebanon</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">Bashar al-Assad faced a&nbsp;volatile relationship with Israel, worsening ties with Lebanon and tensions with Turkey over water rights.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In 2000, he began withdrawing Syrian troops from Lebanon who had been in the country since 1976. Syrian troops entered Lebanon in 1976 during the Lebanese civil war.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The removal of soldiers hastened when Syria was accused of involvement in the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Hariri's death led to a public uprising in Lebanon and international pressure on Syria to remove its troops. Assad denied any involvement, saying that if Syrians were found responsible, they would be considered traitors and face legal consequences. “If the UN investigation concludes Syrians were involved, those people would be regarded as traitors who would be charged with treason and face an international court or the Syrian judicial process,” he was quoted as saying by CNN.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The backlash in Lebanon led to hundreds of thousands of people protesting in Beirut, demanding an end to Syrian influence. On April 26, 2005, Syria withdrew its last soldier from Lebanon.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>2011 Civil Unrest In Syria</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">In March 2011, mass protests broke out in Syria, inspired by the Arab Spring. Bashar al-Assad initially offered reforms, such as abolishing emergency laws and releasing political prisoners, but violence against protesters escalated. The government deployed troops and tanks, while Assad claimed Syria was the victim of an international conspiracy. By September 2011, armed opposition groups gained momentum, leading to a full civil war by mid-2012.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In July 2012, Assad's inner circle suffered a major blow when several senior officials were killed in a bombing. As the war intensified, both sides received support from international allies.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In August 2013, attacks involving chemical weapons near Damascus killed hundreds,&nbsp;leading to calls for international military action. An agreement between the US, Russia and Syria led to Syria's chemical weapons being placed under international control, avoiding military intervention. Despite this, Assad's forces continued using indiscriminate weapons, such as barrel bombs in rebel-controlled areas.</p>

<p dir="ltr">As the war progressed, Assad's hold on power grew stronger. The rise of ISIS in 2013 refocused international efforts, including those of the US, on defeating the extremist group. Russia's military intervention in 2015 also strengthened Assad's position. By 2017, Assad regained control of most major cities, with remaining rebels confined to pockets of territory.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In 2018, Assad's army advanced in Idlib, where Turkish forces had intervened to protect rebel-held areas. As the conflict neared its end, Assad began rebuilding Syria through infrastructure projects and attracting foreign investment. One controversial measure, Law 10, allowed the government to seize property from displaced Syrians, enabling property redistribution to loyalists.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Controversies</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Civilian Deaths: </strong>In the early months of the Syrian protests in 2011, civilian deaths increased and refugees fled to neighbouring countries. In December 2011, when asked about the government's violent crackdown on protesters, Assad denied responsibility, claiming that he had not ordered security forces to kill or act brutally. He claimed that they're not his forces and suggested that no government intentionally kills its people, unless it is led by a “crazy person.”</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>2014 Elections:</strong>&nbsp;In June 2014, Bashar al-Assad held elections widely considered a sham. Voting was only allowed in government-controlled areas, excluding large parts of northern and eastern Syria held by rebels. Assad's campaign slogan was “sawa,” meaning “together”, but he made no public appearances to discuss his plans. He claimed 88 per cent of the vote. His position was strengthened when Russia agreed to support his forces militarily in September 2014. By February 2016, the conflict had killed around 4.7 lakh and created a refugee crisis.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Chemical Weapons:</strong>&nbsp;In August 2013, the Assad regime faced international condemnation for using chemical weapons against civilians. Despite global outrage, Assad managed to avoid foreign intervention with the help of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who facilitated the removal of Syria's chemical weapons stockpile. By 2013, more than 70,000 people had been killed since 2011. In April 2017, following a new chemical weapons attack, then US President Donald Trump ordered air raids on a Syrian airbase, drawing strong reactions from Assad and his allies, Russia and Iran. In April 2018, another chemical weapons attack led to further international condemnation. Trump called Assad an “animal” and criticised Putin. The US, along with the UK and France, launched air strikes on Syria in 2018.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Hayat Tahrir al-Sham emerged from al-Qaeda-affiliated Jabhat al-Nusra during the Syrian civil war.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Syrian Islamist rebels, spearheaded by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), launched a massive offensive against President Bashar al-Assad's regime this past week. This surprise assault, the largest in years, has led to the capture of over 50 towns and villages in northern Syria and "large parts" of Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city.</p>

<p>HTS and allied rebel forces advanced rapidly from their base in Idlib, Syria's last major opposition stronghold. By Friday, they entered western Aleppo, facing minimal resistance as Assad's troops retreated. The offensive lead to fierce retaliation, including Russian airstrikes on Aleppo – Russia's first in the city since 2016 – killing 277, including 28 civilians.</p>

<p><strong>What is Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS)?</strong></p>

<p>HTS began in 2011 as Jabhat al-Nusra, an Al Qaeda affiliate, and was known for its effectiveness and brutality. “Hayat Tahrir al-Sham” translates to "Organisation for the Liberation of the Levant". Initially aligned with the Free Syrian Army in the uprising against Assad, its strict jihadist ideology soon alienated it from other rebel factions.</p>

<p>Abu Mohammed al-Golani, a former leader of Jabhat al-Nusra, heads HTS. The group follows a Salafi-jihadist ideology, focusing on toppling Assad's government and establishing Islamic rule within Syria. Unlike al-Qaeda, HTS claims “local goals” rather than pursuing a global Islamic Caliphate.</p>

<p>In 2016, the group's leader severed ties with Al Qaeda and rebranded the organisation, which later evolved into HTS after merging with other Islamist groups. Since then, HTS has operated as the dominant force in Idlib, controlling a population of four million, many of whom were displaced during Assad's military campaigns.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>HTS: Governance</strong></p>

<p>Unlike the self-proclaimed Islamic State, HTS shifted its focus from global jihad to establishing fundamentalist Islamic rule within Syria. This localised ambition has allowed HTS to consolidate power in Idlib, where it functions as a de facto government. However, allegations of human rights abuses and bitter infighting with rival factions have tainted its reputation.</p>

<p>HTS governs parts of Syria through the Syrian Salvation Government (SSG), delivering essential services like food aid and welfare programmes to approximately four million residents in its territories. The group controls critical resources, including the Bab al-Hawa border crossing with Turkey, which facilitates humanitarian aid.</p>

<p>For years, HTS avoided large-scale military campaigns, seemingly content with its stronghold in Idlib. The recent offensive in Aleppo, however, signals a shift in strategy.</p>

<p>Idlib has remained a bastion of resistance against Assad since the early years of the conflict. A fragile ceasefire brokered by Russia and Turkey in 2020 allowed HTS to strengthen its grip on the province. Yet, Aleppo's history as a major battleground – where rebels suffered one of their greatest defeats - adds symbolic weight to the current offensive.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Syrian army has said dozens of its soldiers had been killed in a major attack led by Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham rebels who swept into the city of Aleppo, forcing army to redeploy in the biggest challenge to President Bashar al-Assad in years.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Syrian army said on Saturday dozens of its soldiers had been killed in a major attack led by Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham rebels who swept into the city of Aleppo, forcing the army to redeploy in the biggest challenge to President Bashar al-Assad in years.</p>

<p>Russia's Defence Ministry said its air force had carried out strikes on Syrian rebels in support of the country's army, Russian news agencies reported. The strikes followed what was the boldest rebel assault for years in a civil war where front lines had largely been frozen since 2020.</p>

<p>Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, once known as the Nusra Front, is designated a terrorist group by the U.S., Russia, Turkey and other states. Assad is a close Moscow ally.</p>

<p>In Washington, the White House National Security Council said it was closely monitoring the situation and had been in contact with regional capitals over the last 48 hours.</p>

<p>NSC spokesperson Sean Savett said Syria's refusal to engage in a political process and its reliance on Russia and Iran had "created the conditions now unfolding, including the collapse of Assad regime lines in northwest Syria."</p>

<p>Savett said the U.S. had nothing to do with the offensive led by "a designated terrorist organization" and "urged de-escalation ... and a serious and credible political process" under the 2015 U.N. Security Council Resolution 2254, which laid out the steps for a ceasefire and political transition.</p>

<p>The war, which has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced many millions, has ground on since 2011 with no formal end, although most major fighting halted years ago after Iran and Russia helped Assad's government win control of most land and all major cities.</p>

<p>Aleppo had been firmly held by the government since a 2016 victory there, one of the war's major turning points, when Russian-backed Syrian forces besieged and laid waste to rebel-held eastern areas of what had been the country's largest city.</p>

<p>"I am a son of Aleppo, and was displaced from it eight years ago, in 2016. Thank God we just returned. It is an indescribable feeling," said Ali Jumaa, a rebel fighter, in television footage filmed inside the city.</p>

<p>Acknowledging the rebel advance, the Syrian army command said insurgents had entered much of Aleppo.</p>

<p>After the army said it was preparing a counterattack, airstrikes targeted rebel gatherings and convoys in the city, the pro-Damascus newspaper al-Watan reported. One strike caused casualties in Aleppo's Basel square, a resident told Reuters.</p>

<p>The state-run Russian Centre for the Reconciliation of the Enemy Parties in Syria said missile and bomb strikes against the rebels had targeted "militant concentrations, command posts, depots, and artillery positions" in Aleppo and Idlib provinces. It claimed about 300 rebel fighters had been killed.</p>

<p>Images filmed on Saturday showed people posing for photos on a toppled statue of Bassil al-Assad, late brother of the president. Fighters zipped around the city in trucks and milled around in the streets. A man waved a Syrian opposition flag as he stood near Aleppo's historic citadel.</p>

<p>The Syrian military command said militants had attacked in large numbers and from multiple directions, prompting "our armed forces to carry out a redeployment operation aimed at strengthening the defence lines in order to absorb the attack, preserve the lives of civilians and soldiers".</p>

<p>The rebels also took control of Aleppo airport, according to a statement by their operations room and a security source.</p>

<p>Two rebel sources also said the insurgents had captured the city of Maraat al Numan in Idlib province, bringing all of that area under their control.</p>

<p>The fighting revives the long-simmering Syrian conflict as the wider region is roiled by wars in Gaza and Lebanon, where a truce between Israel and the Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah took effect on Wednesday.</p>

<p>With Assad backed by Russia and Iran, and Turkey supporting some of the rebels in the northwest where it maintains troops, the offensive has brought into focus the conflict's knotted geopolitics. Fighting in the northwest had largely abated since Turkey and Russia reached a de-escalation agreement in 2020.</p>

<h2><strong>RUSSIAN, TURKISH MINISTERS TALK</strong></h2>

<p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov held a phone call with his Turkish counterpart, Hakan Fidan, discussing the situation in Syria, Russia's Foreign Ministry said on Saturday.</p>

<p>"Both sides expressed serious concerns at the dangerous development of the situation," the ministry said. They agreed it was necessary to coordinate joint actions to stabilise the situation in the country.</p>

<p>Turkish security officials had said on Thursday that Ankara had prevented operations which opposition groups wanted to organise, in order to avoid further tensions in the region.</p>

<p>Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi told Lavrov in a phone call that the rebel attacks were part of an Israeli-U.S. plan to destabilise the region, Iranian state media said.</p>

<p>The Syrian Civil Defense, a rescue service operating in opposition-held parts of Syria, said in a post on X that Syrian government and Russian aircraft carried out airstrikes on residential neighbourhoods in rebel-held Idlib, killing four civilians and wounding six others.</p>

<p>Two Syrian military sources said Russia has promised Damascus extra military aid that would start arriving in the next 72 hours.</p>

<p>The Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), which spearhead the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces that control much of northeastern and eastern Syria and have long had a foothold in Aleppo, widened their control in the city as government troops left, a senior YPG source said.</p>

<p>Mustafa Abdul Jaber, a commander in the Jaish al-Izza rebel brigade, said the rebels' speedy advance had been helped by a lack of Iran-backed manpower to support the government in the broader Aleppo province.</p>

<p>Iran's regional allies have suffered a series of blows at the hands of Israel as the Gaza war has expanded through the Middle East.</p>

<p>The opposition fighters have said the campaign was in response to stepped-up strikes in recent weeks against civilians by the Russian and Syrian air forces on areas of Idlib province, and to preempt any attacks by the Syrian army.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A mob surrounded senior Bangladesh journalist Munni Saha in Dhaka last night and accused her of spreading misinformation and "doing everything to make Bangladesh a part of India". Ms Saha was heckled as she kept saying, "This is also my country". Eventually, a police team came and took her into custody.</p>

<p>According to reports in Bangladesh media, Ms Saha was wanted in a case linked to a student's death during the anti-reservation protests in the neighbouring country that led to its former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ouster. Police said Ms Saha was rescued from Dhaka's Kawran Bazar area, where a mob had surrounded her.</p>

<p>Rezaul Karim Mallik, a senior officer of Dhaka Metropolitan Police, told The Daily Star Newspaper, "People handed her over to the police. She suffered a panic attack. We have released her after considering her health condition and the fact that she is a woman journalist." Ms Saha has been asked to seek bail from court and comply with police summons in the future.</p>

<p>In a video that has now gone viral, Ms Saha is seen surrounded by a mob. A voice is heard accusing her of misguiding people regarding the 2009 Bangladesh Rifles mutiny that claimed 57 lives. "You are doing everything you can to make this country a part of India. The blood of students is on your hands," the journalist is told as she nods in denial.</p>

<p>"How can you be a citizen of this country and harm this country," she is told. Ms Saha responds, "How have I harmed? This is also my country."</p>

<p>The 55-year-old journalist is the former news head of Bengali channel ATN News. After the Sheikh Hasina administration was toppled, she and several other journalists were charged with crimes against humanity.</p>

<p>The heckling of Ms Saha comes amid concerns over the condition of minority Hindus in Bangladesh after the regime change. A Hindu priest Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari was arrested in Dhaka last week after a Hindu community's protest demanding legal protection and a ministry for minority affairs. The Hindu priest, who was earlier associated with ISKCON, faces a sedition case, allegedly for his remarks on the targeting of Hindus.</p>

<p>ISKCON has now said that two more monks, Adipurush Shyam Das and Ranganath Das Brahmachari, have been arrested after they met Chinmoy Krishna Das. The vice-president of ISKCON Kolkata also said that rioters had vandalised the ISKCON centre in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>Following Hasina's ouster, an interim government helmed by Grameen Bank founder and Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has taken charge. Over the past few months, multiple reports of minority Hindus being targeted in Bangladesh have emerged.</p>

<p>In the aftermath of the priest's arrest, India expressed concern over the rise of "extremist rhetoric, increasing incidents of violence and provocation" in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>The Ministry of External Affairs said that India has consistently raised the issue of targeted attacks on Hindus and other minorities with the Bangladesh government. MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal has urged the interim government in Bangladesh to take steps to protect minorities.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Canadian court has granted bail to Khalistani terrorist Arshdeep Singh Gill, alias Arsh Dalla, the de facto chief of the banned Khalistan Tiger Force, amid India's push for his extradition. The Khalistani terrorist was granted bail on the condition of furnishing a surety bond of $30,000. The next hearing in his case is scheduled for February 24, 2025.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dalla was arrested in Canada's Halton in October after he was injured in an attack by unknown shooters. Since then, India has been trying to extradite him from Canada. Sources said that the Khalistni terrorist was granted despite non-cooperation from the Indian authorities.</p>

<p>They said that despite the bail order, India will continue to follow up on the issue with the Canadian authorities.</p>

<h2><strong>India's Push For Dalla's Extradition</strong></h2>

<p>Last month, the Foreign Ministry said that a court in Canada's Ontario had listed its extradition request for hearing and that it had sent separate requests to verify financial details as provided last year. The ministry labelled Dalla a "proclaimed offender" named in over 50 cases of murder, attempt to murder, extortion and terrorist acts, including terror financing. He was designated a 'terrorist' in January last year and is also an accused in multiple cases filed by the National Investigation Agency.</p>

<p>According to sources, the Khalistani terrorist has been in direct contact with Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI. Delhi also believes that he has taken over the reins of the Khalistani terror outfit after Hardeep Nijjar was shot dead in June 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Arsh Dalla's Arrest</strong></h2>

<p>Sources said that Dalla, a native of Punjab's Moga district, was arrested in Canada's Ontario on October 28. According to sources, Arsh Dalla was passing through the Halton area in a car with his partner Gurjant Singh, when there was an accidental fire from the weapon kept in the vehicle.</p>

<p>"The bullet hit Dalla's right hand, and Singh was also injured. They were admitted to the hospital, where authorities alerted police about them. When questioned about injuries, Dalla then told cops a fake story of an attack on him," they said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the probe, the Canadian police searched their vehicle - a grey Dodge Durango - and found bullet marks on the SUV, and also found two bullet casings on the floor of the passenger's seat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A day later, Dalla's house was searched and a Taurus 9mm handgun, with a loaded magazine, was recovered, as well as a rifle, a shotgun, and two high-capacity magazines in a gun safe. Dalla and his associate, Gurjant Singh, were arrested and booked under several serious charges, including illegal possession of weapons and tampering with evidence.</p>

<h2><strong>Rise of Arsh Dalla</strong></h2>

<p>Dalla, once a local gangster from Dala village of Punjanb's Moga, climbed the list of India's most wanted terrorists after taking over the reins of KTF following Nijjar's assassination last year. He began his criminal career as a local gangster before relocating to Canada in 2020 on a study visa. He returned to Punjab after a dispute with gangster Sukha Lumma. Later, he along with his associates, killed Lumma and fled to Canada again. According to the National Investigation Agency (NIA), Dalla now lives in Surrey, British Columbia, with his family.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As per sources, Dalla recruited young people from Punjab and Haryana via social media to expand his terror network.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bryan Johnson, a millionaire tech entrepreneur leading the longevity movement, is known for his ambitious efforts to reverse ageing, extend health spans, and push the limits of human lifespan to 150 years. His latest post on X, discussing night-time erections, has generated significant attention online. What makes this even more interesting is Mr Johnson's use of Bollywood songs to illustrate his points about these erections.</p>

<p>Mr Johnson has been transparent about using his night-time erections as a "biomarker" for cardiovascular and sexual health. In a recent post, he shared a clip from the 1994 Bollywood film Andaz, featuring Anil Kapoor and Juhi Chawla, along with the song Khada Hai, which is known for its suggestive lyrics. He captioned the video, writing, "Nighttime erections are a biomarker for cardiovascular, physiological, and sexual health."</p>

<p></p>

<p>But Mr Johnson didn't stop there. In a follow-up post, he shared an excerpt from the song Choo Lo by The Local Train, adding, "When your night-time erections are shorter than Lagaan's runtime..."</p>

<p>After this initial post, Mr Johnson's public admission that he doesn't wear underwear sparked even more curiosity. He later shared a quirky, widely circulated video featuring a woman who gained fame on social media for provocatively asking about the colour of people's underwear.&nbsp;In a shirtless video, Johnson said, "Main chaddi nahi pehenta (I don't wear underwear)." He captioned the post, "It's not about the color of your underpants. It's about the length of your nighttime erections."</p>

<p>A user joked, "Whoever is suggesting you bollywood songs needs to be arrested. Being 'too accurate' is dangerous."</p>

<p>"A standing ovation is what you'll receive... when you arrive," another user remarked.</p>

<p>Some users speculated that it is YouTuber and Comedian Tanmay Bhat's doing "Reveal your social media agency for the India tour already. PS: is it Tanmay?"</p>

<p>The fourth user commented, "Acing the meme game Bryan. Love it!"</p>

<p>"Top tier marketing," the fifth user wrote.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

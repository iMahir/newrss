       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Vladimir Putin has replaced the governor of the Kursk region -- partly controlled by Ukraine -- saying it needs a "crisis" manager, after residents voiced anger at the handling of the incursion.</p>

<p>Ukrainian troops launched a shock offensive into Kursk in August, forcing thousands to flee border areas. Ukraine's army said in November it controls 800 square kilometres (310 square miles) of territory in the region.</p>

<p>Putin appointed Alexander Khinshtein -- a prominent pro-Kremlin lawmaker -- as acting Kursk governor late on Thursday.</p>

<p>"There is a need for crisis management there," Putin said in a meeting with Khinshtein.</p>

<p>"The most important thing is to organise work on helping people," he added.</p>

<p>Acknowledging communications failures, Khinshtein told Putin: "We have to do all we can so that all residents of Kursk region fully feel that they are part of our one big country."</p>

<p>The previous regional chief, Alexei Smirnov, became acting governor in May and was inaugurated in September. He left voluntarily, according to the Kremlin and wrote on Telegram he has a new post.</p>

<p>Smirnov had drawn criticism over his appearances at televised meetings after the incursion, appearing formulaic and lacking a personal touch.</p>

<p>Putin considers Khinshtein "can better deal with this role", said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, denying there was any "grievances" against Smirnov.</p>

<p>Since August, Kursk locals have taken to social media to voice anger at the lack of warnings over the incursion and the handling of the crisis.</p>

<p>Some have created video messages to Putin pleading for help, though discontent is rarely shown on official media.</p>

<p>Some residents of Olgovka, about 17 kilometres (10 miles) from the border, said their village looks "like a scene from a horror film" and "we have found ourselves homeless".</p>

<p>"Some of our fellow villagers were killed, some are missing, since evacuation was not announced and some did not have time to leave," a village spokesman said.</p>

<p>At a public meeting last month, former Kursk governor Roman Starovoit, now transport minister, acknowledged the Russian military had looted in a district under their control, after official media blamed Ukrainians.</p>

<p>Starovoit told a Life News journalist Friday: "I hope (Khinshtein) will have enough experience to organise communications, first and foremost," calling it a "shortcoming" of the ousted Smirnov.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday linked an arson attack on a synagogue in Australia to what he called Canberra's "anti-Israel sentiment".</p>

<p>Police in the Australian city of Melbourne said mask-wearing arsonists attacked a synagogue before dawn on Friday. They were still searching for the suspects and said they did not know why the premises had been targeted.</p>

<p>In a statement, Netanyahu said that "this heinous act cannot be separated from the anti-Israel sentiment emanating from the Australian Labor government."</p>

<p>He cited Canberra's "outrageous decision" to vote for a United Nations General Assembly resolution that demanded the end of Israel's "unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory".</p>

<p>Netanyahu argued that "anti-Israel sentiment is anti-Semitism".</p>

<p>Australia's was among 157 votes in favour of the resolution on December 3, after it abstained in a similar vote in September.</p>

<p>No serious injuries were reported in the fire which eviscerated much of the synagogue building. Congregants were only beginning to gather for morning prayers as the attack took place, a board member said.</p>

<p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said federal police would help their state counterparts to investigate. He condemned the attack and said he had "zero tolerance" for anti-Semitism.</p>

<p>"This violence and intimidation and destruction at a place of worship is an outrage," he said in a statement.</p>

<p>Netanyahu called the attack "a vile, classic anti-Semitic act, and I expect the authorities in Australia to use the full extent of their power to prevent such anti-Semitic attacks in the future".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UK's Prince William will attend Saturday's re-opening of Notre Dame cathedral in Paris, Kensington Palace said on Friday, but his wife, Catherine, will not accompany him.</p>

<p>"The Prince of Wales will travel to Paris tomorrow to attend the ceremony marking the reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral," the palace said in a statement.</p>

<p>"His Royal Highness is travelling at the request of His Majesty's Government on behalf of the United Kingdom," it added.</p>

<p>Around 50 heads of state and government are expected in the French capital for the ceremony. US president-elect Donald Trump is also to attend.</p>

<p>Buckingham Palace did not immediately reply to an AFP request on whether King Charles III would attend. Kensington Palace said that Catherine would not be in Paris.</p>

<p>Charles, who is the head of the Church of England, is currently undergoing treatment for cancer. Catherine, also known as Kate, has gradually begun resuming public engagements after also being diagnosed with cancer earlier this year.</p>

<p>Charles's wife, Queen Camilla, recently fell ill with pneumonia and has had to cancel some of her appearances.</p>

<p>France last week showed off to the world the gleaming restored interior of the 850-year-old mediaeval cathedral, which was hit by a huge fire in 2019.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump's pick to helm NASA, a private astronaut and close ally of Elon Musk's SpaceX, is a central figure of a speedy, commercial-focused side of the space industry who would face unfamiliar political challenges as an administrator.</p>

<p>Jared Isaacman, the CEO of payment processing company Shift4 Payments, has made landmark visits to space on two ambitious SpaceX missions, including the first-ever privately funded spacewalk in September.</p>

<p>In accepting Trump's decision, he envisioned a "thriving space economy" and vowed to "usher in an era where humanity becomes a true spacefaring civilization."</p>

<p>But the path to pursuing a faster, more privatized human spaceflight agenda is expected to involve a delicate political tango of trimming costly, entrenched programs and wooing lawmakers to increase the space agency's $25 billion budget.</p>

<p>"He's going to definitely push NASA, but he'll do it in a positive way," said Garrett Reisman, a retired NASA astronaut who has been an adviser to SpaceX.</p>

<p>Musk had recommended Trump pick Isaacman and has since told associates he sees the tech billionaire as someone who will get things done at NASA, according to two people familiar with the discussions.</p>

<p>"He is a man (of) high ability and integrity," Musk said Wednesday of Isaacman on his X platform.</p>

<p>Targets at NASA for Trump and Musk's cost-cutting agenda that Isaacman is expected to eye include the agency's over-budget, $24 billion Space Launch System rocket and the in-development Gateway space station poised to sit in a lunar orbit, according to people familiar with the transition team's space plans.</p>

<p>Other projects expected to face scrutiny include the agency's goal to return soil samples from Mars - another top NASA priority alongside its Artemis moon program.</p>

<p>While likely to face pushback from lawmakers, cuts to expensive NASA programs could mean boosts to companies such as SpaceX that have embraced cheaper and faster means of getting to space and offering rockets to the government as a privately owned service.</p>

<p>That approach has contrasted with the space agency's traditional method of company contracting where companies like Boeing and Lockheed Martin build spacecraft that the agency itself owns, controls and fully funds.</p>

<p>Trump's first NASA administrator, former Oklahoma congressman Jim Bridenstine, proved adept at navigating those political challenges. He was instrumental in winning budget boosts for NASA's flagship crewed space exploration program and upping its dependence on private companies.</p>

<p>Bridenstine in a statement Wednesday night urged for Isaacman's Senate confirmation, saying his "vision for pushing boundaries, paired with his proven track record of success in private industry, positions him as an ideal candidate to lead NASA into a bold new era of exploration and discovery."</p>

<p>Since Trump's first term, NASA has focused heavily on returning humans to the moon. But the Artemis program using NASA's powerful Space Launch System (SLS) rocket to send astronauts to space and Musk's Starship rocket to land them on the moon has faced budget blowouts and delays, pushing the planned landing back to 2027.</p>

<p>NASA's reliance on SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, providing astronaut rides to the International Space Station at a cheaper price than previous options, has reinforced the agency's commercial cost-savings strategy. It has also galvanized a industry culture that threatens the future of NASA's older and far more expensive SLS rocket, built mainly by Boeing and Northrop Grumman with a countrywide workforce of 28,000.</p>

<p>"Administrator-nominee Isaacman, if confirmed, will face challenges as he leads NASA into the future," said Dan Stohr, CEO of the industry group Coalition for Deep Space Exploration, which counts Boeing and Lockheed Martin as members.</p>

<p>"Budget limitations, workforce, and infrastructure needs will all play a role in shaping NASA's future," Stohr added.</p>

<p>NASA's current administrator, Bill Nelson, said he spoke with Isaacman to congratulate his tentative nomination and feels "basically optimistic" about the future of NASA under Trump.</p>

<p>"I think the relationship between Elon Musk and the president-elect is going to be a benefit to making sure that the funding for NASA is there, so I see that as a positive," Nelson told a press conference on Thursday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[India on Friday demanded that Pakistan act against terrorist Masood Azhar, chief of banned terrorism group Jaish-e-Mohammed and the mastermind behind terror strikes like the 2011 Parliament attack.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>India on Friday demanded that Pakistan act against terrorist <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/masood-azhar" target="_blank">Masood Azhar</a>, chief of banned terrorism group <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/jaish-e-mohammed" target="_blank">Jaish-e-Mohammed</a> and the mastermind behind terror strikes like the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/2011-parliament-attack" target="_blank">2011 Parliament attack</a>.</p>

<p>The strong statement followed reports of a public speech by Azhar - his first in 21 years - at an Islamic seminary in Bahawalpur in Pakistan's Punjab province, in which he reportedly vowed to continue attacks on India and used a derogatory word for Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p>

<p>Referring to reports of Azhar's speech, External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal, at a scheduled press briefing, also pointed out that it, if true, "had exposed Pakistan's duplicity" in containing terrorist outfits and terrorists operating from its soil to launch cross-border attacks.</p>

<p>"Masood Azhar is involved in cross-border terror attacks in India. We demand strong action be taken against him, so he is brought to justice. There has been a denial that he is not there in Pakistan... but, if the reports are correct, then it exposes the duplicity of Pakistan," Mr Jaiswal told reporters.</p>

<p>In his outrageous speech Azhar reportedly also called Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a "mouse", and declared his intention to step up terror attacks in Jammu and Kashmir.</p>

<p>The speech was reportedly delivered sometime in November.</p>

<p>Azhar is among India's most-wanted terrorists.</p>

<p>In September 2019 India branded Azhar and another Pak-based terrorist, Lashkar-e-Taiba founder Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, as 'individual terrorists' under the stringent anti-terror law UAPA.</p>

<p>Apart from the attack on Parliament in 2001, in which two security personnel were killed, he is also linked to strike on Central Reserve Police Force personnel in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama in 2019.</p>

<p>He also orchestrated an attack on the Indian consulate in Afghanistan's Mazar-e-Sharif in 2016.</p>

<p>In August 2020, after more than a year of demanding Pak admit its responsibility for the Pulwama terror attack, the Indian government slammed its neighbour for continuing to shelter Azhar.</p>

<p>Anurag Srivastava, then the MEA spokesperson, had said, "Jaish-e- Mohammed claimed responsibility for the Pulwama attack. The organisation and its leadership are in Pakistan and it is regrettable Masood Azhar, the first accused, continues to find shelter in that country."</p>

<p>In January of this year, social media posts - apparently from Pakistan-based users - declared that Masood Azhar had died in a bomb blast while returning from a mosque.</p>

<p>A fact-check, however, confirmed the news as fake. The photo of the blast that allegedly killed Azhar was found to have first been posted five years ago in an unrelated explosion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[BJP, which leads the coalition of parties currently in Government in India, has directly accused the US State Department of trying to "destabilise India". It also claimed that the US "deep state" is working to "target Prime Minister Narendra Modi".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Bharatiya Janata Party or BJP, which leads the coalition of parties currently in Government in India, has directly accused the US State Department of trying to "destabilise India". It also claimed that the US "deep state" is working to "target Prime Minister Narendra Modi".</p>

<p>In a press conference, the BJP spokesperson said, "It has always been the US State Department behind this agenda"</p>

<h2><strong>BJP CLAIMS THERE'S A NEXUS</strong></h2>

<p>Sambit Patra, the spokesperson of the ruling BJP, claimed that elements in the US deep state have colluded with a group of journalists and with India's opposition leader Rahul Gandhi to put a spoke in the wheel of India's growth story with unsubstantiated allegations and malicious reports without a "shred of evidence". He suggested at a press conference that all this is in conjunction with the "US State Department".</p>

<p>The BJP also slammed Rahul Gandhi for using reports by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project or OCCRP that "singularly focused" on targeting the Adani Group and its alleged closeness to the government to undermine PM Modi - all "baseless charges", and without a "shred of evidence".</p>

<p>The BJP spokesperson then cited a French media report that showed that OCCRP was funded by the US Agency for International Development and "other deep state figures" like George Soros. "The Deep State had a clear objective to destabilise India by targeting Prime Minister Modi," the BJP said.</p>

<p>It added that "It has always been the US State Department behind this agenda...OCCRP has served as a media tool for carrying out a deep state agenda."</p>

<p>"A French investigative media group has revealed that 50% of OCCRP's funding comes directly from the US State Department," Mr Patra said.</p>

<p>The BJP spokesperson then accused Rahul Gandhi of being a "traitor of the highest order". He also said that "some agencies of America" and billionaire George Soros make a "dangerous triangle trying to destabilise India".</p>

<p>Sambit Patra's charge was then repeated by his party colleague Nishikant Dubey in Parliament. Mr Dubey accused the Congress of "conspiring with foreign forces" to derail the government because of their "hatred" for PM Modi.</p>

<p>Mr Dubey called for opposition leader Rahul Gandhi to be thoroughly investigated for meeting with controversial business tycoon George Soros, who he claimed "routinely conspires to derail economies of other countries" and American lawmakers like Ilhan Omar, who have strongly opposed Prime Minister Modi and his administration. "The Congress must answer... what transpired in meetings with those who have a history of peddling anti-India agenda on Rahul Gandhi's foreign tours," he said.</p>

<h2><strong>CONGRESS RESPONDS, DEMANDS APOLOGY</strong></h2>

<p>This resulted in a sharp reaction from the Congress, which called it the "most unfortunate incident". Congress MP Shashi Tharoor slammed Mr Dubey and his "outrageous statement".</p>

<p>"No 1, you cannot attack people in a defamatory manner. No 2, you cannot take anyone's name without giving them notice in writing in advance, and No 3, you cannot assault parliamentary privilege. He violated all those three rules and he was allowed to go on speaking and ranting for quite some time... so we objected to that. The House was initially adjourned. We went to see the Speaker and we said this has to be expunged from the record. The person must apologise," Mr Tharoor said.</p>

<p>OCCRP admitted to "some funding" by the US government. The media group said in a statement that it was an independent media outlet and not associated with any political party. "The US government, while providing some funding to OCCRP, has no say in our editorial processes and no control over our reporting," it said, according to a report in news agency Reuters.</p>

<p>The US State Department has not yet responded to these charges.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[This is a big decision taken by the Bangladesh government because Rahman has been a part of the currency since the country's inception on March 4th, 1972.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangabandhu (friend of Bangladesh) - the name by which Sheikh Mujibur Rahman had been known, seems quite ironic to what's happening there, since the country identifies him as a nemesis now. Bangladesh is set to erase the image of Rahman, the iconic founding father of the country, from its currency notes.</p>

<p>"We aim to release the new notes within the next six months," said Husneara Shikha, Executive Editor of Bangladesh Bank.</p>

<p>This is a big decision taken by the Bangladesh government because Rahman has been a part of the currency since the country's inception on March 4th, 1972.</p>

<p>Since Hasina fled Bangladesh after the student-led protests, Muhammad Yunus, a Nobel laureate, took charge as the Chief Adviser of an interim government.</p>

<p>Months after ousting Sheikh Hasina as the Prime Minister, Bangladesh is set to remove her father, from the face of Bangladesh currency and print new notes Taka 20, 100, 500, and 1,000 - as Bangladesh Bank has confirmed. This takes place just weeks after Rahman's portrait was taken down from Yunus' office as a "concession" given to the student protesters from the caretaker government.</p>

<p>Mahfuz Alam, an adviser to the government, said "Photo of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman- Post '71 Fascist, is removed from Darbar Hall. It is a shame for us that we couldn't remove his picture from Bangabhaban after the 5th August. Apologies. But, he won't be seen anywhere till people's July spirit lives on."</p>

<p>The central bank has further added that the "graffiti" drawn during the July protests, with some religious structures and Bengali traditions will be included in the designing of the new notes.</p>

<p>This move can be perceived as the country trying to make a shift from its identity and the legacy of Bangabandhu. It is also interesting to note that a national holiday on August 15th has been cancelled, since that day marked the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Along with this, several institutions have been renamed, removing Hasina and Rahman from their legacy.</p>

<p>In her recent remarks, Hasina accused Yunus of being "involved in genocide" and failing to protect minorities in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>However, Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal has termed her comments as "hate speech", and the country's leaders said a smear campaign is going on against the Yunus government.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US high school teacher has claimed that she was fired over a Facebook post she made criticising president-elect Donald Trump and his followers. According to <em>The Independent,</em> Joanie Garratt was an AP History teacher with over 30 years in the Beverly Hills Unified School District (BHUSD). She says she was fired from the school on November 13, less than a month before her planned retirement on December 5. Her lawyer claims she was terminated because of an anti-Trump post, which also involved her reaction to a group of pro-Trump students who gathered on November 6 to celebrate Trump's re-election.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In her post, Ms Garratt wrote she was "disheartened" by a march at Beverly Hills High School in support of President-elect Donald Trump, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/beverly-hills-teacher-trump-facebook-b2659610.html" rel="noindex,nofollow">outlet </a>reported. She also claimed that during the demonstration, Trump supporters "harassed and intimidated many other non-MAGA students and specifically targeted the class where Black Student Union was meeting, telling all kinds of racial slurs".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Some students arrived at school truly upset &amp; even crying only to be bullied later by their classmates. And don't blame the administration for this. They are dealing with it. This comes from their leader, His Majesty, King Trump," Ms Garrat wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Her lawyer said that following the Facebook post, the district's superintendent called her to let her know that her social media post led to her dismissal. The official did not cite any other explanation, the attorney said, in a news release.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Garratt never discussed Trump, the election or the pro-Trump students' demonstration in her classes. Her comment was made on her own Facebook account, on her own time, and is a prime example of political speech that's protected under the First Amendment and California labour and education codes," the release stated.</p>

<p>"Joanie's post, which criticized harassment at the rally and attributed student conduct to political rhetoric whipped up as part of Donald Trump's re-election strategy, is constitutionally protected speech," the attorney added.</p>

<p>However, Superintendent Michael Bregy disagreed with that characterisation. "Ms Garratt retired from full-time teaching in BHUSD years ago and was serving and remains a substitute teacher in the District. No action was taken to dismiss her or any other employee in the last month," he wrote in a statement, per the outlet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Our focus remains on fostering an educational environment where students and staff are respected and valued. We encourage meaningful discussions that prioritize mutual understanding, respect, and accountability. BHUSD will continue to uphold its standards and policies to ensure that our schools are spaces where all voices can be expressed thoughtfully and responsibly. We trust these facts will clarify this matter," he added.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A cargo ship loaded with Norwegian weapons destined to protect a Polish logistics hub that distributes military aid to Ukraine has run aground off Norway's coast, authorities said Friday.</p>

<p>The civilian vessel Finlandia Seaways was transporting some of the weapons Oslo announced Monday to protect the hub when it ran aground off southwestern Norway on Thursday.</p>

<p>"The vessel hit a shoal and suffered damage to the rudder and propeller. It had to be tugged to a dock," a spokesman for the Sola rescue centre, Thomas Breivoll, told AFP.</p>

<p>"There was nothing dramatic about it," he added.</p>

<p>Norway's defence ministry is sending F-35 jet fighters, NASAMS surface-to-air missiles and around 100 soldiers to protect the Rzeszow hub in Poland as part of a NATO member state rotation.</p>

<p>A large part of Western military aid to Ukraine, which has been fending off Russia's invasion since 2022, transits through the logistical hub in southeastern Poland.</p>

<p>According to Hanne Olafsen, a spokeswoman for the Norwegian armed forces, the ship was transporting "elements of the anti-air materiel destined for Poland".</p>

<p>"This will undoubtedly lead to a slight delay" in the contingent's deployment, she told AFP.</p>

<p>The military equipment will be transferred from the Finlandia Seaways to another vessel, and the area around the ship has been secured.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Paris' Notre-Dame Cathedral reopens on Saturday, December 7, five and a half years after fire destroyed its roof and spire and caused major damage throughout.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Paris' Notre-Dame Cathedral reopens on Saturday, December 7, five and a half years after fire destroyed its roof and spire and caused major damage throughout.</p>

<p>Here is what you need to know:</p>

<p><strong>WHAT IS NOTRE-DAME?</strong></p>

<p>A medieval Gothic masterpiece, Notre-Dame de Paris (Our Lady of Paris) is one of the French capital's most beloved and visited monuments, celebrated for its rib vaulting, flying buttresses, stunning stained-glass windows and carved stone gargoyles.</p>

<p>The first stone was laid in 1163, and construction continued for much of the next century, with major restoration and additions made in the 17th and 18th centuries.</p>

<p>Victor Hugo helped make the cathedral a symbol of both Paris and France when he used it as a setting for his 1831 novel, "The Hunchback of Notre-Dame". Quasimodo, the main character, has been portrayed in Hollywood movies, an animated Disney adaptation and in musicals.</p>

<p><strong>WHY AND HOW DID IT BURN?</strong></p>

<p>On the evening of April 15, 2019, the cathedral's roof burst into flames. Soon, the fire had engulfed the spire and almost toppled the main bell towers. Around the world, TV viewers watched with horror.</p>

<p>Much of the roof collapsed but the bell towers and facade held.</p>

<p>It remains unclear what exactly caused the fire. Authorities have ruled out arson and said an electrical fault or a burning cigarette may have been responsible.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT WILL HAPPEN AT THE OPENING CEREMONY?</strong></p>

<p>Scheduled to begin around 7 p.m. (1800 GMT), the non-religious part of the ceremony will take place in a big tent in the cathedral's forecourt. It will start with the screening of a documentary on the reconstruction, followed by live classical music.</p>

<p>President Emmanuel Macron, who is embroiled in a political crisis after the collapse of the French government, will give a brief speech. Participants will then sing La Marseillaise, the national anthem, after which Paris' Archbishop Laurent Ulrich will knock on the cathedral's heavy doors with his crozier.</p>

<p>From within the cathedral, a psalm will be sung three times and the doors will then open. Ulrich will bless the ancient organ before it starts playing. This will be followed by a religious service.</p>

<p>US President-elect Donald Trump will be among the guests, as will President Joe Biden's wife Jill and dozens of heads of state and government.</p>

<p>The religious ceremony is due to end around 2000 GMT, with a concert outside the cathedral starting shortly afterwards.</p>

<p><strong>FIRST MASS IN RESTORED NOTRE-DAME TO BE HELD ON SUNDAY</strong></p>

<p>The archbishop will celebrate a Mass, starting at 10:30 a.m. (0930 GMT), the first of eight days of Masses devoted to the reopening and open to specific groups of the faithful and of guests, such as donors on December 11 and firefighters on December 15. Some of the Masses, including on the evening of Dec. 8, at 6:30 p.m. (1730 GMT), will be open to the general public.</p>

<p><strong>WHEN CAN YOU VISIT?</strong></p>

<p>If you're lucky, you can visit on the evening of Dec. 8 from 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. but there is at first likely to be fierce competition - and long queues - to visit the cathedral.</p>

<p>The cathedral says that from Dec. 7, visitors will be able to book a free ticket online, on its website, social media or a dedicated app, to get into the building on the same day or one or two days after booking. There will also be a queue on the spot for those who want to enter without a booking.</p>

<p>The cathedral has also created an app to help self-guide visits.</p>

<p>Groups will only get access next year - from February 1 for religious groups or from June 9th for tourists with guides.</p>

<p>The cathedral expects to welcome 14 to 15 million visitors every year. There is a huge debate in France over whether visitors should pay to get in. The Church is against it, and for now visiting remains free.</p>

<p><strong>HOW WAS THE CATHEDRAL REBUILT?</strong></p>

<p>Money poured in from all over the world, including from French luxury sector billionaires Francois Henri Pinault and the Arnault family. So much money has been donated - more than 840 million euros ($888 million), according to Macron's office - that there will even be funds left over for further investment in the building.</p>

<p>The damage has needed five years' worth of restoration work.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT HAS CHANGED?</strong></p>

<p>Officials say the cathedral is more beautiful than ever, not only because its spire, roof and anything else destroyed by the fire was rebuilt by thousands of expert craftspeople, but also because the stone and paintings, which had blackened over the years, have been thoroughly cleaned. The furniture was also renovated and cleaned, or replaced.</p>

<p>Not everything was damaged in the fire. For instance, emergency workers formed a human chain to whisk gem-studded chalices and other priceless artefacts out of harm's way.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A video showcasing Dubai's safety is going viral on social media, sparking a lively discussion among netizens. In the clip, influencer Leyla Afshonkar stages a prank to test the city's safety. She leaves her gold jewellery on the hood of a parked car and observes from a distance how passersby react. To her astonishment, pedestrians walk by without so much as glancing at the gold. At one point, a woman even picks up a fallen piece of jewellery and places it back on the car.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The video opens with Ms Afshonkar placing a gold necklace and earrings on the bonnet of a blue BMW. She then steps inside a nearby shop, leaving the valuable items exposed. To her surprise, the gold jewellery remains untouched throughout. "It's been half an hour, and literally no one has touched the gold. And tell me Dubai is not the safest country in the world," she says in the clip.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Afshonkar shared the video a few days back. Since then, it has accumulated more than 20 million views and over 1 million likes. The clip sparked a discussion online, with some praising Dubai's safety, and others questioning the authenticity of the stunt.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"If you touch it, they will whip you in jail and will deport you back home and ban forever from entering the country. It's not the people and safety, it's the law that dictates safety," commented one user. "Is Dubai really this safe? Or do they pay influencers for such marketing?" asked another.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, some users vouched for the city's safety. "It is really safe. People are afraid that if they get caught, the punishment is swift and strict. You must see the service cabbies provide there. If their rating drops below 4.7, they're sent back to Pakistan or India," wrote one user.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I once forgot my handbag with a laptop, passport, and cash. An hour later, I realized it was missing. Two hours after that, I retrieved it from the exact spot where I left it. Nobody touched it!" shared another.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"You can leave your wallet and phone on a table in a food court, and no one will touch it. Done it multiple times. This is how society should function globally!" commented a third user.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Dubai is safe but this video is scripted as (0:16) same girl in white &amp; black spotted (0:38) standing behind this main girl at jewellery store watching all these recorded videos," pointed out one X user.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Indeed, Dubai is incredibly safe, which sometimes makes its residents a bit careless, leading to challenges when they travel to countries with different safety standards," remarked another.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin will hold his annual press conference on December 19, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in televised comments Friday, saying it will include foreign media.</p>

<p>The televised marathon event will take place a month before US President-elect Donald Trump takes over at the White House and as Russian forces make advances in Ukraine.</p>

<p>The event, during which Putin answers journalists' questions and takes calls from members of the public, will be called "Results of the year with Vladimir Putin", Peskov said.</p>

<p>He confirmed that international media will be able to participate, after Russia imposed restrictions and entry bans on foreign journalists working in Russia over the last year in what it calls reciprocal measures.</p>

<p>"Journalists from federal, regional and international media will be accredited," Peskov said.</p>

<p>Representatives of international media attending "will mainly be foreigners working under current accreditation in Russia," Peskov said, while some other Western media will be present.</p>

<p>The event will start noon Moscow time (0900 GMT), the state TASS news agency reported.</p>

<p>Last year's event took more than four hours.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A priceless piece of history, a Roman gold aureus bearing the image of Brutus, the infamous assassin of Julius Caesar, is set to auction in Geneva on Monday. The coin, considered a national treasure, is expected to fetch over a million Swiss francs, with bidding starting at 750,000 francs ($852,000).</p>

<p>Frank Baldacci, head of Numismatica Genevensis (NGSA), describes the coin as "a piece of history" and "the Da Vinci of Roman coins", adding that "a numismatist's eyes light up when beholding a coin like this".</p>

<p>The aureus, gold currency used in ancient Rome, weighing 8 grams, is one of only 17 known examples and features Brutus's profile framed with laurel leaves on one side, celebrating his military victories on the other.</p>

<p>Struck shortly before the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC, the coin holds immense historical importance, both artistically and politically. Baldacci notes that the laurel wreath and inscription "IMP" (for emperor) suggest Brutus's ambition to promote himself as emperor, despite not holding the title.</p>

<p>The coin's journey spans centuries, traveling discreetly through private collections, including princes and lords collections during the Renaissance. It resurfaced in the 1950s and was sold to a private collector in 2006 for 360,000 Swiss francs.</p>

<p>"This is a coin returning to market after a generation," Baldacci said.</p>

<p>To guarantee its authenticity, the coin is encased in an airtight box, with certification by specialists involving comparison with other ancient coins and gold analysis.</p>

<p>This exceptional rare coin offers a unique opportunity to acquire a piece of history, making it a coveted treasure for collectors and historians alike.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[South Korea's main opposition leader Lee Jae-myung warned that President Yoon Suk Yeol might make another attempt to declare martial law before parliament votes on impeaching him on Saturday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korea's main opposition leader Lee Jae-myung warned that President Yoon Suk Yeol might make another attempt to declare martial law before parliament votes on impeaching him on Saturday.</p>

<p>Yoon's brief imposition of martial law late on Tuesday sent Asia's fourth-largest economy into turmoil, with Lee's Democratic Party and other minor parties pushing to pass an impeachment motion against Yoon as early as Saturday afternoon.</p>

<p>As Lee was preparing for an interview with Reuters at his office within the National Assembly building on Friday afternoon, rumours spread that Yoon might visit the parliament, prompting opposition lawmakers to scramble to gather to block him, fearing another attempt at martial law.</p>

<p>Yoon's office said he was not planning to visit and the acting defence minister said reports about a possible second martial law order were untrue.</p>

<p>But Lee said there was still a possibility of another spontaneous late-night declaration to try to turn around the situation, though he did not offer substantive evidence.</p>

<p>"The situation is getting worse, there are fewer ways to escape, and he might see it as a breakthrough to destroy the existing systems and create a situation where he can do whatever with his power, however unreasonable that might be," Lee said.</p>

<p>"That's why it's very dangerous tonight, because the only chance he has is tonight and tomorrow morning."</p>

<p><strong>IMPEACHMENT VOTE</strong></p>

<p>The impeachment requires support from two-thirds of the 300-member assembly to pass, which means at least eight of the 108 legislators from Yoon's ruling People Power Party (PPP) must vote for it.</p>

<p>The conservative PPP has said it would block Yoon's impeachment, a formal position it reaffirmed late on Friday after a lengthy meeting of its lawmakers.</p>

<p>That came even though its chief, Han Dong-hoon, had earlier said that Yoon needed to be removed from power.</p>

<p>Lee said Han's view might not represent the official party line, but the likelihood for passing the motion was increasing.</p>

<p>"Even if he may avoid it tomorrow, the conclusion will eventually come down to one thing whether it be the day after tomorrow, a week later or a month later - the only way to tackle the situation is to impeach him unless he resigns," he said.</p>

<p>If parliament votes to impeach, the president is suspended from duty until the Constitutional Court decides whether to oust him. The prime minister serves in an acting capacity until a snap election is held.</p>

<p>Lee, who narrowly lost to Yoon in the 2022 presidential election, is seen as a top contender if Yoon is removed and a snap election is held.</p>

<p>A criminal conviction in November for an election law violation and further pending criminal cases may jeopardize his standing to run, however, and many members of Yoon's party have cited the need to stop Lee as a reason to oppose impeachment.</p>

<p>When asked if he would run, Lee said now was not the time to think about it, but to gather all strength to overcome the crisis as soon as possible before economic and diplomatic repercussions become serious.</p>

<p>"The current situation is not from a problem rooted in our country or democracy, but it's like a virus that happened to infiltrate into our perfectly functioning system," he said.</p>

<p>"So we have to focus on removing the virus. With proper, rapid treatment, we will recover, and through the process, our nation and democracy will become even stronger."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Armed with a growing file of clues, New York police on Friday were scouring surveillance videos and asking the public for help in their search for the masked assailant who gunned down a UnitedHealth executive on a Midtown Manhattan sidewalk.</p>

<p>Brian Thompson, 50, the CEO of UnitedHealth's insurance unit and a father of two, was shot from behind early on Wednesday in what police described as a brazen and targeted attack. It came just before the company's annual investor conference at the Hilton on Sixth Avenue.</p>

<p>Police have released multiple photos of the suspect that were captured by security cameras from around town during his stay in New York. They have yet to publicly identify the man, who was last seen riding an electric bicycle into Central Park.</p>

<p>Police offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction.</p>

<p>The words "deny," "defend" and "depose" were carved into shell casings found at the scene, police sources told ABC and the New York Post. A New York City Police Department spokesperson would not comment on the report.</p>

<p>The words evoke the title of author Jay Feinman's 2010 book critical of the insurance industry entitled "Delay Deny Defend: Why Insurance Companies Don't Pay Claims and What You Can Do About It." Feinman, a professor emeritus at Rutgers University Law School, declined to comment.</p>

<p>UnitedHealth is the largest US health insurer, providing benefits to tens of millions of Americans, who pay more for healthcare than people in any other country. Thompson joined UnitedHealth in 2004 and became the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, a unit of UnitedHealth Group, in April 2021.</p>

<p>Investigators believe the suspect arrived in New York City on November 24 after traveling from Atlanta by bus, CNN reported, citing unnamed law enforcement sources. The suspect checked into a hostel in the city with a fake identification and paid with cash, CNN reported.</p>

<p>Detectives believe the perpetrator was experienced with firearms based on how he slowly and deliberately carried out the shooting, CNN reported, citing police sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was ongoing.</p>

<p>Security video showed the shooter, wearing a hooded sweatshirt, ski mask and a gray backpack, walking up behind Thompson, raising his handgun and firing at his back. Police said the gunman arrived outside the hotel several minutes before Thompson and waited for him to walk past before firing, ignoring other passers-by.</p>

<p>CNN, whose reporter John Miller is a former NYPD deputy commissioner, said police found a phone in an alley that the gunman ran through and also recovered a water bottle the shooter bought just minutes before the attack.</p>

<p>A fingerprint on the water bottle was too smudged to provide further clues about the shooter, the New York Times reported, citing a senior law enforcement official.</p>

<p>New York has one of the most advanced surveillance systems of any major US city, largely built after the attacks of September 11, 2001, said Felipe Rodriguez, a former NYPD detective sergeant who is now an adjunct professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York.</p>

<p>There are thousands of cameras in New York and all feeds can be monitored in real time as well as reviewed for previous video, aided by facial recognition software.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A senior Hong Kong judge sided with the government on Friday and dismissed the first legal challenge to the city's newly enacted national security law, which had been brought by a jailed protester.</p>

<p>Ma Chun-man -- known as "Captain America 2.0" for carrying a replica of the Marvel superhero's shield during democracy rallies in 2019 -- was imprisoned for "inciting secession" under a national security law imposed by Beijing in 2020.</p>

<p>He had hoped to receive a one-third sentence remission -- typically granted to inmates for good behaviour -- and be released in March.</p>

<p>But the passage of another national security law this year effectively banned remission for people convicted of national security crimes, and Ma's request for early release was denied.</p>

<p>Ma challenged the decision, but on Friday the court said the new system was "sufficiently precise and certain".</p>

<p>"There is no question of Mr Ma being subject to any additional or heavier penalty by operation" of the new rules, High Court judge Alex Lee ruled.</p>

<p>"The applicant's substantive judicial review is dismissed," said Lee, who is among a pool of jurists selected by Hong Kong's leader to hear security cases.</p>

<p>Both of Hong Kong's national security laws have been criticised by Western nations such as the United States for quashing dissent and curtailing freedoms in the city.</p>

<p>Hong Kong authorities have defended the laws as necessary to restore order following the huge and sometimes violent pro-democracy protests in 2019.</p>

<p>Under the second law, national security prisoners are now "not entitled to remission", city leader John Lee has said, with the rule change covering those already serving time.</p>

<p>An exception can be made only if Hong Kong's prison chief is satisfied that an early release would not be contrary to national security interests.</p>

<p>Ma's lawyers argued that the definition of "interests of national security" was too vague.</p>

<p>But government lawyers responded that "national security is really a constantly evolving concept... not capable of being inflexibly defined".</p>

<p>Ma, a former food delivery worker, was sentenced to nearly six years in jail after being found guilty of "inciting secession" by chanting Hong Kong independence slogans, an offence under the first national security law.</p>

<p>The sentence was reduced to five years after a successful appeal in 2022.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Guardian Media Group announced Friday it had agreed to sell the world's oldest Sunday newspaper, The Observer, to online news company Tortoise Media, brushing aside strikes by staff.</p>

<p>The announcement by GMG and its owner came despite a 48-hour strike this week by more than 500 journalists at the Guardian daily and Observer opposing the deal.</p>

<p>"The boards of the Guardian Media Group and its owner, the Scott Trust, have in principle approved the sale of The Observer to Tortoise Media," a statement said.</p>

<p>"The new ownership model will protect The Observer's future, championing the voice of liberal values and investing in exceptional journalism," it added.</p>

<p>Tortoise, a "slow news" outlet founded in 2019, had approached GMG with an offer to buy the publication and invest more than £25 million ($32 million) over the next five years in the "editorial and commercial renewal of the title".</p>

<p>Unionised staff members last month voted 93 percent in favour of strike action, accusing the Scott Trust of "betrayal" over the sale.</p>

<p>"I recognise how unsettling this period has been for Observer staff, but we're confident we have agreed the best possible way forward," Katharine Viner, editor-in-chief of Guardian News &amp; Media, said in Friday's statement.</p>

<p>Tortoise, run by former BBC News director James Harding, plans to continue publishing The Observer on Sundays and combine it with its own podcasts and live events.</p>

<p>The weekly dates back to 1791.</p>

<p>"This investment will preserve the Observer's 233-year legacy and protect the paper's future," said Anna Bateson, GMG's chief executive.</p>

<p>Following a deal expected to be signed in the coming days, the Scott Trust will invest in Tortoise Media and become one of its largest shareholders, the statement added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Continuing his pattern of compensating donorship with political power, President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday announced podcaster and former PayPal chief operating officer David Sacks as White House artificial intelligence and crypto czar.</p>

<p>Since it is a new role, it is unclear as of now how the vertical would function with the government and what authority David Sacks would have to make or implement changes.</p>

<p>"In this important role, David will guide policy for the Administration in Artificial Intelligence and Cryptocurrency, two areas critical to the future of American competitiveness," Trump had said on Truth Social when he made the announcement.</p>

<p>He added that Sacks has the "knowledge, business experience, intelligence, and pragmatism to MAKE AMERICA GREAT".</p>

<p>The latter had hosted a fundraiser for Trump at his mansion in San Francisco, with tickets that cost as much as $300,000 to attend. More than $12m was secured from this which beat the initial goal of $5m. This event was also co-sponsored by Sacks' co-host Chamath Palihapitiya.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, Sacks and Palihapitiya, over an informal dinner suggested Trump to pick J D Vance as his VP. Apart from this, Sacks is also closely associated with Elon Musk and backed his decision of taking Twitter over.</p>

<p>It is expected that Sacks and Musk will work together on the AI front since the latter has an AI company xAI and an AI chatbot called Grok. However, both of them will be special government employees which means they can serve a maximum of 130 days a year without publicly divesting their assets.</p>

<p>Apart from this Trump has also designated Sacks to head the council of advisors for science and technology. The work involved ranges in sectors like energy, environment, public health and national security.</p>

<p>"He will work on a legal framework so the Crypto industry has the clarity it has been asking for, and can thrive in the US" Trump said, talking about Sacks' role in the administration.</p>

<p>And for the first time in its 15 year history, Bitcoin blasted the $100 barrier, ahead of Trump's pick of Sacks, in anticipation of a friendly regulatory environment for the digital currency.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rebel forces pressing a lightning offensive in Syria aim to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad's rule, their Islamist leader said in an interview published on Friday.</p>

<p>The Islamist-led rebels were at the gates of Syria's Homs, a war monitor said, after wresting other key cities from government control.</p>

<p>In little over a week, the offensive has seen Syria's second city Aleppo and strategically located Hama fall from President Bashar al-Assad's control for the first time since the civil war began in 2011.</p>

<p>Should the rebels capture Homs, that would cut the seat of power in the capital Damascus from the Mediterranean coast, a key bastion of the Assad clan, which has ruled Syria for the past five decades.</p>

<p>By Friday morning, the rebels were just five kilometres (three miles) from the edge of Homs, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor.</p>

<p>Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, the leader of the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) rebel alliance, said the goal of the offensive was to overthrow Assad's rule.</p>

<p>"When we talk about objectives, the goal of the revolution remains the overthrow of this regime. It is our right to use all available means to achieve that goal," Jolani told CNN in an interview.</p>

<p>The rebel alliance conducting the offensive that began on November 27 is led by HTS, which is rooted in the Syrian branch of Al-Qaeda but has sought to moderate its image in recent years.</p>

<p>The rebels launched their offensive in northern Syria the same day a ceasefire took effect in the war between Israel and Lebanese group Hezbollah, which along with Russia and Iran have been crucial backers of Assad's government.</p>

<p>Turkey, which has backed the opposition, on Friday said its Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan would meet with his Russian and Iranian counterparts this weekend in Qatar to discuss the situation in Syria.</p>

<p>- Fear -</p>

<p>Fearing the rebels' advance, tens of thousands of members of Assad's Alawite minority were fleeing Homs on Thursday, residents and the Observatory said.</p>

<p>Khaled, who lives on the city's outskirts, told AFP that "the road leading to (coastal) Tartus province was glowing... due to the lights of hundreds of cars on their way out".</p>

<p>Homs was the scene of a months-long government siege of opposition areas and deadly sectarian attacks in the early years of the civil war.</p>

<p>Early in the war, which began with Assad's brutal crackdown on democracy protests, activists referred to the city as "the capital of the revolution" against the government.</p>

<p>Syrians who were forced out of the country by the crackdown on the revolt were glued to their phones as they watched the developments unfold.</p>

<p>"We've been dreaming of this for more than a decade," said Yazan, a 39-year-old former activist who survived the siege and is now living as a refugee in France.</p>

<p>Asked whether he was worried about HTS's Islamist agenda, he said: "It doesn't matter to me who is conducting this. The devil himself could be behind it. What people care about is who is going to liberate the country."</p>

<p>On the other side of the sectarian divide, however, there was fear among Homs's Alawite community.</p>

<p>Haidar, 37, who lives in an Alawite-majority neighbourhood, told AFP by telephone that "fear is the umbrella that covers Homs now".</p>

<p>"I've never seen this scene in my life. We are extremely afraid, we don't know what is happening."</p>

<p>On Friday, the rebel alliance "entered the cities of Rastan and Talbisseh" on the main road between Hama and Homs, the Observatory said.</p>

<p>The factions were faced with "a total absence" of government forces, it added.</p>

<p>Footage posted on social media and verified by AFP showed rebels firing into the air as they drove through Talbisseh.</p>

<p>The Syrian defence ministry said the army launched strikes against "terrorist" fighters in Hama province.</p>

<p>The Syrian Observatory, which relies on a network of sources in Syria, said 826 people, mostly combatants but also including 111 civilians, have been killed since the offensive began last week.</p>

<p>The United Nations said that the violence has displaced 280,000 people, warning that numbers could swell to 1.5 million.</p>

<p>Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman said there was a "massive exodus of Syrian Alawites from parts of Homs, tens of thousands are heading towards the Syrian coast, fearing the rebels' advance".</p>

<p>- 'Massive blow' -</p>

<p>Many of the scenes witnessed in recent days would have been unimaginable earlier in the war.</p>

<p>The rebels announced on Telegram their capture of Hama following street battles with government forces, describing it as "the complete liberation of the city".</p>

<p>Many residents turned out to welcome the rebel fighters. An AFP photographer saw some residents set fire to a giant poster of Assad on the facade of city hall.</p>

<p>The army admitted losing control of the city, though Defence Minister Ali Abbas insisted that its withdrawal was a "temporary tactical measure".</p>

<p>In a video posted online, HTS leader Jolani said his fighters had entered Hama to "cleanse the wound that has endured in Syria for 40 years", referring to an army massacre in the 1980s.</p>

<p>In another message on Telegram congratulating "the people of Hama on their victory," he used his real name, Ahmed al-Sharaa, instead of his nom de guerre for the first time.</p>

<p>Aron Lund, a fellow of the Century International think tank, called the loss of Hama "a massive, massive blow to the Syrian government".</p>

<p>Should Assad lose Homs, it wouldn't mean the end of his rule, Lund said, but "with no secure route from Damascus to the coast, I'd say it's over as a credible state entity."</p>

<p>UN chief Antonio Guterres said Thursday that the escalation in Syria is the result of a "chronic collective failure" of diplomacy.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain's Catherine, Princess of Wales, on Friday will host a Christmas service at Westminster Abbey that will reflect on "the most difficult times" as she returns to public life after her cancer diagnosis.</p>

<p>The London carol service will "reflect upon the importance of love and empathy, and how much we need each other, especially in the most difficult times of our lives", according to Catherine's Kensington Palace office.</p>

<p>Each guest will receive an order of service illustrated by British artist Charlie Mackesy that will ask "how did I help?", with the reply "you were by my side, which was everything".</p>

<p>Catherine is expected to attend alongside husband Prince William and their children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis.</p>

<p>The princess said in September that she had completed her chemotherapy treatment for an unspecified cancer and was looking forward to undertaking more engagements "when I can".</p>

<p>She attended Remembrance Day events last month and visited Southport in northwest England in October to meet people affected by a knife attack in July that killed three young girls.</p>

<p>Families affected by the attack are among the 1,600 people invited to the service, according to the BBC.</p>

<p>Among the guests are those "who have supported others in their communities, whether on a personal level with friends and family, through their work, or as they selflessly give up their time through volunteering," said Kensington Palace.</p>

<p>Six-time Olympic cycling champion Chris Hoy, who recently revealed he has terminal cancer, will light a candle and the event will hear musical performances from UK singer Paloma Faith and US jazz performer Gregory Porter.</p>

<p>Each guest will receive a letter of thanks written by Catherine.</p>

<p>In it, she writes that "this carol service is a heartfelt celebration of every one of you, and a reminder that at Christmas, and throughout the year, we must all shine for each other.</p>

<p>"Because in times of joy and sadness, we are all each other's light."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

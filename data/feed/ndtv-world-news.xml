       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 92-year-old man has been charged in the UK with the murder and rape of a woman almost six decades ago, British police said Wednesday.</p>

<p>Louisa Dunne, 75, was found dead by a neighbour inside her home in the southwestern English city of Bristol in June 1967.</p>

<p>Her cause of death was recorded as strangulation and asphyxiation.</p>

<p>The case remained cold for 57 years until nonagenarian Ryland Headley, of Ipswich in eastern England, was arrested on Tuesday and subsequently charged.</p>

<p>The arrest came after Avon and Somerset police began reviewing the case last year, which included further forensic examination of items relating to the case.</p>

<p>"This development marks a hugely significant moment in this investigation," the force's detective inspector Dave Marchant said in a statement.</p>

<p>"We've updated Louisa's family about this charging decision and a specialist liaison officer will continue to support them in the coming days, weeks and months."</p>

<p>Headley appeared in court in Bristol via video-link on Wednesday and was remanded in custody. He was not asked to enter pleas to the two charges.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Oz is another addition to the unconventional health team after Trump tapped Robert F Kennedy Junior as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump has picked Mehmet Oz, a Turkish-American doctor to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service - an agency that is responsible for the healthcare of millions of Americans.</p>

<p>Before landing here, Oz had been a trained cardiothoracic surgeon, after which he found fame on The Oprah Winfrey Show and then proceeded to host his own show - The Dr Oz Show, an Emmy-winning TV show that was broadcasted for 13 seasons and made him a household name.</p>

<p>Oz is another addition to the unconventional health team after Trump tapped Robert F Kennedy Junior as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.</p>

<p>However, he has always pushed for insurance for all, a stance commonly held by progressives, including Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris. "It should be mandatory that everybody in America have health care coverage. If you can't afford it, we have to give it to you," he told The Seattle Times.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Oz has been accused of promoting "miracle" cures and malaria drugs like hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in the early days of the pandemic to cure Covid-19, which experts believe do nothing against the virus.</p>

<p>He has time and again gravitated towards "pseudoscience" in his shows, promoting homoeopathy and alternative medicine and blurring the line between science and endorsements. He has also been accused of recommending unproven pills that would "literally flush fat from your system" and "push fat from your belly".</p>

<p>It is notable to mention that a 2014 British Medical Journal study said that his medical recommendations were based on evidence just 46 per cent of the time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite that, Trump said in a statement that, "There may be no Physician more qualified and capable than Dr. Oz to Make America Healthy Again."</p>

<p>"Women, in particular, are drawn to Dr. Oz for his advice and counsel. I have seen this many times over the years. They know him, believe in him, and trust him," Trump said while endorsing Oz. He even made an appearance on Oz's show and said that his wife, Melania Trump was a big fan of the show.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Senator Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat who used to lead the Senate health committee, said in a statement, "Even putting aside the raft of alarming pseudoscience Dr. Oz has previously endorsed, it is deeply disappointing to see someone with zero qualifications being announced to head up such a critical agency."<br />
<br />
In a post on X, Lawrence Gostin, the director of O'Neill Institute mentioned that, "Dr Oz is unfit to run CMS. He peddles conspiracy theories on vaccines &amp; fake cures. He profits from fringe medical ideas. By nominating RFK Jr &amp; Mehmet Oz, Trump is giving his middle finger to science. Having worked for 40 years in public health, it's utterly disheartening."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Oz stopped performing surgeries in 2018 but still holds a physician licence. He also tried his hand in politics in 2022, when he lost to John Fetterman while running for Senate in Pennsylvania with the help of Donald Trump.<br />

<p>On Sunday, a team of experts from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&nbsp;and Alaska Veterinary Pathology Services launched an investigation into the fin whale's death. To prevent the carcass from drifting away, they anchored it to the shore and began collecting valuable tissue samples. "We've got some urine and some heart tissues ... and additional blood and baleen samples," Ms Mahoney said.</p>

<p>However, determining the exact cause of death remains a daunting task, even with laboratory analysis, due to factors like decomposition and the lack of visible injuries, noted an expert.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What are Fin Whales?</strong></p>

<p>Fin whales, the world's second-largest whale species, can grow up to 85 feet (25.9 meters) in length and weigh a staggering 40-80 tons, according to NOAA Fisheries.&nbsp;"Fin whales are typically found in deep, offshore waters of all major oceans, primarily in temperate to polar latitudes. They are less common in the tropics. They occur year-round in a wide range of locations, but the density of individuals in any one area changes seasonally," the NOAA Fisheries states on its website. "Most migrate from the Arctic and Antarctic feeding areas in the summer to tropical breeding and calving areas in the winter. The location of winter breeding grounds is not known."</p>

<p>Despite their impressive size, fin whales face numerous and varied threats. Ship strikes, entanglement in fishing gear, and underwater noise pollution pose significant risks to their well-being. Moreover, the impacts of climate change further exacerbate the vulnerability of these incredible creatures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The G20 Rio de Janeiro Leaders' Declaration aspires to chart a bold course for addressing the climate crisis. While it emphasises sustainable, inclusive, and resilient growth, its lofty rhetoric is undermined by significant gaps, contradictions, and a failure to address systemic barriers. The declaration risks being another aspirational statement that falls short of driving meaningful global action.<br />
The statement's language is filled with promises to “encourage”, “recognise”, and “cooperate”. However, it stops short of binding commitments or enforceable mechanisms. Reiterating the Paris Agreement goals without concrete actions or timelines does little to mitigate the worsening climate crisis. This vagueness perpetuates a familiar pattern in global climate diplomacy, where lofty ambitions remain unfulfilled.</p>

<h2><strong>The Absence Of Water</strong></h2>

<p>Despite the call for a “whole-of-economy” change, the declaration lacks a clear framework for implementing its commitments. For instance, its pledge to triple renewable energy capacity globally by 2030 is not supported by actionable steps to address financing gaps or infrastructure challenges.</p>

<p>One of the Declaration's most glaring omissions is the absence of water as a central theme. The global hydrological cycle, critical to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), is treated as an afterthought, siloed under Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH). This ignores the role of water as a global common good, central to tackling hunger, poverty, and climate resilience. Addressing water issues demands an economy-wide transformation, not fragmented policies relegated to specific sectors.</p>

<p>Achieving the Paris Agreement's goals requires more than pledges; it demands a robust green industrial strategy. Yet, the declaration fails to recognise the importance of aligning industrial policies with sustainability goals. Trade frameworks, particularly through the World Trade Organization (WTO), need reform to enable equitable participation in green growth. Without systemic changes, developing nations will remain marginalised in the global energy transition.</p>

<h2><strong>Blame Where Due</strong></h2>

<p>The declaration's call for reforming the international financial system lacks substance, failing to address the stark realities faced by developing nations. In 2022 alone, these countries spent a record $443.5 billion servicing external public and publicly guaranteed debt, diverting essential resources away from critical sectors such as health, education, and environmental initiatives. For the 75 poorest nations eligible for the World Bank's International Development Association (IDA) financing, the situation is graver, with $88.9 billion paid in debt servicing that same year. This escalating burden underscores the systemic inequities of a financial system that leaves vulnerable countries with dwindling fiscal space to tackle pressing development and climate needs.</p>

<p>The availability of concessional financing—essential for sustainable development in low-income nations—remains grossly insufficient. While developed countries provided $115.9 billion in climate finance in 2022, finally surpassing the $100 billion annual target set for 2020, this milestone arrived years too late to address the urgency of the climate crisis. Moreover, accessing these funds continues to be fraught with bureaucratic hurdles and inequitable mechanisms, leaving many developing nations unable to finance necessary adaptation and mitigation strategies effectively. This systemic failure reflects the financial system's prioritisation of creditor interests over the needs of the most vulnerable.</p>

<h2><strong>Rhetoric Over Action</strong></h2>

<p>These challenges directly impact global climate action, as developing countries are left to bear the dual burden of servicing debt and facing the catastrophic consequences of climate change. Without access to timely and adequate financing, these nations are forced into a cycle of underinvestment in sustainable projects and reliance on expensive market loans. The result is an unsustainable debt spiral that undermines not only their economic stability but also the global ambition to achieve climate goals. The declaration's emphasis on scaling up green finance “from billions to trillions” ignores these entrenched barriers, offering little more than rhetorical commitments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The declaration misses an opportunity to demand structural reforms in multilateral development banks and central banks to align their strategies with Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and SDG goals. Central banks and financial regulators, critical players in managing climate risks, are barely mentioned. Their mandates should be expanded to account for climate risks, ensuring that financial systems support sustainable development rather than perpetuate inequities. Furthermore, the demand for critical minerals to support renewable energy transitions risks turning resource-rich developing nations into mere suppliers, exacerbating environmental degradation and human rights violations. The declaration fails to address these risks or propose equitable mechanisms for resource governance.<br />
Despite reiterating the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR), the declaration does little to address the structural inequalities that burden low- and middle-income countries.</p>

<h2><strong>Missed Opportunities</strong></h2>

<p>Historical emitters are not held accountable for their disproportionate contributions to climate change, and there are no specific commitments from high-income nations to scale up climate finance or emissions reductions.</p>

<p>The failure to prioritise just transitions is another missed opportunity. While the declaration references this principle, it offers no actionable steps to support vulnerable communities or ensure equity in the global energy transition.</p>

<p>The declaration represents a significant missed opportunity to address the escalating climate crisis with the urgency and specificity it demands. It acknowledges the necessity of adaptation and the establishment of a Loss and Damage Fund but fails to provide a concrete framework for implementation. This oversight leaves vulnerable nations, particularly those in the Global South, to bear the brunt of climate impacts without adequate financial or technical support. Despite the urgency highlighted at the United Nations COP29 climate talks in Baku, where financial mechanisms to support poorer nations were central, the G20's commitments remain nebulous and lack actionable substance.</p>

<h2><strong>Migration Remains A Blindspot</strong></h2>

<p>The absence of any mention of climate-induced migration is inexcusable. According to the World Bank, climate change could displace up to 216 million people within their own countries by 2050, creating an unprecedented humanitarian crisis. From the sinking islands of the Pacific to desertification in Africa, millions are already being forced from their homes. Yet, the G20 remains silent. This omission reveals a troubling disregard for the socio-economic fallout of climate change and a failure to acknowledge the human cost of inaction.</p>

<p>The declaration's call for circular economies and waste reduction is undermined by its refusal to confront the unsustainable consumption patterns of high-income countries. G20 nations are responsible for approximately 75% of global waste and the majority of natural resource consumption, yet the document avoids binding commitments to curb these excesses. The emphasis on recycling and reuse is commendable but hollow without a corresponding reduction in overall consumption.</p>

<p>The G20 Rio Declaration positions itself as a comprehensive roadmap for addressing the climate crisis but falls short of its promise. Its reliance on vague commitments, lack of enforceable mechanisms, and failure to address systemic inequities reveal it as more performative than transformative.</p>

<p>To drive meaningful action, future G20 presidencies, particularly South Africa's, must prioritise actionable commitments that address structural barriers to sustainability and equity. Bold leadership, systemic reform, and binding targets are essential to turn these aspirations into reality. Without these, the declaration risks becoming another footnote in the history of missed opportunities in global climate governance.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nicknamed as a "mini moon" or "second moon," asteroid 2024 PT5 was first seen on August 7 by a NASA-sponsored asteroid detecting system. This bus-sized asteroid is currently approaching the end of its close visit to Earth and will vanish until 2055. The asteroid was momentarily trapped by Earth's gravity and became a "mini moon" between September 29 and November 25. Stargazers and space enthusiasts have been delighted by this unusual occurrence, but because of its small size and dim brightness, the asteroid was not visible to the naked eye. Most people were not able to see it because only professional telescopes can detect it.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/11/18/you-only-have-a-few-days-left-to-see-the-earths-second-moon-22016807/"><em>The Metro,</em></a> the mini-moon is only 3,760,000 km from Earth. That certainly might sound like a lot-or at least how far the sofa from the TV remote can feel sometimes-but it's barely a stone's throw in the world of space.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/science/earths-second-moon-to-be-visible-today-all-about-asteroid-2024-pt5-6674585"><strong>Also Read | Earth's 'Second Moon' To Be Visible Today. All About Asteroid 2024 PT5</strong></a></p>

<p>'Mini' is also the key word here. Asteroid 2024 PT5 is only 37 feet or so long-the size of a bus. The mini-moon is roughly 11,400,000 feet. Our new lunar neighbour has travelled far to reach us. Experts think it hails from the Arjuna asteroid belt, a ring of primordial crumbs 93 million miles from the Sun.</p>

<p>NASA officials speculate it might be a fragment of the Earth's Moon itself from an ancient impact that has by pure chance found its way back.PT5 was first picked up by Complutense University of Madrid scientists using a powerful NASA-funded telescope in Sutherland, South Africa, as per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/11/18/you-only-have-a-few-days-left-to-see-the-earths-second-moon-22016807/"><em>the news outlet.</em></a><br />
<br />
'Mini-moons' are celestial objects like asteroids or comets that do drive-by visits to the Earth. Though some were later revealed by astronomers to be diminutive space junk like satellite scraps or lost rockets.</p>

<p><strong>Asteroid 2024 PT5</strong></p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/planetarydefense/2024/10/02/nasa-to-track-asteroid-2024-pt5-on-next-close-pass-january-2025/"><em>NASA,</em></a> Asteroid 2024 PT5 was first observed on August 7, 2024, by the Sutherland, South Africa, telescope of the University of Hawai'i's Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), which is funded by NASA. Estimated to be about 33 feet (10 meters) wide, the asteroid does not pose a hazard to Earth.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gunshots, screams, eerie laughter: South Korea's border island Ganghwa is being bombarded nightly with blood-curdling sounds, part of a new campaign by the nuclear-armed North that is driving residents to despair.</p>

<p>Before it started, 56-year-old Kim Yun-suk fell asleep to the hum of insects and woke to the chirping of birds. Now, she is kept awake every night by what sounds like the soundtrack of a low-budget horror movie at top volume.</p>

<p>"The peaceful sounds of nature... have now been drowned out," Kim told AFP.</p>

<p>"All we hear is this noise."</p>

<p>The campaign is the latest manifestation of steadily declining ties between the two Koreas this year, which have also seen Pyongyang test ever more powerful missiles and bombard the South with trash-carrying balloons.</p>

<p>Since July, North Korea has been broadcasting the noises in huge chunks almost every day from loudspeakers along the border.</p>

<p>The northern point of Ganghwa -- an island in the Han river estuary on the Yellow Sea -- is only about two kilometres (a mile) from the North.</p>

<p>When AFP visited, the nighttime broadcast included what sounded like the screams of people dying on the battlefield, the crack of gunfire, bombs exploding, along chilling music that started at 11:00 pm.</p>

<p>In the almost pitch-black fields, sinister noises echoed as the stars in the clear night sky shone beautifully alongside the coastal road lights, creating a stark and unsettling contrast.</p>

<p>North Korea has done propaganda broadcasts before, said 66-year-old villager Ahn Hyo-cheol, but they used to focus on criticising the South's leaders, or idealising the North.</p>

<p>Now "there were sounds like a wolf howling, and ghostly sounds", he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It feels unpleasant and gives me chills. It feels bizarre."</p>

<p>Ganghwa county councillor Park Heung-yeol said that the new broadcasts were "not just regime propaganda -- it's genuinely intended to torment people".</p>

<p>- Torture -&nbsp;</p>

<p>Experts said the new broadcasts almost meet the criteria for a torture campaign.</p>

<p>"Almost every regime has used noise torture and sleep deprivation," Rory Cox, a historian at the University of St Andrews, told AFP.</p>

<p>"It is very common and leaves no physical scarring, therefore making it deniable."</p>

<p>Exposure to noise levels above 60 decibels at night increases the risk of sleep disorders, experts said, but AFP tracked levels of up to 80 decibels late at night on Ganghwa during a recent trip.</p>

<p>"I find myself taking headache medicine almost all the time," An Mi-hee, 37, told AFP, adding that prolonged sleep deprivation due to the noise has also led to anxiety, eye pain, facial tremors and drowsiness.</p>

<p>"Our kids can't sleep either, so they've developed mouth sores and are dozing off at school."</p>

<p>Distraught and desperate, An travelled to Seoul and got on her knees to beg lawmakers at the National Assembly to find a solution, breaking down in tears as she described the island's suffering.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It would actually be better if there were a flood, a fire, or even an earthquake, because those events have a clear recovery timeline," An said.</p>

<p>"We have no idea if this will go on until the person in North Korea who gives the orders dies, or if it could be cut off at any moment. We just don't know."</p>

<p><strong>- '70s horror flick' -</strong></p>

<p>The noise tormenting Ganghwa island residents appeared to be a rudimentary mix of clips from a sound library, typically common at any TV or radio broadcasters, audio experts told AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The sound effects are "like something found in a South Korean horror film in the 70s and 80s," said sound engineer Hwang Kwon-ik.</p>

<p>The two Koreas remained technically at war since the 1950 to 1953 conflict ended in an armistice not a peace treaty.</p>

<p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un this year declared Seoul his "principal enemy" and has ramped up weapons testing and built closer military ties with Russia.</p>

<p>The isolated and impoverished North is known to be extremely sensitive about its citizens gaining access to South Korean pop culture.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some experts have suggested the latest broadcasts could be aimed at preventing North Korean soldiers from hearing the South's own propaganda broadcasts, which typically feature K-pop songs and international news.</p>

<p>In August, just weeks after South Korea resumed K-pop broadcasts in response to Pyongyang floating trash-carrying balloons south, a North Korean soldier defected by crossing the heavily fortified border on foot.</p>

<p>But Lee Su-yong, an audio production professor at the Dong-Ah Institute of Media and Arts, said "if there is sound coming towards the North that you want to mask, then the sound (you use to cover it) must also be directed toward the North."</p>

<p>"It seems less about masking noise and more about inflicting pain on people in the South," he told AFP.</p>

<p>Choi Hyoung-chan, a 60-year-old resident, said the South Korean government had failed to protect vulnerable civilians on the frontier.</p>

<p>"They should come here and try to live with these sounds for just ten days," he told AFP, referring to officials in Seoul.</p>

<p>"I doubt they could even endure a single day."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A woman from Andhra Pradesh, working as a house help in Kuwait has accused her employers of torture. The woman, a native of Kakinada district, recorded a video explaining her ordeal and sent it to her relatives.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a tearful video, Gara Kumari, a widow and mother of three, cried for help: "They are not giving me proper food. they are trying to kill me. Please save me and send me back to my children."</p>

<p>Ms Kumari, from Yallamelli village in Gandepalli, married Venkatesh of Ramavaram village in Jaggampeta 19 years ago. After her husband's death five years ago, she was left to care for their two daughters and a son alone. Despite working tirelessly in her village, her income was insufficient to meet her family's needs.</p>

<p>In search of a better livelihood, Ms Kumari sought the assistance of an agent, M Sudhakar, from Palakollu. With his help, she travelled to Kuwait seven months ago to work as a domestic help in Kuwait, leaving her children in her mother's care.</p>

<p>What began as a bid to secure a better future soon turned into a nightmare. Ms Kumari's video describes physical and emotional abuse, denial of proper food, and a threat to her life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The video has gone viral, causing a stir in Kakinada district. Relatives and villagers are pressing authorities for swift action to rescue Ms Kumari and ensure her safe return to India.The role of the agent who facilitated her travel, M Sudhakar, is also under scrutiny.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cells, such as those making up human bodies, might be capable of 'learning', once deemed exclusive to complex creatures with brains, including birds and mammals, a new study has suggested.</p>

<p>Habituation is a simple form of learning in which one's response to a certain trigger lessens with repeated exposure. It is how one learns to ignore things happening often, such as the ticking of a clock. Habituation can also help people confront their fears.</p>

<p>The study offered "compelling evidence" that even single-cell creatures such as amoebae, as well as the cells in human bodies, could show habituation similar to that seen in complex organisms with brains and nervous systems, said researchers, led by those at Harvard Medical School, US, and the Centre for Genomic Regulation, Spain.</p>

<p>The results, published in the journal Current Biology, added to a small but growing body of evidence in this field and deepen our understanding of how learning and memory work at the most basic level of life, they said.</p>

<p>"This finding opens up an exciting new mystery for us: How do cells without brains manage something so complex?" said senior author Jeremy Gunawardena, an associate professor of systems biology at Harvard Medical School.</p>

<p>Gunawardena's team had earlier documented evidence of a single-celled ciliate displaying avoidance behaviour, similar to that observed in animals when they encounter unpleasant situations. A ciliate uses hairs on its surface for moving and eating.</p>

<p>The findings suggested that a single cell is capable of behaviour more complex that what is currently appreciated, the researchers said.</p>

<p>For the study, the researchers used computer models to analyse how molecules inside ciliates and cells of mammals respond to different patterns of stimulation, or something that triggers a physical or behavioural change.</p>

<p>They found four networks of molecules that displayed hallmarks of habituation, usually seen in animal brains. Each of the molecule networks were found to have two forms of "memory" storage that captured information learned from the environment.</p>

<p>Further, one of the memory form was found to decay much faster than the other -- a form of memory loss necessary for habituation, the researchers noted.</p>

<p>If single cells can "remember", it could also help explain how cancer cells develop resistance to chemotherapy or how bacteria become resistant to antibiotics -- situations where cells seem to "learn" from their environment, they said.</p>

<p>However, these possibilities would need to be explored with real-world biological data, the team said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UK singer and television personality Tulisa has revealed that she identifies as "demisexual". The revelation happened during a discussion about her personal life in an episode of '<em>I'm A Celebrity</em>' on Tuesday. Tulisa, a former '<em>X Factor</em>' judge, is one of the 10 stars who flew to Australia to compete in the series, <em>The Independent</em> reported. The teammates started talking about dating during a break when Tulisa revealed she is a celibate. The 36-year-old shared she is a demisexual and has been celibate for over three years.</p>

<p>"Even though I've been on there, I've never gone on an actual date with anyone on there. I'm proper guarded," Tulisa said about avoiding dating apps.</p>

<p>"I feel like I'm demisexual, I need to have a really close emotional bond with someone... I need actual depth. I'm a slow, slow burner," she added.</p>

<p>Tulisa said it makes her feel "physically sick" to imagine sleeping with or dating someone she doesn't have a connection with. "This is my temple, you cannot enter!"</p>

<p>Talking about relationship, Tulisa said, "I actually do enjoy being single, I enjoy being on my own."</p>

<h3><strong>What is demisexuality?</strong></h3>

<p>It is a sexual orientation in which a person experiences sexual attraction only after forming a deep emotional connection with someone, as per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/tulisa-im-a-celeb-dating-b2650039.html" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>The Independent</em></a>.</p>

<p>It is not clear how many people in the world are demisexual. The outlet said that the term was coined in 2006 on a web forum devoted to asexuality.</p>

<p>A 2021 British census said that 0.06 per cent of people in the UK identify as asexual.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Constructing new railways is undoubtedly a costly endeavour. Even under ideal conditions, cutting through landscapes can cost millions of dollars per mile and take decades to complete,&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/travel/hs2-britain-expensive-high-speed-railway/index.html" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>CNN </em></a>reported.</p>

<p>When the project involves building through one of Europe's most densely populated countries, like Britain, both costs and opposition skyrocket.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Britain's High Speed 2 (HS2) rail project, currently estimated by the UK government to cost between $58.4 billion and $70 billion for its first- and now only- phase, comes with a staggering price tag of $416 million per mile. This makes it the world's most expensive railway project, earning it widespread criticism.</p>

<p>For comparison, the troubled California High-Speed Rail project in the United States is estimated to cost up to $200 million per mile, while France's Tours-Bordeaux TGV line, completed in the mid-2010s, cost just $32-$40 million per mile. Most European high-speed rail projects outside the UK typically range around $66.4 million per mile.</p>

<p>Even densely populated countries like China and Japan have managed to construct high-speed railways through megacities for significantly less. For example, China's Jakarta-Bandung "WHOOSH" line in Indonesia, built through challenging terrain, costs approximately $80 million per mile.</p>

<p>In Britain, however, major infrastructure projects are notorious for exceeding budgets. HS2's costs have ballooned over time, with many now considering it an expensive failure unlikely to deliver the promised social and economic benefits.</p>

<p>Launched in 2012 with an initial projection of $42.8 billion for nearly 400 miles of railway, HS2 has since been plagued by a series of challenges, including political interference, a lack of long-term planning, bureaucratic delays, poor project management, and insufficient oversight. The project has cycled through five CEOs, seven chairmen, six prime ministers, eight finance ministers, and nine transport ministers amid a period of political instability in the UK.</p>

<p>The construction industry, wary of these systemic issues, has inflated bids to include hefty mitigation costs. As a result, what began as a bold vision for Britain's transport future has devolved into a cautionary tale of mismanagement and spiralling expenses.<br />

       <description><![CDATA["The Security Council structure, as it stands today, is a reflection of 1945. It does not reflect today's realities," India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Parvathaneni Harish said during a conversation here on Tuesday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India is "unsatisfied" with the pace of progress on Security Council reform, the country's envoy at the UN said, noting that there are countries who prefer the status quo and those that oppose expansion in the permanent category "at all costs" as they feel their neighbours may have a chance to become a member.</p>

<p>"The Security Council structure, as it stands today, is a reflection of 1945. It does not reflect today's realities," India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Parvathaneni Harish said during a conversation here on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Harish delivered the keynote address on 'Responding to Key Global Challenges: The India Way' at an event at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA).</p>

<p>Harish gave an expansive overview of the "India way" on key global issues ranging from reformed multilateralism, terrorism, demography, India's digital revolution to the country's youth, climate change, democracy, healthcare and vaccines.</p>

<p>The event was co-sponsored by the MPA programme in Global Leadership and the International Organisation and UN Studies programme (IO/UNS) and attended by students, faculty and policy experts.</p>

<p>He noted that the United Nations does "great work" in the humanitarian field, addressing the humanitarian requirements of hundreds of millions around the world as well as in the development domain -- children's health, public health, and labour through its specialised institutions.</p>

<p>"Yet for the common man on the street, their perception, the lenses through which they view the UN is neither the humanitarian dimension nor the development dimension or the public health dimension. They only look at the inability of the UN to stop conflicts in areas like Ukraine and the Middle East. That is the view they have and that is probably the only yardstick by which they are assessing the efficiency of the UN," he said during a panel discussion after the keynote address.</p>

<p>Harish underlined that there is consensus that the UN Security Council should be reformed.</p>

<p>"Yes, it needs reforms. It needs expansion. However several countries prefer the status quo. Those who are already permanent members do not wish to vacate it. Those who are already permanent members do not wish to give up the veto. Those who feel that their neighbours may have a chance to become a member would oppose expansion in the permanent category at all costs," he said.</p>

<p>"This is the way nations behave, very much like people, in terms of motivations."</p>

<p>Pakistan is part of the group 'Uniting for Consensus' that opposes permanent seats for India and other G4 nations Brazil, Germany and Japan.</p>

<p>Of the five Permanent members of the Council, France, Russia, the UK and the US have voiced strong support for India's bid for a permanent seat in a reformed Council.</p>

<p>China has said that Security Council reform is an important part of the reform of the multilateral governance architecture but also pointed to the "practice of a few countries and interest groups who pursue their own selfish and small-circle interests when it comes to Council reform".</p>

<p>Harish described the process as being "very difficult" and "complex".</p>

<p>"Yes, we are unsatisfied with the pace of progress in the last 15-16 years and urging the co-chairs of the Inter-Governmental Negotiation process to decisively move forward on this.</p>

<p>"Is it going to be easy and will it happen tomorrow? Probably not. What should we do? We should keep at it because eventually, things will not remain the same. Nothing remains the same. Change is a natural order of things. It will happen, if not today, tomorrow. If not tomorrow, the day after. We are engaged with this process because we need a multilateral system that works, and is fit for purpose to deal with today's challenges, problems and also opportunities."</p>

<p>Harish emphasised the institutions of multilateralism that "we have today are a product of the post Second World War.</p>

<p>"The reality of 1945 is long gone, the institutions remain. They are not fit for purpose for dealing with today's challenges and opportunities. Yet they have not been reformed, whether it is the UN, the UN Security Council, international financial institutions, trade bodies, each one of them needs to be made fit for purpose for today's realities," he said.</p>

<p>Harish said that changing the status quo is not easy. "You have a lot of status quo supporters, and you need to build consensus for this. It's a difficult process which is still ongoing," he said.</p>

<p>"We are a multipolar world, and we in Asia are clear that a multipolar Asia in a multipolar world is the way ahead," he said.</p>

<p>Summarising the "India way", Harish underlined that the "world is not a zero-sum game". The 'India way' that has emerged is a "proactive India playing on the front foot", he said using cricket terminology, of "Go ahead and engage, manage difficult partners, cultivate new friends that you have not dealt with before, reassure old friends with whom you have had many years of productive partnership, draw in new stakeholders to all the things that you want to bring about, reach out both to old friends and new partners as you come up with new approaches of dealing with things, extend a hand of friendship and collaboration to all, and finally, expand the outreach, the footprint, and hands of friendship to everybody.</p>

<p>"No to dogma. Don't get caught out just because you did something in a particular way" over the last several decades. "Consistency is not a virtue. Yes, to calculated risk-taking, because increasingly, we are dealing with a young population, that wants prosperity as of yesterday, that has great aspirations, that wants innovation and wants transformation. If we don't change the way we do business, we will not be in a position to meet their aspirations," he said outlining the 'India Way'.</p>

<p>"India is a bridge between the developed and the developing world, between the established and the emerging, a friend of the world that believes in participatory institution building without confrontation. We don't want to impose anything on anyone. Global commons for global good. This is what we work for."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>"Dragon Ball" fans on Wednesday celebrated 40 years of the globally beloved Japanese manga, anime and video game franchise, just months after creator Akira Toriyama's unexpected death.</p>

<p>The original "Dragon Ball" manga was first serialised on November 20, 1984, featuring a boy named Son Goku who collects magical balls containing dragons to help protect the Earth.</p>

<p>The comic books have since sold more than 260 million copies in Japan and worldwide, according to publisher Shueisha.</p>

<p>Toriyama died aged 68 in March because of a blood clot on his brain, sparking an outpouring of grief from fans, including tributes from world leaders.</p>

<p>The first part of the manga series was turned into an anime for TV also called "Dragon Ball" from 1986. Dubbed in different languages, the show captured children's hearts with its madcap battles.</p>

<p>"Dragon Ball Z", an adaptation of the later part of the manga, took the series' popularity to even greater heights.</p>

<p>Films, video games and other spin-offs followed as the franchise grew into a global phenomenon.</p>

<p>"Happy birthday to Goku and all his friends. And eternal farewell to Akira Toriyama," anime fan account Catsuka said on its X page, which boasts more than 230,000 followers.</p>

<p>The franchise is particularly popular in Latin America, and several tributes appeared in Spanish on Instagram, including from a Mexican newspaper.</p>

<p>"It's a seminal work that celebrates victory gained through friendship and hard work. I think the simplicity of the story has been an important factor in the series' success," 19-year-old student Tsutomu Tanaka told AFP in Tokyo.</p>

<p>The latest anime series in the franchise, "Dragon Ball Daima", began airing last month, and Saudi Arabia has announced it will build the world's first "Dragon Ball" theme park.</p>

<p>"The commercial machine is already there" for "Dragon Ball", said journalist and anime expert Tadashi Sudo.</p>

<p>But while the popularity of the franchise is secure in the short-term, "the challenge remains whether it can maintain its creativity without Toriyama".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The man who stabbed three people to death in Manhattan has confessed to targeting victims because they were "alone" and "distracted". The details about Ramon Rivera's rampage in New York City came shortly before he was produced before the Manhattan Criminal Court for his arraignment on three counts of first-degree murder, The <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/19/us-news/suspected-nyc-stabber-who-killed-3-in-chilling-spree-confessed-he-picked-vics-because-they-were-alone-distracted-sources/" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">New York Post</a>&nbsp;reported.<br />
<br />
Assistant District Attorney Megan Joy explained how the 51-year-old homeless man allegedly attacked three random people, without any provocation, on Monday morning, in the hours-long incident that stretched from West Side to East River.<br />
<br />
Joy said Rivera embarked on a "bloody and violent rampage" killing three innocent New Yorkers "who were doing nothing but going about their day”.</p>

<p>When Judge Janet McDonnell sent him to jail without bail, Rivera did not protest against the order.<br />
<br />
Sources told the New York Post this seeming indifference even appeared to be consistent through his actions right after the murders. After killing two men and a woman, Rivera spent hours sleeping in police custody. Once he got up, Rivera waived 'Miranda rights' and fully confessed while staying calm.<br />
<br />
The rampage started with the stabbing of Angel Gustavo Lata-Landi, 36, a construction worker from upstate Peekskill. Lata-Landi was waiting to get picked up from work in Chelsea at around 8:20 AM (local time), according to police.<br />
<br />
In the courtroom, Lata-Landi's family sat in the gallery, with tears in their eyes during the hearing.<br />
<br />
His sister, Vertha Land, said that Lata-Landi died working and the family just wanted justice. "The city should take responsibility for the disaster we've been left with," she added.<br />
<br />
After killing Lata-Landi, Rivera then trekked to the East River waterline and stabbed Chang Wang, 67, while he was busy fishing. This happened before 10:30 AM.<br />
<br />
The third victim was Wilma Augustin, 36, who was stabbed to death near the United Nations building. This happened nearly half an hour later. She was taken to a nearby hospital, but the doctors declared her dead.<br />
<br />
The single mother, a migrant from Haiti, was staying at the Americana Inn shelter with her son. "She was a very good lady," a woman known to Augustin said.<br />
<br />
As per the court papers, Rivera suffers from documented mental health problems and was taken into custody soon after Augustin's stabbing. He was carrying two knives.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Demographic shifts, worsening climate change and rapid technological transformation risk creating a bleak future for youth in the mid-21st century, UNICEF warned.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Demographic shifts, worsening climate change and rapid technological transformation risk creating a bleak future for youth in the mid-21st century, the United Nations agency for children warned Tuesday in an annual report.</p>

<p>"Children are experiencing a myriad of crises, from climate shocks to online dangers, and these are set to intensify in the years to come," Catherine Russell, executive director of UNICEF, wrote in a statement marking the release of the agency's annual report.</p>

<p>"Decades of progress, particularly for girls, are under threat."</p>

<p>This year, UNICEF uses its report to project forward to 2050 identifying three "major trends" that in addition to unpredictable conflicts pose threats to children unless policymakers make changes.</p>

<p>The first risk is demographic change, with the number of children expected to remain similar to current figures of 2.3 billion, but they will represent a smaller share of the larger and ageing global population of around 10 billion.</p>

<p>While the proportion of children will decline across all regions, their numbers will explode in some of the poorest areas, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

<p>This offers the potential to boost economic growth, but only if the new young population has access to quality education, health care, and jobs, UNICEF notes.</p>

<p>In some developed countries, children could make up less than 10 percent of the population by 2050, raising concerns about their "visibility" and rights in societies focused on aging populations.</p>

<p>The second threat is climate change.</p>

<p>If current greenhouse gas emission trends continue, by 2050 children could face eight times more heatwaves than in 2000, three times more extreme flooding, and 1.7 times more wildfires, UNICEF projects.</p>

<p>New technology, particularly artificial intelligence, has the potential to power new innovation and progress but could also widen existing inequalities between rich and poor countries.</p>

<p>An estimated 95 percent of people in developed nations have internet access, compared to just 26 percent in the least developed, often due to a lack of electricity, connectivity, or devices.</p>

<p>"Failure to remove barriers for children in these countries, especially for those living in the poorest households, means letting an already disadvantaged generation fall even further behind," according to UNICEF.</p>

<p>Being connected also carries risks. The unchecked proliferation of new technologies poses threats to children and their personal data, making them vulnerable to online predators.</p>

<p>"Children of the future face many risks, but what we wanted to demonstrate is that the solutions are in the hands of todays decision-makers," Cecile Aptel, deputy director of UNICEF's research division, told AFP.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People in the UK have been asked to brace for more snow and travel chaos across the country due to falling temperature. The Met Office has issued Yellow weather warning for East and West Midlands for this entire week, forecasting the temperature to dip below zero. It said Monday night saw sub-zero temperatures for much of the UK, reaching as low as minus 11.2 degrees Celsius at Braemar in Aberdeenshire. Shoppers have been warned to stock mil, bread and other essentials before the weather makes it harder to step out.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Four years ago, President Joe Biden declared "America's back" and told his fellow world leaders that Donald Trump had been an aberration.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four years ago, President Joe Biden declared "America's back" and told his fellow world leaders that Donald Trump had been an aberration.</p>

<p>On a valedictory visit to Peru and Brazil this week, it was Biden who faded from view - and straight into the Amazon rain forest - as Trump's return to power comes into sharp relief.</p>

<p>That scene in the Brazilian jungle in Manaus offered a bizarre and meme-worthy image from Biden's six-day trip to South America. After delivering remarks from a podium set up on a dirt path about the need to keep fighting climate change, he took no questions and instead turned and walked off into the trees.</p>

<p>Aides insisted this was all part of the plan - where else was he supposed to go, after all? But the visual of Biden ambling slowly away from the camera and disappearing from view brimmed with melancholy symbolism around the end of this presidency.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His trip to the region for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Lima and the Group of 20 summit in Rio de Janeiro was meant to reassure allies. Instead, it left an impression that Biden's foreign policy, and not President-elect Trump's, had been the aberration, and that relations with the US are about to get a whole lot rockier.</p>

<p>World leaders who attended the summits made clear they were bracing for dramatic policy shifts from the White House, especially on Russia's war in Ukraine. Even leaders who align ideologically with Trump seemed shaken by the scale of the upheaval that may come.</p>

<p>"On potential US disengagement, we have to do all we can to prevent the western front from fraying," Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni told reporters in Rio de Janeiro. "I think everyone realizes where the truth lies in the Ukrainian conflict and Russia's responsibility in not wanting to engage in dialog."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Biden's approach to the summit had the air of a popular elder statesman saying his last goodbyes. He never took questions from the press, and limited himself at the G-20 meeting to brief public remarks. Cameras caught him backslapping and hugging fellow leaders, many of whom were presumably seeing him for the last time as president.</p>

<p>Evidence that Biden's team wasn't up for a fight was everywhere. Brazil declined to invite Ukraine's leader, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to the event, and the G-20's final communique was rammed through by the host, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, despite opposition from other nations over the weakness of its language on Russia's war in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"As you know, this is my last G-20," Biden had said on Monday, the G-20 summit's first day. "We've made progress together, but I urge you to keep going - and I'm sure you will, regardless of my urging or not."</p>

<p>The next day, after discussing climate finance, Biden cut himself off. "I have much more to say," he said, according to a pool report. "I'm not going to."</p>

<p>His refusal to engage with the news of the day also meant that he never provided a justification or explanation for one of the last foreign-policy decisions of his presidency: allowing Ukraine to fire long-range US-provided ATACMS missiles into Russian territory.</p>

<p>That decision came to light on Sunday. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz made clear a day later that he wouldn't follow Biden's example and that Berlin would continue to refuse to supply its Taurus missile system to Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By Tuesday, Ukraine had fired ATACMS at an ammunition depot in Russia's Bryansk border region, though it didn't officially acknowledge that the US weapon was used. The same day, the Kremlin announced that President Vladimir Putin had signed off on a revised nuclear doctrine that lowered the threshold for Russia to resort to using the weapons.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The use of ATACMS represented "a qualitatively new phase" of the war, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told a news briefing in Rio, addressing reporters in English on the question. "And we will react accordingly."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Throughout his presidency - and for decades before as a US senator and vice president - Biden had set his aides on edge with off-the-cuff remarks and verbal gaffes. This time, he resisted once again.</p>

<p>"Mr. President, why did you change your mind on Ukraine shooting long-range missiles?" a reporter shouted to Biden during a camera spray on Tuesday as he met Lula.</p>

<p>Biden appeared ready to respond but then decided to keep the silence he has largely maintained in the two weeks since Vice President Kamala Harris lost the US election to Trump. Instead, US adversaries including China President Xi Jinping and allied leaders such as Scholz have filled the vacuum left by Biden.</p>

<p>"I made clear in my talks with Xi that we won't accept weapons deliveries to Russia and that we will look even closer to dual-use goods for Russia," Scholz told reporters.</p>

<p>Soon after Lavrov spoke, Biden joined other world leaders for a G-20 group photograph. Cameras showed him coughing into his fist and unwrapping a throat lozenge. Biden, who looked stiff and walked haltingly all week, turns 82 on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The photo opportunity was a redo from the summit's first day, when Biden along with Canada's Justin Trudeau and Italy's Meloni had missed the traditional "family photo."&nbsp;</p>

<p>That intensified grumbling from White House staffers already irked by what they saw as chaotic organization from the summit hosts. Journalists peppered Brazilian officials about the decision to take the photo without the US president - something unthinkable at any previous G-20 summit, and all the more for a leader making his swan-song appearance.</p>

<p>"Brazil is like this," Communications Minister Paulo Pimenta explained, according to a pool report. "When it's time, it's time."</p>

<p>Biden has one more foreign trip - to Angola next month - before he leaves office. Even allies seemed to recognize that it's time to move on.</p>

<p>"The world is changing so fast," European Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen said in a post to X that featured a photo of her with Biden and Xi. "So it is good to see familiar faces in these global summits. To greet fellow G20 leaders. And welcome new ones."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanese footballer Celine Haidar was about to make her dream of playing for the national women's team come true, but debris from an Israeli strike left the 19-year-old in a medically induced coma.</p>

<p>After full-blown war erupted in September, Haidar's family were among more than a million people who fled south Beirut and other Hezbollah strongholds, as Israeli bombs rained down.</p>

<p>"But Celine had to come back to (south) Beirut for her studies and training," her father Abbas Haidar told AFP.</p>

<p>"She would leave the house after evacuation calls were issued or bombing intensified, then she'd come back home at night to sleep," he said.</p>

<p>Now, she is the latest athlete to become a casualty of Israeli strikes, which already forced the Lebanese Football Association to postpone all domestic football competitions indefinitely.</p>

<p>On Saturday, her father called her to warn of new evacuation orders published by the Israeli military online and she left the house.</p>

<p>But soon after, "my wife called to tell me Celine was in the hospital," he said.</p>

<p>She had been seriously wounded in an Israeli strike on her home neighbourhood of Shiyah, as the air force pummelled Beirut's southern suburbs.</p>

<p><strong>Cracked skull</strong></p>

<p>Footage of Haidar lying unconscious on the ground, her face covered in blood, while a young man beside her cried in pain took Lebanese social media by storm.</p>

<p>"The strike was close and she was hit in the head," her mother Sanaa Sharhour told AFP. "My daughter has a brain haemorrhage, her skull is cracked."</p>

<p>Sharhour said her daughter had sent her a message asking her to prepare her favourite dish, but "an hour later her friend called to say she had been wounded".</p>

<p>"My daughter is a heroine, she will get up," she said, her eyes red with tears.</p>

<p>"She dreamt of competing abroad. She said she wanted to be like (Cristiano) Ronaldo and (Lionel) Messi... She wanted to be a star and for everyone to talk about her.</p>

<p>"Now everyone is talking about her because she was wounded in a war that she has nothing to do with.</p>

<p>"They killed her dream."</p>

<p><strong>'A fighter' on the pitch</strong></p>

<p>Haidar was a pillar of her club, Beirut Football Academy (BFA), which won the Lebanese Women's Football League last season without dropping a single point, and was due to don the captain's armband this season.</p>

<p>The midfielder was also part of the national women's Under-18 team that won the 2022 West Asian Football Federation championship.</p>

<p>Now she is in a medically induced coma, team manager Ziad Saade said.</p>

<p>"The doctors are following her very closely," her father told AFP from the Saint-Georges Hospital in Beirut where his daughter is being treated.</p>

<p>"But her injuries are serious, we hope she will gradually heal," he said with tears in his eyes.</p>

<p>"We're paying the price for something that's not our fault."</p>

<p>Lebanese authorities say more than 3,544 people have been killed since Hezbollah began trading fire with Israel in October last year, with most deaths recorded since Israel stepped up its campaign in September.</p>

<p>"On the pitch, she's a fighter, she was the link between defence and attack," coach Samer Barbari said, as he and teammates visited her at the hospital.</p>

<p>"She is an exceptional girl and an excellent player."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The daughter of the French man standing trial for enlisting dozens of strangers to rape his heavily-sedated wife on Tuesday clashed with her father at his trial, shouting in the courtroom that he would "die in lies".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since early September, Dominique Pelicot has been in the dock along with 49 other men for organising the rapes and sexual abuse of his now ex-wife Gisele Pelicot. In a closing statement, Dominique Pelicot again admitted to the accusations, saying that his "motive" was wanting to satisfy a "fantasy".</p>

<p>"I came to do what I did through people who willingly accepted what I proposed," he told the court.</p>

<p>Dominique Pelicot, as in previous statements, went back to his past, saying that he was affected throughout his life by a rape he said he suffered at the age of nine in hospital, and then at the age of 14 being forced to witness the gang-rape of a young girl at a building site.</p>

<p>"I don't know when I'll get out, but if I do get out (of prison), I don't have any plans. What saddens me the most is that people think I'm capable of certain things that I'm not capable of doing," he added.</p>

<p>Family lawyer Antoine Camus then interjected that Dominique Pelicot's daughter Caroline Darian, joined in court by her brothers David and Florian, needed an "audible and human response" to the actions she says she is "convinced" she suffered at his hands.</p>

<p>Caroline Darian, a pen name, in 2022, wrote a book "Et j'ai cesse de t'appeler papa" ("And I stopped calling you dad"). She believes she was also assaulted by her father who took intimate photographs of her.</p>

<p>"I am not going to try to convince her with perverse answers," Dominique Pelicot replied.</p>

<p>"I don't remember taking these photos. I tell her straight in the eyes that I never touched her."</p>

<p>He then turned to her directly and said: "Caroline, I have never done anything to you."</p>

<p>But she interrupted, saying: "You lie, you don't have the courage to tell the truth! Even about your ex-wife!"&nbsp;</p>

<p>"You will die in lies! Alone, alone in lies Dominique Pelicot!", she continued before being interrupted by judge Roger Arata.</p>

<p>Nude photos taken without her knowledge and photomontages of Caroline Darian with lewd titles were found on her father's hard drive. In some, she appears asleep, sometimes wearing her mother's underwear.</p>

<p>A total of 51 men, including Dominique Pelicot, are on trial, with one defendant still at large.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="CetSht_cn">
<p>Democrats and LGBTQ rights advocates expressed outrage Tuesday after a Republican lawmaker introduced a measure that would ban the first openly transgender person elected to the US Congress from using women's restrooms in the building.</p>

<p>The text targets Sarah McBride, who won one of Delaware's seats in the House of Representatives earlier this month and will take her place in Congress come January.</p>

<p>On Monday, Republican Representative Nancy Mace, a staunch ally of President-elect Donald Trump, introduced the resolution banning transgender women from using female restrooms.</p>

<p>The fiery South Carolina congresswoman also explained her thinking on X, posting that "biological men do not belong in private women's spaces. Period. Full stop. End of story."</p>

<p>Transgender rights are a hot-button issue in the United States -- with the participation of trans people in competitive sports and the subject of access to gender-affirming care for minors triggering fiery debate.</p>

<p>Democrats and LGBTQ advocates largely denounced Mace's effort, categorizing it as an attack on trans people.</p>

<p>Calling the proposed resolution "hateful," US House Democrat Becca Balint said there was "no bottom to the cruelty. We have an obligation to push back."</p>

<p>Mark Pocan, chair of the Congressional Equality Caucus, said the resolution was "a pathetic, attention-seeking attempt to grab Trump's eye and the media spotlight."</p>

<p>"Trans people, including trans employees, are paying the price," he said.</p>

<p>Asked Tuesday about the measure, Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson deflected, telling reporters: "This is an issue that Congress has never had to address before, and we're going to do that in deliberate fashion with member consensus."</p>

<p>McBride herself wrote on X that the maneuver was "a blatant attempt from far right-wing extremists to distract from the fact that they have no real solutions to what Americans are facing."</p>

<p>While McBride has acknowledged her groundbreaking status as the first openly trans lawmaker, she has said her legislative priorities will remain "affordable child care, paid family and medical leave, housing, health care, reproductive freedom."</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Millionaire tech entrepreneur Bryan Johnson suffered a severe allergic reaction and temporary disfigurement after his recent anti-ageing procedure.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Millionaire tech entrepreneur Bryan Johnson suffered a <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/tech-millionaire-bryan-johnsons-face-blows-up-after-anti-ageing-experiment-goes-wrong-7053138 ">severe allergic reaction</a> and temporary disfigurement after his recent anti-ageing procedure. The "Project Baby Face" involved injecting a donor's fat into his face. It was part of the 47-year-old's effort to look young after significant weight loss left him with a gaunt look, especially his face.</p>

<p>Mr Johnson was following a strict 1,950-calorie diet, which led to fat loss but also left him looking more aged than he desired.&nbsp;He experienced a severe allergic reaction just 30 minutes after the injections. His face began to swell rapidly, to the point where he was unable to see. Seven days later, Mr Johnson reassured his audience the swelling had subsided and his face returned to normal. He also mentioned that his team was already preparing for their next attempt at the procedure.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Here are some facts about Bryan Johnson:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Millionaire Bryan Johnson is at the forefront of the longevity movement. He is the founder of the ‘Don't Die' programme, which promotes longer, healthier, and happier lives.</li>
	<li>In 2021, he made headlines for launching Project Blueprint, an anti-ageing attempt involving a series of plasma transfusions. Under this, he underwent blood transfusions from young anonymous donors. According to Bloomberg, he screened these donors to ensure they had an ideal body mass index, were free from diseases, and maintained a healthy lifestyle.</li>
	<li>He reportedly spends $2 million annually on anti-aging treatments. In 2023, he participated in a "multigenerational plasma exchange," where he <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/man-swaps-blood-with-his-father-and-son-in-age-reversing-procedure-4058320">infused himself with plasma from his then 17-year-old son</a> and had his father, then 70, undergo a similar procedure. The 47-year-old's goal is to maintain the health of a much younger person, claiming to have the heart of a 37-year-old and the skin of a 28-year-old.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Bryan Johnson graduated with a BA in International Studies from Brigham Young University in 2003 and earned an MBA from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business in 2007, as per his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryanrjohnson/ " rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> profile.</li>
	<li>Bryan Johnson founded Braintree in 2007, which acquired Venmo for $26.2 million in 2012. By 2013, Braintree was processing $12 billion in payments and was acquired by PayPal for $800 million, with Johnson earning over $300 million. In 2014, he launched the OS Fund with $100 million to invest in emerging technologies. In 2016, he founded Kernel, investing $100 million to develop brain activity technology, including devices for conditions like Alzheimer's and strokes. By 2020, Kernel had raised $53 million from external investors.&nbsp;</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A road rage incident in North Carolina turned deadly when a 75-year-old man fatally shot another man on Saturday evening. According to witnesses, Terrell Eugene Giddens allegedly shot 40-year-old Jeffrey Michael Guida with a rifle after the two men pulled over and got out of their vehicles during a traffic dispute, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/14/us-news/north-carolina-father-40-killed-in-front-of-his-3-young-kids-during-road-rage-dispute-with-elderly-man-75/" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>New York Post </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Giddens also reportedly fired at Mr Guida's car, which had Guida's three children - aged 13, 11, and 2 - inside. Fortunately, the children were unharmed, as confirmed by the Catawba County Sheriff's Office.</p>

<p>"It certainly could have been worse if the children were injured or killed," Catawba County Sheriff's Office Capt. Aaron Turk told WBTV.</p>

<p>Giddens was arrested and now faces charges of murder and three counts of first-degree attempted murder. Witnesses said the altercation took place at the intersection of Island Point Road and North View Harbour Drive in Catawba, NC, roughly an hour outside of Charlotte.</p>

<p>When deputies arrived at the scene around 5 p.m., they found Mr Guida dead, but Giddens was not present. Investigators used witness accounts and a description of Giddens and his vehicle to locate him at his home on Island Point Road, where he was taken into custody.</p>

<p>Friends and family have since created a small memorial for Mr Guida at the location where he was killed.</p>

<p>"It's unbelievable, isn't it? That something like that could happen right here in my neighbourhood," neighbour Dennis Couch told WBTV.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[The 61-year-old had suffered a fatal stab wound to the neck, according to records from the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A British photojournalist was tragically stabbed to death on a hiking trail in California, with his teenage son now facing charges for the murder, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/crime/paul-lowe-stabbing-son-california-hiking-b2630064.html" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>Independent </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Paul Lowe, an award-winning photographer known for documenting conflicts like the siege of Sarajevo during the Bosnian war, was found dead on October 12 in the San Gabriel Mountains.</p>

<p>The 61-year-old had suffered a fatal stab wound to the neck, according to records from the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://local.nixle.com/alert/11266773/"><em>Los Angeles County Medical Examiner</em></a>.</p>

<p>His 19-year-old son, Emir Lowe, was subsequently arrested on suspicion of murder, authorities confirmed.</p>

<p>The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department stated, "The District Attorney's office filed one count of murder against suspect Emir Lowe for the murder of his father, Christian Paul Lowe. There is no additional information at this time."</p>

<p>Emir Lowe is charged with one count of murder and is scheduled to appear in court for the first time on Wednesday at the West Covina Courthouse, according to police.</p>

<p>The incident reportedly occurred around 3:28 p.m. on Mount Baldy Road, near Stoddard Canyon Falls. Authorities responded to a call about an assault with a deadly weapon and found a "white male adult suffering trauma to his upper torso."</p>

<p>Paul Lowe was pronounced dead at the scene by emergency responders.</p>

<p>The sheriff's department added that a man fitting the suspect's description was seen leaving the scene in a vehicle, which later crashed a few miles away. The individual was detained for further investigation.</p>

<p><em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://x.com/warstudies/status/1846226458726830450">King's College London</a>,</em> where Paul Lowe was a visiting professor in war studies, expressed their condolences, stating that the esteemed photojournalist would be "deeply missed."</p>

<p>"Paul was a Visiting Professor in the Department of War Studies, a Professor of Photojournalism at the University of the Arts London, and an award-winning photojournalist with VII Academy. A friend, colleague and collaborator whose work had a huge impact in shining a spotlight on the Siege of Sarajevo and addressing its legacy, we were privileged to work with him on several projects related to art and reconciliation.</p>

<p>"His boundless energy, warmth, creativity, initiative and enthusiasm were contagious and uniquely inspiring. He will be deeply missed.</p>

<p>"We send our deepest condolences to his family at this difficult time."<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Speaking about the challenges faced in the region, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar in his address at the SCO Summit in Islamabad today made a veiled reference about China and Pakistan.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Speaking about the challenges faced in the region, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar in his address at the SCO Summit in Islamabad today made a veiled reference about China and Pakistan.</p>

<p>The foreign minister said, "If trust is lacking or cooperation inadequate, if friendship has fallen short and good neighbourliness is missing somewhere, there are surely reasons to introspect and causes to address," adding that "It is only when we reaffirm our commitment most sincerely to the Charter that we can fully realise the benefits of cooperation and integration that it envisages."</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar's remarks come at a time where relations both with China and Pakistan are severely strained due to issues of terrorism from Pakistan and military standoffs with China along the Line of Actual Control.</p>

<p>Ties between India and Pakistan has gone into a deep-freeze as India has made it clear that dialogue can happen only in an atmosphere "free of terror" and that the ball is now in Pakistan's court for them to end the scourge of terrorism. As for China, ties have diminished to the very minimum after Beijing's multiple unilateral actions along the Line of Actual Control over the last few years. There can be no cooperation when there is no trust, and that is what Mr Jaishankar highlighted in his subtle reference to the two neighbours.</p>

<p>Addressing all the delegates at the key regional summit, Mr Jaishankar also said that "Cooperation must be based on mutual respect and sovereign equality. It should recognize territorial integrity and sovereignty. It must be built on genuine partnerships, not unilateral agendas. It cannot progress if we cherry-pick global practices, especially of trade and transit."</p>

<p>Speaking about the "three evils" that plague our world, Mr Jaishankar said, "But most of all, our endeavours will progress only when our commitment to the Charter remains firm. It is axiomatic that development and growth requires peace and stability. And as the Charter spelt out, this means being firm and uncompromising in countering the 'three evils'. If activities across borders are characterized by terrorism, extremism and separatism, they are hardly likely to encourage trade, energy flows, connectivity and people-to-people exchanges in parallel."</p>

<p>Giving a glimpse of how the region would be if the these evils were addressed and countered successfully, Mr Jaishankar said, "Let us contemplate how much we all stand to gain if it was to be otherwise. Our very agenda today in Islamabad gives us a glimpse of those possibilities. Industrial cooperation can enhance competitiveness and expand labour markets. MSME collaboration has positive implications for employment. Our collective endeavours can expand resources and encourage investment flows. Business communities will profit through larger networks. Collaborative connectivity can create new efficiencies. The world of logistics, as indeed of energy, could undergo a sea change. Environmental protection and climate action are ready domains for mutually beneficial exchanges. The treatment of infectious and non-infectious diseases will benefit from accessible and affordable pharmaceutical capabilities. Whether it is health, food or energy security, we are all clearly better off working together. Indeed, even culture, education and sports are promising areas. In effect, there is so much that we can do once we are truly determined to promote that synergy."</p>

<p>The foreign minister further emphasised that "This is not just an endeavor for our own benefit. We all realize that the world is moving towards multi-polarity. Globalization and rebalancing are realities that cannot be denied. Cumulatively, they have created many new opportunities in terms of trade, investment, connectivity, energy flows and other forms of collaboration. There is no question that our region would benefit immensely if we take this forward. Not just that, others too would draw their own inspiration and lessons from such efforts."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An influencer in Taiwan who touted herself as a "caring" mother of five has been accused of abusing and killing a 2-year-old boy under her care. According to the <em>South China Morning Post (SCMP)</em>, the woman, identified by her surname Sung, allegedly killed a toddler after repeatedly abusing him for a week. She was previously a parenting expert with nearly 9,000 followers on Facebook. The woman had been posting loving photos of her and her five children, and sharing her experiences as a parent. So, the boy's father was convinced by her posts and sent his son under her care in February, paying her $930 a month.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, in June, the little boy vomited and lost consciousness after being beaten during a bath. At the time, Sung rushed him to the hospital, where he was declared dead from serious injuries. Forensic examinations later revealed 15 old and new injuries on the boy, including seven caused by club and shoehorn. The 2-year-old had also suffered skull fractures and a brain haemorrhage, the outlet reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3281981/caring-taiwan-kol-mother-5-accused-beating-and-killing-toddler-under-her-care" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>SCMP</em></a>, Sung, who had been bringing up her children on her own, got a home care licence in 2022 but cancelled it in March. The boy's father then registered with the government for Sung to continue looking after his son.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sung allegedly abused the boy for a week before his death because he refused to eat his meals by himself and was not tidy enough. A surveillance camera installed at her home recorded her crime. Authorities said that the woman constantly beat the boy on the head with a shoehorn, knocked him against a wall and threw him into the bathtub, which eventually caused his death.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sung has been charged with injuring and killing a child. She faces a minimum of 10 years in jail and a maximum of life imprisonment. Kaohsiung Social Affairs Bureau said they had sent her five children to their relatives and would carry out home visits regularly.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on social media, users discovered that in 2016, Sung posted that she felt "painful about news of child abuse" and denounced parents abusing their own children. "What were you thinking, abusing other people's child in front of your five kids? How could you abuse a kid while writing all those parenting posts?" said one post on her Facebook page.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Russian man who survived 66 days adrift at sea in a small inflatable boat on Wednesday spoke from his hospital bed about his ordeal.</p>

<p>Mikhail Pichugin, 46, was rescued by a fishing boat Monday off the coast of the far eastern Kamchatka peninsula, more than two months after he set off on a boat trip with his brother and 15-year-old nephew, both of whom died aboard.</p>

<p>Taken to a hospital in the city of Magadan, Pichugin was well enough to speak briefly to journalists Wednesday, lying in a hospital bed.</p>

<p>Looking pale with red-rimmed eyes but not emaciated, he gave a few details of how he managed to survive in the Sea of Okhotsk.</p>

<p>"With God's help, how else? If a boat called Angel saved me," he said, smiling, referring to the name of the fishing boat whose crew spotted him.</p>

<p>"I collected rainwater," he said. He also credited a sleeping bag filled with camel hair for helping him survive.</p>

<p>"It's wet, it doesn't get dry but you crawl under it, you wriggle around a bit and you get warm."</p>

<p>"I had no choice. I have my mother at home, my daughter," he added on his motivation to live.</p>

<p>Magadan deputy governor Tatiana Savchenko said his condition was "satisfactory".</p>

<p>She said the administration would pay for Pichugin to fly home and for relatives to visit.</p>

<p>Pichugin comes from Ulan-Ude in Siberia but was working on the far eastern island of Sakhalin as a driver.</p>

<p>He set off from the coast of the Khabarovsk region on August 9 with his visiting brother Sergei, 49, and nephew Ilya, 15, on a crossing to Sakhalin meant to take a few hours.</p>

<p>When they failed to arrive, Russian rescuers surveyed the area by helicopter and plane, suspecting the boat had drifted towards Kamchatka, but found nothing and the search was eventually called off.</p>

<p>The boat was found around 1,000 kilometres (670 miles) from its starting point.</p>

<p>Pichugin may have survived because of his portly 100-kilogramme (220 pounds) stature, according to his wife. Russian television reported he weighed only 50kg when found on Monday.</p>

<p>His wife Yekaterina told RIA Novosti news agency: "It's a kind of miracle". She said the men had taken enough food and water to last only two weeks.</p>

<p>Transport investigators have launched a probe into possible breaches of safety rules, raising the prospect that Pichugin could face a criminal charge and risk a jail term of up to seven years.</p>

<p>Russian television reported the men should have taken a satellite phone, the only means of communication in the Sea of Okhotsk.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday unveiled his long-awaited Victory Plan to end Russia's invasion, rejecting any territorial concessions and urging ramped-up Western backing, including an invitation to join NATO.</p>

<p>After pushing back Russian troops at the start of the invasion in February 2022, Kyiv is now facing mounting pressure to find an exit strategy as its troops suffer battlefield losses and Moscow intensifies its strikes on infrastructure.</p>

<p>Russia has seized around a fifth of Ukraine's territory since the invasion began, reducing towns and cities to rubble and killing thousands of civilians.</p>

<p>But in his address to lawmakers in Kyiv on Wednesday, the 46-year-old leader ruled out the possibility that Ukraine could cede some territory to secure peace and also dismissed any pause in the conflict.</p>

<p>"Russia must lose the war against Ukraine. And this does not mean a freeze (in fighting) and it does not mean any trade in Ukraine's territory or sovereignty," Zelensky said in his speech to lawmakers, flanked by European Union and Ukrainian flags.</p>

<p>The number one priority in the five-part so-called Victory Plan, the Ukrainian leader said, was closer integration with the US-led NATO defence alliance.</p>

<p>"The first point is an invitation to NATO, now," Zelensky said, claiming that Moscow had been undermining security in Europe for decades because Kyiv was not a member.</p>

<p><strong>Kremlin derides 'futile' plan</strong></p>

<p>Zelensky also said that his country's Western allies should lift restrictions on Ukraine's use of long-range weapons so Kyiv can target Russian military sites on occupied Ukrainian territory and also within Russia.</p>

<p>The Kremlin immediately dismissed Zelensky's roadmap to end the grinding conflict, describing it as "some ephemeral peace plan".</p>

<p>"The only peace plan there can be is for the Kyiv regime to realise the futility of the policy it is pursuing and understand the need to sober up," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.</p>

<p>Russia has demanded Kyiv abandon territory it already controls in the east and south of Ukraine as a precondition for peace talks.</p>

<p>The Russian military announced during Zelensky's address to lawmakers that its forces had captured two more villages in eastern Ukraine, where its forces are steadily advancing.</p>

<p>The ministry said the villages of Nevske and Krasnyi Yar had been "liberated", publishing a video of destroyed buildings in Nevske with Russian flags flying from two of them.</p>

<p><strong>'Coalition of criminals'</strong></p>

<p>In his address, Zelensky criticised China, Iran and North Korea for their support for Moscow, renewing accusations that Pyongyang was sending its citizens to work in Russian factories and fight alongside Russian forces.</p>

<p>"The coalition of criminals along with Putin already includes North Korea," Zelensky told lawmakers. "Everyone sees the Iranian regime's assistance to Putin, and also China's cooperation with Russia."</p>

<p>Kyiv has dismissed any rival plans to end the war, including those put forward by Brazil and China, saying they lack guarantees for Ukraine's security or the war-battered country's sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>

<p>Unlike Zelensky's "Peace Formula," an agenda that stipulates Russia must withdraw all its troops from Ukraine's internationally-recognised borders, the Ukrainian leader had until Wednesday given few details about his "Victory Plan."</p>

<p>He visited European leaders last week in a bid to promote the plan and secure as much aid as possible, as future backing from Washington hinges on the outcome of presidential elections next month.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, he said he had discussed a secret annex to the "Victory Plan" with the United States, Britain, France, Italy and Germany to deploy on Ukrainian territory a "non-nuclear strategic deterrence package" that would discourage future Russian attacks after the war.</p>

<p>He also said he would present his Victory Plan in full at an EU summit on Thursday, urging more Western support and an invitation to NATO.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here are the five main points of a Ukrainian plan for victory against Russian invading forces no later than next year as outlined by President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Wednesday. Another three points were secret, he said, as he unveiled the plan in a speech at Ukraine's parliament:</p>

<p><strong>NATO INVITE</strong></p>

<p>Ukraine needs an unconditional invitation to join the NATO military alliance now, he said.</p>

<p>"We understand that NATO membership is a matter of the future, not the present. But (Russian President Vladimir) Putin can see that his geopolitical calculations are headed for defeat," Zelenskiy said.</p>

<p><strong>BEEF UP UKRAINE'S DEFENCE CAPABILITIES</strong></p>

<p>He said Ukraine's ability to defend itself had to be "irreversibly strengthened" and laid out a number of ways to do this.</p>

<p>They included further arming Ukraine and strengthening its defence industry, boosting air defence capabilities, removing restrictions on weapon use and a continuation of Ukrainian military operations on Russian soil.</p>

<p><strong>DETERRENCE</strong></p>

<p>Zelenskiy said Ukraine's western allies should deter Russia from any further aggression by showing Moscow that this would have consequences.</p>

<p>"Ukraine proposes to place on its soil a comprehensive non-nuclear strategic deterrence package that will be sufficient to protect Ukraine from any military threat from Russia," he said.</p>

<p>He said there was also a secret addendum to this part of the plan, and did not go into further detail on what the proposed deterrence involved.</p>

<p><strong>STRATEGIC ECONOMIC POTENTIAL</strong></p>

<p>Zelenskiy proposed that Ukraine sign an agreement with the U.S., EU and other unnamed allies that would allow for joint investments and use of Ukraine's natural resources, which Zelenskiy said were worth trillions of dollars.</p>

<p>"These include, in particular, uranium, titanium, lithium, graphite and other strategically valuable resources that will strengthen either Russia and its allies or Ukraine and the democratic world in global competition," he said.</p>

<p><strong>UKRAINE STRENGTHENING NATO</strong></p>

<p>Zelenskiy proposed that after the war, Ukraine's armed forces could be used to enhance the security of NATO, and replace some of the U.S. forces currently stationed in Europe.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Mr Hwang expressed remorse, stating he was "deeply sorry" for causing "disappointment."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korean footballer Hwang Ui-jo has publicly apologized for secretly recording sexual encounters with his partners. Prosecutors stated that the 31-year-old striker filmed intimate moments with two of his partners without their consent on four occasions between June and September 2022, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c23k5jdgppgo" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>BBC </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/sports/2024/10/600_384372.html"><em>Korea Times</em></a>, prosecutors demanded a four-year prison term for the footballer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During his first court appearance in Seoul on Wednesday, Mr Hwang expressed remorse, stating he was "deeply sorry" for causing "disappointment."</p>

<p>Last month, Mr Hwang departed from England's Nottingham Forest to join Turkey's Alanyaspor.</p>

<p>The recordings came to light when Mr Hwang's sister-in-law posted them on social media last June as part of an attempt to blackmail him. She was later sentenced to three years in prison in September after Hwang filed a lawsuit against her.</p>

<p>Despite the blackmail case, prosecutors continued to pursue charges against Hwang for illegally filming the videos. They declined to release information about the women involved to avoid causing further harm.</p>

<p>In court, Hwang stated, "I will not do anything wrong in the future and will do my best as a footballer."</p>

<p>He added, "I sincerely apologize to the victims affected by my actions, and I am deeply sorry for the disappointment I have caused to everyone who has supported me."</p>

<p>The sentencing date for Mr Hwang was slated for December 18, 2024.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The batteries inside the weaponised pagers that arrived in Lebanon at the start of the year, part of an Israeli plot to decimate Hezbollah, had powerfully deceptive features and an Achilles' heel.</p>

<p>The agents who built the pagers designed a battery that concealed a small but potent charge of plastic explosive and a novel detonator that was invisible to X-ray, according to a Lebanese source with first-hand knowledge of the pagers, and teardown photos of the battery pack seen by Reuters.</p>

<p>To overcome the weakness - the absence of a plausible backstory for the bulky new product - they created fake online stores, pages and posts that could deceive Hezbollah due diligence, a Reuters review of web archives shows.</p>

<p>The stealthy design of the pager bomb and the battery's carefully constructed cover story, both described here for the first time, shed light on the execution of a years-long operation which has struck unprecedented blows against Israel's Iran-backed Lebanese foe and pushed the Middle East closer to a regional war.</p>

<p>A thin, square sheet with six grams of white pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) plastic explosive was squeezed between two rectangular battery cells, according to the Lebanese source and photos.</p>

<p>The remaining space between the battery cells could not be seen in the photos but was occupied by a strip of highly flammable material that acted as the detonator, the source said.</p>

<p>This three-layer sandwich was inserted in a black plastic sleeve, and encapsulated in a metal casing roughly the size of a match box, the photos showed.</p>

<p>The assembly was unusual because it did not rely on a standard miniaturised detonator, typically a metallic cylinder, the source and two bomb experts said. All three spoke on conditions of anonymity.</p>

<p>Without any metal components, the material used to trigger detonation had an edge: like the plastic explosives, it was not detected by X-ray.</p>

<p>Upon receiving the pagers in February, Hezbollah looked for the presence of explosives, two people familiar with the matter said, putting them through airport security scanners to see if they triggered alarms. Nothing suspicious was reported.</p>

<p>The devices were likely set up to generate a spark within the battery pack, enough to light the detonating material, and trigger the sheet of PETN to explode, said the two bomb experts, to whom Reuters showed the pager-bomb design.</p>

<p>Since explosives and wrapping took about a third of the volume, the battery pack carried a fraction of the power consistent with its 35 gram weight, two battery experts said.</p>

<p>"There is a significant amount of unaccounted for mass," said Paul Christensen, an expert in lithium batteries at Britain's Newcastle University.</p>

<p>At some point, Hezbollah noticed the battery was draining faster than expected, the Lebanese source said. However, the issue did not appear to raise major security concerns - the group was still handing its members the pagers hours before the attack.</p>

<p>On September 17, thousands of pagers simultaneously exploded in the southern suburbs of Beirut and other Hezbollah strongholds, in most cases after the devices beeped, indicating an incoming message.</p>

<p>Among the victims rushed to hospital, many had eye injuries, missing fingers or gaping holes in their abdomens, indicating their proximity to the devices at the time of detonation, Reuters witnesses saw. In total, the pager attack, and a second on the following day that activated weaponized walkie-talkies, killed 39 people and wounded more than 3,400.</p>

<p>Two Western security sources said Israeli intelligence agency Mossad spearheaded the pager and walkie-talkie attacks.</p>

<p>Reuters could not establish where the devices were manufactured. The office of Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which has authority over Mossad, did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Lebanon's Information Ministry and a spokesperson for Hezbollah declined to comment for this article.</p>

<p>Israel has neither denied nor confirmed a role. The day after the attacks Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant praised Mossad's "very impressive" results in comments that were widely interpreted in Israel as a tacit acknowledgement of the agency's participation.</p>

<p>US officials have said they were not informed of the operation in advance.</p>

<p><strong>THE WEAK LINK</strong></p>

<p>From the outside, the pager's power source looked like a standard lithium-ion battery pack used in thousands of consumer electronics goods.</p>

<p>And yet, the battery, labelled LI-BT783, had a problem: Like the pager, it did not exist on the market.</p>

<p>So Israel's agents created a backstory from scratch.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has serious procurement procedures to check what they buy, a former Israeli intelligence officer, who was not involved in the pager operation, told Reuters.</p>

<p>"You want to make sure that if they look, they find something," the former spy said, requesting not to be named. "Not finding anything is not good."</p>

<p>Creating backstories, or "legends", for undercover agents has long been a core skill of spy agencies. What made the pager plot unusual is that those skills appear to have been applied to ubiquitous consumer electronics products.</p>

<p>For the pagers, the agents deceived Hezbollah by selling the custom-created model, AR-924, under an existing, renowned Taiwanese brand, Gold Apollo.</p>

<p>Gold Apollo's chairman, Hsu Ching-kuang, told reporters a day after the pager attack that he was approached about three years ago by a former employee, Teresa Wu, and her "big boss, called Tom" to discuss a licence agreement.</p>

<p>Hsu said he had scant information about Wu's superior, but he granted them the right to design their own products and market them under the widely distributed Gold Apollo brand.</p>

<p>Reuters could not establish the identity of the manager, nor whether the person or Wu knowingly worked with Israeli intelligence.</p>

<p>The chairman said he was not impressed by the AR-924 when he saw it, but still added photos and a description of the product to his company's website, helping give it both visibility and credibility. There was no way to directly buy the AR-924 from his website.</p>

<p>Hsu said he knew nothing about the pagers' lethal capabilities or the broader operation to attack Hezbollah. He described his company as a victim of the plot.</p>

<p>Gold Apollo declined to provide further comment. Calls and messages sent to Wu went unanswered. She has not given a statement to the media since the attacks.</p>

<p><strong>"I KNOW THIS PRODUCT"</strong></p>

<p>In September 2023, webpages and images featuring the AR-924 and its battery were added to apollosystemshk.com, a website that said it had a licence to distribute Gold Apollo products, as well as the rugged pager and its bulky power source, according to a Reuters review of internet records and metadata.</p>

<p>The website gave an address in Hong Kong for a company called Apollo Systems HK. No company by that name exists at the address or in Hong Kong Corporate records.</p>

<p>However, the website was listed by Wu, the Taiwanese businesswoman, on her Facebook page as well as in public incorporation records when she registered a company called Apollo Systems in Taipei earlier this year.</p>

<p>A section of the apollosystemshk.com site devoted to the LI-BT783 put emphasis on the battery's outstanding performance. Unlike the disposable batteries that powered older generation pagers, it boasted 85 days of autonomy and could be recharged via a USB cable, according to the website and a 90-second promotional video on YouTube.</p>

<p>In late 2023, two battery stores came online with the LI-BT783 listed in their catalogues, Reuters found. And in two online forums devoted to batteries, participants discussed the power source, despite its lack of commercial availability: "I know this product," a user with the handle Mikevog wrote in April 2023. "It's got a great datasheet and a great performance."</p>

<p>Reuters could not establish the identity of Mikevog.</p>

<p>The website, the online stores, and the forum discussions bear the hallmark of a deception effort, the former Israeli intelligence officer and two Western security officers told Reuters. The websites have been scrubbed from the web since the pager bombs devastated Lebanon, but archived and cached copies are still viewable.</p>

<p>Ruing the day they bought the pagers, Hezbollah leaders said they had launched internal investigations to understand how the security breach could happen and identify possible moles.</p>

<p>The group had shifted to pagers at the start of the year after realising that cellphone communications were compromised by Israeli eavesdropping, Reuters previously reported.</p>

<p>Hezbollah's investigations have helped uncover how Israeli agents used an aggressive sales tactic to make sure Hezbollah's procurement manager chose the AR-924, one of the people familiar with the matter said.</p>

<p>The salesperson who conveyed the offer made a very inexpensive proposition for the pagers, "and kept bringing the price down until he was pulled in," the person said.</p>

<p>Lebanese authorities have condemned the attacks as a serious violation of Lebanon's sovereignty. On September 19, in his last public speech before he was killed by Israel, Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said the device blasts could amount to a "declaration of war" and vowed to punish Israel.</p>

<p>Hezbollah and Israel have been exchanging fire since October 8, 2023, when the operator group began launching rockets at Israeli military positions in solidarity with its Palestinian ally Hamas.</p>

<p>In the wake of the device attacks, Israel has launched a full-on war on Hezbollah, including a ground invasion of southern Lebanon and airstrikes that have killed most of its top leadership.</p>

<p>Hezbollah's internal investigation into the pager attack, still underway, suffered a setback on September 28: Eleven days after the devices exploded, the senior Hezbollah official tasked with leading the procurement probe, Nabil Kaouk, was himself killed by an Israeli airstrike.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's top diplomat has warned UN chief Antonio Guterres that Tehran is ready for a "decisive and regretful" response if Israel attacks his country in retaliation for a missile attack.</p>

<p>The Islamic republic fired about 200 missiles at Israel on October 1 in revenge for the killing of two of its closest allies, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, as well as an Iranian general.</p>

<p>Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant vowed last week that his country's retaliatory measure would be "deadly, precise and surprising".</p>

<p>"Iran, while making all-out efforts to protect the peace and security of the region, is fully prepared for a decisive and regretful response to any adventures" by Israel, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said during a phone call with Guterres, according to a statement from his office on Wednesday.</p>

<p>During the call on Tuesday evening, Araghchi also appealed to the United Nations to use its resources "to stop the crimes and aggressions of the Israeli regime and to send humanitarian aid to Lebanon and Gaza".</p>

<p>Iran's top diplomat also spoke on the phone with his French counterpart Jean-Noel Barrot on Tuesday, his office said.</p>

<p>In the call, Araghchi stressed the need to stop Israeli attacks on Lebanon, warned against any "new adventures" by its arch-foe in the region, and called for the removal of Israeli "obstacles" impeding the delivery of aid to displaced people.</p>

<p>It followed a phone conversation on Sunday between the two countries' presidents, Emmanuel Macron and Masoud Pezeshkian.</p>

<p>Over the past week, Araghchi has visited Lebanon, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Iraq and Oman in an effort to ease tensions.</p>

<p>Araghchi arrived in Jordan on Wednesday before travelling to Egypt and Turkey, Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei said in a post on social media platform X.</p>

<p>Upon his arrival in Amman, Araghchi met his Jordanian counterpart Ayman Safadi and the two discussed regional developments amid Israel's "atrocity and aggression against Gaza and Lebanon", Baghaei said.</p>

<p>The official Iranian news agency IRNA said Araghchi also met with Jordan's King Abdullah II.</p>

<p>The developments come against the backdrop of a war between Israel and Iran-allied Palestinian operator group Hamas that has been raging for more than a year and has expanded to include Lebanon in recent weeks.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A woman in the United States has been arrested on allegations of killing her mother and dismembering her body. According to <em>The Independent</em>, the 32-year-old woman, identified as Torilena May Fields, was initially charged on Wednesday with abuse of corpse, tampering with evidence and obstructing governmental operations when she was arrested in connection to the death of her mother, Trudy Fields. She allegedly stabbed and shot her mother multiple times. She is also accused of torturing and killing a dog. Authorities have hinted that further charges could be added as the investigation progresses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/crime/kentucky-dismember-body-mom-daughter-murder-b2629228.html"><em>The Independent</em></a>, authorities on Wednesday said that when the worker hired to work on Trudy Fields's home arrived at the property he couldn't find the homeowner but then came across a dismembered body in the backyard. At first, he thought the remains were Trudy Fields' and called the Kentucky State Police.</p>

<p>Officers then responded to the scene and found a woman's body on a blood-stained mattress. Cops then spotted a second blood-stained mattress that had been dragged toward the back of the house.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After finding another woman inside the house, the troopers attempted to speak with her, but she allegedly refused to acknowledge them or allow them entry, forcing them to procure search warrants.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Units responded and found a dead female in the backyard," KSP Trooper David Jones said in an arrest citation. "Tried to make contact with somebody at the house. The house was locked up. They backed up, and set up a perimeter. We had other units respond. Ended up getting a search warrant for the residence," he added, per the outlet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then, members of the state police's Special Response Team found Torilena Fields, 32, alone in the house. Police gave her multiple commands to leave her home, but she allegedly refused to comply, according to an arrest document.</p>

<p>Cops were eventually forced to remove the 32-year-old from her home. After taking her into custody, they discovered that parts had been removed from the body outside and were stuffed into a folded-up mattress. When they arrested Fields, she had blood on her face, hands and clothing, and when they entered the house, they found a stainless steel pot containing body parts that appeared to have been cooked in an oven.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The worker who discovered the body told the authorities that the 32-year-old had been on the property during one of his previous visits and had been "casting spells on them and was being confrontational."</p>

<p>Fields was also reportedly under the influence of drugs when they arrested her. She is charged with murder, abuse of a corpse, tampering with physical evidence, torture of a dog or cat, and obstructing governmental operations. She is being held at the Bourbon Count Detention Center on a $1.5 million bond.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[As the climate turns warmer and compels people to relocate, droughts could become the main driver of migration and cities are expected to become more populated, according to a study.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the climate turns warmer and compels people to relocate, droughts could become the main driver of migration and cities are expected to become more populated, according to a study that analysed trends in internal migration in 72 countries over 50 years.</p>

<p>While migration, both within or across a country's borders, has traditionally been seen as an economic or a conflict-related consequence, in recent years, environmental factors have increasingly become significant for people to relocate.</p>

<p>Researchers said that as droughts intensify and regions become more dry, the movement of people accelerates, often leading to a migration towards urban areas, where opportunities could be scarce but are perceived as more stable.</p>

<p>"When faced with environmental pressures like prolonged dryness, many people see migration as their least bad option," said author Marco Percoco, Director of the GREEN Research Center at Bocconi University, Italy.</p>

<p>Using census-based data, the researchers analysed 107,840 migration flows within 72 countries between 1960 and 2016.</p>

<p>"We find that increased drought and aridity have a significant impact on internal migration, particularly in the hyper-arid and arid areas of Southern Europe, South Asia, Africa and the Middle East and South America," the authors wrote in the study published in the journal Nature Climate Change.</p>

<p>Rural areas, especially those dependent on agriculture, were found to be the hardest hit because of climate change. The communities in these regions are most likely to experience the effects of worsening droughts, the researchers said.</p>

<p>In places where farming is the main source of income, drying soils and dwindling water supplies directly translate into lost livelihoods, thereby driving people towards urban areas, they added.</p>

<p>The move to cities is a coping strategy, a way for rural families to adapt to conditions that no longer support their way of life, the authors said.</p>

<p>Urban areas, therefore, become magnets for people fleeing rural ones -- a trend that the researchers said is reshaping urban landscapes as the needs and challenges of the migrants further strain an already stressed infrastructure.</p>

<p>The authors thus called for a holistic approach to address the root causes of climate-induced migration, including proactive strategies to improve support systems in urban areas.</p>

<p>They also highlighted the need for policies that help rural communities adapt to climate change in place, thereby possibly reducing the need for migration in the first place.</p>

<p>Better water management, agricultural innovation, and social safety nets could help stabilise populations and allow people to continue their lives without being forced to move, the authors said.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel conducted strikes on Wednesday targeting Hezbollah's main bastion and a city in southern Lebanon where it holds sway, after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed calls for a ceasefire.</p>

<p>The strike on south Beirut, the operator's main stronghold, was the first in several days of calm in the area, after an intense period of bombardment earlier in the Israel-Hezbollah war.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, warplanes pounded the city of Nabatiyeh in south Lebanon, where Hezbollah and its ally Amal hold sway, with the strikes sending a thick plume of smoke billowing over houses, palm trees and the blue-tipped minaret of a mosque.</p>

<p>The Lebanese health ministry said five people were killed in the Nabatiyeh strikes on two municipal buildings, while a local official said the mayor was among the dead.</p>

<p>Israel ramped up its bombardment mainly of Hezbollah strongholds in late September, and sent ground troops across the Lebanese border on September 30.</p>

<p>The Israel-Hezbollah war has left at least 1,356 people dead in Lebanon, according to an AFP tally of Lebanese health ministry figures, though the real toll is likely higher.</p>

<p>Hezbollah started low-intensity strikes on Israel in October last year, in support of its ally Hamas following the October 7 attack that triggered the Gaza war.</p>

<p>With Hamas weakened but not crushed, Israel widened the focus of its military operations to include Lebanon, vowing to fight until tens of thousands of Israelis forced by Hezbollah's fire to flee their homes are able to return.</p>

<p>The war in Lebanon, which has suffered years of economic and political crisis, has displaced at least 690,000 people, according to figures from the International Organization for Migration.</p>

<p>- No ceasefire -</p>

<p>The latest strikes came hours after Netanyahu told French President Emmanuel Macron he was "opposed to a unilateral ceasefire, which does not change the security situation in Lebanon, and which will only return it to the way it was", according to a statement from his office.</p>

<p>Netanyahu and the Israeli military have insisted there must be a buffer zone along Israel's border with Lebanon where there are no Hezbollah fighters.</p>

<p>"Prime Minister Netanyahu clarified that Israel would not agree to any arrangement that does not provide this (a buffer zone) and which does not stop Hezbollah from rearming and regrouping," the statement said.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Hezbollah's deputy leader Naim Qassem said the only solution was a ceasefire, while threatening to expand the scope of its missile strikes across Israel.</p>

<p>"Since the Israeli enemy targeted all of Lebanon, we have the right from a defensive position to target any place" in Israel, he said.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the Iran-backed group said it launched a barrage of rockets towards the northern Israeli city of Haifa and targeted Israeli bulldozers and a tank near the border.</p>

<p>Israel's military had kept up its bombardment on Tuesday and said it captured three Hezbollah fighters in south Lebanon.</p>

<p>Asked about Israeli air strikes in Lebanon, in which residential buildings in the centre of Beirut were hit on October 10, the US State Department voiced open criticism.</p>

<p>"We have made clear that we are opposed to the campaign the way we've seen it conducted over the past weeks" in Beirut, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters.</p>

<p>In a letter sent to the Israeli government on Sunday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin also warned that the United States could withhold weapons deliveries unless more humanitarian aid was delivered to Palestinians in Gaza.</p>

<p>The letter made "clear to the government of Israel that there are changes that they need to make again to see that the level of assistance making it into Gaza comes back up from the very, very low levels that it is at today," Miller said.</p>

<p>- 'Worst restrictions' -</p>

<p>Despite the need for food, medical supplies and shelter in hunger-ravaged Gaza, a spokesman for the UN's children's agency UNICEF said Tuesday that aid was facing the tightest restrictions since the start of Israel's offensive over a year ago.</p>

<p>"We see now what is probably the worst restrictions we've seen on humanitarian aid, ever," spokesman James Elder said, adding that there were "several days in the last week (where) no commercial trucks whatsoever were allowed to come in".</p>

<p>For over a week, Israeli forces have engaged in a sweeping air and ground assault targeting northern Gaza and the area around Jabalia amid claims that Hamas operators were regrouping there.</p>

<p>"The whole area has been reduced to ashes," said Rana Abdel Majid, 38, from the Al-Faluja area of northern Gaza.</p>

<p>Majid said entire blocks had been levelled by "the indiscriminate, merciless bombing."</p>

<p>Nidal al-Arab lost 10 of his family members during Israeli strikes on Jabalia.</p>

<p>"People are trapped. If they don't die of shelling, they will soon die of thirst and hunger because the siege is getting tighter," the 40-year-old told AFP.</p>

<p>Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza after an October 7 attack by Hamas that resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official Israeli figures, including hostages killed in captivity.</p>

<p>The Israeli campaign has killed 42,409 people, the majority civilians, according to figures from the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory which the UN considers reliable.</p>

<p>- Iran retaliation? -</p>

<p>Israel is also weighing how to respond to Iran's launch of around 200 missiles at the country on October 1.</p>

<p>Iran's top diplomat, Abbas Araghchi, warned UN chief Antonio Guterres that Tehran was ready for a "decisive and regretful" response should Israel attack his country.</p>

<p>Araghchi's conversation with Guterres was the latest in a string of diplomatic efforts by Iran, which also says its main goal is protect peace in the region.</p>

<p>Iran said its October 1 attack was in retaliation for an Israeli strike in Beirut that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Iranian general Abbas Nilforoushan on September 27.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden, whose government is Israel's top arms supplier, has warned Israel against striking Iran's nuclear or oil facilities.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A fuel tanker explosion in northern Nigeria has killed more than 140 people, a spokesman for the national emergency agency told AFP on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Victims were burnt to death on Tuesday trying to collect fuel that had spilled from the crashed vehicle in the town of Majia in Jigawa state.</p>

<p>Nura Abdullahi, a spokesman for the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), said "more than 140" people have been buried in a mass grave and warned the toll was likely to rise further.</p>

<p>The tanker had veered to avoid colliding with a truck in the town of Majia, police spokesman Lawan Shiisu Adam&nbsp;said.</p>

<p>Following the crash, residents crowded around the vehicle, collecting fuel that had spilled on the road and in drains, Adam said.</p>

<p>He said the residents had "overwhelmed" officers trying to stop them.</p>

<p>The Nigerian Medical Association has urged doctors to rush to nearby emergency rooms to help with the influx of patients.</p>

<p>Fuel tanker explosions are common in Africa's most populous nation, where roads can be poorly maintained and residents often look to siphon off fuel following accidents.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A giant sphere 700 m (2,300 ft) underground with thousands of light-detecting tubes will be sealed in a 12-storey cylindrical pool of water in coming months for an experiment that will shine new light on elusive subatomic particles called neutrinos.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A giant sphere 700 m (2,300 ft) underground with thousands of light-detecting tubes will be sealed in a 12-storey cylindrical pool of water in coming months for an experiment that will shine new light on elusive subatomic particles known as neutrinos.</p>

<p>After years of construction, the $300 million Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) in China's southern Guangdong province will soon start gathering data on neutrinos, a product of nuclear reactions, to help solve one of the biggest mysteries in particle physics.</p>

<p>Every second, trillions of extremely small neutrinos pass through matter, including the human body. In mid-flight, a neutrino, of which there are three known varieties, could transform into other types. Determining which types are the lightest and the heaviest would offer clues to subatomic processes during the early days of the universe and to explaining why matter is the way it is.</p>

<p>To that end, Chinese physicists and collaborating scientists from all over the world will analyse the data on neutrinos emitted by two nearby Guangdong nuclear power plants for up to six years.</p>

<p>JUNO would also be able to observe neutrinos from the sun, gaining a real-time view of solar processes. It could also study neutrinos given off by the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium in the Earth to better understand mantle convection driving tectonic plates.</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">A view of a cable car that transports workers, scientists, and visitors down a 1,266-metre-long slope tunnel to 700 metres underground.</p>
</div>

<p>Due to go operational in the latter half of 2025, JUNO will outpace the far larger Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) under construction in the United States. DUNE, backed by the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) under the US Department of Energy's (DOE) top particle physics laboratory, Fermilab, will come online around 2030.</p>

<p>The race to understand neutrinos and advance the study of particle physics, which has transformed medical imaging technologies and developed new energy sources, intensified when the DOE abruptly cut funding for U.S. institutes collaborating on JUNO. It instead focused on building DUNE, which has since been plagued by delays and budget overruns, with costs skyrocketing to more than $3 billion.</p>

<p>"China had supported Fermilab's LBNF at the time, but later the cooperation could not continue," Wang Yifang, chief scientist and project manager of JUNO, told Reuters during a recent government-backed media tour of the facility.</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">Chinese physicists and collaborating scientists from all over the world will analyse the data on neutrinos.</p>
</div>

<p>"Around 2018-2019, the US DOE asked all national laboratories not to cooperate with China, so Fermilab was forced to stop working with us."</p>

<p>The DOE, the largest US funding agency for particle physics, did not respond to Reuters' request for comment.</p>

<p>Sino-US tensions have risen sharply over the past decade. A trade war erupted during the Trump administration and President Joe Biden later cracked down on the sale of advanced technology to China.</p>

<p>In August, a bilateral science and technology cooperation pact signed in 1979 lapsed, potentially pushing more scientists to seek alternative partners, creating duplication in research and missing out on collaboration that otherwise might have led to beneficial discoveries.</p>

<p>In the 2010s, the countries jointly produced a nuclear reactor that could use low-enriched uranium, minimising the risk of any fuel being weaponised.</p>

<p>China's foreign ministry said Beijing was "in communication" with Washington about the lapsed science agreement. The U.S. State Department did not comment.</p>

<h2><strong>SOLE US COLLABORATOR</strong></h2>

<p>Institutions collaborating on JUNO hail from locations including France, Germany, Italy, Russia and the US, and even self-governed Taiwan, which China claims as part of its territory.</p>

<p>Neutrino observatories are also being constructed in other places.</p>

<p>"The one in the US will be six years behind us. And the one in the France and in Japan, they will be two or three years later than us. So we believe that we can get the result of mass hierarchy (of neutrinos) ahead of everybody," Wang said.</p>

<p>So far, real-life neutrino applications remain a distant prospect. Some scientists have mulled the possibility of relaying long-distance messages via neutrinos, which pass through solid matter such as the Earth at near light speed.</p>

<p>Researchers are keeping their distance from politics to focus on the science, although they remain at the mercy of governments providing the funding.</p>

<p>One US group remains in JUNO, backed by the National Science Foundation, which recently renewed its funding for its collaboration for another three years, the group's leading physicist told Reuters.</p>

<p>In contrast, more than a dozen US institutes participated in the predecessor to JUNO, the Daya Bay experiment, also in Guangdong.</p>

<p>"Despite any political differences, I believe that through our collaboration on this scientific endeavour, we are setting a positive example that may contribute, even in a small way, to bringing our countries closer together," said J. Pedro Ochoa-Ricoux of the University of California, Irvine.</p>

<h3><strong>DATA INTEGRITY</strong></h3>

<p>The passage of neutrinos from the two power stations will be logged by JUNO's 600 metric ton spherical detector, which will immediately transmit the data to Beijing electronically. The data will be simultaneously relayed to Russia, France and Italy, where it can be accessed by all of the collaborating institutions, said Cao Jun, JUNO's deputy manager.</p>

<p>Data integrity has been a concern among foreign companies in China since a law was enacted in 2021 on the use, storage and transfer of data in the name of safeguarding national security.</p>

<p>"We have a protocol to make sure that no data is missing," Cao said.</p>

<p>For data on the more crucial aspects of the experiment, at least two independent teams will conduct analyses, with their results cross-checked.</p>

<p>"When these two groups get a consistent result, we can publish it," Cao said.</p>

<p>US-based Ochoa-Ricoux, who previously collaborated on China's Daya Bay experiment, will lead the data analysis for JUNO. He will also be involved in the DUNE data analysis.</p>

<p>"We welcome the Americans," said Wang, also director of the Institute of High Energy Physics, the Chinese counterpart of Fermilab.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dynamiting inter-Korea roads and railways. Threatening war over drone incursions. Moving nuclear-capable weapons to the border. North Korea appears very unhappy with the South at the moment -- but why?&nbsp;</p>

<p>What we know:&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What has changed?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>For decades, North Korea was officially committed to reunification, and in their constitutions, both North and South Korea claim sovereignty over the whole of the peninsula.</p>

<p>But in January, the North's leader Kim Jong Un declared South Korea his "principal enemy", cut all communications to an "irretrievable level", and had mentions of "reconciliation" or "fellow countrymen" scrubbed from record.</p>

<p>Since then, the North has ramped up weapons testing, bombarded the South with trash-carrying balloons, threatened war over drone incursions, and blown up roads and railways connecting the countries.</p>

<p>"North Korea is simply following through on what they said they would do," Lim Eul-chul, a professor at Kyungnam University, told AFP.</p>

<p>"It seems to reflect the North's determination to completely eliminate any premise of 'unification by absorption' into the South."</p>

<p>Kim even said recently that his country was no longer interested in "liberating the South".</p>

<p><strong>Why now?</strong></p>

<p>It might be the weather.</p>

<p>Swathes of North Korea were hit by devastating floods this summer that destroyed thousands of homes and farms, killing and displacing people.</p>

<p>Pyongyang could have orchestrated this latest round of conflict with the South to deflect from growing domestic discontent, Seoul officials have said.</p>

<p>The North's claims that Seoul flew drones over Pyongyang -- a major security breach -- have appeared on the front pages of the country's tightly controlled state media.</p>

<p>This is a bid to rally "North Korean citizens, who have grown weary of the fake dictatorship of the Kim family", South Korea's military has said.</p>

<p>Seoul's national security adviser Shin Won-sik said "North Korea is escalating tensions in order to tighten its grip over its unstable internal affairs".</p>

<p>"North Korea is a regime that, paradoxically, maintains its stability by the existence of external threats to its system," he added in a state broadcast interview.</p>

<p><strong>What about the drones?</strong></p>

<p>The North says South Korea's military has been flying drones over the capital Pyongyang to drop anti-regime propaganda -- a "remarkable" development which "showcases one of the pathways through which we could see a serious bout of escalation between the two countries," US-based analyst Ankit Panda told AFP.</p>

<p>North Korea, which lacks robust air defences, is insecure about the incursions.</p>

<p>"Drones over their national capital could provide the kind of reconnaissance in a time of war that would allow the South Koreans to strike directly at Kim Jong Un himself," he said.</p>

<p>Cheong Seong-chang, director of the Korean peninsula strategy at Sejong Institute, said the reports suggest "the breach was detected in the airspace above the headquarters of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea".</p>

<p>"The North Korean leadership would have been greatly shocked," he told AFP.</p>

<p>Even if these drones were just dropping propaganda rather than seeking to locate Kim's office, it is still a problem as the country regards all "foreign content as a subversive threat", said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul.</p>

<p>But Seoul's military has pointed out that the North has repeatedly sent drones into the South -- including to Seoul's district of Yongsan, where the presidential compound is located, in 2022.</p>

<p><strong>Is Russia involved?</strong></p>

<p>Historic allies Russia and North Korea have drawn ever closer since Moscow invaded Ukraine in February 2022.</p>

<p>Seoul claims Kim has been shipping arms to Moscow to use against Kyiv, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently accused the North of sending troops to Russia's army.</p>

<p>After the North blew up inter-Korean roads and railways, ally China urged all sides to avoid escalation. But Russia blames Seoul for the drones, saying it was a "gross encroachment on the sovereignty" of North Korea.</p>

<p>"Russia and North Korea are not only engaging in sanctions-violating military trade and reviving Cold War-era diplomatic commitments," said Easley.</p>

<p>"They are also reinforcing and amplifying each other's political propaganda in attempts to justify and normalise their pariah state behaviour."</p>

<p><strong>Have they done this before?</strong></p>

<p>North and South Korea have long been locked in cycles of escalation, and Pyongyang has repeatedly blown up key infrastructure in the past to make foreign policy points.</p>

<p>In 2008, it blew up a cooling tower at a nuclear complex after the United States agreed to remove Pyongyang from its list of states that sponsor terrorism.</p>

<p>In 2018, after it signed a tension-reducing military deal with the South, it simultaneously detonated 10 guard posts.</p>

<p>After diplomatic outreach broke down, it then blew up a liaison office in 2020, largely out of frustration that activists in the South were sending balloons carrying anti-regime propaganda leaflets across the border.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Globally, there is an increase in online and phone frauds. These frauds frequently include impersonation, emotional manipulation, and promises of quick gains. Deepfake technology has given these schemes a new dimension, resulting in incredibly convincing fake identities and movies.</p>

<p>According to a report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/15/asia/hong-kong-deepfake-romance-scam-intl-hnk/index.html"><em>CNN,</em></a> men had fallen prey to a romance scam that used deepfake artificial intelligence to lure its victims into parting with more than $46 million. In a news conference Monday, Hong Kong police in the Asian financial hub announced the arrests of more than two dozen members of the alleged scam ring, which they say targeted men from Taiwan to Singapore and as far away as India.</p>

<p>Police said the 21 men and six women were held on charges including conspiracy to defraud following a raid on the gang's alleged operating centre at a 4,000-square-foot industrial unit in the city's Hung Hom district.</p>

<p>As per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/15/asia/hong-kong-deepfake-romance-scam-intl-hnk/index.html"><em>the report</em></a>, aged 21 to 34, the suspects were mostly well-educated, with many of them digital media and technology graduates allegedly recruited by the gang after attending local universities, police said. The suspects allegedly worked with IT specialists overseas to build a fake cryptocurrency platform, where the victims were coerced to make investments, police added.</p>

<p>Deepfakes are comprised of realistic fake video, audio, and other content created with the help of AI. The technology is being increasingly adopted by a variety of bad actors, from people wishing to spread convincing disinformation to online scammers.</p>

<p>These scams can have major financial and emotional effects, so it's critical to be aware of the dangers and take precautions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Foreign Minister <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/cooperation-must-be-on-mutual-respect-says-s-jaishankar-in-pakistan-6800735">S Jaishankar</a> flagged concerns over terrorism and extremism at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)'s meeting of the Heads of Government in Islamabad. In a veiled message to Pakistan, he said that cooperation in areas like trade is unlikely to flourish if cross-border activities are characterised by terrorism.</p>

<p><strong>Here are the top 5 quotes from S Jaishankar's speech at the SCO summit:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>"It (SCO) should recognise territorial integrity and sovereignty. It must be built on genuine partnerships, not unilateral agendas. It cannot progress if we cherry-pick global practices, especially of trade and transit."</li>
	<li>"If activities across borders are characterised by terrorism, extremism, and separatism, they are hardly likely to encourage trade, energy flows, connectivity and people-to-people exchanges in parallel."</li>
	<li>"If trust is lacking or cooperation inadequate if friendship has fallen short and good neighbourliness is missing somewhere, there are surely reasons to introspect and causes to address."</li>
	<li>"We meet at a difficult time in world affairs. Two major conflicts are underway, each with its own global repercussions. Covid pandemic has left many in the developing world deeply devastated," he said."</li>
	<li>"Disruptions of various kinds - ranging from extreme climate events to supply chain uncertainties and financial volatility - are impacting growth and development."</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nepali rescuers dangling from a rope beneath a helicopter swooped in to retrieve the frozen corpses of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/5-russian-mountaineers-killed-while-climbing-dhaulagiri-in-nepal-6742934">five Russian high-altitude climbers killed earlier this month</a>, mountain officials said Wednesday.</p>

<p>The five Russians went missing on October 6 during an attempt to summit the world's seventh-highest mountain Dhaulagiri, an 8,167-metre (26,795-foot) Himalayan peak.</p>

<p>Bad weather delayed efforts to collect the bodies, which lay on an icy slope about 7,000 metres high.</p>

<p>"The five bodies have been retrieved through a long line rescue, and were brought to the base camp," Nima Nuru Sherpa, president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association, told AFP. "They are now being brought to Kathmandu."</p>

<p>Long line rescue is a dangerous operation used only when the terrain is too challenging for a helicopter to land, with a specialised rescuer attached to a rope.</p>

<p>As well as the helicopter pilot, the rescue team included two mountain guides and the long line rescue specialist.</p>

<p>Hundreds of people from around the world travel to the Himalayas each year for the autumn climbing season in Nepal.</p>

<p>The country is home to eight of the world's 14 highest peaks, and foreign climbers that flock to its mountains are a major source of revenue for the country.</p>

<p>Dhaulagiri's peak was first scaled in 1960 by a Swiss-Austrian team and has since been climbed by hundreds of people.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While most of us think of flights as long-haul journeys, there's a tiny Scottish flight that takes just one and a half minutes to complete its journey. Operated by Loganair, the flight connects the Orkney islands of Westray and Papa Westray.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This quick hop is so short that the actual flying time is often less than a minute! It's faster than many flights take to reach cruising altitude. In fact, the record for the fastest flight is 53 seconds, set by pilot Stuart Linklater, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/travel/uk-ireland/uk-home-worlds-fastest-flight-33863996" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>the Mirror</em></a> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The flight covers a distance of about 1.7 miles across the water, which is roughly the same length as the runway at Edinburgh Airport, the capital of Scotland. The flights are combined with routes to Kirkwall, forming a small triangle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The airline uses Britten-Norman BN2B-26 Islander aircraft, which have 10 passenger seats. Passengers in the front row can even watch the pilot in action.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Papa Westray, with its 70 inhabitants, relies on this flight for essential connections to the mainland. In recent years, it has become a popular destination for tourists seeking a unique and brief travel experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Beyond its brevity, this flight offers a glimpse into a slower pace of life. The Orkney Islands, with their rugged landscapes and rich history, provide a stark contrast to the bustling metropolises of the world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The flight's passengers, whether locals or tourists are likely to be struck by the beauty of the islands and the simplicity of their lives. The journey may be short, but the memories it creates can last a lifetime.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli military strikes on Gaza overnight killed at least 19 Palestinians, medics said on Saturday, while forces continued to push deeper into the Jabalia area, where international relief agencies say thousands of people are trapped.</p>

<p>Residents said Israeli forces continued to pound Jabalia, which is in the north of the enclave and is the largest of the enclave's historic refugee camps, from the air and ground.</p>

<p>There has been no fresh Israeli comment but the military said in past days that forces operating in Jabalia and nearby areas killed dozens of militants, located weapons and dismantled military infrastructure.</p>

<p>The operation in this area began a week ago and the military said then it aimed to fight against Hamas militants waging attacks and to prevent Hamas from regrouping.</p>

<p>Palestinian health officials put the number of people killed in Jabalia over the past week at around 150.</p>

<p>On Friday, Israeli strikes hit four houses in Jabalia, killing around 20 people and wounding dozens, medics said. The Israeli military has sent troops into the nearby towns of Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya as well as Jabalia and ordered residents to evacuate their homes and head to safe areas south of the enclave.</p>

<p>Palestinian and United Nations officials say there are no safe areas in Gaza. They have also voiced concerns over severe shortages of food, fuel, and medical supplies in northern Gaza, and said there is a risk of famine there.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Health said Israel's threats to evacuate three hospitals operating there by force put the safety of patients and medical staff at risk.</p>

<p>Israel's military campaign in Gaza, aimed at eliminating the operator group Hamas, has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians since it began a year ago, according to Gaza's health ministry, and has laid waste to the enclave.</p>

<p>The war began after a Hamas-led assault on October 7, 2023, on southern Israeli communities in which 1,200 people were killed and about 250 were taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>In a statement on Saturday, Hamas said Israel's "massacre against the civilians" aimed to punish the residents of Jabalia for refusing to leave their homes. It also said it was a sign of Israel's military failure to defeat the group.</p>

<p>Israel has denied it targets civilians.</p>

<p>The armed wings of Hamas, the Islamic Jihad, and smaller other factions said their fighters attacked Israeli forces in Jabalia and nearby areas with anti-tank rockets, and mortar fire.</p>

<p><strong>POLIO VACCINATIONS</strong></p>

<p>United Nations officials said on Friday an Israeli offensive and evacuation orders in northern Gaza might affect the second phase of its polio vaccination campaign set to start next week.</p>

<p>The territory's health ministry announced on Saturday that the campaign would begin on Monday in central Gaza Strip areas and would last three days before moving to other territories.</p>

<p>Aid groups carried out an initial round of vaccinations last month after a baby was partially paralysed by the type 2 poliovirus in August, the first such case in the territory in 25 years.</p>

<p>As in the first phase, humanitarian pauses in the fighting in Gaza are planned, in order to reach hundreds of thousands of children.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US forces have conducted air strikes against multiple Islamic State group sites in Syria, the military said Saturday.</p>

<p>US forces "conducted a series of airstrikes against multiple known ISIS camps in Syria in the early morning of Oct. 11," the US Central Command said in a statement on X, using an acronym for the Islamist militant group.</p>

<p>"The strikes will disrupt the ability of ISIS to plan, organize, and conduct attacks against the United States, its allies and partners, and civilians throughout the region and beyond."</p>

<p>The US military has around 900 troops in Syria as part of the international coalition against the Islamic State (IS) group.</p>

<p>The coalition was established in 2014 to help combat the armed group, which had taken over vast swaths of Iraq and Syria.</p>

<p>Anti-IS coalition forces have been targeted dozens of times with drones and rocket fire in both Iraq and Syria, as violence related to the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza since last year has drawn in militants across the Middle East, including Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon.</p>

<p>US forces have carried out multiple retaliatory strikes against militant factions in both Iraq and Syria.</p>

<p>In September, US forces conducted two separate strikes in Syria, killing 37 "terrorist operatives" including members of IS and Al-Qaeda affiliate Hurras al-Din.</p>

<p>US Central Command said Saturday that its damage assessments were underway and "do not indicate civilian casualties."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former Republican President Donald Trump has an edge over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris on who would better navigate the country through the Ukraine and Middle East wars, a Wall Street Journal opinion poll of seven battleground states showed.</p>

<p>In overall support, the poll published on Friday showed Harris and Trump tied across the seven states that could decide the November presidential election.</p>

<p>The poll showed Harris with marginal 2 percentage point leads in Arizona, Georgia and Michigan, Trump up 6 points in Nevada and 1 in Pennsylvania, and the two tied in North Carolina and Wisconsin. The poll of 600 registered voters in each state conducted on Sept. 28-Oct. 8 had a margin of error of 4 percentage points in each state.</p>

<p>The neck-and-neck results echo other polls reflecting a tight race before the Nov. 5 election as Americans grapple with concerns about the economy, immigration, women's rights and the nation's democratic values in picking between the two candidates.</p>

<p>A Reuters/Ipsos poll this week also found Trump and Harris locked in a close race nationally, with Harris marginally ahead 46% to 43%.</p>

<p>Surveys of swing state voters can be an important indicator given that state-by-state results of the Electoral College will determine the winner, with the seven battleground states likely being decisive.</p>

<p>Harris would win a narrow majority in the Electoral College if she captures the states where she holds an edge in the WSJ's poll.</p>

<p>According to the WSJ poll, Trump leads Harris in the seven swing states 50% to 39% on who is best able to handle Russia's war in Ukraine. Trump also has a 48% to 33% lead over Harris on who is better suited to handle the Israel-Hamas war.</p>

<p>More voters said they backed Trump on the economy and immigration while more said Harris would do a better job when it comes to housing, healthcare and caring about people like them, the WSJ poll found.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korea accused South Korea on Friday of sending drones to scatter a "huge number" of anti-North leaflets over its capital Pyongyang, in what it called a political and military provocation that could lead to armed conflict.</p>

<p>South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said it could not confirm the North's accusations but also referred in its statement to Pyongyang's practice of sending into South Korean airspace balloons with bags of trash attached.</p>

<p>North Korea's foreign ministry said the drones were flown over Pyongyang at night this week and last and that the intrusion demanded retaliatory action, the state news agency KCNA reported.</p>

<p>"The ROK (South Korea) should immediately stop such irresponsible and dangerous provocation that may cause an armed conflict and lead to a war between the two sides," the ministry was quoted as saying.</p>

<p>In its statement, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said it "cannot confirm the truth of North Korea's claims", adding: "All responsibility for the recent series of events" lies with Pyongyang.</p>

<p>It cited "despicable, low-grade and internationally embarrassing acts of filth and garbage balloons and other provocations." More balloons were being sent on Friday, it said.</p>

<p>North Korea has been floating thousands of balloons with trash attached into the South since May, exacerbating tensions between the two countries.</p>

<p>Pyongyang says they are a response to some activists and North Korean defectors in South Korea who fly balloons into the North carrying aid parcels and leaflets criticising leader Kim Jong Un.</p>

<p><strong>BLURRY IMAGES</strong></p>

<p>KCNA distributed photos, including ones showing a blurry, triangular object labelled as a "drone" dropping another object labelled as "bundle of leaflets". One image also showed a cloud of small objects that was labelled as "scattered leaflets."</p>

<p>Another photo showed black, yellow and white leaflets comparing the economic situation in the South to the impoverished North and criticizing North Korean leader Kim Jong Un by name.</p>

<p>South Korea's Yonhap news agency cited an official at the Joint Chiefs of Staff as saying it needs to look into whether a private group had sent leaflets into the North.</p>

<p>In December five North Korean drones crossed into South Korea, prompting Seoul to scramble fighter jets and attack helicopters, and try to shoot them down, in the first such intrusion since 2017.</p>

<p>The two Koreas are still technically at war after their 1950-53 war ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty, and the North has long denounced defectors as "human scum".</p>

<p>There will be no more warnings and the North will immediately take action in the event of another drone being sent by the South into its territory, North Korea's foreign ministry said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Israel warned residents of south Lebanon "not to return" to their homes on Saturday as Hezbollah said it launched missiles across the border on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel warned residents of south Lebanon "not to return" to their homes on Saturday as Hezbollah said it launched missiles across the border on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar.</p>

<p>In cities around Israel, markets were closed and public transport halted as observant Jews fasted and prayed.</p>

<p>But with the country at war, troops remained engaged in combat in Hamas-run Gaza and in southern Lebanon, a traditional Hezbollah stronghold, amid a firestorm of criticism over the wounding of four UN peacekeepers.</p>

<p>In a message addressed to south Lebanese, Israeli military spokesman Avichay Adraee wrote on X: "For your own protection, do not return to your homes until further notice... Do not go south; anyone who goes south may put his life at risk."</p>

<p>The war between Israel and Hezbollah has since September 23 killed more than 1,200 people in Lebanon, according to an AFP tally of Lebanese health ministry figures, and forced more than a million to flee their homes.</p>

<p>On Saturday, Hezbollah said it had launched missiles at an Israeli army base near the northern city of Haifa.</p>

<p>In a statement the group said its fighters were "targeting the explosives factory there with a salvo of... missiles".</p>

<p>Air raid sirens sounded in northern Israel, with the Israeli military saying it had intercepted a projectile launched from Lebanon.</p>

<p>Israel began pounding Gaza shortly after suffering its worst ever attacks from Iran-backed Hamas militants on October 7 last year, and it launched a ground offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon on September 30.</p>

<p>After the Yom Kippur holiday, attention is likely to turn again to Israel's expected retaliation against Iran, which launched around 200 missiles at Israel on October 1.</p>

<p><strong>'Deliberately targeted'</strong></p>

<p>on Friday, Israel faced severe diplomatic backlash over what it said was a "hit" on a United Nations peacekeeping position in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Two Sri Lankan peacekeepers were hurt in the second such incident in two days, the UNIFIL mission said Friday.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said its soldiers had responded with fire to "an immediate threat" around 50 metres (yards) from the UNIFIL base in Naqura.</p>

<p>But the Irish military's chief of staff, Sean Clancy, said it was "not an accidental act" while French President Emmanuel Macron said he believed the UN peacekeepers had been "deliberately targeted".</p>

<p>Both Ireland and France are major contributors to UNIFIL.</p>

<p>As Israel faced a chorus of condemnation by UN chief Antonio Guterres, Western allies and others, its military pledged to carry out a "thorough review".</p>

<p>UNIFIL peacekeepers in Lebanon are on the frontline of the Israel-Hezbollah war, which has killed more than 1,200 people in Lebanon since September 23, according to an AFP tally of Lebanese health ministry figures.</p>

<p>Four peacekeepers have been injured including two Indonesians who were hurt on Thursday when a tank shot at their watchtower, according to UNIFIL.</p>

<p>Diplomatic efforts to negotiate an end to the fighting have so far failed, but Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati said his government would ask the UN Security Council to issue a new resolution calling for a "full and immediate ceasefire".</p>

<p>Lebanon's military said on Friday that an Israeli strike on one of its positions in south Lebanon killed two soldiers.</p>

<p>In a show of support for Iran's ally Hezbollah, the speaker of the Iranian parliament Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf visited on Saturday the site of a deadly Israeli strike earlier this week that, according to a source close to Hezbollah, targeted Hezbollah's security chief Wafiq Safa.</p>

<p>Neither Hezbollah nor Israel has confirmed whether Safa was indeed the target of the strike, but according to the Lebanese health ministry, the raid killed 22 people.</p>

<p>The visit to Lebanon, a signal of defiance, comes after Israel vowed to respond to Iran's second-ever direct attack.</p>

<p>Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant vowed this week that his country's response would be "deadly, precise and surprising".</p>

<p>The United States is pushing for a "proportionate" response that would not tip the region into a wider war, with President Jore Biden urging Israel to avoid striking Iranian nuclear facilities or energy infrastructure.</p>

<p><strong>Gaza deaths</strong></p>

<p>Iran-backed Hezbollah began firing on Israel in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas following the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel which resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures, which includes hostages killed in captivity.</p>

<p>Israel's military campaign in Gaza has wrought devastation and, according to data from the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory, killed 42,175 people, a majority civilians.</p>

<p>Israeli operations in Gaza continue, with the army laying siege to an area around Jabalia in the north, causing more suffering for hundreds of thousands of people trapped there, according to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees.</p>

<p>"The bombardment has not stopped. Every minute there are shells, rockets and fire on the buildings and everything that moves", Areej Nasr, 35, told AFP after fleeing from Jabalia to Gaza City Thursday.</p>

<p>On Friday, Gaza's civil defence agency reported 30 people killed in Israeli strikes in the area, including on schools being used as shelter by displaced people.</p>

<p>An AFP journalist in Gaza reported heavy artillery shelling, explosions and gunfire Saturday further south in Gaza City's Zeitoun neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Adraee, the Israeli military spokesman, on Saturday posted another evacuation warning for an area near Jabalia.</p>

<p>"The specified area, including the shelters within it, is considered a dangerous combat zone," Adraee said on X, ordering residents to move to the humanitarian zone in the southern part of the strip.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China's government said on Friday that employees of Taiwan's Foxconn, the world's largest iPhone assembler, are being investigated for suspected taking of bribes and embezzlement, after Taiwan reported their detention.</p>

<p>Taiwan's government said this week that four Foxconn employees had been detained in China under "quite strange" circumstances in Zhengzhou, home to a major Foxconn plant assembling Apple's iPhones, on suspicion of the equivalent of "breach of trust".</p>

<p>China's Taiwan Affairs Office, in a statement to Reuters, said the Foxconn employees are suspected of crimes including taking bribes and embezzlement and the investigation is ongoing. It did not state how many employees were being investigated.</p>

<p>"The relevant departments are handling the case strictly in accordance with the law and are protecting their legal rights in accordance with the law," it added, without elaborating.</p>

<p>Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, declined to comment.</p>

<p>Taiwan's China policymaking Mainland Affairs Council said this week that Foxconn had stated the company had "suffered no losses and that the four employees had done nothing to harm the company's interests".</p>

<p>The case may be connected to corruption and abuse of power by a small number of Chinese security officials, the council added, without giving details.</p>

<p>Democratically governed Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, has repeatedly warned its citizens to be aware of the potential dangers of visiting the country.</p>

<p>In June, Taiwan's government raised its travel warning for China, telling its citizens not to go unless absolutely necessary, following a threat from Beijing to execute those deemed "diehard" Taiwan independence supporters.</p>

<p>Taiwanese businesses have invested billions of dollars in China since the country began landmark economic reforms four decades ago, drawn by a common culture and language and much lower costs.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said on Friday it had approved the return to flight of the SpaceX Falcon 9 vehicle after it reviewed and accepted the SpaceX-led investigation findings and corrective actions for the mishap that occurred September 28.</p>

<p>The FAA on Sept. 30 said SpaceX had to investigate why the second stage of its Falcon 9 malfunctioned after a NASA astronaut mission, grounding the launch vehicle for the third time in three months.</p>

<p>The malfunction caused the booster to fall into a region of the Pacific Ocean outside of the designated safety zone the FAA approved.</p>

<p>The FAA also said Friday it closed the SpaceX-led investigations for the Falcon 9 mishaps that occurred with Starlink missions in July and August.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the FAA said SpaceX's workhorse Falcon 9 rocket could return to flight solely for a mission on Monday for the European Space Agency's Hera spacecraft from Florida.</p>

<p>Separately, Reuters reported this week the FAA could approve a license for the launch of SpaceX's Starship 5 as soon as this month. Starship 5 is the fifth test launch of the company's rocket which it calls Starship.</p>

<p>The Starship spacecraft and Super Heavy rocket are a fully reusable system designed to carry crew and cargo to Earth orbit, the Moon and beyond.</p>

<p>Last month, the FAA said it did not expect a determination on a license before late November. SpaceX said Monday Starship's fifth flight test could launch as soon as Sunday, pending regulatory approval.</p>

<p>The FAA has repeatedly said it did not expect to decide on a license until late November. On Tuesday it said only that it was still reviewing the proposed mission and would make a decision "once SpaceX has met all licensing requirements."</p>

<p>SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has harshly criticized the FAA, including for proposing a $633,000 fine against SpaceX over launch issues and for the delay in approving the license for Starship 5, which the company says has been ready to launch since August. Musk has called for the resignation of FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker and threatened to sue the agency.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia's Vladimir Putin held talks with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Friday in Turkmenistan, where the two leaders hailed their countries growing economic ties and similar views on world affairs, an entente viewed with concern by the United States.</p>

<p>At odds with Washington and the European Union over Russia's war in Ukraine, something he casts as part of a wider existential struggle against an arrogant and self-interested West - Putin is keen to deepen ties with what he calls the Global East and Global South.</p>

<p>Putin, whose country is hosting a summit of the BRICS nations in Kazan on October 22-24, invited Pezeshkian to come to Russia on an official visit, a proposal the Iranian leader accepted according to Russia's state RIA news agency.</p>

<p>"Economically and culturally, our communications are being strengthened day by day and becoming more robust," Pezeshkian was cited as telling Putin by Iran's official IRNA news agency.</p>

<p>"The growing trend of cooperation between Iran and Russia, considering the will of the top leaders of both countries, must be accelerated to strengthen these ties," he said.</p>

<p>In a later report from Dubai, Russia's TASS news agency quoted the Iranian president, in a video issued by his office, as saying the two sides had agreed to boost cooperation in a number of areas.</p>

<p>"Our talks with the Russian president lasted about an hour. And we talked again about agreements that we have concluded," the report quoted him as saying.</p>

<p>"We have constructive interaction. We agreed to speed up the completion of projects in the gas sectors, in road and rail construction, desalination and other projects linked to energy, petrochemicals and electricity."</p>

<p>Pezeshkian last month committed his country to deeper ties with Russia to counter Western sanctions. The two countries say they are close to signing a strategic partnership agreement, something Pezeshkian said on Friday he hoped could be finalised at the BRICS summit in Russia later this month.</p>

<p>The United States regards Moscow's growing relationship with Tehran with concern. It has accused Iran of supplying Russia with ballistic missiles for use in the conflict in Ukraine, something Tehran has denied.</p>

<p><strong>NEW WORLD ORDER EMERGING, SAYS PUTIN</strong></p>

<p>Russia says cooperation with Iran is expanding in all areas.</p>

<p>"We actively work together in the international arena, and our assessments of current events in the world are often very close," TASS cited Putin as telling Pezeshkian on the sidelines of the conference in the Turkmen capital of Ashgabat.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian, according to IRNA, noted that Iran and Russia had significant complementary capacities and could assist each other. "Our positions in the world are much closer to each other than to others," he was quoted as telling the Russian leader.</p>

<p>Pezeshkian said earlier that Israel should "stop killing innocent people", and its actions in the Middle East were backed by the U.S. and EU. Russia has also criticised Israel, which says it is protecting its own security, for bombing civilian areas.</p>

<p>Putin was cited by TASS as telling Pezeshkian that economic ties between Moscow and Tehran were on the up.</p>

<p>In comments released by the Kremlin earlier on Friday, Putin told the conference in the Central Asian country that a new world order was being formed and that new centres of economic growth and financial and political influence were emerging.</p>

<p>Russia supported "the broadest possible international discussion" on the emerging multipolar world and was open to discussing it within various fora, including the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Eurasian Economic Union, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, and BRICS, said Putin.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tesla's reveal of a robotaxi designed as a low-slung, two-seater, sporty coupe - quite the opposite of a typical taxi with room for several passengers and luggage - flummoxed investors and analysts.</p>

<p>CEO Elon Musk served up the cool design for the prototype of the Tesla robotaxi, dubbed Cybercab, at a much-hyped event near Los Angeles late on Thursday. These will go into production some time in 2026 and cost less than $30,000 a pop, he said.</p>

<p>But in true Musk style, he skipped over expectations of how a two-seater robotaxi would serve the needs of families headed to a restaurant or to the airport, or if he expected these to appeal only to a niche clientele.</p>

<p>Investors jeered the design and the lack of financial detail, with Tesla stocks tumbling 9% on Wall Street on Friday.</p>

</div>

<p>"When you think of a cab, you think of something that's going to carry more than two people," said Jonathan Elfalan, vehicle testing director for the automotive website Edmunds.com. "Making this a two-seat-only car is very perplexing."</p>

<p>Tesla did not respond to an email seeking comment.</p>

<p>Experts said robotaxis would best emulate regular taxis with plenty of room, a tall design and sliding doors. Musk did showcase a futuristic robovan that could seat up to 20 people but did not say when that would be available.</p>

<p>The market for two-door robotaxis would be very limited, said Sandeep Rao, a senior researcher at Leverage Shares, an investment management company with assets of about $1 billion, including in Tesla.</p>

<p>Two-door vehicles account for just 2% of car sales in the U.S., excluding SUVs and pickups, according to data from analytics firm J.D. Power.</p>

<p>Musk said he wanted to make robotaxis cheaper than mass transit to operate and predicted an operating cost of 20 cents per mile over time for the Cybercab.</p>

<p>But he did not say how quickly Tesla could mass-produce Cybercabs and secure regulatory approvals, or how it could beat Alphabet's Waymo, which already operates robotaxis in some U.S. cities.</p>

<p>Waymo has a fleet of about 700 Jaguar Land Rover cars that fit four passengers, same as the seating capacity in Amazon's Zoox robotaxis.</p>

<p>Waymo's former CEO John Krafcik said Tesla's design looked "more playful than serious," and that the two-door configuration posed challenges for older passengers and those with disabilities.</p>

<h2><strong>'MORE PLAYFUL THAN SERIOUS'</strong></h2>

<p>Delivering the robotaxi and capturing a still nascent and tightly regulated market will be critical for Tesla.</p>

<p>Musk this year scrapped plans to build a smaller, cheaper vehicle amid slowing EV demand and shifted focus to the advancing Tesla's autonomy ambitions. The robotaxi business could catapult Tesla's valuation to $5 trillion, he has said, from about $700 billion now.</p>

<p>"Two-seaters have been proposed for decades as commuter vehicles. They just haven't taken off," said Sam Fiorani, vice president at research firm AutoForecast Solutions. Tesla will eventually need to build larger robotaxis, he said.</p>

<p>Blake Anderson, senior investment analyst at Carson Group, a Tesla investor, said that if the Cybercab is supposed to be a lower-cost, mass-market model to widen Tesla's appeal, the two-seat design doesn't make sense.</p>

<p>"It's probably a way that they can introduce something quick to market," he said.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During a recent interview on <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pW6yJOqFiVQ&amp;t=305s" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>"The David Rubenstein Show: Peer to Peer Conversations," </em></a>Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google's parent company Alphabet, revealed that Google is seeking "superstar software engineers." Mr Pichai emphasised that those aspiring to join the tech giant's engineering team must excel and be willing to learn, grow, and adapt to new challenges.</p>

<p>Mr Pichai also discussed how Google's workplace culture encourages creativity and innovation. He highlighted the company's tradition of offering free meals to employees, explaining that these perks help build a sense of community and ignite creative thinking. Mr Pichai recalled moments from his early years at Google when spontaneous interactions in the company cafe; led to the development of exciting new ideas. He stressed that the benefits of such initiatives far outweigh their costs, playing a key role in fostering Google's collaborative environment.</p>

<p>With over 179,000 employees as of June 2024, Google continues to excel at attracting top talent. Mr Pichai revealed that nearly 90% of candidates who receive job offers at Google accept them, reflecting the company's strong appeal, particularly in a competitive job market. He acknowledged that securing a position at Google remains a prestigious accomplishment, especially in light of hiring slowdowns in the tech industry.</p>

<p>As competition for entry-level tech roles intensifies, candidates must distinguish themselves. Former Google recruiter Nolan Church told Business Insider that interviewees need to come well-prepared. This means not only understanding Google's core values but also being able to articulate specific elements of the company's mission. Church advised candidates to share personal anecdotes about their professional successes, highlighting their passion and determination.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Leaders of the group of atomic bomb survivors awarded the Nobel Peace Prize warned on Saturday that the risk of nuclear war was rising, renewing their call to abolish nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>"The international situation is getting progressively worse, and now wars are being waged as countries threaten the use of nuclear weapons," said Shigemitsu Tanaka, a survivor of the 1945 U.S. bombing of Nagasaki and co-head of the Nihon Hidankyo group.</p>

<p>"I fear that we as humankind are on the path to self-destruction. The only way to stop that is to abolish nuclear," he said.</p>

<p>In awarding the survivors, the Norwegian Nobel Committee highlighted the devastation of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the Japanese group's decades-long work to rid the world of nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>The group's endeavours have critical importance in the world today, the committee said. It did not specify any countries.</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin signalled last month that Moscow would consider responding with nuclear weapons if the U.S. and its allies allow Ukraine to strike deep inside Russia with long-range Western missiles.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[After weeks of intensive diplomacy aimed at securing a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah militants, the United States has settled on an altogether different approach: let the unfolding conflict in Lebanon play out.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After weeks of intensive diplomacy aimed at securing a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah militants, the United States has settled on an altogether different approach: let the unfolding conflict in Lebanon play out.</p>

<p>Just two weeks ago, the United States and France were demanding an immediate 21-day ceasefire to ward off an Israeli invasion of Lebanon. That effort was derailed by Israel's assassination of Hezbollah leader Syed Hassan Nasrallah, the Oct. 1 launch of Israeli ground operations in southern Lebanon and Israeli airstrikes that have wiped out much of the group's leadership.</p>

<p>Now, U.S. officials have dropped their calls for a ceasefire, arguing that circumstances have changed.</p>

<p>"We do support Israel launching these incursions to degrade Hezbollah's infrastructure so ultimately we can get a diplomatic resolution," State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told a press briefing earlier this week.</p>

<p>The course change reflects conflicting U.S. goals - containing the ever-growing Middle East conflict while also severely weakening Iran-backed Hezbollah.</p>

<p>The new approach is both practical and risky.</p>

<p>The US and Israel would benefit from the defeat of a common enemy - Hezbollah, which Tehran uses to threaten Israel's northern border - but encouraging Israel's widening military campaign risks a conflict that spins out of control.</p>

<p>Jon Alterman, a former State Department official, said the U.S. wants to see Hezbollah weakened but must weigh that against the risk of “creating a vacuum” in Lebanon or provoking a regional war.</p>

<p>Washington's approach, he said, seems to be: "If you can't change the Israeli approach, you might as well try to channel it in a constructive way."</p>

<p><strong>A VIRTUE OF NECESSITY</strong></p>

<p>Israel's latest fight with Hezbollah started when the group fired missiles at Israeli positions immediately after the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas gunmen on Israel that triggered the Gaza war. Hezbollah and Israel have been exchanging fire ever since.</p>

<p>As months of indirect ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas went nowhere, Israel in September began ramping up its bombardment of Hezbollah and landed painful blows on the group, including remotely detonating Hezbollah pagers and radios, wounding thousands of the group's members.</p>

<p>After Nasrallah's death - which the U.S. called "a measure of justice" - U.S. President Joe Biden called again for a ceasefire along the Israel-Lebanon border.</p>

<p>The government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu launched its ground invasion anyway and within a few days the U.S. had dropped its calls for a ceasefire and expressed support for its ally's campaign.</p>

<p>Aaron David Miller, a former U.S. Middle East negotiator, said Washington had little hope of restraining Israel and saw potential benefits in the operation.</p>

<p>"It certainly created momentum in which the administration probably thought, 'Let's make a virtue out of necessity'," he said, adding that U.S. officials were also likely reserving leverage to try and curtail Israel's retaliation for a ballistic missile attack that Tehran carried out last week.</p>

<p>Today, no meaningful ceasefire talks are underway, said European sources familiar with the matter, adding that Israelis would press ahead with their operation in Lebanon "for weeks if not months." Two U.S. officials told Reuters that might well be the timeline.</p>

<p>For the U.S. the Israeli campaign could bring at least two benefits.</p>

<p>First, weakening Hezbollah - Iran's most powerful proxy militia - could curb Tehran's influence in the region and lower the threat to Israel and to U.S. forces.</p>

<p>Washington also believes that military pressure could force Hezbollah to put down arms and pave the way for the election of a new government in Lebanon that would oust the powerful militia movement, which has been a significant player in Lebanon for decades.</p>

<p>Jonathan Lord, a former Pentagon official now with the Center for a New American Security in Washington, said that would be hard to achieve.</p>

<p>"On the one hand, many Lebanese people bristle under the weight of Hezbollah's presence in Lebanon. But at the same time ... this change is being foisted upon Lebanon through a very violent campaign," Lord said.</p>

<p><strong>RISKY STRATEGY</strong></p>

<p>The ultimate goal, U.S. officials said this week, is to enforce United Nations Security Council resolution 1701, which mandated a U.N. peacekeeping mission - known as UNIFIL - to help the Lebanese army keep its southern border area with Israel free of weapons or armed personnel other than those of the Lebanese state.</p>

<p>U.S. officials say the conversations with parties to achieve these goals can take place as the fighting continues, even though analysts warn the conflict greatly increases the risk of a broader war, particularly as the region awaits Israel's response to Iran's missile strike.</p>

<p>Beyond the chance of a war that could draw in the United States, there is the fear that Lebanon becomes another Gaza.</p>

<p>A year of Israeli military operations have reduced the enclave to a wasteland and killed nearly 42,000 people, according to Gaza health officials. U.S. officials openly warn Israel's offensive in Lebanon should not at all resemble that of the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>Despite those dangers, Alterman, who now heads the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the diplomacy is unlikely to stop the fighting anytime soon.</p>

<p>"Netanyahu sees all of his gambles paying off and it strikes me as a hard moment for Israel to feel like it should stop pressing its advantage,” he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"The IDF takes every precaution to minimize harm to civilians and peacekeepers alike.

<p>Proving his claims, Musk brought along a bunch of Optimus robots to the party and requested people to be nice to them. “You will be able to walk right up to them and they will serve drinks at the bar. It's a wild experience just to have humanoid robots. They are there, just in front of you.”</p>

<p>Optimus will cost $20,000 to $30,000 in the long term, Musk said.</p>

<p>Internet is amazed by Optimus.</p>

<p>An X user shared a video of Optimus greeting people, chatting with them and taking orders. Take a look:</p>

<p>A user commented, “Didn't it feel like you were in some time travel trip to be there? This event made history for sure.”</p>

<p>Some users raised eyebrows at Optimus's interacting skill. An X user wrote, “Is it really optimus talking? Kinda feeling there's a human behind it.”</p>

<p>Another said, “The ones mingling and serving drinks were remotely operated but still really impressive.”</p>

<p>“When the hand dexterity of Optimus is equal to that of a human being, I would be interested in buying one. Particularly if it can access information on various subjects and learn. I could use the help working on our rental properties and around our place in Arizona,” said another, showing interest in the innovation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Northern lights were spotted over the Baltic Sea close to Kiel, northern Germany, on Thursday night.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As reported by AFP, the northern lights were triggered by a coronal mass ejection (CME) from the Sun earlier in the week. This event marked a significant geomagnetic storm.</p>

<p></p>

<p>A statement issued by the Institute of Astrophysics (IIA), said "For an extraordinary fourth time during the current solar cycle, intense red-coloured Auroral activity was seen from Ladakh, India, and was photographed by astronomers of the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) from Hanle, Leh, and Merak on the night of 10-11 October &nbsp;2024."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The CME that caused this spectacle was particularly potent, having erupted from a section of the Sun aimed directly at Earth. Juha-Pekka Luntama, head of the European Space Agency's Space Weather Office, described it as a "perfect hit."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Skies across Fish Creek, south of Melbourne,&nbsp; in Australia, were also lit up in this vibrant display of colours which is typically referred to as Aurora Australis, or the Southern Lights, in the southern hemisphere.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As solar activity approaches its peak in an 11-year cycle, these storms pose risks to satellites, GPS systems, and power grids.&nbsp;Looking ahead, there may be additional opportunities to witness auroras in the coming years as solar activity continues to rise.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A boot melting out of the ice – a sight that caught photographer and filmmaker Jimmy Chin's attention. Upon giving it a close look, Jimmy and team discovered a foot, remains that they believe belong to Andrew Comyn Irvine, fondly known as Sandy, who disappeared 100 years ago with the famed climber George Mallory.</p>

<p>“I lifted up the sock and there's a red label that has A.C. IRVINE stitched into it,” Chin said, describing the moment, reported <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/article/sandy-irvine-body-found-everest" rel="noindex,nofollow">National Geographic in an exclusive piece</a>.</p>

<p>In September, in the Central Rongbuk Glacier, below the north face of Mount Everest, a National Geographic documentary team including photographer and director Jimmy Chin and filmmakers and climbers Erich Roepke and Mark Fisher, examined the boot.</p>

<p>100 years ago, on the morning of June 8, 1924, Andrew Comyn Irvine, 22, and George Mallory set off for the summit. Mallory's remains were located in 1999, while the whereabouts of Irvine's were unknown.</p>

<p>However, the discovery of a boot now could solve the mystery behind what happened on the summit a century ago. Did the duo make it to the top? If yes, they would have preceded Edmund Hillary and Tibetan mountaineer Tenzing Norgay, who are currently recorded as the first people to reach the summit on May 29, 1953.</p>

<p>“It's the first real evidence of where Sandy ended up. A lot of theories have been put out there,” said Chin about their discovery.</p>

<p>Back in 1999, when George Mallory's body was found by the alpinist Conrad Anker, as part of the Mallory and Irvine Research Expedition, it gave certain clues, hinting that the duo completed the summit and were descending when they had a fall.</p>

<p>“His (Mallory's) dark snow goggles were in his pocket, which led to speculation that the fall could have occurred in the evening as the two had been descending. The photograph of his wife that Mallory had planned to leave on the summit wasn't with him,” Anker wrote in The Lost Explorer, which he co-authored with David Roberts, as quoted by National Geographic.</p>

<p>According to the exclusive report, Chin shared the news with Irvine's great-niece Julie Summers, 64, who wrote a 2001 biography of Irvine - Fearless on Everest: The Quest for Sandy Irvine. “I'm regarding it as something close to closure,” she said.</p>

<p>Members of the family have volunteered to share DNA samples to compare with the remains to confirm their identity, reports National Geographic in a piece.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Florida fishing boat captain faced a harrowing survival ordeal, spending over 18 hours clinging to a cooler in the Gulf of Mexico following Hurricane Milton's wrath in the region. The US Coast Guard successfully rescued the man on Thursday, October 10, around 1.30pm local time, approximately 30 miles off Longboat Key.</p>

<p>According to a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.news.uscg.mil/Press-Releases/Article/3933279/coast-guard-rescues-man-off-longboat-key-following-hurricane-milton/">Coast Guard release</a>, the captain was found wearing a life jacket, a vital piece of equipment that likely saved his life. "This man survived in a nightmare scenario for even the most experienced mariner," said Lt Cmdr Dana Grady, chief of the command centre at Sector St Petersburg. The captain's identity has not yet been disclosed.</p>

<p>The captain initially contacted the Coast Guard on Monday, October 7, after his fishing boat became disabled about 20 miles off John's Pass, prompting a rescue operation that brought him and a crew member safely back to Air Station Clearwater. Just two days later, as Hurricane Milton approached land, the captain returned to the boat around 3am to make repairs but failed to check in afterwards.</p>

<p>On October 9, during severe weather conditions caused by the hurricane, which included 6 to 8-foot seas and winds reaching approximately 30 mph, the Coast Guard managed to establish radio contact with the captain. He reported that the boat's rudder had fouled, leaving him stranded. Coast Guard officials advised him to don his life jacket and stay close to the vessel's emergency position-indicating radio beacon. Unfortunately, communications were lost shortly thereafter.</p>

<p>After more than 18 hours adrift, the Coast Guard launched a helicopter rescue mission. Dramatic footage captured a crew member being lowered into the turbulent waters to reach the captain, who was clinging to a small cooler. "To understand the severity of the hurricane conditions, we estimate he experienced approximately 75-90 mph winds and 20-25 foot seas for an extended period, including overnight," Grady noted. His survival was attributed to his life jacket, the emergency locator beacon, and the cooler he held onto.</p>

<p>After the rescue, the captain was shifted to Tampa General Hospital. Hurricane Milton made landfall near Siesta Key, Florida, around 8.30pm local time on October 9, bringing maximum sustained winds of 120 mph and resulting in at least 16 fatalities so far.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

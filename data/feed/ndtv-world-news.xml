       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nepali rescue teams resumed their search early Saturday for at least 63 people missing after monsoon rains triggered a landslide that swept two buses off a highway and into a river.</p>

<p>The force of Friday's landslide in central Chitwan district pushed the vehicles over concrete crash barriers and down a steep embankment, at least 30 metres (100 feet) from the road.</p>

<p>Dozens of rescuers spent hours struggling to comb the raging Trishuli river, an effort hampered by muddy waters and fierce currents, before sunset forced them to call off the search.</p>

<p>No sign of the vehicles or their occupants has yet been found.</p>

<p>"We will search all possible places," Chitwan district chief Indra Dev Yadav told AFP.</p>

<p>"We will employ all our abilities for search and rescue despite the water levels, current and the water's muddiness."</p>

<p>District official Khimananda Bhusal told AFP on Friday that the buses were carrying at least 66 people between them, but three passengers had been able to escape and were treated at a local hospital.</p>

<p>The accident happened before dawn along the Narayanghat-Mugling highway, around 100 kilometres (60 miles) west of Kathmandu.</p>

<p>One bus was heading from the capital to Gaur in Rautahat district in southern Nepal, and the other was en route to Kathmandu from southern Birgunj.</p>

<p>A driver was killed in a separate accident on the same road after a boulder hit his bus. He died as he was being treated at a hospital.</p>

<p>Deadly crashes are common in the Himalayan republic because of poorly constructed roads, badly maintained vehicles and reckless driving.</p>

<p>Nearly 2,400 people lost their lives on Nepal's roads in the 12 months to April, according to government figures.</p>

<p>Twelve people were killed and 24 injured in an accident in January when a bus heading to Kathmandu from Nepalgunj fell into a river.</p>

<p>Road travel becomes deadlier during the annual monsoon season as rains trigger landslides and floods across the mountainous country.</p>

<p>Monsoon rains across South Asia from June to September offer respite from the summer heat and are crucial to replenishing water supplies, but also bring widespread death and destruction.</p>

<p>The rainfall is hard to forecast and varies considerably, but scientists say climate change is making the monsoon stronger and more erratic.</p>

<p>Floods, landslides and lightning strikes have killed 88 people across the country since the monsoon began in June, according to police figures.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden has made numerous verbal stumbles and gaffes over the years. From verbal slip-ups to near-fall incidents, Mr Biden, whose age is often targeted by opposition leaders and remains a concern for voters, has had all. The 81-year-old has given hearty laughs to many and has shocked others with his blunder-prone personality. Now, with US elections just around the corner, questions about the US President's fitness to serve four more years - or win November's election - continue to swirl. However, despite growing concerns about his mental sharpness and candidacy, Mr Biden has repeatedly doubled down on staying in the race. He has asserted that he was the "most qualified" to both defeat the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump and govern the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But there is no question that Mr Biden's age is a cause of particular concern to voters. Republican underdog Nikki Haley has repeatedly tried to draw attention to the advanced ages of her competitors. In a recent interview she also jokingly said that President Biden's South Carolina primary vote count would also serve as a fine campaign slogan: "Very close to 100."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Donald Trump, on the other hand, has also worked hard to suggest that his rival is too old, warning at one stage that Mr Biden's propensity for gaffes could lead to nuclear war and referring to him as a "guy who can't put two sentences together". Mr Trump recently also posted a spoof commercial for "White House Senior Living" on social media.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, Joe Biden has fought back, producing his own gaffe reel of bizarre remarks Mr Trump has made at his campaign rallies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Still, there is no denying that Mr Biden has made more than his fair share of mistakes and blunders over the years. From mixing up European leaders to misidentifying his own Vice President Kamala Harris at a recent press conference, the 81-year-old has made many mistakes during statements, speeches or public comments. In some instances, White House staff have also had to make corrections to official transcripts in order to align the president's words with public policy stances or to change the meaning of his statements entirely, according to a report from AFP.</p>

<h3><strong>Here are some of the US President's gaffes over recent years:&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<h2><strong>Joe Biden's gaffe with Ukraine leader</strong></h2>

<p>While speaking to reporters about NATO's support for Ukraine earlier this week, the 81-year-old raised eyebrows by mistakenly referring to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as "President Putin" in front of the assembled world leaders.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"And now I want to hand it over to the President of Ukraine, who has shown as much courage as he has determination. Ladies and gentlemen, President Putin," Mr Biden said during the speech. However, he quickly realised his mistake and apologised. But the embarrassing moment was witnessed by everyone present, with the President explaining that it occurred because he was "so focused on beating" the Kremlin leader.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Referring to Kamala Harris as "Vice President Trump"</strong></h2>

<p>At the same conference, when he was asked about his Vice President Kamala Harris, he mistakenly called her "vice president Trump". "Look, I wouldn't have picked vice president Trump to be vice president if she was not qualified to be president. So start there," he said.</p>

<p>Moreover, the 81-year-old also struggled to find the words "chief of staff," mistakenly referring to the group of the country's top uniformed military leaders as "commander in chief" - the title he holds as president.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Mistaking Egypt for Mexico</strong></h2>

<p>In February this year, Mr Biden appeared to confuse Egypt with Mexico while referring to the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict in the Middle East. "The president of Mexico did not want to open up the gate to allow humanitarian material to get in," he said. "I talked to him. I convinced to open the gate," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Confusing world leaders&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>In the same month, the US President mistakenly claimed to have met Francois Mitterand, who died in 1996, at the G7 summit in 2021. "Mitterrand from Germany - I mean, from France - looked at me and said, 'You know, what... why... how long you back for?" President Biden told his puzzled listeners.</p>

<p>The same week, he also said that he said that he had spoken to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who died in 2017, about the January 6 riots, which happened in 2021. He was thinking of Angela Merkel.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Forgetting the name of Hamas</strong></h2>

<p>In February, Mr Biden appeared unable to recall Hamas' name while speaking at a press conference. He was asked a question about the hostage negotiations between Israel and Hamas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"There is some movement, and I don't wanna, I don't wanna ...," the 81-year-old said, and then paused. "Let me choose my words - there's some movement, there's been ... a response from the, uh...."</p>

<p>"There's been a response ... from ... the opposition, but, um -" Mr Biden said. He sounded confused about what he meant to say, eventually stating after some guidance, "Yes, I'm sorry, from Hamas."</p>

<h2><strong>Tripping on the steps to Air Force One</strong></h2>

<p>In July 2023, Joe Biden stumbled awkwardly on the stairs of Air Force One. He was walking up to board the presidential plane in Finland when he stumbled. "About half way up he appeared to stumble very slightly but kept walking on up. He turned to wave to the staff out on the tarmac and went in," the <em>Independent </em>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Muddling up the wars in Ukraine and Iraq&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>Last year, the US President muddled up the ongoing war in Ukraine with the Iraq war, which ended in 2011. He was speaking to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House before heading to Chicago when he was asked whether he believed Russian President Vladimir Putin had been weakened by the Wagner Group's mutiny that summer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Biden responded by saying that President Putin was "clearly losing the war in Iraq".&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>"God save the Queen"</strong></h2>

<p>In 2023, Mr Biden also made another verbal gaffe when he bizarrely closed out a speech on gun control with the proclamation: "God save the Queen, man". The slip-up raised eyebrows and provoked confusion over whether he had been referring to UK's Queen Elizabeth II, who died in September 2022, or King Charles III's wife Queen Camilla, who had just been crowned a month earlier at a grand coronation ceremony in London.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The White House, however, later sought to explain away the bizarre reference by saying that he was merely "commenting to someone in the crowd".</p>

<h2><strong>Biden's gaffe with former UK PM Rishi Sunak&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>When Mr Biden hosted Rishi Sunak as UK Prime Minister at White House in June 2023, he accidentally addressed him as "Mr President". As they smiled and posed for photos, the 81-year-old said, "Well, Mr President..."&nbsp;</p>

<p>He then quickly corrected himself and joked, "I just demoted you, Mr Prime Minister".&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Gaffe about Ireland</strong></h2>

<p>Last year, Mr Biden confused the name of the New Zealand All Blacks rugby team with the reviled British paramilitary force, the Black and Tans, during a visit to Ireland. " "See this tie I have, this shamrock tie? It was given to me by one of these guys right here, who's a hell of a rugby player who beat the hell out of the Black and Tans," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He then corrected himself during the speech and the White House later said it was "very clear" to Irish rugby fans the president was referring to the New Zealand rugby team.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Napping at COP26&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>In a viral video, the 81-year-old was caught sleeping on the job at the COP26 climate change conference in Scotland in 2021. In the video, Mr Biden was seen appearing to doze off during the opening remarks of the climate summit, with his eyes shit at one point for more than 20 seconds. An aide was seen popping over and nudging him awake.</p>

<h2><strong>Biden falling off a bicycle&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>In 2022, Mr Biden fell off a bicycle near his Delaware beach home, moments after greeting reporters with a wave and a cheery "Good morning!" Asked what caused the fall, he said that the "toe cages" on his bike got caught.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Shaking hands with thin air&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>In 2022, a video of US President Joe Biden appearing to turn to shake someone's hand after a speech left the internet puzzled. There was no one on the stage beside him at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University in Greensboro where he delivered a 40-minute speech.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 81-year-old finished his speech, then turned right with his hand stretched out in a handshake position. But there was no one on stage who could respond to the US President's gesture.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The XL bully, the largest breed of American bully dogs, is known for its muscular build and strength and is already regulated in the UK.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ireland is set to follow the UK's lead in banning this controversial breed by outlawing XL bully dogs, according to the <em>BBC. </em>The Irish Department of Rural and Community Development announced the ban, which will take effect in October of this year and prohibit the sale, donation, abandonment, and breeding of these canines.</p>

<p>Owning an XL bully will also be prohibited starting February 1, 2025, unless the current owners receive a "Certificate of Exemption."</p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgxqn2q2kzeo"><em>News Outlet,</em></a> Minister Heather Humphreys said the ban was in the "interest of public safety following a number of recent horrific attacks by XL bullies, which included the death of a young woman, Nicole Morey, in Limerick."</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/woman-mauled-to-death-by-her-own-xl-bully-dogs-at-home-in-london-5710634"><strong>Also Read | Woman Mauled To Death By Her Own XL Bully Dogs At Home In East London</strong></a></p>

<p>In March, Ms Humphreys established the group to examine dog control issues, chaired by a former senior garda (Irish police officer).</p>

<p>Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Simon Harris has also previously said he would like to see a ban and that there was a "clear need" for government action.</p>

<p><strong>What is an XL bully?</strong></p>

<p>The largest breed of bully dog in America is the XL bully. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ban-on-xl-bully-dogs#full-publication-update-history">The UK Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs </a>states that this breed is a variation of the larger American bully. They are characterised as big dogs with a blocky head and muscular physique that show considerable strength and power relative to their size. In England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, there are stringent laws governing the ownership of XL bullies.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>The International Monetary Fund said it reached a new $7 billion loan deal with Pakistan in a bid to bolster its faltering economy.</p>

<p>Islamabad agreed in exchange to conduct further unpopular reforms, including widening the South Asian nation's chronically low tax base.</p>

<p>Pakistan last year came to the brink of default as the economy shrivelled amid political chaos, catastrophic 2022 monsoon floods and decades of mismanagement -- as well as the global economic downturn.</p>

<p>The nation was saved by last-minute loans from friendly countries, as well as support from the IMF, but its finances remain in dire straits with high inflation and staggering public debts.</p>

<p>The new three-year deal, which still needs approval by the IMF Executive Board, should enable Pakistan to "cement macroeconomic stability and create conditions for stronger, more inclusive and resilient growth", it said in a statement Friday.</p>

<h2>Dealing with a downturn</h2>

<p>Islamabad wrangled for months with IMF officials to unlock the new loan -- its 24th payout from the lender in more than six decades.</p>

<p>It came on condition of far-reaching reforms, most notably increasing the chronically low tax base.</p>

<p>In a nation of over 240 million people and where most jobs are in the informal sector, only 5.2 million filed income tax returns in 2022.</p>

<p>During the 2024-25 fiscal year which started at the beginning of July, the government aims to raise nearly $46 billion in taxes, a 40 percent increase from the previous year.</p>

<p>More unusual methods have seen the tax authority block 210,000 SIM cards of mobile users who have not filed tax returns in a bid to widen the revenue bracket.</p>

<p>Islamabad also aims to reduce its fiscal deficit by 1.5 percent to 5.9 percent in the coming year, heeding another key IMF demand.</p>

<p>But Pakistan's public debt remains huge at $242 billion and servicing it will still swallow up half of the government's income in 2024, according to the IMF.</p>

<p>Analysts have criticised Islamabad's measures as surface-level reforms -- aimed at courting the IMF without addressing underlying problems.</p>

<p>"It is hard to not see old patterns in this new IMF deal," Ali Hasanain, associate professor of economics at the Lahore University of Management Sciences, told AFP.</p>

<p>"The IMF has issued a loan similar in size and conditions as the one agreed to five years ago, and five years before that."</p>

<p>"Will authorities seize the opportunity thus created to embark on fundamental reforms to how the country is run?" he asked. "You would be well-advised not to hold your breath."</p>

<h2>Public backlash</h2>

<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif came to power in February elections marred by allegations of rigging -- with ex-prime minister Imran Khan jailed and barred from running.</p>

<p>The diet of strict economic measures introduced by his shaky coalition government is likely to undermine their popularity.</p>

<p>There have already been scattered protests over tax and bill hikes introduced in last month's budget -- prepared with IMF oversight -- and more demonstrations are scheduled for the coming weeks.</p>

<p>While around 40 percent of the population already lives below the poverty line, the World Bank said in April it feared that 10 million additional Pakistanis would fall below this threshold.</p>

<p>Pakistan's last $3 billion loan from the IMF in 2023 proved a lifeline.</p>

<p>But it also came on the condition of unpopular austerity measures, including an end to subsidies cushioning consumer costs.</p>

<p>In recent months, the current account balance has recovered slightly and high inflation has started to subside.</p>

<p>The IMF anticipates two percent growth this year, with inflation still expected to reach nearly 25 percent year-on-year, before gradually coming down in 2025 and 2026.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian Defence Minister Andrei Belousov and his US counterpart Lloyd Austin held a telephone call where they discussed lowering the risk of "possible escalation", the Russian defence ministry said on Friday.</p>

<p>The call, which was initiated by Moscow, comes as tensions between the two sides flare over Washington's plan to deploy long-range missiles in Germany, a decision the Kremlin warned could spell a return to Cold War-style confrontation.</p>

<p>"The issue of preventing security threats and reducing the risk of possible escalation was discussed," Russia's defence ministry said in a statement on the talks.</p>

<p>According to Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh, Austin "emphasized the importance of maintaining lines of communication" during the conversation.</p>

<p>The two sides have managed to organise sporadic phone calls despite raging tensions over the conflict in Ukraine, including a recent call at the end of June where Moscow chided Washington's arms supplies to Kyiv.</p>

<p>The White House announced on Wednesday during a NATO summit that it would station long-range weapons including Tomahawk cruise missiles in Germany as a deterrent.</p>

<p>The Kremlin criticised the move, accusing Washington of taking a step towards a new "Cold War" and of directly participating in the conflict in Ukraine.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The three-bedroom condo spans 3,601 square feet and features stunning city views, a swimming pool, and a sauna.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>King Charles III has reportedly acquired a luxurious condo unit in Manhattan's prestigious Billionaires' Row. According to city finance records, the unit was sold for $6.63 million and is located in the landmarked Steinway Hall portion of the development.</p>

<p>The move is being seen as the monarch bridging the gap between him and estranged royal Prince Harry, his son, who now resides in US's California.&nbsp;However, King Charles' estate is located far from Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's residence in Montecito, California.</p>

<p>They settled in California after leaving their duties as working members of the Royal Family in 2020. The couple has two children, Archie and Lilibet, and live on the former estate of Riven Rock, Montecito, which they purchased in 2020.<br />
<br />
The deed lists the buyer as "His Majesty the King in Right of Canada," and the purchase was made through the Canadian consulate in New York, with Robert McCubbing, senior trade commissioner and director of trade and investment, signing the deed on the King's behalf.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Mr McCubbing said the purchase was “for use as the Official Residence for the Consulate General of Canada in New York,” as per the <a href="http://https://nypost.com/2024/07/11/real-estate/king-charles-buys-luxe-nyc-condo-on-billionaires-row/ ">NY Post</a>.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The luxury condo boasts three bedrooms, 4.5 bathrooms, and 3,601 square feet of living space, complete with stunning city views, a swimming pool and a sauna. The unit starts with an elegant foyer featuring stone floors and a powder room off to the side. It opens out to a spacious living room and a dining room adjacent to it.<br />
<br />
The custom kitchen is finished with high-end materials, including Cristallo Gold quartzite countertops, custom hand-crafted cabinetry and a full suite of Gaggenau appliances. A study opposite the foyer includes an ensuite bathroom. The primary bedroom has a walk-in closet, a windowed bathroom made of Italian white Venato marble, a free-standing copper soaking tub and custom bronze fixtures.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The building amenities are equally impressive, with an 82-foot two-lane swimming pool, private cabanas, a separate sauna and treatment rooms, a double-height fitness centre with a mezzanine terrace, a private dining room and chef's catering kitchen and a residents' lounge with a vast terrace. The property is one of 60 residences in the Billionaires' Row complex, with a stunning view of Central Park from the adjacent 91-story tower.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meta said Friday it was lifting restrictions on US presidential candidate Donald Trump's Facebook and Instagram accounts, ending measures put in place after his supporters violently stormed the US Capitol in 2021.</p>

<p>It said that "former President Trump, as the nominee of the Republican Party, will no longer be subject to the heightened suspension penalties."</p>

<p>Trump's Facebook and Instagram accounts were suspended indefinitely a day after his supporters attacked the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, and it was determined he had praised people engaged in violence on social media.</p>

<p>His accounts were reinstated in February 2023 but with a threat of penalties for future breaches -- an additional restriction that Meta lifted on Friday.</p>

<p>"In assessing our responsibility to allow political expression, we believe that the American people should be able to hear from the nominees for President on the same basis," Meta wrote in a blog post.</p>

<p>It added that US presidential candidates "remain subject to the same Community Standards as all Facebook and Instagram users, including those policies designed to prevent hate speech and incitement to violence."</p>

<p>Trump, the first former president to be convicted of a crime, was also banned from Twitter and YouTube.</p>

<p>While those restrictions were later lifted last year, Trump now mainly communicates on his own social media platform, Truth Social.</p>

<p>His Facebook profile, which has 34 million users, includes messages originally published on Truth Social as well as invitations to rallies and videos from his campaign.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID) is responsible for recurring waves of infection as it continues to evolve and mutate into new variants which keep it a step ahead of our immunity.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We're in the midst of a bad cold and flu season <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-06-21/flu-whooping-cough-rsv-cases-up-as-covid-cases-unkown/104002964">in Australia</a>. Along with the usual viral suspects, such as influenza, RSV, and rhinoviruses (which cause the common cold), bacterial pathogens are also causing significant rates of illness, particularly in children. These include <em>Bordatella pertussis</em> (<a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-07-01/whooping-cough-epidemic-cases-surging-australia-superbug-vaccine/104023220">whooping cough</a>) and <em><a href="https://www.health.vic.gov.au/health-advisories/increase-in-mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infections-in-victoria">Mycoplasma pneumoniae</a></em>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID) is responsible for recurring waves of infection as it continues to evolve and mutate into new variants which keep it a step ahead of our immunity.</p>

<p>The latest variant is nicknamed “FLuQE”, and is reportedly <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-07-03/covid-flirt-fluqe-new-variant-cases-rise-australia-us-uk/104035534">gaining traction</a> in Australia and other countries. So what is there to know about FLuQE?</p>

<h2>From FLiRT to FLuQE</h2>

<p>In recent months, you may have heard of the “<a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2024/what-to-know-about-covid-flirt-variants">FLiRT</a>” subvariants. These are decedents of the <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-emergence-of-jn-1-is-an-evolutionary-step-change-in-the-covid-pandemic-why-is-this-significant-220285">Omicron variant JN.1</a>, including KP.1.1, KP.2 and JN.1.7.</p>

<p>KP.2, in particular, significantly contributed to COVID infections <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-05-24/covid-cases-rising-australia-flirt-variant/103883574">in Australia</a> and <a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2024/what-to-know-about-covid-flirt-variants">elsewhere</a> around May.</p>

<p>The name FLiRT refers to the amino acid substitutions in the spike protein (<a href="https://theconversation.com/as-covid-cases-rise-again-what-do-i-need-to-know-about-the-new-flirt-variants-230423">F456L, V1104L and R346T</a>). Amino acids are the molecular building blocks of proteins, and the spike protein is the protein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 which allows it to attach to our cells. These changes in the spike protein arise from mutation – random changes in the genetic code of the virus.</p>

<p>SARS-CoV-2's goal is to select mutations that produce a spike protein that binds strongly to our cells' receptors to support efficient infection (sometimes called viral fitness) while avoiding neutralising antibodies in our immune system (immune pressure).</p>

<p>The FLiRT mutations seem to reduce the ability of neutralising antibodies to bind to the spike protein, potentially enabling the virus to better evade our immunity. But at the same time, it appears the immune pressure which has selected for these mutations may have affected the ability of the virus to bind to our cells.</p>

<p>These <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11142104/">findings</a> are yet to be peer-reviewed (independently verified by other researchers). However, they suggest the FLiRT variants may have traded in some ability to infect our cells for a spike protein that's more resistant to our immune system.</p>

</figure>

<p>According to experts <a href="https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/fluqe-coronavirus-mutation-contributing-to-sicker-than-normal-winter-experts-say/o1oiybsjz">in Australia</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamhaseltine/2024/05/31/analyzing-the-emergence-of-covid-variant-kp2-and-its-potential-impact/">internationally</a>, what appears to have occurred with FLuQE is an additional mutation has restored fitness that may have been lost with the FLiRT mutations.</p>

<p>FLuQE (KP.3) is a direct descendant of FLiRT, meaning it has inherited the same mutations as the FLiRT variants. But it has an additional amino acid change in the spike protein, Q493E (giving FLuQE its name).</p>

<p>This means the <a href="https://tactnowinfo.substack.com/p/covid-shifting-tides-the-emergence">amino acid glutamine</a> at position 493 has changed to glutamic acid (the spike protein is <a href="https://theconversation.com/as-covid-cases-rise-again-what-do-i-need-to-know-about-the-new-flirt-variants-230423">1,273 amino acids long</a>). Glutamine is a neutral amino acid, whereas glutamic acid has a negative charge, which changes the properties of the spike protein. This could improve the ability of the virus to infect our cells.</p>

<p>It's still early days for FLuQE and we don't have peer-reviewed research on this yet. But it appears we now have (another) immune evasive virus that is also well adapted to infecting our cells. It's no surprise, then, that FLuQE seems to be becoming dominant in <a href="https://x.com/Mike_Honey_/status/1810663232140697812">many countries</a>.</p>

<h2>What next?</h2>

<p>We would expect with widespread transmission of and infection with FLiRT and FLuQE variants, population immunity to these variants will mature, and in time, their dominance will be supplanted by the next immune-evasive variant.</p>

<p>The tug of war between our immune system and SARS-CoV-2 evolution continues. The issue we are dealing with now is vaccines don't sufficiently protect from infection or suppress virus transmission. While they're very good at protecting against severe disease, the virus still infects lots of people.</p>

<p>As well as the burden on people and health care, lots of infections means more opportunities for the virus to evolve. The more “rolls of the dice” the virus has to find a mutation that helps it evade our immune system and infect our cells, the more likely it is to do so.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next-generation vaccines and therapies really need to boost immunity in the upper respiratory tract (nose and throat) to reduce infection and transmission. This is where infection initiates. A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07575-x">human challenge study</a>, where volunteers are experimentally exposed to SARS-CoV-2, showed people who didn't become infected had a robust anti-viral immune response in their upper respiratory tract.</p>

<p>To this end, there are immune-stimulating nasal sprays and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-45348-2">nasal vaccines</a> in clinical development. The hope is this approach will slow down the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and the emergence of new subvariants that continue to drive waves of infection and disease.</p>

<p>Fortunately, so far these mutations have not generated a virus that is obviously more pathogenic (causes worse disease), but there are no guarantees this won't happen in the future.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Delta Air Lines has found itself embroiled in a huge controversy over its social media post on the Palestinian flag. A now-deleted tweet by Delta, which is one of the major airlines of the United States, sympathized with a post that incorrectly said its two flight attendants, with Palestinian flag pins, were wearing "Hamas badges."</p>

<p>An X user tweeted on Tuesday, "Since 2001 we take our shoes off in every airport because a terrorist attack in US soil. Now imagine getting into a Delta flight and seeing workers with Hamas badges in the air. What do you do?"</p>

<p>A day later, the Delta Air Lines' X account responded to the post and said, "I hear you as I'd be terrified as well, personally. Our employees reflect our culture and we do not take it lightly when our policy is not being followed."</p>

<p>The response, however, was deleted later.</p>

<p>The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the US' largest Muslim advocacy organization, slammed the airline for the "racist anti-Palestinian" tweet and demanded an apology.</p>

<h3><strong>Delta Air Lines' Apology</strong></h3>

<p>After backlash, Delta Air Lines issued an apology on X and said it "strives for an environment of inclusivity and respect for all". It also said the employee responsible "no longer supports Delta's social channels".</p>

<p>"On Wednesday, we removed a reply that was not in line with our values. We strive for an environment of inclusivity and respect for all, in our communities and our planes.

<p>According to CBS News, the two Delta employees photographed wearing the pins will continue to work for the airline as "it was in compliance with its uniform policy".</p>

<p>Moving forward, though, employees will only be permitted to wear US flags on their uniforms, Delta said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republicans are set to gather in Milwaukee to select Donald Trump as their presidential nominee at the party's four-day convention starting on Monday.</p>

<p>The Republican National Convention (RNC) comes as Democrats are engulfed in turmoil, with President Joe Biden facing calls to drop out of the race after a disastrous debate performance against Trump raised questions about his mental acuity.</p>

<p>Here are some key facts about the gathering:</p>

<h2>Fired up</h2>

<p>Political conventions are a stage for party delegates to select their presidential nominees and to adopt a party platform.</p>

<p>Drawing large television and online audiences, next week's convention is likely to fire up core Republican supporters ahead of the November election.</p>

<p>Trump's campaign has outlined themes for each day of the convention that riff on his red-hat rallying cry: "Make America Great Again."</p>

<h2>Faces in the crowd</h2>

<p>Over 50,000 people are expected to attend.</p>

<p>That includes some 2,429 "delegates" -- a mix of politicians and grassroots activists -- who will vote for the candidate who won their state's nominating contest earlier this year. In almost every part of America, that's Trump.</p>

<p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, Arizona Senate hopeful Kari Lake, TV personality Savannah Chrisley, as well as rapper and model Amber Rose are expected to attend or speak at the event, according to multiple reports.</p>

<p>Former first lady Melania Trump is expected to be in attendance, but it is not clear whether she will speak.</p>

<p>Scores of protesters are expected to demonstrate near the venue, although reports say they will not be permitted within the security zone established around the tightly guarded convention arena.</p>

<h2>Battleground</h2>

<p>The convention puts a spotlight on Wisconsin's importance to both parties as a key battleground that Trump has in his sights after losing the state by 20,000 votes in 2020.</p>

<p>The state -- which was also the venue for the 2020 Democratic convention -- has hosted several campaign stops from both the Biden and Trump campaigns in the first half of 2024.</p>

<h2>'New golden age'</h2>

<p>The convention -- a celebration of all things Trump -- opens on Monday with a focus on the economy called "Make America Wealthy Once Again" before shifting to crime on Tuesday to "Make America Safe Once Again."</p>

<p>Wednesday, labeled "Make America Strong Once Again," will zero in on Biden's foreign policy and how "America has become a global laughing stock."</p>

<p>Trump formally accepts the nomination on Thursday in a speech that will be followed by millions, closing the convention by ushering in "a new golden age for America," according to the campaign.</p>

<h2>Running mate</h2>

<p>An announcement of Trump's running mate is anticipated as early as the opening day on Monday.</p>

<p>The billionaire appears to have zeroed in on two US senators, J.D. Vance of Ohio and Marco Rubio of Florida, as well as North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, who initially ran against Trump for the nomination before falling in line.</p>

<h2>Media coverage</h2>

<p>Comprehensive media coverage is expected, with major American TV networks offering live updates from the event. It will also be live streamed on platforms such as YouTube, X, Facebook and Rumble.</p>

<p>The RNC is set to live stream events on its website, gopconvention2024.com</p>

<p>Political conventions were once a TV ratings hit. But ratings for both Republican and Democratic conventions were down in 2020 compared to 2016 due to what analysts describe as increasing partisanship and competing streaming options.</p>

<p>Viewership for the RNC was down about 21 percent on average in 2020 across all four nights compared with 2016, news site Axios reported, citing figures from ratings agency Nielsen.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 44-year-old woman in the United States has been left with horrific injuries after being attacked by a cluster of highly venomous spiders. According to the <em>New York Post</em>, Jessica Rogue was cleaning out a shed outside her home in Atlanta when she encountered several brown recluse spiders. Less than 24 hours later, she was rushed to the hospital as her face, arms and throat swelled up and she was covered in rashes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A bite of a brown recluse spider can cause necrotic (rotting) skin lesions and lead to serious reactions or even death in some. In Ms Rogue's case, the brown recluse spiders bit her in multiple places. As per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/12/us-news/atlanta-mom-attacked-by-cluster-of-deadly-spiders-suffers-horrific-injuries/"><em>Post</em></a>, She suffered horrific injuries, with her face swollen and her skin feeling "on fire".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I was just in there sweeping, I immediately felt something on my face next to my eye. I felt I got bit," Ms Rogue said. "There were spiders on me. Where I was, it was a really messy web, and I was trying to clean that up," she continued.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to her GoFundMe page, the 44-year-old suffered numbness and loss of mobility in her hand and foot too. And she said she is "really worried" about her eye. "My eye is, I'm having a lot of pain. I just don't know what's going to happen with my eye," she told the local news outlet while wearing an eyepatch.</p>

<p>A GoFundMe to help Ms Rogue with medical costs has collected $8,097. "She has numbness and loss of mobility in her hand and foot (still unsure if it's temporary or permanent yet) and her skin is on fire," fundraiser organiser Morgan Underwood wrote. "She's unable to work and has three beautiful daughters," the page read.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In an update, Ms Underwood added that Ms Rogue is out of hospital and recovering. "The swelling on her face has gone down a great deal," it is "now covered in an itchy, painful rash," the page read. "Her arms, neck and chest are also covered in an itchy, painful rash, and the areas where she was bitten are blistered up, so we're keeping an eye on that," the update said.</p>

<p>Notably, the brown recluse spider is the most common and widespread of the brown spiders, but it is usually found only in the South and Central United States. It is a small species that can grow up to 0.5 inches long. Its bite, however, can pack a powerful venomous punch.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Alec Baldwin's trial for involuntary manslaughter collapsed in spectacular fashion Friday as a judge found key evidence over a fatal shooting on the set of "Rust" had been withheld from the defense, and dismissed the case.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alec Baldwin's trial for involuntary manslaughter collapsed in spectacular fashion Friday as a judge found key evidence over a fatal shooting on the set of "Rust" had been withheld from the defense, and dismissed the case.</p>

<p>Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer, presiding over the trial in Santa Fe, New Mexico, said bullets potentially linked to the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins that could have been favorable to Baldwin's case had not been shared with his lawyers by police and prosecutors.</p>

<p>The Hollywood A-lister immediately burst into tears, as the case -- which could have seen him sentenced to 18 months in prison if found guilty -- was abruptly tossed out in sensational scenes.</p>

<p>"The state's willful withholding of this information was intentional and deliberate. If this conduct does not rise to the level of bad faith, it certainly comes so near to bad faith as to show signs of scorching prejudice," said Marlowe Sommer.</p>

<p>"The court concludes that this conduct is highly prejudicial to the defendant."</p>

<p>Baldwin was holding a gun in the direction of Hutchins during a rehearsal in October 2021 when the weapon fired, killing Hutchins and wounding the film's director.</p>

<p>The movie's armorer Hannah Gutierrez, who loaded the fatal weapon, is already serving 18 months in prison for involuntary manslaughter.</p>

<p>Baldwin was facing the same charge. Prosecutors claim he ignored basic gun safety laws and acted recklessly on set.</p>

<p>Baldwin's celebrity lawyer Alex Spiro argued the actor had no responsibility for checking the weapon's deadly contents and did not know it contained live rounds.</p>

<p>But the defense's case also rested heavily on discrediting the police investigation.</p>

<p>And Spiro on Thursday introduced evidence that live bullets potentially linked to the shooting had been handed to police, but not disclosed to Baldwin's lawyers.</p>

<h2>'Buried'</h2>

<p>The bullets were handed into police by a "Good Samaritan" earlier this year, more than two years after the "Rust" tragedy.</p>

<p>The "Good Samaritan" was a former police officer and a family friend of Gutierrez, the armorer. He told police the bullets matched the rounds that killed Hutchins.</p>

<p>Spiro accused police of having "buried" evidence by not filing it under the "Rust" case, depriving the defense of a chance to see it.</p>

<p>"Which was a perfect plan," he told the court.</p>

<p>Crime scene technician Marissa Poppell, under questioning from Spiro, said she had catalogued the bullets, but had been told not to file them under the "Rust" case.</p>

<p>Special prosecutor Kari Morrissey scrambled to respond, telling the court she had never seen or heard of the bullets before this week.</p>

<p>But when it emerged that Morrissey had been present for discussions in which it was decided not to submit the bullets into the "Rust" case file, Morrissey voluntarily called herself as a witness in a last-ditch attempt to salvage the state's case.</p>

<p>She claimed the allegedly "buried" bullets did not match the live rounds on the set of "Rust," and had been stored in a different state, Arizona, up to the day of the tragic shooting.</p>

<p>Marlowe Sommer was not convinced and dismissed the case, prompting the emotional scenes among Baldwin and his family.</p>

<h2>'Dumbfounded'</h2>

<p>Baldwin is highly unlikely to see the inside of a criminal court again over the shooting, legal experts said, though he could still face civil suits.</p>

<p>"As far as the criminal proceedings, it's over. They can't refile," said Los Angeles lawyer Tre Lovell.</p>

<p>"It's been dismissed with prejudice. To try to do it again would be double jeopardy. You can't do that."</p>

<p>University of Richmond law professor Carl Tobias agreed that "on the criminal side, I think it's done."</p>

<p>"The prosecutors could try to somehow mount an extraordinary appeal. But I don't think any appellate court is going to agree with the prosecutor," he said.</p>

<p>The withheld evidence could benefit Gutierrez, the film's armorer who has already launched an appeal, and David Halls, the movie's first assistant director who took a plea deal and admitted negligence.</p>

<p>Christopher Melcher, a Los Angeles-based attorney, told AFP he was "dumbfounded" by the case's sudden collapse.</p>

<p>"The case unfolded as quickly as I've ever seen a case... It was just absolutely amazing to watch."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Billionaire Elon Musk has donated to a super political action committee working to elect Donald Trump to the White House, a major gambit by the world's richest person to make his imprint on the US political landscape.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Billionaire Elon Musk has donated to a super political action committee working to elect Donald Trump to the White House, a major gambit by the world's richest person to make his imprint on the US political landscape.</p>

<p>Musk has contributed to a low-profile group called America PAC, according to people familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity to detail his plans. It's unclear how much Musk has given, but the people characterized the figure as a sizable amount. The PAC is next required to disclose its list of donors on July 15.</p>

<p>The move highlights the growing influence of a technology mogul who tops the Bloomberg Billionaires Index with a net worth of $263.6 billion and his shift from a self-described political independent - who said he preferred to stay out of politics - into a figure who regularly uses his X social-media platform to espouse right-leaning views and assail Democrats.</p>

<p>The money injection from Musk comes at a time when Trump has overtaken his rival, President Joe Biden, in fundraising with the help of deep-pocketed Wall Street and corporate donors. Biden's own money raising has dropped off following a calamitous debate that led prominent Democratic donors to put away their checkbooks.</p>

<p>Musk has yet to publicly endorse a candidate in the 2024 race and said earlier this year he did not anticipate financing either Trump or Biden's election efforts, but his decision to open his pocketbook presents an opportunity for him to become a financial juggernaut for Republicans.</p>

<p>Multiple requests for comment to Musk were not returned. The Trump campaign declined to comment.</p>

<p>Chris Gober, America PAC's treasurer, declined to comment.</p>

<h3>Ground-Game Boost</h3>

<p>America PAC is working mostly behind the scenes to bolster the Trump campaign's ground game.</p>

<p>Though Federal Election Commission disclosures don't detail where work is occurring, canvassing and get-out-the-vote efforts are conducted most intensively in key battleground states that will determine the outcome of the election.</p>

<p>Musk's efforts threaten to deal a devastating blow to Biden and Democrats, who are already mired in an intraparty battle over the president's political future.</p>

<p>Democrats invested heavily in field offices and staff in swing states, moves Biden regularly touts on the stump.</p>

<p>A super PAC matching those efforts on Trump's behalf gives Republicans a major cash advantage to spend official campaign money elsewhere, in what is shaping up to be the most expensive presidential election in US history.</p>

<p>Among outside organizations backing Trump, America PAC is the biggest spender on direct voter contacts. It has spent $15.8 million so far, with $13.1 million of that going for field operations, federal records show. It has also paid for digital media, texting and phone calls to reach voters.</p>

<p>The group focuses on door-to-door persuasion and get-out-the-vote efforts. A recent ruling by the FEC allows super PACs to coordinate with campaigns on voter outreach.</p>

<p>America PAC has hired In Field Strategies, a national grassroots firm that's also done work for the Republican National Committee.</p>

<p>Representatives for In Field didn't respond to a request for comment.</p>

<h3>Corporate Impact</h3>

<p>The political money makes Musk an even more formidable Washington player. He derives his wealth primarily from his holdings in electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc., SpaceX and X. His companies already boast sizable government contracts and regularly clash with federal agencies over regulations.</p>

<p>Some of Trump's proposed policies, such as dismantling Biden's measures to transition the US to electric vehicles and vows to impose tariffs on Chinese EV makers, would have a direct impact on Tesla.</p>

<p>Musk and Trump have clashed in the past but the two have grown closer with the tech entrepreneur advising the former president on electric vehicles and crypto policy.</p>

<p>During Tesla's annual meeting last month, Musk discussed his relationship with Trump.</p>

<p>"He does call me out of the blue for no reason," Musk said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korea "most strongly denounces" the declaration at the recent NATO summit, KCNA said on Saturday, citing the country's foreign ministry spokesperson.</p>

<p>Leaders of NATO countries stressed a membership pledge for Ukraine and took a stronger stance on China's support for Russia in a declaration this week at a summit in Washington.</p>

<p>"The "Washington Summit Declaration," cooked up and made public on July 10, goes to prove that the U.S. and NATO, reduced to a tool for its confrontation, pose the most serious threat to the global peace and security," North Korea's state media KCNA quoted a foreign ministry spokesperson as saying.</p>

<p>North Korea's statement added that the U.S. moves to expand military blocs with NATO countries and Asian partners, including South Korea and Japan are "the vicious root cause of seriously threatening the regional peace, extremely exacerbating the international security environment and sparking off worldwide arms race."</p>

<p>The summit declaration called on China to cease all material and political support for Russia's war effort. It also accused Iran and North Korea of fuelling Russia's war in Ukraine by providing direct military support to Moscow.</p>

<p>Separately, South Korea and the United States on the sidelines of a NATO summit signed a guideline on establishing an integrated system of extended deterrence for the Korean peninsula to counter nuclear and military threats from North Korea.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden returned to the campaign trail Friday seeking to reassure voters and Democrats alike about his fitness for office, after a major news conference failed to silence calls for him to quit.</p>

<p>"We've got to finish the job. And I promise you I am OK," the 81-year-old told supporters at a diner in Northville in the battleground state of Michigan, which he must win in November to beat Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Biden was to give a speech later in Detroit warning of the "nightmare" of a second Trump term under a hard-right manifesto that his campaign is pinning to the former president.</p>

<p>But the drumbeat of Democrats urging Biden to step aside kept getting louder, with 19 lawmakers having now openly called on him not to seek reelection following a disastrous debate performance against Trump on June 27.</p>

<p>The bloodletting continued despite a defiant Biden insisting in a high-stakes press conference at a NATO summit in Washington on Thursday that he would run again, and win.</p>

<p>A series of gaffes, including referring to Vice President Kamala Harris as "Vice President Trump" and mixing up Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky with Russian strongman Vladimir Putin, kept the focus on his mental acuity.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Gaffes for 40 years' -</strong></p>

<p>"The president understands that there's still some anxiety," Biden campaign communications director Michael Tyler told reporters traveling to Michigan with the president aboard Air Force One.</p>

<p>"That's why he's laser focused on demonstrating that he is the best person to take on Donald Trump and defeat him in November."</p>

<p>Tyler played down the verbal slip-ups, saying Biden has been known for making them throughout his long political career.</p>

<p>"Joe Biden has been making gaffes for 40 years, he made a couple of last night, he probably will continue to do so," he said.</p>

<p>As the row sparked by the debate enters a third week, Biden has been making efforts to reach out to lawmakers, speaking by telephone to Latino and Asian members of the House of Representatives on Friday.</p>

<p>The top Democrat in the House of Representatives, Hakeem Jeffries, meanwhile said he had met with Biden late Thursday after the press conference.</p>

<p>Jeffries said he "expressed the full breadth of insight, heartfelt perspectives and conclusions about the path forward" but did not give further details.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Complete losers' -</strong></p>

<p>The campaign event in Detroit is Biden's fourth trip this year to the state, part of the industrial "blue wall" along with Wisconsin and Pennsylvania that were key to his 2020 win against his rival.</p>

<p>Biden's speech is expected to focus on "Project 2025", a blueprint for power by hardline conservatives that Democrats have said the former president would implement, despite the 78-year-old's denials.</p>

<p>"Project 2025 is run and paid for by Trump people," Biden was to say according to excerpts released by the campaign.</p>

<p>"And here is the nightmare it would unleash."</p>

<p>The concerns over Biden are affecting Democratic donors, with Hollywood star and high-profile supporter George Clooney calling on Biden to step aside on Wednesday.</p>

<p>A number of other key donors have told the largest Biden campaign fund that around $90 million in pledged donations is on hold if he carries on running, the New York Times reported on Friday.</p>

<p>Trump, who mocked Biden on social media during the news conference, followed up on Friday by saying the Zelensky gaffe was "unpardonable."</p>

<p>But he added that Biden "shouldn't allow complete losers like George Clooney, under the total auspices and control of Barack Hussein Obama, to push him out of office. That must be his decision, and his decision alone."</p>

<p>Trump was referring to reports in US media that some in Biden's camp believe former president Obama, under whom Biden served as vice president, is involved behind the scenes with the rebels.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NASA released on Friday a pair of images taken by the James Webb Space Telescope showing two galaxies - one nicknamed the Penguin and the other the Egg - in the process of merging in sort of a cosmic ballet as the U.S. space agency marked two years since it unveiled the orbiting observatory's first scientific results.</p>

<p>Webb, which was launched in 2021 and began collecting data the following year, has reshaped the understanding of the early universe while taking stunning pictures of the cosmos. The two galaxies in the images are situated 326 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Hydra. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).</p>

<p>"We see two galaxies, each a collection of billions of stars. The galaxies are in the process of merging. That's a common way that galaxies like our own build up over time, to grow from small galaxies - like those that Webb has found shortly after the Big Bang - into mature galaxies like our own Milky Way," said Jane Rigby, NASA Webb senior project scientist.</p>

<p>Since becoming operational, Webb has observed galaxies teeming with stars that formed within a few hundred million years of the Big Bang event that marked the beginning of the universe about 13.8 billion years ago.</p>

<p>The mingling Penguin and Egg galaxies are collectively known as Arp 142. They are shown in the imagery joined by a haze that is a mix of stars and gas amid their slow-motion merger.</p>

<p>The Penguin galaxy, so dubbed because its shape from the perspective of the telescope resembles that flightless bird, including a beak-like region, is formally called NGC 2936. It is a spiral-shaped galaxy, now a bit distorted. The Egg galaxy, also named for its shape, is formally called NGC 2937. It is a compact elliptical-shaped galaxy. Together, their appearance is suggestive of a penguin guarding its egg.</p>

<p>Their interaction, according to NASA, was set in motion between 25 and 75 million years ago, and they are expected to become a single galaxy hundreds of millions of years from now.</p>

<p>Webb has detected the earliest-known galaxies and has provided insight into areas such as the composition of planets beyond our solar system, known as exoplanets, and the nature of star-forming regions in the cosmos.</p>

<p>"This mission has allowed us to look back to the most distant galaxies ever observed and understand the very early universe in a new way," said Mark Clampin, astrophysics division director at NASA headquarters. "For example, with Webb, we've found that these very early galaxies are more massive and brighter than we expected, posing the question: How did they get so big so quickly?"</p>

<p>Webb was designed to be more sensitive than its Hubble Space Telescope predecessor, which also is continuing its work. Webb looks at the universe mainly in the infrared, while Hubble has examined it primarily at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths.</p>

<p>"Webb is the largest, most powerful telescope ever put in space. It specializes in capturing infrared light - wavelengths of light longer than our eyes can see. With its incredible sensitivity to those wavelengths, we've been able to look back into the early universe in a way previous missions couldn't, see through dust and gas into the heart of star formation, and examine the composition of exoplanet atmospheres like never before," Clampin said.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, Clampin added, "Some of Webb's most exciting investigations will be the things we haven't even thought of yet."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Turkey's ruling party presented a bill to parliament on Friday that aims to round up millions of stray dogs, a plan that has alarmed animal lovers who say a mass neutering campaign would be a better solution than locking dogs up in shelters.</p>

<p>Under the draft law proposed by the AK party, municipalities would be charged with getting strays off the street and into shelters until they are adopted. Aggressive dogs or any with untreatable diseases would be put down.</p>

<p>"Streets are not a space for dogs to live. But they have the right to live in more qualified shelters," Abdullah Guler, chair of the AK party's parliamentary group, told reporters.</p>

<p>An earlier version of the bill, which was leaked to Turkish media months ago, said all street dogs could be put down within a month but the provision was removed after public outcry, including from opposition politicians.</p>

<p>The population of street dogs in Turkey is estimated to be 4 million, and 2.5 million dogs have been neutered in the past 20 years by municipalities, according to the draft bill.</p>

<p>Under current legislation, municipalities have to neuter and vaccinate all street dogs and leave them where they were found following treatment.</p>

<p>There are currently 322 animal shelters with a capacity to host a total of 105,000 dogs, according to the bill.</p>

<p>The draft bill also requires all municipalities to spend at least 0.3% of their annual budget on animal rehabilitation services and building shelters.</p>

<p>Municipalities will be given time until 2028 to build new shelters and improve current shelters, the bill says.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A New York federal judge has ordered Amazon.com to comply with a subpoena from a U.S. civil rights agency investigating claims that the online retailer discriminated against pregnant warehouse workers.</p>

<p>U.S. District Judge Lorna Schofield in Manhattan late Thursday rejected Amazon's claims that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) subpoena was too broad and sought irrelevant information.</p>

<p>The EEOC is seeking data on requests that pregnant workers at five U.S. warehouses made for accommodations such as limits on heavy lifting and additional breaks, and whether Amazon granted or denied them.</p>

<p>The commission's probe was prompted by complaints from five women who say they faced pregnancy discrimination while working at Amazon warehouses in New Jersey, Connecticut, North Carolina, and California.</p>

<p>Amazon provided the EEOC with more than 200,000 pages of data in response to the subpoena, but not the specific information requested by the agency, according to court filings.</p>

<p>Schofield in her ruling said the information sought in the subpoenas was necessary for the EEOC to determine whether Amazon engaged in illegal discrimination. The judge gave Amazon until Aug. 9 to comply with the subpoena.</p>

<p>Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday. An EEOC spokesman declined to comment.</p>

<p>In 2022, a New York state agency filed an administrative complaint accusing Amazon of requiring pregnant and disabled warehouse workers to take unpaid leaves of absence, even if they were capable of working, instead of providing accommodations. That case is pending.</p>

<p>Amazon has denied wrongdoing and said it strives to support its workers, but acknowledged in a statement responding to the New York complaint that "we don't always get it right."</p>

<p>The EEOC launched its probe last year and issued a subpoena seeking five categories of information, including data on accommodations Amazon provided to warehouse workers with disabilities. At the time, federal law only required companies to provide the same accommodations to pregnant workers that they gave to employees with disabilities.</p>

<p>A law passed later last year mandates that employers accommodate workers' pregnancies regardless of how they treat workers with disabilities.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earth's population will peak in the mid-2080s at around 10.3 billion people, then drop slightly to a level much lower than anticipated a decade ago, the United Nations said.</p>

<p>The current population of 8.2 billion people will rise to that maximum over the next 60 years, then dip to 10.2 billion by the end of the century, says a report released Thursday entitled "World Population Prospects 2024."</p>

<p>It said the size of the world's population in 2100 will be six percent lower, or 700 million people fewer, than what was anticipated in June 2013.</p>

<p>"The demographic landscape has evolved greatly in recent years," said Li Junhua, UN Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs.</p>

<p>He said the unexpected population peak stems from several factors that include lower levels of fertility in some of the world's largest countries, especially China.</p>

<p>He said this lower maximum will also come earlier than previously calculated and this is a hopeful sign as the world fights global warming: fewer humans accounting for less aggregate consumption would mean less pressure on the environment.</p>

<p>"However, slower population growth will not eliminate the need to reduce the average impact attributable to the activities of each individual person," this official said.</p>

<p>More than a quarter, or 28 percent, of the world's population, now lives in one of 63 countries or areas where the population has already peaked, including China, Russia, Japan, and Germany, the report said.</p>

<p>Nearly 50 other countries should join that group over the next 30 years, including Brazil, Iran, and Turkey.</p>

<p>However, population growth will continue in more than 120 countries beyond 2054. These include India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan, and the United States, according to the UN.</p>

<p>A rise in global life expectancy -- interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic -- has resumed, with an average of 73.3 years of longevity in 2024. It will average 77.4 years in 2054.</p>

<p>So the world's population will get more and more gray. By the late 2070s, the number of people 65 or older is projected to be 2.2 billion, surpassing those under 18, the study predicts.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

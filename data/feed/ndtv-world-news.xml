       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump is reportedly looking into a clause in the US Constitution that allows a president to make unilateral appointments if the Senate is not in session.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">US President-elect Donald Trump's latest cabinet picks are facing opposition from various quarters, with some of his key hires set to undergo further vetting, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/14/politics/trump-controversial-cabinet-picks/index.html" rel="nofollow,noindex">CNN</a> reported. While many of the Republican leader's personnel decisions are immediate, several will need Senate approval, which includes a hearing and the approval of a majority in the chamber.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Now, Trump is reportedly looking into a clause in the US Constitution that allows a president to make unilateral appointments if the Senate is not in session, as per <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg7r5e3gz7o" rel="nofollow,noindex">The BBC</a>.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>How does Senate vetting work?</strong></h2>

<p dir="ltr">More than 1,000 positions, including the Cabinet, ambassadors, and some lower-level roles, require Senate approval. However, many of Donald Trump's team members, such as those in the White House or as national security advisers, do not need Senate approval but still go through a vetting process, which may involve FBI background checks.</p>

<p dir="ltr">On Thursday, incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune said on Fox News, "None of this is gonna be easy." The FBI checks nominees for Senate-confirmed roles and other national security positions but does not provide an opinion on the results, leaving that to the president-elect or White House Counsel. Donald Trump's transition team has reportedly <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-team-bypasses-fbi-background-checks-for-some-cabinet-picks-7031432">bypassed FBI checks for some cabinet picks</a> and is considering private vetting companies.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">The Senate approval process involves submitting financial disclosure forms, completing role-specific questionnaires, and testifying before a Senate committee. The committee votes on the nomination, and the full Senate then votes. Cabinet appointments are usually approved quickly, but political conflicts can lead to intense battles and even rejections. With Republicans controlling both chambers of Congress, some disputes may be less intense, although concerns about nominees like Matt Gaetz for Attorney General have already surfaced.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>What are recess appointments?</strong></h2>

<p dir="ltr">A recess appointment allows the president to make temporary appointments when Congress is not in session. These appointments are usually temporary, expiring at the end of a congressional session. Donald Trump has expressed interest in using this power to bypass Senate approval, but it is not guaranteed, as Congress would need to agree to a recess.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The recess process was originally intended for emergencies when Congress did not meet as frequently as it does now. The goal was to ensure that presidents could fill important roles without delay.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Donald Trump's plan to use recess appointments and bypass Senate vetting has historical precedent. Former presidents, including George W. Bush (171 recess appointments), Bill Clinton (139), and Barack Obama (32), have employed this method, often to bypass political gridlock.</p>

<p dir="ltr">However, the use of recess appointments was curbed after the Supreme Court struck down several of Obama's appointments in 2014, calling them unconstitutional.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>When can Trump make recess appointments?</strong></h2>

<p dir="ltr">The President-elect can make recess appointments in two ways. First, if the Senate agrees to a recess of 10 days or more by majority vote. Second, if the House votes for a longer recess, Trump could use a rare constitutional power to adjourn both chambers of Congress.</p>

<p dir="ltr">However, Trump cannot make these appointments until after his inauguration on January 20. This power has never been used before, and it's unclear how it would play out. Trump would need unanimous consent from all 100 senators to force a recess longer than 10 days, which is challenging given that Democrats hold 47 seats. To override opposition, Republicans would need at least seven Democratic votes or a change to the filibuster, which Senate Majority Leader John Thune has opposed.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Entrepreneur-turned politician Vivek Ramaswamy, who along with Tesla owner Elon Musk has been nominated in-charge of the Department of Government Efficiency, has indicated a massive cut in federal government jobs in the United States.</p>

<p>"Elon Musk and I are in a position to start the mass deportations of millions of unelected federal bureaucrats out of the DC bureaucracy. That, too, is how we're going to save this country," Ramaswamy, an Indian American, said at an event in Mar-a-Lago in Florida on Thursday.</p>

<p>"I don't know if you've got to know Elon yet, but he doesn't bring a chisel. He brings a chainsaw. We are going to be taking it to that bureaucracy. It's going to be a lot of fun," he said.</p>

<p>"We've been taught to believe over the last four years that we have become a nation in decline, that we're at the end of the ancient Roman Empire. All we have is to fight over the scraps of some shrinking pie. I don't think we have to stay as that nation in decline. I think with what happened last week, we're back to being a nation in our ascent. A nation whose best days are actually still ahead of us," Ramaswamy said.</p>

<p>"It is going to be morning in America, the start of a new dawn, the start of a country where our kids are going to grow up and we're going to tell them and mean it, that you get ahead in the United States again with your own hard work and commitment and dedication, that you're free to speak your mind at every step of the way, that the best person gets the job regardless of their colour," he said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Musk and Ramaswamy announced that they will livestream every week to update the American public on the progress of the works by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).</p>

<p>"Our goal is to shave the size of government and to be as transparent as possible with the public. Weekly 'Dogecasts' will start soon," Ramaswamy said.</p>

<p>"DOGE's job is to create a government of a size and scope that our Founders would be proud of. Elon Musk and I look forward to fulfilling the mandate given to us by President Trump," he said.</p>

<p>Ramaswamy, however, argued that too much bureaucracy means less innovation and higher costs. "That's a real problem with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), and countless other 3-letter agencies," he said, adding, "They are utterly agnostic to how their daily decisions stifle new inventions and impose costs that deter growth." "We are assembling the brightest minds in the country. This is the equivalent of a modern Manhattan Project. I think the major problem holding our country back is a federal bureaucracy. Target that cost, save the money, restore self-governance," Ramaswamy said.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Mr Miller had requested hot tea during cabin service when the 'scalding' hot water, filled to the brim, was handed to him in a "negligent fashion".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US man has sued Frontier Airlines for $150,000 in damages after he was left with third-degree burns and 'disfiguring scars' on his penis, testicles and thighs after hot tea was splashed on him, according to a report in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/frontier-flight-passenger-sues-tea-damages-b2648081.html" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>The Independent</em></a>. The man, identified as Sean Miller was flying home from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina when the scalding drink left him injured. He was immediately rushed to the hospital upon landing and later transferred to an area burn centre for specialised treatment due to the severity of the wounds.</p>

<p>As per the lawsuit filed in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Mr Miller had requested hot tea during cabin service when the 'scalding' hot water, filled to the brim, was handed to him in a "negligent fashion". The liquid was at an "unsafely and unreasonably high temperature" and "without any form of a lid", the suit added.</p>

<p>As per Adam S. Barrist, Mr Miller's attorney, his client has suffered discolouration on his penis, scrotum along with "significantly decreased sensation in his penis," "post-traumatic stress disorder," and "lack of self-esteem," plus at least one herniated disc.</p>

<p>"Due to the tightly-situated plane seat configuration, Mr Miller was unable to get up from his seat after the spill and, instead, was trapped in agonizing pain while his body was being burnt," Mr Barrist told the publication.</p>

<p>Mr Miller was reportedly forced to take off time from work after the incident and incurred "substantial" medical expenses, which added to his mental trauma, added Mr Barrist.</p>

<p><strong>Woman sues EgyptAir</strong></p>

<p>This is not the first instance when a US citizen has sued an airline for spilling a hot beverage. Last week, 35-year-old Esraa Hezain sued EgyptAir for $5 million in damages as she suffered "second-degree burns" from a hot liquid splashed on her.</p>

<p>As per the Brooklyn federal court documents, the incident took place in February earlier this year as the beverage, kept in a "lidless cup" of tea flew off a "defective" seat tray and splashed over her. Hezain's attorney, Abram Bohrer said his client had suffered second-degree burns to her lower abdomen, her right inner thigh and buttocks. "For the price of a lid this didn't have to happen," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[With a similar colour scheme and logo, Bluesky is gaining traction as a decentralised alternative to X, attracting around one million new users daily]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">In the wake of Donald Trump's win in the US elections, users are abandoning Elon Musk's X for Bluesky, a rival social media platform. With a similar colour scheme and logo, Bluesky is gaining traction as a decentralised alternative, attracting around one million new users daily.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Currently, the social media platform has 16.7 million users, though this figure is rapidly climbing. But what exactly is Bluesky, and why is it becoming a refuge for those leaving X?</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>What is Bluesky?</strong></h3>

<p dir="ltr">Bluesky describes itself as "social media as it should be." The platform offers familiar features like search, notifications, and reposting but stands apart with its decentralised design.</p>

<p dir="ltr">This setup allows users to host their data on servers outside the company's control. While most users opt for the standard ".bsky.social" username, the platform also offers the option to create custom domains, adding a layer of personalization.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In functionality, Bluesky mirrors the original Twitter (now X) experience.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Why X users are switching?</strong></h3>

<p dir="ltr">Bluesky's sudden surge in popularity can be traced back to when Republican Donald Trump's election victory spurred political division. Elon Musk's support for the president-elect and his anticipated involvement in his administration have driven many users to seek alternatives.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">it's official — 1,000,000 people have joined Bluesky in just the last day!!!<br />
<br />
welcome ?<a href="https://t.co/x6v5YW0WFT">https://t.co/x6v5YW0WFT</a><a href="https://t.co/ifpjZFpYsf">pic.twitter.com/ifpjZFpYsf</a></p>
— bluesky (@bluesky) <a href="https://twitter.com/bluesky/status/1857225667206939034?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 15, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p dir="ltr">Organisations like&nbsp;The Guardian&nbsp;have also cited separate reasons for leaving X, calling it "a toxic media platform."</p>

<p dir="ltr">Celebrities have further fuelled Bluesky's momentum. Popular figures such as Lizzo, Ben Stiller, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Patton Oswalt have joined the platform, some reducing or ending their presence on X entirely.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Who owns Bluesky?</strong></h3>

<p dir="ltr">Jack Dorsey, the former head of Twitter, founded Bluesky with the vision of creating a decentralised Twitter-like platform. But Mr Dorsey stepped down from the Bluesky board in May 2024 and deleted his account in September.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Today, Bluesky is led by CEO Jay Graber and operates as a US public benefit corporation, as per The BBC.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Bluesky marketing</strong></h3>

<p dir="ltr">Unlike X, Bluesky has avoided traditional advertising. The platform initially raised funds through investors and venture capital and is now exploring paid services like custom domain names for usernames.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Bluesky is rapidly growing but still has a long way to go before challenging X, which Elon Musk claims has 250 million daily active users.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump and his allies feel that the FBI system is "slow," besides being plagued with issues which might prevent him from immediately starting the work of implementing his agenda, people close to the transition planning said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">US President-elect Donald Trump's transition team has reportedly taken help from private companies to conduct vetting of potential candidates for administrative roles. The team has bypassed the traditional background checks through the FBI for some of Mr Trump's Cabinet picks.</p>

<p dir="ltr">People close to the transition planning told <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/15/politics/security-clearances-fbi-gabbard-gaetz/index.html" rel="nofollow,noindex">CNN</a> that Donald Trump and his allies feel that the system of the law enforcement agency is "slow," besides being plagued with issues which might prevent him from immediately starting the work of implementing his agenda.</p>

<p dir="ltr">However, critics have said that the intrusive background checks at times bring to the fore embarrassing information that can be used to inflict political damage.</p>

<p dir="ltr">This comes after the President-elect has floated some controversial choices for the high-level positions in the new US government, including Tulsi Gabbard as the new Director of National Intelligence and Matt Gaetz for Attorney General.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In the US, the president, ultimately, has the final authority on whom he/she wants to nominate to share intelligence with, regardless of the established protocol that was set in the wake of the Second World War to ensure the ones selected do not have any unknown foreign ties as well as other issues which may raise national security concerns.</p>

<p dir="ltr">According to CNN, bypassing the background checks could be bucking a long-established norm in Washington as it reflects the deep mistrust Trump has of the national security establishment that he derides as the 'Deep State'.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Sources have said Mr Trump has privately questioned the requirement for law enforcement background checks.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The incoming Trump administration “doesn't want harmony,” said Dan Meyer, a national security attorney in Washington, DC, adding that they “don't want the FBI to coordinate a norm; they want to hammer the norm”.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Before the November 5 presidential election, some advisers of Donald Trump circulated a memo urging him to bypass the traditional background check process for a few appointees, a person briefed on the memo noted.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The memo proposed hiring private researchers rather than taking help of the law enforcement as they could move more quickly to perform the task. However, Trump can always decide to eventually submit these names to the FBI.</p>

<p dir="ltr">A few names announced by Mr Trump for various roles in his administration might get into trouble during the background check, which could pose a potential hurdle during the confirmation process.</p>

<p dir="ltr">For multiple years, Matt Gaetz has been mired in the US Justice Department as well as House ethics investigations in connection with sex trafficking. On his behalf, he has denied any wrongdoing.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, Tulsi Gabbard has often appeared to take position that favour foreign leaders like presidents of Syria and Russia, raising questions from critics.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In 2017, she met with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in Syria and even said that he was “not an enemy" of the US.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China is willing to be partners and friends with the United States, China's ambassador to Washington said, seeking to strengthen dialogue between the world's two largest economies.</p>

<p>China has no plan to surpass or replace the United States, Xie Feng said in a speech in Hong Kong on Friday, addressing Chinese officials and the U.S. ambassador to China.</p>

<p>The Sino-US partnership is never a zero-sum game, Xie said, adding that the two nations have great potential to work together on areas including trade, agriculture, energy, artificial intelligence, and public health.</p>

<p>"China and the United States have concerns for each side," Xie said. "It is entirely possible to bring issues to the table to communicate frankly, seek solutions on an equal footing."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden on Friday joked about going to space to "bring back" the stranded astronauts - referring to Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore, who have been at the International Space Station (ISS) since June due to a Starliner spacecraft malfunction.</p>

<p>Biden made the comments while discussing space exploration with Peru President Dina Boluarte Zegarra at a bilateral meeting.</p>

<p>Stating that the US and Peru are cooperating on space exploration, Biden laughingly said, "Now, that fellow right there...the former senator from Florida (pointing to NASA administrator Bill Nelson) - a very close friend of mine - every time my wife thinks I'm getting out of hand, she says that she is going to call him and have him send me to space."</p>

<p>"And I'm a little concerned he may want to send me to space because we got to get some folks back home," the 81-year-old President said as he laughed.</p>

<p>Indian-origin astronaut Sunita Williams and her <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/in-good-health-nasa-amid-reports-of-sunita-williams-declining-health-6966297">NASA</a> counterpart Barry Willmore have been at the ISS for nearly five months. They were launched aboard Boeing's Starliner spacecraft on June 5 for its first crewed flight and landed at the space station on June 6. It was supposed to be an eight-day mission but now has been stretched into months as they faced space debris threats, helium leaks, and technical glitches on the Starliner spacecraft.</p>

<p>According to NASA, it's too risky to bring the duo back to Earth currently on the malfunctioned capsule.</p>

<p>They will now return home in February next year.</p>

<p>Amid this, reports of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/my-body-has-changed-but-sunita-williams-on-her-health-aboard-space-station-7012028">Williams' health</a> deteriorating have been doing rounds after images of her "gaunt" appearance in space went viral. However, earlier this week, she put the rumors to rest in a video interview shared by NASA.</p>

<p>Williams asserted that her weight is the same as when she arrived at the ISS.</p>

<p>"I think my body has changed a little bit but I weigh the same. There are a lot of changes that go on here...It's funny, I think there are some rumours around that I am losing weight and stuff...No, I am actually right at the same amount. We go weigh ourselves, we have a spring mass...Butch and I weigh ourselves the same way that I was when I got up here," she said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Karoline Leavitt entered politics while attending Saint Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump has <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-president-donald-trump-names-karoline-leavitt-as-youngest-white-house-press-secretary-7030666">appointed Karoline Leavitt</a>, a 27-year-old campaign spokesperson, as the next White House press secretary, making her the youngest person to ever hold the role.</p>

<p>Ms Leavitt “is smart, tough, and has proven to be a highly effective communicator,” Mr Trump said. “I have the utmost confidence she will excel at the podium, and help deliver our message to the American People."</p>

<p><strong>Who is Karoline Leavitt?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Karoline Leavitt comes from a middle-class business family in New Hampshire.</li>
	<li>She studied communications and political science at Saint Anselm College, a Catholic institution in her home state of New Hampshire.</li>
	<li>She interned at Fox News and in the White House press office during Donald Trump's first term.</li>
	<li>She graduated in 2019 and worked as a presidential writer and later as assistant press secretary in Mr Trump's administration. She assisted press secretary Kayleigh McEnany during high-pressure briefings and worked against what she described as "biased mainstream media."</li>
	<li>Ms Leavitt ran for Congress in 2022 for New Hampshire's first congressional district. She won the Republican nomination but lost the general election to Democrat Chris Pappas. Her campaign positions included cutting taxes, supporting law enforcement, promoting strong borders, and completing the border wall, aligning closely with Donald Trump's priorities.</li>
	<li>Karoline Leavitt served as communications director for Republican Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, who has since been nominated by President-elect Trump as the US ambassador to the United Nations.</li>
	<li>She served as the national press secretary for Donald Trump's campaign during the 2024 US presidential election.</li>
	<li>She gave birth to her first child in July 2024, just before the US presidential election.</li>
</ul>

<p>The previous youngest White House press secretary was Ron Ziegler, who held the role at 29 years old under then President Richard Nixon.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fragments of 10-20 human skulls have been discovered in a burned-out house in a small town in New Mexico after the man who lived there tossed bones out of a car while hitching a ride. According to the <em>New York Times</em>, the police made the grisly discovery earlier this month at a residence in Jal "associated with rumours of human remains". The Lea County sheriff, Corey Helton, said the investigators have sent the fragments to a state lab for testing any potential identification, which could take up to a month. For now, investigators don't know if the bones were ancient or if they could be linked to any missing persons or homicide cases, he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But investigators are "actively examining the possibility that some, if not all, of the human remains may have been purchased online," the sheriff's office continued, per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/14/us/new-mexico-human-skulls.html" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>New York Times</em></a>. "Everything is based on what we find out from the anthropologist, which will dictate what direction we go," Sheriff Helton said.</p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/14/us-news/up-to-20-human-skulls-found-in-new-mexico-home-may-be-linked-to-missing-woman-police/" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>New York Post</em></a>, authorities began investigating after they received a call from a resident who reported an "unsettling encounter" while offering someone a ride on November 5. The resident claimed that the passenger, identified as Cecil Villanueva, "made alarming statements" and threw items from his vehicle - some of which "appeared to be human bones," police said.</p>

<p>Cops searched the area near a convenience store and found bone fragments that a pathologist confirmed as human. Authorities then searched Villanueva's home the following day and discovered additional bone fragments, including part of a skull and jawbone. Police stated that "10-20" human skulls were discovered during a second search of the house three days later.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sheriff Helton said that investigators are now exploring whether some of the skull pieces might be linked to the disappearance of a Jal resident, Angela McManes, who was last seen in May 2019. She reportedly lived on the same street as the property where the bone fragments were discovered. But the sheriff's office said that, so far, "there does not appear to be a link" to Ms McManes, beyond the proximity of her home to the property where the skull fragments were found.</p>

<p>"Authorities are working diligently to determine the connection between the remains and McManes, as well as other possible victims," the sheriff's office said.</p>

<p>Cecil Villanueva has been charged with criminal trespass, a misdemeanour. He is in custody at the Lea County Detention Center, officials said.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The incident in New York remains the only case recorded where a "possible flight safety issue" was encountered.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A commercial plane had a "near miss" with an unexplained aerial phenomenon, more commonly known as unidentified flying objects or "UFOs", over the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of New York, according to a fresh report released by the Pentagon. After the close brush, the airline crew informed the incident to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) stating that it had a "near miss" with a "cylindrical object" while over the Atlantic Ocean" just off the coast of New York. It remains unclear when the supposed close brush took place, or which airline was involved.</p>

<p>The case in New York remains the only incident recorded where a "possible flight safety issue" was encountered "during the event", the Pentagon report added. The agency that reviews all of the new incidents being reported by military personnel and now additional federal agencies is the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), which added that it was continuing its research into the Empire State case.</p>

<p>Notably, between May 2023 and June 2024, AARO received 757 new incident reports, 485 that occurred in that time period and another 272 reports from 2021 and 2022 that had not been previously revealed to the premier agency. A total of 18 incidents were reported near US nuclear infrastructure, weapons, and launch sites as well.</p>

<p>"10 of the reported Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) flew over protected areas for a duration less than five minutes. Two instances involved longer flight times of 53 minutes and 1 hour and 57 minutes respectively. Flight duration is unknown for the remaining six cases," the report noted.</p>

<p>Owing to the rising backlog of cases, a significant number of reports remain unresolved. Currently, AARO is investigating 444 cases.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/more-than-700-ufo-reports-received-but-no-proof-of-alien-activity-7024724" rel="noindex, nofollow"><strong>Also read | Annual UFO Report Finds Over 700 New Cases, But No Proof Of Alien Activity</strong></a></p>

<h3><strong>'Cannot explain them'</strong></h3>

<p>The Pentagon stated in the report that it could not explain more than 20 reports of UAP sightings in the past year alone.</p>

<p>"There are interesting cases that with my physics and engineering background and time in the I.C. I do not understand, and I don't know anybody else understands them," said Dr Jon Kosloski, AARO director.</p>

<p>"Orbs, cylinders, triangles, in one of the cases, it has been happening over an extended period of time, and it is possible that there's multiple things happening," Kosloski added, explaining how the UAPs might have looked like.</p>

<p>Despite not being able to explain multiple reports. AARO said it had "discovered no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology".</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[As the controversy surrounding her explicit videos snowballed, Ms Rahman posted a brief statement before going offline.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan-based TikTok influencer<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/pakistani-influencer-imsha-rehman-deactivates-social-media-accounts-after-private-video-leaks-7008463" rel="noindex, nofollow"> Imsha Rehman</a> has deactivated her social media accounts after her private videos were circulated online without her consent. The videos, allegedly showing Ms Rehman in a compromising position, have since gone viral, triggering a social media storm in the conservative country. Rehman has been facing criticism and intense scrutiny from all quarters which prompted her to wipe out her social media footprint, at least temporarily. Rehman has become the latest Pakistani influencer to have had her private videos leaked online.</p>

<p><strong>Who is Imsha Rehman?</strong></p>

<p>Born on October 7, 2002, in Lahore, Ms Rehman is one of the biggest social media influencers in Pakistan -- commanding a legion of followers on Instagram and TikTok. She started her social media journey by sharing fishing and lifestyle content before transitioning to down-to-earth and relatable content on the short video platform, TikTok.</p>

<p>As of the last update, Rehman had over 111,000 followers on Instagram and nearly 200,000 followers on TikTok - the Chinese app owned by ByteDance.</p>

<p><strong>Imsha Rehman responds to controversy</strong></p>

<p>As the controversy surrounding her explicit videos snowballed, Ms Rahman posted a brief statement before going offline. "The backlash has been overwhelming", she wrote. As per Pakistani media reports, the videos were released after hackers managed to gain access to her accounts.</p>

<p>A screenshot shared by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://tribune.com.pk/story/2509113/tiktoker-imsha-rehman-deactivates-social-media-accounts" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>The Express Tribune </em></a>showed Ms Rehman's TikTok page where she had changed the bio to, "Jab tak video viral hai maine ne ID off kar di hai (Till the time video is viral, I have deactivated my account)."</p>

<p><strong>Previous instance</strong></p>

<p>This is not the first instance when a Pakistani social media influencer has had their online privacy breached. Minahil Malik, a popular social media personality and TikTok star had also quit social media after an intimate video of her with her boyfriend leaked online. She claimed the video was "fake" and lodged a complaint with the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA).</p>

<p>However, Malik faced intense trolling since social media users accused her of intentionally leaking the video. Pakistani actress Mishi Khan released a video in which she criticised influencers for "stooping to the lowest level" for fame. She did not directly name Malik, but the references were said to be directed towards her.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>English TV presenter Davina McCall, 57, is out of surgery after undergoing an operation to remove a rare brain tumour, according to her partner, Michael Douglas. Ms McCall had previously informed her 1.9 million followers on Instagram in a video message that she had been diagnosed with a type of benign tumour called a colloid cyst. On Friday (Nov 16) evening, Mr Douglas provided the update, stating that Ms McCall was out of surgery after doctors performed what was a 'textbook' surgery.</p>

<p>“Davina is out of surgery and according to the surgeon it was textbook. She's currently recovering in ICU as a precaution, as you can imagine she's utterly exhausted. Thanks so much for all the love from everyone on here.. it's powerful stuff, we are super grateful," read the update by Mr Douglas.</p>

<p>Mr Douglas added that his partner will remain offline for some time as she recovers from the surgery.</p>

<p>"@davinamccall will be "off grid" for a bit while she recovers from this brain operation. She is in great shape and in very good hands," he wrote.</p>

<p>"I'll I do the odd update from her account here for anyone interested. I'm sure she'll read all the comments when she's able to so feel free to send love. The support of people is amazingly powerful. Have a great day everyone."</p>

<p>In the video message, Ms McCall described that the tumour's discovery came as a shock to her. Ms McCall said after she was offered a health scan for a menopause talk she had done earlier, the test results showed the brain tumour.</p>

<p>"I thought I was going to ace it [the test]. But it turned out I had a benign brain tumour called a colloid cyst, which is very rare - three in a million," she said in the video.</p>

<p>Ms McCall described it as "big", 14mm wide, adding: "It needs to come out, because if it grows it would be bad."</p>

<p>"And so I slightly put my head in the sand for a while, and then I saw quite a few neurosurgeons. I got lots of opinions, and I realised that I have to get it taken out."</p>

<p><strong>What is benign brain tumour?</strong></p>

<p>As per doctors, a benign (non-cancerous) brain tumour is a mass of cells that grows relatively slowly in the brain. They are unlikely to spread, but are still serious and can be life-threatening. Such non-cancerous tumours are more common in those above the age of 50.</p>

<p>Symptoms include headache, blackouts, behavioural changes and loss of consciousness.</p>

<p><strong>Who is Davina McCall?</strong></p>

<p>Ms McCall's presenting career includes the reality TV show, Big Brother, Long Lost Family, and My Mum, Your Dad along with Comic and Sport Relief. In 2023, she won the top prize at the British Book Awards for her book on menopause, co-authored with Dr Naomi Potter.</p>

<p>Ms McCall has extensively contributed to campaigns on menopause awareness and has batted for women's rights, as per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy5l997xnl4o" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>BBC</em></a>.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As part of an ongoing initiative to repatriate stolen art from countries across South and Southeast Asia, the United States on Wednesday announced that it has returned more than 1,400 looted artefacts worth $10 million to India. According to <em>CNN</em>, the recovered trafficked goods include items that were recently on view at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. Among them is a sandstone sculpture of a celestial dancer that was smuggled from central India to London, before being illegally sold to one of the Met's patrons and donated to the museum.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://manhattanda.org/d-a-bragg-announces-the-return-of-more-than-1400-antiquities-to-the-people-of-india/">press release</a>, the Manhattan District Attorney's Office said that the reparations resulted from "several ongoing investigations" into looting networks, including those operated by convicted art traffickers Nancy Wiener and Subhash Kapoor, an antiquities dealer who was sentenced to 10 years in jail for running a multimillion-dollar looting network through his New York gallery.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After his arrest in Germany in 2011, Subhash Kapoor was sent to face charges in Tamil Nadu. The US Da's office obtained an arrest warrant for him in 2012, however, he remains in custody in India, pending his extradition to the US.</p>

<p>"Today's repatriation marks another victory in what has been a multiyear international investigation into antiquities trafficked by one of history's most prolific offenders," William Walker, the federal Homeland Security Investigation's New York special agent in charge, said in a press statement, per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/15/style/india-us-returns-antiquities-hnk-intl/index.html" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>CNN</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The stolen items were formally returned at a ceremony at the Indian consulate in New York.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, in July, the US and India signed an agreement to protect cultural property by preventing illegal trades and streamlining the process of returning stolen antiquities back to India.</p>

<p>The US returned 297 stolen antiquities to India in September. The antiquities belong to a time period spanning almost 4000 years, from 2000 BCE - 1900 CE and have origins in different parts of India. The majority of the antiquities were terracotta artefacts from Eastern India, while others were made in stone, metal, wood and ivory and belong to different parts of the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"In recent times, restitution of cultural property has become an important aspect of India-US cultural understanding and exchange. Since 2016, the US Government has facilitated the return of a large number of trafficked or stolen antiquities. 10 antiquities were returned during PM's visit to USA in June 2016; 157 antiquities during his visit in September 2021 and a further 105 antiquities during his visit in June last year," the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.mea.gov.in/press-releases.htm?dtl/38328/United+States+of+America+returns+297+antiquities+to+India">Ministry of External Affairs</a> said in a statement in September.</p>

<p>"The total number of cultural artefacts returned from US to India since 2016 stands at 578. This is the maximum number of cultural artefacts returned by any country to India," it added.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President-elect Donald Trump announced Friday that 27-year-old campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt will serve as his White House press secretary.</p>

<p>Leavitt "is smart, tough, and has proven to be a highly effective communicator. I have the utmost confidence she will excel at the podium, and help deliver our message to the American People," Trump said in a statement.</p>

<p>Leavitt is said to be the youngest person to take the key position, acting as the face of the White House and fielding questions from the media.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She acted as national press secretary for Trump during his campaign, giving birth in July to her first child ahead of the election, she told a Fox News podcast posted online on Friday.</p>

<p>After working as an assistant press secretary for Trump during his first term in office, she ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the House of Representatives from her home state of New Hampshire in 2022.</p>

<p>She has also worked as a communications director for Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, whom Trump has nominated to be UN ambassador.</p>

<p>"I didn't grow up in a political family. I grew up like most Americans in a middle-class business family here in my home state of New Hampshire," she told the Fox News podcast. "I just dove into politics at my college, Saint Anselm College, in Manchester (New Hampshire)."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scary footage has emerged from a Miami-bound Scandinavian Airlines flight that had to make a U-turn&nbsp;on Thursday (Nov 14) and return to Europe after encountering severe turbulence over Greenland. The video clip going viral on social media shows passengers screaming as the plane violently shakes, ejecting the fliers from their seats. Food and carry-on bags could also be seen lining the aisles before the pilots took the call to return to a base in Copenhagen with 254 passengers and crew members onboard.</p>

<p>"Look at her feet touching the [ceiling]!" one passenger wrote alongside a clip that has gone viral on social media. "Thought we would die."</p>

<p>The flight had taken off from Stockholm around 12:55 pm local time and was due to land in Miami at 5:45 pm when the incident took place. Despite the heavy shakedown, there were no serious injuries among the passengers and crew, according to a Scandinavian Airlines spokesperson.</p>

<p>"Following such turbulence, standard safety procedures require a thorough inspection of the aircraft," the spokesperson said.</p>

<p>The passengers were accommodated in a hotel overnight and were booked on other flights by Friday morning, according to a report in <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/15/world-news/terrifying-video-shows-passengers-screaming-in-fear-when-severe-turbulence-kicks-them-from-their-seats-forces-plane-to-u-turn/" rel="noindex, nofollow">NY Post.</a></em></p>

<p>The flight, which typically takes nine hours, was rerouted back to Copenhagen, Denmark where technicians are looking for any potential damages. According to reports, if the flight had continued its journey to Miami, it would have been grounded "for an extended period of time" as the US city does not have space and personnel for inspection of a plane that has suffered such damage. The aviation safety protocols mandate a thorough inspection of any aircraft when it undergoes severe turbulence.</p>

<p>This is not the first instance when a Scandinavian Airline flight has been forced to abandon the flight path and return to home base. In September, a flight bound for Malaga, Spain from Norway has halted when a mouse leaped from a passenger's meal and started roaming around the cabin.</p>

<p>The pilot was forced to land in Copenhagen due to a policy that prohibits rodents on flights because they can chew through electrical wiring.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's White House comeback gives his ally Elon Musk a sizeable advantage in a running standoff with EU tech regulators -- who may now think twice before fining his X platform over disinformation concerns.</p>

<p>The world's richest man -- as the boss of Tesla and SpaceX as well as the former Twitter -- threw his full weight into Trump's campaign to reclaim the US presidency.</p>

<p>Elon Musk backed the Republican with hard cash but also used his far-reaching social media platform to push pro-Trump messages, including inflammatory disinformation, to his more than 200 million followers.</p>

<p>The bet amply paid off, with a victorious Trump tapping Musk for an outsized role to overhaul the US government -- and putting Brussels in an uncomfortable spot.</p>

<p>With the European Union counting on continued US backing to keep an aggressive Russia from its borders, can it really afford to upset Trump by going after a prized ally?</p>

<p>Trump's future vice-president J.D. Vance even mused on the campaign trail that Washington could drop support for NATO if the EU presses on with attempts to regulate Musk's X network under a landmark new content law.</p>

<p>"American power comes with certain strings attached. One of those is respect free speech, especially in our European allies," he warned.</p>

<p>For Musk, hostility to the EU's Digital Services Act (DSA) is about more than just business: along with supporters on the American right he increasingly paints it as an ideological battle against censorship.</p>

<p>"The election in the US will not impact our enforcement work," a spokesman for the European Commission -- the powerful tech enforcer for the 27-nation EU -- told AFP.</p>

<p>But experts are not so sure.</p>

<p><strong>Billions in fines?</strong></p>

<p>Musk's X platform was formally accused by the commission in July of misleading users with its blue checkmarks for certified accounts, of insufficient advertising transparency and failing to give researchers access to the platform's data.</p>

<p>The allegations are part of a wider DSA inquiry into how X tackles the spread of illegal content and information manipulation.</p>

<p>Each offence could theoretically trigger a fine of up to six percent of the annual global turnover of all the companies Musk controls -- reaching into the billions.</p>

<p>According to several sources close to the proceedings, the commission was wrapping up its probe -- and readying a heavy fine -- when its digital chief Thierry Breton quit in September, having been denied a second term by EU chief Ursula von der Leyen.</p>

<p>But the stars have since realigned, with the EU now caught in the headlights for fear the volatile Trump will start a trade war and cut support for Ukraine against the Russian invasion.</p>

<p><strong>'Provoke' Trump?</strong></p>

<p>With Trump at the reins, enforcing EU tech rules against X may become a matter of politics as much as anything else.</p>

<p>"I'd be surprised if the commission chooses to provoke Trump over something like this," said Alexandre de Streel, an expert at the Center on Regulation in Europe (CERRE) think tank.</p>

<p>"Transatlantic relations are going to become more complicated -- and this probably isn't the area where they will need to fight hardest," he said.</p>

<p>"Musk believes the DSA goes too far in how it asks platforms to regulate content -- and that is also the view of far-right parties in Europe," de Streel noted. "It's become a battle of ideas, and I don't see Musk folding -- especially not now."</p>

<p>The European Commission also has to factor in Trump's hard-right allies within the bloc, from Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban to Italian leader Giorgia Meloni.</p>

<p>After Trump's re-election, von der Leyen stressed the importance of the EU-US "partnership" and a "strong transatlantic agenda" -- a stance echoed by Breton's designated successor as digital enforcer, Henna Virkkunen.</p>

<p>"With war on its doorstep, Europe must think carefully," said Umberto Gambini, of European affairs consultancy Forward Global. "I don't think it can afford to upset Trump in these first months."</p>

<p>Gambini predicts that the commission's probes into X will keep ticking along but the departure of Breton -- who clashed spectacularly with Musk via social media -- will offer a chance to reset the relationship.</p>

<p>Already back in August, Brussels had distanced itself from a letter of warning sent by the French commissioner before Musk interviewed Trump live on X.</p>

<p>That said, "if Europe wants to remain credible" in the fight to rein in Big Tech, it "has to keep threatening fines in the billions, not millions", Gambini said.</p>

<p>But with fragile transatlantic ties in mind, it may choose to focus its firepower on Chinese platforms such as TikTok instead, judged the EU expert.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a red box factory that stands out among the drab hills of the West Bank, Chat Cola's employees race to quench Palestinians' thirst for local products since the Gaza war erupted last year.</p>

<p>With packaging reminiscent of Coca-Cola's iconic red and white aluminium cans, Chat Cola has tapped into Palestinians' desire to shun brands perceived as too supportive of Israel.</p>

<p>"The demand for (Chat Cola) increased since the war began because of the boycott," owner Fahed Arar, told AFP at the factory in the occupied West Bank town of Salfit.</p>

<p>Julien, a restaurateur in the city of Ramallah further south, said he has stocked his classic red Coca-Cola branded fridge with the local alternative since the war began in October last year.</p>

<p>Supermarket manager Mahmud Sidr described how sales of Palestinian products surged over the past year.</p>

<p>"We noticed an increase in sales of Arab and Palestinian products that do not support (Israel)," he said.</p>

<p>Although it does not supply Israeli troops in Gaza with free goods -- as some US fast food brands have been rumoured to -- Coca-Cola is perceived as simply too American.</p>

<p>The United States provides enormous military assistance to Israel, aid that has continued through the devastating military campaign in Gaza that Israel launched in response to Hamas's unprecedented attack of October 7, 2023.</p>

<p>Coca-Cola did not respond to a request for comment, but it says the company does not support religion nor "any political causes, governments or nation states".</p>

<p>A manager of the National Beverage Company, the Palestinian firm bottling Coca-Cola in the Palestinian territories, told AFP the company had not noticed the return of many products from local stores.</p>

<p>There was however a decline of up to 80 percent in the drink's sales to foreign-named chains, said the manager, speaking on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p><strong>Not just cola</strong></p>

<p>"The national boycott movement has had a big impact," Fahed Arar said.</p>

<p>Ibrahim al-Qadi, head of the Palestinian economy ministry's consumer protection department, told AFP that 300 tonnes of Israeli products were destroyed over the past three months after passing their sell-by date for want of buyers.</p>

<p>The Palestinian economy's dependence on Israeli products has made a broader boycott difficult and Chat Cola's popularity partly stems from being one of the few quality Palestinian alternatives.</p>

<p>"There's a willingness to boycott if the Palestinian producers can produce equivalently good quality and price," the head of the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute, Raja Khalidi, told AFP.</p>

<p>Khalidi said the desire for Palestinian substitutes has grown sharply since the war in Gaza began, but is stifled by "an issue of production capacity which we lack".</p>

<p>A boycott campaign has been more successful in neighbouring Arab states less dependent on Israeli goods.</p>

<p>In neighbouring Jordan, the franchisee of French retail giant Carrefour, Dubai-based conglomerate Majid Al Futtaim Group announced it was shutting down all its operations after activists called for a boycott.</p>

<p><strong>'Palestinian taste'</strong></p>

<p>Chat Cola's Arar is proud of developing a quality Palestinian product.</p>

<p>Staff at the company's Salfit factory wear sweaters emblazoned with the words "Palestinian taste" in Arabic and the Palestinian flag.</p>

<p>After opening the factory in 2019, Arar plans to open a new one in Jordan to meet international demand and avoid the complications of operating in the occupied West Bank.</p>

<p>Although the plant still turns out thousands of cans of Chat, one production line has been shut down for more than a month.</p>

<p>Israeli authorities have held up a large shipment of raw materials at the Jordanian border, hitting output, Arar said, adding he can meet only 10 to 15 percent of demand for his product.</p>

<p>As Arar spoke, Israeli air defences intercepted a rocket likely launched from Lebanon, creating a small cloud in view of the plant.</p>

<p>But with war have come opportunities.</p>

<p>"There has never been the political support for buying local that there is now, so it's a good moment for other entrepreneurs to start up," economist Khalidi said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk's SpaceX is preparing to launch a tender offer in December to sell existing shares at a price of $135 per share, the Financial Times reported on Friday, citing people with knowledge of the discussions.</p>

<p>The tender offer would value SpaceX at more than $250 billion, according to the report.</p>

<p>SpaceX did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.</p>

<p>Elon Musk, the world's richest person, is expected to wield significant influence in Washington to secure favorable government treatment for his companies, including SpaceX, after Donald Trump's victory for a second presidency.</p>

<p>Elon Musk's dream of transporting humans to Mars could also become a bigger national priority under Donald Trump, Reuters reported earlier this month.</p>

<p>NASA's Artemis program, which aims to use SpaceX's Starship rocket to put humans on the moon as a proving ground for later Mars missions, is expected to focus more on the Red Planet under Donald Trump and target uncrewed missions there this decade.</p>

<p>Under Donald Trump, SpaceX is also expected to push for even softer regulations on worker safety and safety of participants in private space flights in orbit.</p>

<p>A Reuters investigation last year documented at least 600 worker injuries at SpaceX facilities across the U.S., and how SpaceX disregarded safety regulations and standard practices.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nearly two decades after hanging his gloves, 58-year-old Mike Tyson is set to climb back into the ring on Friday for a Netflix-backed bout. Tyson, who terrorised the heavyweight division during an imperious reign in the late 1980s, will face 27-year-old YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul in an officially sanctioned fight at AT&amp;T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys, in Texas, US.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tyson, who became the youngest heavyweight champion in history at the age of 20 years and four months in 1986, retired in 2005 after losing to Kevin McBride. At the time, he said he didn't have anything left to give the sport. The boxing legend last fought against Roy Jones Jr. in an exhibition match, with no fans during the pandemic in 2020.</p>

<p>Now, by taking on a man not even half his age, the former world heavyweight champion will become one of the oldest boxers to compete in a sanctioned professional fight. The bout, which according to experts is not an exhibition match, is been described by experts as an "indictment on boxing" &nbsp;and a "competitive fight".</p>

<h2>Tyson Back In The Ring</h2>

<p>So, why is Mike Tyson lacing up the gloves once more after 19 years? Simple answer - the money. As per reports, Mike Tyson is being paid USD 20 million just for this one match. Jake Paul is reportedly getting double of that - USD 40 million.</p>

<p>A showdown is also seen as Netflix's latest one-two punch, as the media giant hopes to cash in on sports' sprint to streaming. The streaming powerhouse will broadcast the event live to a global subscriber list of 280 million. Moreover, a crowd of about 70,000 is expected at the stadium to witness Tyson once again in the ring, according to a BBC report.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the streaming giant, Tyson vs. Paul is their biggest live sports event to date and an opportunity to ensure that it can handle audience demand with the NFL and WWE on the horizon.</p>

<h3>Concerns Over Health</h3>

<p>The Netflix-backed bout has also drawn widespread condemnation across the boxing world. Though the rules of the game have been altered, experts have weighed in on how Mike Tyson's age might play a factor in the highly anticipated fight. The bout was initially due to take place in July but was postponed in May after Tyson required medical treatment on a flight from Miami to Los Angeles after vomiting blood due to a bleeding ulcer.</p>

<p>Raising the issue, Stephen Hughes, a senior lecturer of medicine at Anglia Riskin University in England, cited Tyson's age and past alcohol abuse as risk factors. In an article published by "The Conversation", Hughes that a head trauma during a fight could put the boxer at greater risk of suffering a subdural hematoma, which is potentially fatal.</p>

<p>Prominent British fight promoter Eddie Hearn also flagged risk to Tyson's health during the fight and said, "Twenty years ago, Mike Tyson retired from boxing, and was shot to pieces, right? I mean, completely shot."</p>

<p>"If anyone thinks that Mike Tyson should be in a ring at this age, you either have absolutely no emotional feelings toward the man, or you're an idiot. It shouldn't be happening," he added.</p>

<p>Hearn's rival promoter Frank Warren echoed those sentiments and said, "Mike Tyson is 58 years of age and he shouldn't be fighting."</p>

<p>"Anyone with an ounce of brains knows that it is ridiculous. You can be on a motorway stuck in a traffic jam and you get to the end of it and all it is is people who have stopped to look at a crash -- and that's what this is," he added.</p>

<h3>Mike Tyson's Reply</h3>

<p>Mike Tyson, who US reports say is being paid around $20 million for Friday's contest, has brushed off the concerns for his well-being, insisting that critics from the boxing world are motivated by jealousy.</p>

<p>"I'm beautiful, that's all I can say," he said earlier this year. "The people who said that wish they were up here. No-one else can do this."</p>

<p>At an open workout in Texas this week, Tyson declared that a gruelling training camp had left him with the conviction "that I'm tougher than I believed I was."</p>

<p>"When I agreed to this fight and started training, I thought 'What was I thinking of?' But I've finished the process. The fight is the party. All the hard work is done."<br />

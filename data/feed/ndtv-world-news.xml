       <description><![CDATA[A recent study by The Lancet Public Health Commission reveals that approximately 80 million people worldwide suffer from gambling disorders, with adolescents being the most affected.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An estimated 80 million people worldwide suffer from gambling disorders or problematic gambling as a result of the digital revolution's substantial expansion of the online casino and sports betting markets. Adolescents are the most affected group, according to a recent study by the Lancet Public Health Commission.</p>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.thelancet.com/commissions/gambling">Commission's research</a> further states that children and teenagers are being exposed to gambling product marketing in previously unheard-of ways. Because of this exposure, they are especially vulnerable to the allure of quick cash and the addictive qualities of online gambling sites.</p>

<p>There is a pressing need for greater knowledge and preventative measures to protect vulnerable people from the dangers of online gambling as the prevalence of gambling problems rises, particularly among younger populations.</p>

<p>The author of the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.thelancet.com/commissions/gambling">reports said </a>that "gambling is not an ordinary kind of leisure; it can be a health-harming, addictive behaviour. The harms associated with gambling are wide-ranging, affecting not only an individual's health and wellbeing but also their wealth and relationships, families, and communities, and deepening health and societal inequalities."</p>

<p>"By examining these harms, the Commission unveils the intersections between the social, commercial, legal, and political determinants of health. The Commission sheds light on the increasingly complex commercial ecosystem for gambling and its digital transformation, which offers unparalleled capacities for gambling," the report further said.</p>

<p>The Commission calls on governments and policymakers to treat gambling as a public health issue-just as for other addictive and health-harming commodities, such as alcohol and tobacco-and provides recommendations to prevent and mitigate the broad range of harms associated with gambling," the report further said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran warned on Saturday it would defend itself after Israeli air strikes killed at least two soldiers and further stoked fears of a full-scale regional war in the Middle East.</p>

<p>Israel warned Iran would "pay a heavy price" if it responded to the strikes, and the United States, Germany and Britain demanded Tehran not escalate the conflict further.</p>

<p>Other countries, including many of Iran's neighbours, condemned Israel's strikes and some, such as Russia, urged both sides to show restraint and avoid what Moscow dubbed a "catastrophic scenario".</p>

<p>The Islamic republic insisted it had the "right and the duty" to defend itself, while its Lebanese ally Hezbollah said it had already launched rocket salvos targeting five residential areas in northern Israel.</p>

<p>The Israeli army said 80 projectiles were fired across the border on Saturday.</p>

<p>Confirming its own strikes after explosions and anti-aircraft fire echoed around Tehran, the Israel military said it had hit Iranian missile factories and military facilities in several regions.</p>

<p>The "retaliatory strike has been completed and the mission was fulfilled", while Israeli aircraft "returned safely", a military spokesman added.</p>

<p>Iran confirmed Israel had targeted military sites in Tehran province around the capital and other parts of the country, saying the raids caused "limited damage" but killed two soldiers.</p>

<p><strong>Direct attack</strong></p>

<p>Israel had vowed to retaliate after October 1, when Iran fired around 200 missiles in only the second ever direct attack against its arch-foe. Most of those missiles were intercepted but one person was killed.</p>

<p>The Israeli retaliation drew condemnation from Hamas, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria and Saudi Arabia, which warned against further escalation. Jordan stated that Israeli jets had not used its airspace. Turkey was one of the most outspoken critics, calling for an end to "terror created by Israel".</p>

<p>Israel is already engaged in combat on two fronts.</p>

<p>Since last month, it has been fighting a war against Hezbollah in Lebanon, including strikes that have killed the group's senior leadership and ground incursions seeking to destroy missile sites.</p>

<p>And, for more than a year since Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack, Israel has been fighting a war in Gaza that has caused mass civilian casualties in the densely populated Palestinian territory.</p>

<p>The United Nations has warned the "darkest moment" of that conflict was unfolding, with Palestinians facing a dire humanitarian crisis and daily Israeli bombing.</p>

<p>Along with Hezbollah and Hamas, Iranian-allied groups in Yemen, Iraq and Syria, have carried out attacks during the fallout from the Gaza war.</p>

<p>At roughly the same time as Israel struck targets in Iran, the Syrian state news agency SANA said an Israeli air attack targeted military positions in central and southern Syria.</p>

<p><strong>'Iranian proxies'</strong></p>

<p>The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a loose network of pro-Iran factions, claimed responsibility before dawn Saturday for a drone attack against a "military target" in northern Israel.</p>

<p>On Friday, two people died from shrapnel wounds after a Hezbollah rocket barrage into Israel's north, Israeli officials said.</p>

<p>In addition to the residential strikes, Hezbollah said it had fired rockets at Israeli soldiers near the village of Aita al-Shaab in southern Lebanon and at an intelligence base as well as launching drones against Israel's Tel Nof air base south of Tel Aviv.</p>

<p>On Saturday, Lebanon's health ministry said an Israeli strike had killed a Hezbollah-affiliated medic in Bazuriyeh in the south of the country.</p>

<p>US National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett said Israel's response to Iran was "an exercise in self-defence".</p>

<p>He urged Iran to "cease its attacks on Israel so that this cycle of fighting can end without further escalation".</p>

<p>The Israeli military has blamed "Iran and its proxies" in the region for "relentlessly attacking Israel since October 7", when Hamas's attack against Israel triggered the Gaza war.</p>

<p>That attack resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official Israeli figures.</p>

<p>Dozens of hostages seized on that day are still held by militants in Gaza.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory bombardment and ground war in Gaza has killed 42,924 people, the majority civilians, according to data from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, figures the United Nations considers reliable.</p>

<p>In late September Israel turned its focus to Lebanon hitting, Hezbollah targets and leaders and then sending in ground troops.</p>

<p>Israel says the aim is to make the north of its country safe for tens of thousands of displaced civilians to return.</p>

<p>At least 1,580 people have been killed in Lebanon since September 23, according to an AFP tally of Lebanese health ministry figures.</p>

<p>In April, in its first-ever direct assault against Israeli territory, Iran launched more than 300 drones and missiles.</p>

<p>Tehran said the barrage was retaliation for a strike on Iran's consular annexe in Damascus that killed members of its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.</p>

<p>Explosions later in April shook Iran's Isfahan province in what US officials, cited by American media, said was Israeli retaliation.</p>

<p><strong>Hospital under threat</strong></p>

<p>Iran said its October 1 missile attack on Israel was retaliation for an Israeli air raid that killed Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah as well as the assassination in Tehran of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh.</p>

<p>On Friday, Gaza's health ministry accused Israeli forces of storming the last functioning hospital in the territory's north in a raid it said left two children dead.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said its forces were operating around Kamal Adwan Hospital in north Gaza's Jabalia refugee camp but it was "not aware of live fire and strikes in the area of the hospital".</p>

<p>The Israeli military says it is seeking to destroy operational capabilities Hamas is trying to rebuild in the north.</p>

<p>Also on Friday, Gaza's civil defence agency said Israeli drone strikes killed 12 people waiting to receive aid near the Al-Shati refugee camp.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite the patrolling agreement with China, which was announced earlier this week, it will take time to rebuild trust and for the two countries to be willing to work with each other, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has said.</p>

<p>During an interaction with students from a university in Pune on Saturday, Mr Jaishankar said the breakthrough with China was possible because the military enabled India to stand its ground and make its point and diplomacy also did its part. A focus on infrastructure in border areas, which enabled effective deployment of the military, also played a key role.</p>

<p>Responding to a question on the patrolling and disengagement agreement in the Depsang and Demchok areas in Eastern Ladakh and what can be expected from the future of India-China relations, the minister said, "From 2020, the situation at the border has been very disturbed and that has, understandably, had a very negative impact on the overall relationship. Since September 2020, we have been negotiating with the Chinese on how to find a solution."</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar said there were different aspects to the solution but the pressing one was disengagement because "the troops are very very close up to each other and the possibility of something happening, god forbid, is there". The other aspects, he said are de-escalation, given the troop buildup by China and India's response to it, and the larger question of boundary settlement.</p>

<p>The focus, for now, is disengagement, the minister said, stressing that while there had been understandings in some areas after 2020, blocking of patrolling remained an issue which was being negotiated for two years. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"So, what happened on October 21 was that in Depsang and Demchok, we came to the understanding that patrolling would be resumed how it used to be before... This was important because it was an affirmation that if we can do the disengagement, then it is possible for the leadership level to meet, which is what happened (with the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-Chinese President Xi Jinping meeting) in Russia's Kazan during the BRICS summit," he said during the interaction at FLAME University in Pune.</p>

<p><strong>Future Of Ties</strong></p>

<p>On the question of where the India-China relationship goes from here, Mr Jaishankar said, "I think it is a bit early. We have to wait for things to settle themselves. Because, after four years of a very disturbed border where peace and tranquillity have been shattered, it will naturally take time to rebuild a degree of trust and a willingness to work with each other."</p>

<p>"If we have reached where we have today, there are two reasons for it. The first is a very determined effort on our part to stand our ground and make our point and this would only happen because the military was there in very, very unimaginable conditions to defend the country. The military did its part and diplomacy did its part," he emphasised.</p>

<p>The second reason, the minister said, was the importance given to improving infrastructure in the border areas in the past decade.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Today, we have put in almost five times annually the resources that would be there a decade ago. That's showing results and that enables the military to be effectively deployed. I would be patient. When PM Modi and President Xi met, it was decided that the foreign ministers and national security advisers would meet and see how this should be taken forward," he explained.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Process On</strong></p>

<p>NDTV had reported on Friday on satellite images showing tents and semi-permanent structures being removed by the Chinese side in Depsang and Demchok.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The patrolling agreement had been announced by Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri on Monday and army sources had said on Friday that the process of disengagement would be completed in the two contentious areas by October 29. PM Modi and Mr Jinping welcomed the agreement when they met on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The stand-off between the Indian and Chinese armies began on May 2020 and a deadly clash took place in Ladakh's Galwan the next month in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed in action and an unspecified number on the Chinese side also died.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A troop buildup followed and, after months of talks, Indian and Chinese troops withdrew from the contentious Gogra-Hot Springs area in Ladakh in September 2022 and returned to the pre-April-2020 position.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Law enforcement agencies have arrested more than a dozen vloggers and TikTokers accusing them of spreading fake stories about an alleged rape of a girl student that led to violent protests across Punjab province over a week ago.</p>

<p>Senior Punjab police officer Imran Kishwar said on Saturday that police have also identified 40 students involved in vandalism and violence.</p>

<p>The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and the local police have already arrested 16 individuals, mostly vloggers and tiktokers, during the week for their alleged involved in spreading a fake rape story, he said, adding, those identified for vandalism and violence will be arrested soon.</p>

<p>"We have also blocked 138 social media accounts spreading fake news about the incident," he added.</p>

<p>The FIA said that technical reports of the cybercrime wing had identified social media accounts of 38 senior journalists, lawyers, vloggers and TikTokers who were found involved in sharing the news of the alleged fake propaganda, instigating the general public to involve in ransacking the government and private infrastructure.</p>

<p>At least 50 students were injured and one security guard killed during massive protests that had turned violent across several cities of Punjab province last week following a social media report about a female student allegedly raped by a security guard at a women's college in Lahore. Police had also detained over 600 students.</p>

<p>Later, an investigative committee formed by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz found no evidence of rape at the college, nor did it find any eyewitnesses.</p>

<p>The committee conducted interviews with around 28 students, who mentioned they had heard about the incident from others. The committee's report stated that the matter was sensationalised through social media posts.</p>

<p>Maryam Nawaz blamed former jailed prime minister Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf for exploiting the matter through social media.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The World Health Organization said it has regained contact with staff at a besieged northern Gaza hospital, finding that three health workers had been injured and 44 detained.</p>

<p>Kamal Adwan, northern Gaza's last functioning hospital, "is still under siege, but we managed to get in touch with the staff", WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on X late Friday.</p>

<p>"Three health workers and another employee have been injured, 44 health workers have been detained and four ambulances damaged," he said.</p>

<p>On Friday Gaza's health ministry accused Israeli forces of storming Kamal Adwan hospital in the Jabalia camp, where it launched a major operation earlier this month.</p>

<p>It said the raid left two children dead, and accused the Israeli forces of detaining hundreds of staff, patients and displaced people during the raid.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said its forces were operating around Kamal Adwan, but was "not aware of live fire and strikes in the area of the hospital".</p>

<p>Amid the chaos, WHO said Friday afternoon that it had lost contact with staff at Kamal Adwan, with Tedros describing the development in an earlier post on X the development as "deeply disturbing".</p>

<p>Tedros said the WHO and partner agencies had reached the hospital late on Wednesday night and managed to transfer 23 patients and 26 caregivers to the Palestinian territory's main Al-Shifa Hospital.</p>

<p>"Kamal Adwan Hospital has been overflowing with close to 200 patients -- a constant stream of horrific trauma cases. It is also full of hundreds of people seeking shelter," he said.</p>

<p>In his second post, Tedros highlighted that, in all, "around 600 patients, health workers and individuals are currently sheltering in the hospital".</p>

<p>"The siege and attacks on health workers occurred just hours after the WHO-led mission which delivered essential supplies to keep the facility operational and took critical patients to Al-Shifa Hospital," he said.</p>

<p>"We urge for hospitals, health workers and patients to be protected. Ceasefire!"</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A suicide bomber detonated at a checkpoint in western Pakistan on Saturday, killing eight people and wounding five more, officials said.</p>

<p>The bomber set off the blast from the back of a motorbike rickshaw near the town of Mir Ali in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, a local police officer told AFP on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>Four police officers were killed alongside two members of a state paramilitary force and two civilians in the attack near the border with Afghanistan, he said.</p>

<p>Pakistan has seen an increase in militancy since the Afghan Taliban returned to power in 2021, with Islamabad claiming hostile groups are now using the neighbouring country for shelter.</p>

<p>"Among the five injured personnel, the condition of three is critical, and they have been transferred to a local military hospital," the police officer said.</p>

<p>A local government official who also did not want to be named confirmed the same toll of dead and wounded.</p>

<p>The attack was claimed by a little-known militant group calling itself "Aswad ul-Harb".</p>

<p>Another checkpost near the Afghan border was raided this week by the Pakistani Taliban, killing 10 police officers.</p>

<p>Last year, the country saw more suicide attacks than any year since 2014, according to the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.</p>

<p>There were 29 suicide attacks registered, killing 329 people in Pakistan's deadliest year in a decade.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 10 police officers were killed in a "terrorist attack" in an area of southeastern Iran long plagued by unrest, local media reported on Saturday.</p>

<p>They were killed during an attack on "police vehicles" in Sistan-Baluchistan province's Taftan county, the Mehr and Tasnim news agencies reported, without saying how it was carried out.</p>

<p>No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, which occurred some 1,200 kilometres (745 miles) southeast of the capital Tehran.</p>

<p>The official IRNA news agency, citing a police statement, reported the death of "10 personnel in two patrol units" in what it called an ambush.</p>

<p>Sistan-Baluchistan borders Pakistan and Afghanistan, and is one of the most impoverished provinces in the Islamic republic.</p>

<p>It is home to a large number of the Baluch minority, an ethnic group spread between Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan who practise Sunni Islam in contrast to the country's predominantly Shiite population.</p>

<p>The province has experienced recurring clashes between Iranian security forces and rebels from the Baluch minority, radical Sunni groups and drug traffickers.</p>

<p>Saturday's attack was one of the deadliest attacks in the area in recent months.</p>

<p>In early October, at least six people, including police officers, were killed in the province in two separate attacks.</p>

<p>The Pakistan-based Sunni jihadist group Jaish al-Adl -- Army of Justice in Arabic -- claimed responsibility for the two attacks in a message on Telegram.</p>

<p>Formed in 2012 by Baluch separatists, the group is considered a "terrorist organisation" by both Iran and the United States.</p>

<p>Iran and Pakistan frequently accuse each other of allowing rebel groups to operate and launch attacks from their respective territories.</p>

<p>In mid-January, Iran carried out a strike in Pakistan and targeted the Jaish al-Adl headquarters, according to the Mehr agency.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The number of chronic kidney disease (CKD) cases in women has nearly tripled in the past three decades globally, according to a new study led by researchers from the Gujarat Adani Institute of Medical Sciences (GAIMS).</p>

<p>Type 2 diabetes and hypertension were the leading causes of CKD-related deaths in women, said the research which was presented at the ‘ASN Kidney Week 2024' in San Diego in the US from October 23–27.</p>

<p>“This calls for immediate policy interventions, targeted prevention programmes, and investment in health care infrastructure to curb the rise of CKD, particularly in high-risk regions,” senior author Hardik Dineshbhai Desai, an independent clinical and public health researcher at GAIMS.</p>

<p>GAIMS is the first public-private-partnership (PPP) endeavour between the Gujarat government and Adani Education and Research Foundation.</p>

<p>The analysis, titled ‘Global, National, and Regional Trends in the Burden of Chronic Kidney Disease among Women from 1990- 2021: A Comprehensive Global Analysis,' drew from the ‘Global Burden of Disease' study 2021, a comprehensive effort to quantify health loss across the world over time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From 1990 to 2021, the average annual percentage change in CKD prevalence in women increased by 2.10 per cent, mortality by 3.39 per cent, and disability-adjusted life years by 2.48 per cent.</p>

<p>There have also been significant disparities in CKD-related mortality and morbidity across the world, with marked increases observed particularly in Latin America, North America, and among older adults.</p>

<p>The study showed an alarming increased mortality rate attributable to metabolic risk factor over the last decade after a slight decrease between 2000 and 2010.</p>

<p>“Public awareness campaigns about the importance of early diagnosis, healthy lifestyles, and the management of underlying conditions like diabetes and hypertension are critical,” said Desai.</p>

<p>“Without swift action, the continued rise of CKD could overwhelm health care systems and lead to increased mortality and morbidity worldwide,” he added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian authorities announced a manhunt on Saturday after six convicts tunnelled their way out a correctional facility.</p>

<p>Four of the six fugitives have now been detained, while local law enforcement are in hot pursuit of the remaining two.</p>

<p>"I realise that the news may cause concern, but I ask you not to panic," said Igor Artamonov, governor of the western Lipetsk region.</p>

<p>"Security forces are continuing efforts to track down and detain the criminals," he added.</p>

<p>Prison guards were alerted to their disappearance after carrying out a routine inspection.</p>

<p>"In general regime penal colony No. 2, an underground tunnel was discovered during a patrol of the premises," the prison service of the Lipetsk region said.</p>

<p>"Immediately a count of convicts got underway, which revealed the absence of six inmates," it added.</p>

<p>It did not reveal their identities, but said in a statement the suspects were "from Central Asia".</p>

<p>Four of the escapees were detained, two of whom were caught in the neighbouring Tambov region, the local governor said.</p>

<p>"The search for the remaining two criminals continues," he said.</p>

<p>The Lipetsk region is about 300 kilometres (190 miles) south of Moscow.</p>

<p>Russia has one of the highest prison populations in the world, totalling more than 400,000 people last year, but numbers have decreased as convicts are sent to fight in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Prison escapes are relatively rare in Russia and those who manage to break out are often quickly caught.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<ol>
	<li>Today's Israeli airstrikes on Iran have parallels to a June 1981 airstrike on Iraq, called Operation Opera - simply on the distance covered and the level of risk. NDTV <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/operation-opera-daring-1981-airstrike-on-nuclear-reactor-in-focus-as-israel-faces-multi-front-war-4471744">reported last year</a> that Israel would not hesitate to carry out a similar strike on Iran if it found itself cornered.</li>
	<li>Just like today's airstrikes, which according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/iran-news/article-826126" rel="nofollow,noindex"><em>The Jerusalem Post</em></a> involved over 100 aircraft including the US-made stealth fighter jet F-35 flying a roundtrip of 2,000 km, a concern in 1981's Operation Opera was about selecting the flight path as there were several constraints - a great distance to target (1,100 km), several hostile countries on the way, and limited amount of fuel.</li>
	<li>The Jerusalem Post reported today's massive air operation likely began with initial waves attacking radar and air defence systems, which set the airspace safe and clear for subsequent strikes on military bases in Iran.</li>
	<li>In Operation Opera, on June 7, 1981 at 4 pm, 14 fighter jets took off from Etzion airport in Israel. At approximately 5.30 pm, they struck and destroyed the Osirak nuclear reactor in Iraq, successfully completing their mission with no loss of any Israeli aircraft.</li>
	<li>Israel used F-16As in the strike on Iraq in 1981, with F-15As providing escort. The jets carried a massive amount of fuel in external tanks and flew extremely low for a long distance. However, with improvement in technology - modern versions of F-15 and F-16 are still in service - Israel likely did not have to face the kind of stress it did back in 1981, though the risk would still be high due to a parallel improvement in air defence technology.</li>

       <description><![CDATA[Seoul authorities, while announcing the $327 million initiative this week, stated that they want to "create a city where no one is lonely."]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Authorities in South Korea's capital city Seoul plan to spend 451.3 billion won (around $327 million) in the next five years to tackle "lonely deaths" - a crisis that sees thousands of its citizens, mostly middle-aged men, dying alone every year after getting unnoticed by their family and friends.</p>

<p>Known as 'godoksa' in Korea, these deaths are part of a larger problem of loneliness and isolation in the country, as the government is making all possible efforts to fight it. Sometimes, it takes days and even weeks for the authorities to find these bodies, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/24/asia/south-korea-loneliness-deaths-intl-hnk/index.html">CNN</a> reported.</p>

<p>Seoul authorities, while announcing the $327 million initiative this week, stated that they want to "create a city where no one is lonely."</p>

<p>Apart from this, they will provide loneliness counsellors on a 24/7 hotline and an online platform for similar counselling, besides other follow-up measures like in-person visits and consultations.</p>

<p>In an official release, Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon said the city authorities will mobilise all its municipal capacity to help the people feeling lonely to heal and "return to society". "Loneliness and isolation are not just individual problems, but tasks that society must solve together," Oh Se-hoon said.</p>

<p>The city also plans to introduce several other measures like expanded psychological services, green spaces, nutritional meal plans for middle-aged and elderly people as well as a dedicated "search system" for identifying the isolated residents who are seeking help.</p>

<p>Also, there will be activities carried out to encourage people to venture outside and connect with others. Among these are sports, gardening, book clubs and more, the CNN report said.</p>

<p>As per the latest figures by South Korea's Ministry of Health and Welfare, the number of "lonely deaths" reached 3,661 last year, significantly higher from 3,559 in 2022 and 3,378 in 2021.</p>

<p>However, part of that increase might be due to the broader definition of "lonely death" by the ministry concerned. To qualify as a 'lonely death,' a body had to be found only after a certain amount of time earlier, but the term now is applied to any individual, who stays in social isolation, away from family and relatives and dies by suicide or illness.</p>

<p>South Korea's demographic crisis could be another factor behind this rise. A downtrend in the birth rate and ageing population shows that there have been consistently more deaths in the country than births in recent years. The overall death rate in South Korea, including "lonely deaths," is rising. Also, men in their 50s and 60s made up over half the total group.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US hired a chartered flight to deport Indian nationals who were staying in the country illegally, the Department of Homeland Security has said, noting that this has been done in cooperation with the Indian government.</p>

<p>The charter flight was sent to India on October 22, the department said on Friday. "Indian nationals without a legal basis to remain in the United States are subject to swift removal, and intending migrants should not fall for the lies of smugglers who proclaim otherwise," said Kristie A. Canegallo, a senior official performing the duties of Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security.</p>

<p>The statement said the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) continues to enforce <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/indians-form-third-largest-illegal-immigrant-population-in-us-study-4595873">US immigration</a> laws and deliver tough consequences for those who enter unlawfully and encourages the use of lawful pathways.</p>

<p>Since June 2024, when the Securing the Border Presidential Proclamation and accompanying Interim Final Rule went into effect, encounters between ports of entry along the southwest border of the US have decreased by 55 per cent.</p>

<p>In fiscal year 2024, the DHS removed or returned over 160,000 individuals and operated more than 495 international repatriation flights to more than 145 countries, including India, the statement said.</p>

<p>It said the department regularly engaged with foreign governments throughout the hemisphere and around the world to accept repatriations of their nationals without a legal basis to remain in the US.</p>

<p>This was one tool among many that the US used to reduce irregular migration, promote the use of safe, lawful and orderly pathways, and hold transnational criminal networks accountable for smuggling and exploitation of vulnerable people, it said.</p>

<p>Over the last year, DHS has removed individuals from a range of countries worldwide, including Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Egypt, Mauritania, Senegal, Uzbekistan, China, and India.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian actors were behind a viral video falsely showing mail-in ballots for Donald Trump being destroyed in the swing state of Pennsylvania, US officials said Friday, amid heightened alert over foreign influence operations targeting the upcoming election.</p>

<p>The video, which garnered millions of views on platforms such as the Elon Musk-owned X, purports to show a man sorting through mail-in ballots from the state's Bucks County and ripping up those cast for Trump.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the Bucks County Board of Elections declared the video as "fake," saying that the envelope and other materials depicted in the footage are "clearly not authentic materials" belonging to or distributed by them.</p>

<p>In a joint statement on Friday, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said the video was part of a Russian disinformation operation.</p>

<p>"Russian actors manufactured and amplified a recent video that falsely depicted an individual ripping up ballots in Pennsylvania," the statement said.</p>

<p>"This Russian activity is part of Moscow's broader effort to raise unfounded questions about the integrity of the US election and stoke divisions among Americans," it added.</p>

<p>The statement said Russia was expected to create and release more such content in an attempt to "undermine trust" in the integrity of the November 5 elections.</p>

<p>The video surfaced as American authorities brace for a surge in disinformation in the final days of a nail-biting election between Republican nominee Trump and the Democratic candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>The video, also debunked by AFP's fact-checkers, was connected to a Kremlin-aligned disinformation network known as Storm-1516, according to researchers including Darren Linvill, co-director of Clemson University's Media Forensics Hub.</p>

<p>Linvill, who has closely studied the network, said the account on X -- previously called Twitter -- that distributed the video has regularly amplified other narratives from this network.</p>

<p>Storm-1516 has previously produced fake videos to discredit the campaign of Harris and her running mate Tim Walz, according to disinformation researchers.</p>

<p>Last month, the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center said Russian operatives are ramping up disinformation operations to malign Harris's campaign by disseminating conspiracy-laden videos.</p>

<p>Aside from Russia, Iran and China are also fanning "divisive narratives to divide Americans and undermine Americans' confidence in the US democratic system," the ODNI warned in a memo earlier this week.</p>

<p>"Foreign influence efforts will intensify in the lead-up to Election Day, especially through social media posts -- some of which are likely to be AI generated or enhanced," the report said.</p>

<p>"These actors probably perceive that undermining confidence in the elections weakens the legitimacy of our democracy and consequently makes the United States less capable of effectively pursuing policies that are counter to their interests," it added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As Israel launched a series of air strikes Saturday, which it said were aimed at Iran's military infrastructure, AFP looks at the other attempts over the years.</p>

<h3><strong>Revolutionary Guard</strong></h3>

<p>Israel has been blamed for targeting top members of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, mostly in attempts outside their country's borders.</p>

<p>Latest victims include a general killed on September 27 by the side of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli strike in the suburbs of Beirut.&nbsp;</p>

<p>An air strike blamed on Israel on Iran's consular annex building in Damascus on April 1, 2024 killed, according to Tehran, seven members of the Revolutionary Guards, including two of top rank.</p>

<p>The recent killings are only the latest in a long list.</p>

<p>In December 2023, a commander died in Syria in an attack blamed on Israel, a year after a colonel was killed, also in Syria.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In May 2022, Sayyad Khodaei, a member of the Quds Force, the unit in charge of the Guards' external operations, was gunned down by two motorcyclists on his way home in Tehran. According to the New York Times, Israel told the United States that it was responsible for the hitjob.&nbsp;</p>

<p>General Hassan Moghadam, responsible for armament programmes, was killed in an explosion at a munitions depot in November 2011 close to Tehran, in an operation blamed on the United States and Israel.</p>

<h3><strong>Iran's nuclear programme</strong></h3>

<p>Israel has also been accused of carrying out targeted assassinations against several high-ranking Iranian physicists, often linked to Tehran's nuclear programme.</p>

<p>Among them are nuclear physicist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, killed in November 2020 and presented after his death as a vice minister of defence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Scientist Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan, who was working on the Natanz nuclear site, and Majid Shahriari, the founder of Iran's nuclear society, as well as particle physics professor Massoud Ali Mohammadi were others killed over the years.</p>

<p>Israel has also been accused of sabotaging Iranian nuclear installations, mainly the Natanz complex to the south of Tehran.</p>

<p>On April 11, 2021, the site saw a small explosion, according to Iran's atomic energy agency.</p>

<p>The New York Times reported that Israel played a part in the "strong blast" that apparently took out the internal electric system supplying uranium enrichment centrifuges.</p>

<p>Another "accident" also hit Natanz in July 2020, in what Iran's atomic agency had said was a "sabotage".</p>

<p>In September 2010, a cyberattack using the Stuxnet virus took out the enrichment centrifuges at Natanz.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Iran accused Israel and the United States, while information security experts also pointed the finger at Washington.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Iran's allies</strong></h3>

<p>Iran's allies too have found that Tehran is not always safe shelter.</p>

<p>Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh was killed on July 31 in Iran's capital in an attack blamed on Israel. He was in Tehran to attend the inauguration ceremony of Iran's new president Masoud Pezeshkian.</p>

<h3><strong>Iranian petrol</strong></h3>

<p>In March 2021, the Wall Street Journal, citing US and Middle East officials, reported that Israel had in 2019 targeted at least a dozen vessels travelling to Syria and in most cases, transporting Iranian petrol.</p>

<p>The report said Israel had deployed underwater mines in the assault.</p>

<p>Through 2021, Israel and Iran accused each other of naval sabotages.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The radar antenna reflector for the NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) mission arrived at the spacecraft integration and test facility of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in Bengaluru this week.</p>

<p>After its arrival in Bengaluru on Tuesday aboard a NASA C-130 cargo plane, the reflector was transported to the ISRO Spacecraft Integration and Test Establishment for its further reintegration with the NISAR spacecraft to prepare for testing, NASA said.</p>

<p>The satellite, a collaborative effort between NASA and ISRO to observe the Earth, is scheduled for launch from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Andhra Pradesh's Sriharikota in early 2025. The leading space agencies will be coordinating to determine an official launch readiness date for the same.</p>

<p><strong>Radar Antenna Reflector's Role</strong></p>

<p>The drum-shaped radar antenna reflector, measuring about 39 feet (12 meters) across, is among NASA's contributions to the joint mission. It has been specially designed to help focus the transmitted and received microwave signals to and from the surface of the Earth. This will enable NISAR to scan roughly all of the Earth's land and ice surfaces twice every 12 days to collect scientific data.</p>

<p>This reflector was earlier stationed at the specialised facility in California as engineers applied reflective tape to it, besides taking other precautionary measures to mitigate temperature increases.</p>

<p><strong>NISAR mission</strong></p>

<p>The objectives of the joint NISAR mission are aimed at revolutionising understanding of the planet.</p>

<p>Key observations from NISAR will help researchers worldwide get unprecedented insights into the changes in the Earth's surface, including the ice sheets, sea ice and glaciers.</p>

<p>Additionally, it will monitor changes in the forest and wetland ecosystems, besides tracking the movement and deformation of the crust like landslides, earthquakes as well as volcanic activities.</p>

<p>The rapid coverage from NISAR is aimed at providing multiple opportunities for disaster response. It will produce data to assist in mitigating and assessing the damage, providing observations before and after disasters in short time frames.</p>

<p>For the mission, NASA provided the L-Band SAR payload system, while ISRO supplied the S-Band SAR payload. Both of these SAR systems will help make use of a large size common unfurl able reflector antenna, the Indian Space Agency earlier said.</p>

<p>Besides this, NASA is also providing engineering payloads for the mission.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Archaeologists have disclosed the origin of the famous "holy grail" cup, which was found with 12 human skeletons at the spot in Jordan where the 1989 film Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade was filmed.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Archaeologists have disclosed the origin of the famous “holy grail” cup, which was found with 12 human skeletons at the spot in Jordan where the 1989 film Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade was filmed.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Contrary to popular belief, the chalice is not an ancient vessel for an elixir of immortality. Instead, it is actually a common drinking cup used by the Nabateans, a highly developed civilisation that thrived in the ancient city of Petra thousands of years ago.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“It's a humble jug, not a cup offering the drinker eternal life,” wrote UK archaeologist Claire Isabella Gilmour in <a href="https://theconversation.com/what-12-ancient-skeletons-discovered-in-a-mysterious-tomb-in-petra-could-tell-us-about-the-ancient-city-241850">The Conversation</a>, adding that Nabataean pottery is extremely fine — often only 1.5 mm thick — and is best suited for ceremonial uses or local use.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The ceramic object was excavated in August, alongside the skeletons and various other artefacts. The tomb included well-preserved skeleton bones and artefacts thought to be over 2,000 years old, in contrast to other tombs previously discovered in Petra that were mostly empty.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The findings were spearheaded by Dr. Pearce Paul Creasman, the executive director of the American Center of Research (ACOR), in partnership with Josh Gates from Discovery Channel's ‘Expedition Unknown,' as reported by <a href="https://www.ancient-origins.net/news-history-archaeology/petra-tomb-discovery-0021567">Ancient Origins.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p dir="ltr">Upon the discovery of the so-called “grail,” it was clasped in the hands of one of the 12 skeletons, reminiscent of the chalice that Jesus is believed to have used during the Last Supper.</p>

<p dir="ltr">This ancient tableware is typically very delicate, often measuring only 1.5 mm in thickness, indicating its suitability for ceremonial and local use rather than long-distance transport, unlike its sturdier Roman counterparts.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Adding to the intrigue, the chalice was unearthed in the same location made famous by Steven Spielberg's Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade, with the artefact bearing a striking resemblance to the Spartan-like prop used in the movie.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Despite the similarities, archaeologist Gilmour wrote that this is not a case of art imitating life, noting that the resemblances arise from extensive research into Nabataean pottery conducted by Deborah Fine, a former director of archives at Lucasfilm Ltd.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The discovery of the skeletons, buried in separate sarcophagi, suggests they may have belonged to members of the Nabatean elite.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has appealed to the public to stop donating to the internet 'encyclopaedia' Wikipedia for allegedly letting itself be misused as a platform "controlled by far-Left activists." This is not the first time the Tesla and SpaceX founder has attacked Wikipedia for allegedly running Left narratives.</p>

<p>Mr Musk's latest post on X, the microblogging platform owned by him, referred to a report by the US-based news website Pirate Wires that alleged "a coordinated campaign led by around 40 Wikipedia editors has worked to delegitimize Israel, present radical Islamist groups in a favourable light, and position fringe academic views on the Israel-Palestine conflict as mainstream over past years, intensifying after the October 7 attack."</p>

<p>Mr Musk, who is also a strong supporter of Republican presidential candidate and former US President Donal Trump, in the post on X said, "Wikipedia is controlled by far-Left activists. People should stop donating to them."</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Wikipedia is controlled by far-left activists.<br />
<br />
People should stop donating to them. <a href="https://t.co/Cjq2diadFY">https://t.co/Cjq2diadFY</a></p>
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1849639215199650279?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 25, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>In the report, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/how-wikipedia-s-pro-hamas-editors-hijacked-the-israel-palestine-narrative" rel="nofollow,noindex">Pirate Wires said</a> six weeks after October 7 (Hamas' terror attack on Israel), one of the Wikipedia editors successfully removed the mention of Hamas' 1988 charter, which called for the killing of Jews and the destruction of Israel, from the entry on Hamas.</p>

<p>The group also appeared to attempt to promote the interests of the Iranian government across a number of articles, including deleting huge amounts of documented human rights crimes by [Islamic Republic Party] officials, the US news website that reports at the intersection of technology, politics, and culture said.</p>

<p>In India too, Wikipedia has been accused of being misused by 'super editors' - longtime users who can lock topics on the website to prevent more edits - to run certain narratives.</p>

<p><strong>READ</strong> |&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/ani-wikipedia-defamation-case-if-you-dont-like-india-delhi-high-courts-tough-talk-for-wikipedia-6496462">"If You Don't Like India...": Delhi High Court's Tough Talk For Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>Asian News International (ANI), one of the largest news agencies in South Asia, last month filed a Rs 2 crore defamation case against Wikipedia's parent foundation for allowing certain malicious edits to a page with information about the news agency.</p>

<p>The Delhi High Court then issued contempt notice to Wikipedia over withholding information about edits to an entry on ANI, after the news agency said Wikipedia did not reveal details about three accounts that made the edits. Wikipedia eventually removed the entry over which ANI filed the defamation case.</p>

<p>The Delhi High Court on October 25 raised concerns over Wikipedia's open-edit platform model, with Justice Subramonium Prasad calling it "dangerous" due to its public editing access, legal news website <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.barandbench.com/news/delhi-high-court-flags-wikipedia-model-dangerous" rel="nofollow,noindex">Bar and Bench reported</a>.</p>

<p>Wikipedia has also become a narrative battleground over the Manipur crisis, with allegations that far-Left editors attribute their content only to sources created and influenced directly or indirectly by them. Malicious edits made by 'super editors' and locked by them on Wikipedia are seen as a huge problem.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A robot employed by the Gumi City Council in South Korea went defunct after falling down a flight of stairs. While some have sensationalised the event as ‘robot suicide', experts believe it is more likely a technical malfunction or glitch. The robot was a part of the city hall staff and had been working “diligently” since August 2023, said one of its coworkers. It helped with daily tasks such as document deliveries, providing information to residents and city promotion.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Before the fall, eyewitnesses reported unusual behaviour, with the robot circling in one spot seemingly confused “as if something was there.” The incident occurred on June 27 at approximately 4 pm, with the 'Robot supervisor' found damaged and lying in the stairwell between the first and second floors of the council building.<br />
<br />
The cause of the fall remains under investigation. Officials believe it may have been due to a navigational error, sensor failure or programming bug. A city council official mentioned that the robot's “pieces have been collected and will be analysed by the company.”<br />
<br />
The robot was the first of its kind to have such a role in the city. Developed by Bear Robotics, a California-based startup, it was designed to work autonomously, navigating between floors using the elevator. Unlike other robots, which are typically limited to a single floor, this robot had the ability to move freely, making it a unique asset to the Gumi City Council. The robot worked from 9 am to 6 pm and was even given its own civil service officer card, just like a human employee.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The manufacturer, Bear Robotics, is working with the council to investigate and prevent similar incidents in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
South Korea has consistently demonstrated a strong affinity for robotics, spearheading the global adoption of automation technology. With a remarkable ratio of one industrial robot for every 10 employees, the country boasts the highest robot density in the world, as per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/22/15679 ">reports</a>.<br />
<br />
However, in the wake of the recent robot incident at the Gumi City Council, the municipality has decided to temporarily halt its plans to introduce a second robot officer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-07/qc80ev5g_rishi-sunak_625x300_05_July_24.jpg?im=FitAndFill,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>"To the country, I would like to say first and foremost, I am sorry". Those were <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/i-am-sorry-uk-pm-rishi-sunak-concedes-defeat-in-uk-polls-6037606">Rishi Sunak's words</a> as he left Downing Street for the last time. "I have heard your anger, your disappointment", he declared, "and I take responsibility for this loss."</p>

<p>Sunak was addressing the nation outside Ten Downing Street, with his wife, Akshata Murty, at his side, before heading to the palace to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/uk-general-election-why-rishi-sunak-lost-from-crumbling-nhs-to-economic-crisis-why-rishi-sunak-lost-uk-election-6039983">resign as Britain's Prime Minister</a>. It was a brief and dignified address, tinged with humility and regret. The scale of the election defeat suffered by Rishi Sunak's Conservatives is truly remarkable. The party has lost two-thirds of its seats in Parliament; there will be just over 120 Conservative MPs among the 650 members of the newly elected House of Commons. It's the Conservatives' worst-ever general election result.</p>

<h2><strong>Verdict: Failure</strong></h2>

<p>The final verdict on Rishi Sunak's 20 months in office has to be: failure. He failed to achieve several of the political goals he had publicly set himself; he didn't cut waiting times for hospital treatment or stem illegal immigration. He failed to unite his own party which, after 14 unbroken years in power, was increasingly quarrelsome and faction-ridden. And he failed to persuade the voters that he had a vision for Britain's future.</p>

<p>There were some successes too. Rishi Sunak, a decent man, restored integrity to the post of Prime Minister after the damage inflicted by Boris Johnson's clowning and deceit; he presided over a gradual improvement in the country's economy; and he sorted out some of the lingering mess in the wake of Britain's departure from the European Union.</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/opinion/can-uks-new-pm-keir-starmer-fix-labours-fragile-relations-with-india-6038590">Also Read | UK Elections: Mending India-Labour Relations Won't Be Easy For Starmer</a></strong></p>

<p>But he proved to have poor political instincts. He never gave the impression of being fully in charge, and was battered and buffeted by the rivalries within his own party. His election campaign was spectacularly inept. And his own reputation was tarnished by a bizarre decision to pull out early from global commemorations of the 80th anniversary of D-Day, a proud moment in Britain's history that marked the turning of the tide against Nazi Germany in the Second World War.</p>

<p>At times, Rishi Sunak has faced political vitriol that some would see as racist. The right-winger Nigel Farage - leader of an anti-immigration party, Reform UK, which took millions of votes from the Conservatives - said during the campaign that Sunak's D-Day misjudgement was because "he doesn't understand our history and culture". But Sunak's lasting place in history is that he has been the first person of colour to head Britain's government, and he has demonstrated beyond doubt that race is no longer a barrier to getting to the very top.</p>

<h2><strong>What Changes Under Starmer?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>The Labour Party has achieved a landslide victory with the slogan 'time for change'. Its leader, Keir Starmer - who has now succeeded Sunak as prime minister - will have a huge Parliamentary majority.</p>

<p>But in fact, there is likely to be little immediate change. Starmer has made clear that a Labour government will not increase taxes and there will be no alteration in foreign policy. The only immediate policy reversal is likely to be the abandoning of Sunak's controversial and ill-considered plan to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda in central Africa.</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/pm-modi-congratulates-keir-starmer-for-win-has-a-message-for-rishi-sunak-6039526">Also Read |&nbsp;PM Modi Congratulates Keir Starmer For Win, Has A Message For Rishi Sunak</a></strong></p>

<p>Rishi Sunak has made clear that he will stand down as leader of the Conservative party, but not straight away. He will remain in the post until a successor is chosen. And he emphasised that Conservatives needed to provide a 'professional and effective' opposition to the new Labour government - which will be seen as a warning against the Conservatives lurching to the right in the aftermath of their stinging defeat.</p>

<h2><strong>Sunak, The Ex-Politician?</strong></h2>

<p>Sunak has said he will remain an MP and he has denied suggestions that he's planning to move to California, where the family has a home. But his time at the highest echelons of British politics is almost over. There is rarely any way back for a vanquished prime minister, and Sunak has been so bruised by his time in office that it's unlikely he wants to return to top level politics. At 44, he's young for a former prime minister, he is formidably clever, and he will not find life as a backbench MP very satisfying. So sooner or later, he's likely to depart the political landscape altogether and carve out a new career.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra on Friday announced that Prime Minister Modi will arrive in Moscow on Monday (July 8) afternoon, he said, adding that the PM will then join a private dinner hosted by Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>Addressing a special briefing on PM Modi's visit to Russia and Austria, Kwatra said, PM Modi will pay an official visit to Moscow on July 8-9, at the invitation of the President of the Russian Federation for the 22nd India-Russia Annual Summit."</p>

<p>Further, he also said that after PM Modi and Putin's informal meeting in Uzbekistan's Samarkand in 2022, both leaders have stayed in touch on the phone multiple times.</p>

<p>"The last, that is the 21st, annual summit, you would recall was held in New Delhi in December 2021. The two leaders thereafter met in September 2022 in Samarkand on the margins of the SCO summit in Uzbekistan. They have also stayed in touch with each other through several telephonic conversations through these years," said the Foreign Secretary.</p>

<p>"As of now, the Prime Minister is scheduled to arrive in Moscow in the late afternoon of July 8. President Putin will host a private dinner for the PM on the day of arrival," he added.</p>

<p>While speaking about PM Modi's visit, Mr Kawtra also announced that the next day after his arrival he would engage with the Indian community in Russia, adding that he will also visit to Kremlin.</p>

<p>"The next day, the PM's interactions would include an interface with the indian community in Russia. As part of the programming elements, the PM will also lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Kremlin and thereafter the PM will visit the exhibition venue in Moscow," said Foreign Secretary on PM Modi upcoming Russia visit."</p>

<p>"These engagements will be followed by a restricted level talk between the two leaders, which will then be followed by delegation level talks led by Prime Minister and the Russian President" he added.</p>

<p>The two leaders will review the entire range of multifaceted ties between India and Russia.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden mistakenly referred to himself as "the first Black woman to serve with a Black president" in a recent interview.&nbsp;He momentarily confused himself with Vice President Kamala Harris during the interview with Philadelphia's WURD radio station while acknowledging his time serving as Vice President for former President Barack Obama.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">NEW: President Biden goes on incredibly confusing rant, calls himself the first black woman to serve with a black president.<br />
<br />
He also called himself the “first president that got elected statewide in the state of Delaware, when I was a kid.”<br />
<br />
“By the way, I'm proud to be the, as… <a href="https://t.co/VMNtVe85Pz">pic.twitter.com/VMNtVe85Pz</a></p>
— Collin Rugg (@CollinRugg) <a href="https://twitter.com/CollinRugg/status/1808974408494821730?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 4, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p><br />
He also boasted about appointing the first Black woman to the Supreme Court and selecting the first Black woman as Vice President.</p>

<p>Earlier in the interview, he incorrectly claimed he was the first president elected statewide in Delaware, likely intending to say he was the first Catholic elected statewide, then spoke admiringly of John F Kennedy, another Catholic.</p>

<p>In a 4th of July speech at the White House, the 81-year-old began a story about former President Donald Trump, referring to him as “one of our colleagues, the former president,” before abruptly ending the story with, “probably shouldn't say, at any rate.”</p>

<p>President Biden's verbal missteps continued during his appearance on <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/world-news/joe-biden-says-he-is-first-black-woman-to-serve-with-a-black-president-124070500450_1.html ">The Earl Ingram Show</a>, a program targeting black listeners in Wisconsin. When discussing voting, he made a confusing statement that seemed to reference the Supreme Court's recent decision granting immunity to former President Trump. Biden said, "You need someone, someone who is going to make sure that – the Supreme Court just issued a decision, by the way, that threatens the American principle that we have no kings in America. There's no one above the law."</p>

<p>This incident is the latest in a series of gaffes by the President, particularly after his disastrous performance in the presidential debate, drawing attention and criticism from various quarters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Biden and his top aides have stated that the president's upcoming activities are part of a campaign effort to show voters, donors and activists that his debate performance was merely “a bad night.” Ammar Moussa, a spokesman for Biden's campaign, criticised the news media for throwing light into the president's stumbles.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Keir Starmer on Friday promised that his Labour government will work from day one on national renewal, in his first speech as UK prime minister from Downing Street.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Keir Starmer on Friday swept into Downing Street for the first time as UK prime minister, promising urgent action to restore the country's fortunes.</p>

<p>The Labour party leader oversaw a landslide victory in Thursday's general election, ending 14 years of rule by Rishi Sunak's Conservatives.</p>

<p>"The work of change begins immediately," Starmer told reporters outside Downing Street after accepting head of state King Charles III's request for him to form a government.</p>

<p>"But have no doubt, we will rebuild Britain," he added.</p>

<p>Starmer, a 61-year-old former human rights lawyer and chief state prosecutor, paid tribute to Sunak, who was appointed Tory leader and prime minister in October 2022 after Liz Truss's disastrous tenure.</p>

<p>"His achievement as the first British-Asian prime minister of our country, the extra effort that that will have required, should not be underestimated by anyone," he said.</p>

<p>"We pay tribute to that today. We also recognise the dedication and hard work he brought to his leadership," he added.</p>

<p>Flag-waving Labour supporters lined the approach to Downing Street as Starmer and his wife Victoria arrived from Buckingham Palace, shaking hands with and kissing activists.</p>

<p>Starmer faces a daunting to-do list, noting that Britons had grown tired of crumbling public services, higher prices and empty promises from politicians.</p>

<p>His government, he said, would put "country first, party second", promising to restore "respect for politics", after a succession of scandals under the Tories that eroded public trust.</p>

<p>But he sought to temper high expectations of an immediate transformation. "Changing a country is not like flicking a switch," he said.</p>

<p>"The world is now a more volatile place. This will take a while. But have no doubt that the work of change begins immediately."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Liz Truss, Britain's shortest-serving prime minister, suffered further political ignominy Friday when she sensationally lost her seat in parliament at the British general election.</p>

<p>Truss's defeat came as the constituencies of all her predecessors since the Tories won power in 2010 turned either Labour or Liberal Democrat -- a damning indictment on the Conservatives' 14 years in power.</p>

<p>Truss, who sparked financial turmoil during her 49 chaotic days in charge in 2022, lost her Norfolk South West constituency in eastern England to Labour by 630 votes.</p>

<p>Labour candidate Terry Jermy overturned Truss's massive majority of more than 26,000 which she secured at the last election in 2019 -- a notional 27.85 percent swing.</p>

<p>Her defeat, announced shortly before 7:00 am (0600 GMT) capped a shocking performance for Rishi Sunak's Conservative party as Keir Starmer's Labour opposition won a landslide to return to power after 14 years.</p>

<p>Truss, a member of parliament since 2010, was slow hand-clapped onto the stage after keeping the other candidates waiting for several minutes. She left without making a speech.</p>

<p>But she told the BBC afterwards: "I think the issue we faced as Conservatives is we haven't delivered sufficiently on the policies people want."</p>

<p>Asked if she bore some responsibility, she said: "I agree. I was part of that. That's absolutely true."</p>

<p>Truss -- whose shelf-life as premier was lampooned as shorter than that of an Iceberg lettuce -- said she had "a lot to think about" when asked if she wanted to stay in politics.</p>

<p>Sunak held onto his seat in northern England but the Tories also lost the seats held by Truss's predecessors Boris Johnson, Theresa May, and David Cameron.</p>

<p>Labour took Johnson's previous constituency of Uxbridge and South Ruislip in northwest London while May's ex-seat of Maidenhead, also near the capital, was gained by the smaller Liberal Democrats party.</p>

<p>The Liberal Democrats also won Cameron's old seat of Witney in Oxfordshire.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Here are the five biggest takeaways from a dramatic night.</p>

<h3><strong>Labour landslide, but not historic&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Labour won 412 seats in the 650-seat parliament with only three seats left to declare, guaranteeing the centre-left party a whopping majority after 14 years in opposition.</p>

<p>Keir Starmer, a 61-year-old former lawyer, will become prime minister after steering his party from one of its worst-ever performances in 2019 to victory.</p>

<p>His party capitalised on voter anger at the outgoing Tories, particularly in the so-called "red wall" -- post-industrial areas that traditionally voted Labour, but which switched Conservative in 2019.</p>

<p>However, contrary to polling throughout the campaign, Labour's landslide will be less spectacular than that won by Tony Blair in 1997 (418 seats) and the party, paradoxically, looks set to win fewer votes than it did in 2019's nadir election.</p>

<p>In fact, Labour's vote share of around 34 percent will be the lowest ever to secure a majority, highlighting the fracturing of the opposition and the quirks of the UK's electoral system.</p>

<p>Starmer will also face former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in the next parliament, who the incoming prime minister blocked from standing as a Labour candidate for his handling of accusations of anti-Semitism within the party.</p>

<p>The veteran left-winger stood as an independent and won, and threatens to be a thorn in the side of Starmer's government.</p>

<h3><strong>Hard-right breakthrough&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The anti-immigration Reform UK, led by Brexit talisman Nigel Farage, fired a shot across the bows of the establishment by winning more than four million votes, the third-highest vote share of any party.</p>

<p>The party outperformed the Conservatives in many constituencies and performed strongly in "red wall" areas, but only ended up with four seats due to the first-past-the-post voting system.</p>

<p>Farage, 60, was elected for the first time in the constituency of Clacton-on-Sea, southeast England, and promised the result would be "just the first step of something that is going to stun all of you".</p>

<h3><strong>Conservative catastrophe&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>"Massacre, catastrophe, Waterloo..." There was no shortage of words to describe the depths of the defeat for the Tories, who won a landslide only five years ago but looked set to be reduced to around 120 seats.</p>

<p>A record nine senior ministers from the outgoing government lost, although several other big names narrowly saved their seats, including finance minister Jeremy Hunt and party chairman Richard Holden, who won by 20 votes.</p>

<p>A final humiliation arrived in the early morning when former prime minister Liz Truss, whose 49-day rule in 2022 ended when the markets turned against her radical tax-slashing plans, lost her seat.</p>

<p>Next will come the brutal post-mortem, as the party decides how it will rebuild and whether it tacks to the right or centre.</p>

<h3><strong>Scottish nationalists in crisis&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The Scottish nationalists suffered a terrible evening, with former first minister and independence figurehead Nicola Sturgeon admitting that "it's not a good night" for the Scottish National Party (SNP).</p>

<p>The party has dominated Scottish politics for 15 years but has now ceded control to Labour and been relegated from third to fourth place in Westminster after returning just nine MPs, compared to 48 at the last election.</p>

<p>It is still under investigation over its financing and now has no clear strategy to win independence from the UK, a dream that seemed revived after the Brexit vote.</p>

<h3><strong>Lib Dem comeback&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The return of the pro-EU Lib Dems as the third largest party and a major force in Westminster is one of the election's more unlikely stories following its dismal showing in 2019.</p>

<p>Winning more than 70 seats, the party enjoyed its best-ever result, eclipsing its success in the early 2000s that led it to form a coalition government with the Conservatives between 2010 and 2015.</p>

<p>The party also benefited from the rejection of the Conservatives by more liberal and centrist voters, who were turned off by its rightward drift following the Brexit vote.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A record number of around 26 Indian-origin members of Parliament have been elected to the House of Commons in the UK's general election as results were announced on Friday, with several Conservatives surviving an overall brutal outcome for their party.</p>

<p>Outgoing prime minister Rishi Sunak leads the Tory charge of British Indians holding on to their seats, with a decisive win in his Richmond and Northallerton constituency in Yorkshire. It would have come as small consolation for the Tory leader, who saw his party haemorrhage over 200 seats as the Labour Party's landslide victory unfolded.</p>

<p>"On this difficult night, I would like to express my gratitude to the people of the Richmond and Northallerton constituency for your continued support. Since I moved here a decade ago, you have made me and my family feel so at home and I look forward to serving you for years to come," said Sunak, in a message clearly aimed at dismissing pre-election chatter around his future plans as a politician.</p>

<p>Other prominent British Indian Tories holding on to their seats included former home secretaries, Suella Braverman and Priti Patel, as did Sunak's Goan-origin Cabinet ally Claire Coutinho. Gagan Mohindra held on to his South West Hertfordshire seat for the Conservatives, with Shivani Raja registering a gain for the party in the keenly watched constituency of Leicester East where she was contesting against fellow Indian-origin Labour candidate Rajesh Agrawal. They had both canvassed around the topic of saving the city's famous Diwali lights from being switched off over council budget cuts, as did former MP Keith Vaz who was contesting as an Independent this time.</p>

<p>Among the big losses on the Tory side included Shailesh Vara, who narrowly lost his North West Cambridgeshire seat to Labour, and first-timer Ameet Jogia, who also lost the Tory-held Hendon seat in London to Labour.</p>

<p>Reflective of the overall election results tally, it was the Labour Party that saw the maximum number of winning Indian diaspora candidates, starting with party veterans such as Seema Malhotra – who held on to her Feltham and Heston constituency with a comfortable margin. Goan-origin Valerie Vaz, sister of Keith Vaz, won in Walsall and Bloxwich, as did Lisa Nandy with a big margin in Wigan.</p>

<p>British Sikh MPs Preet Kaur Gill, who defeated Tory first-timer Ashvir Sangha, and Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi both won back their seats for Labour in Birmingham Edgbaston and Slough respectively. Navendu Mishra (Stockport) and Nadia Whittome (Nottingham East) were among the other Labour MPs re-elected with convincing majorities.</p>

<p>It was among the newcomers that British Indians made a big mark for the Labour Party, with Jas Athwal (Ilford South), Baggy Shanker (Derby South), Satvir Kaur (Southampton Test), Harpreet Uppal (Huddersfield), Warinder Juss (Wolverhampton West), Gurinder Josan (Smethwick), Kanishka Narayan (Vale of Glamorgan), Sonia Kumar (Dudley), Sureena Brackenbridge (Wolverhampton North East), Kirith Entwistle (Bolton North East), Jeevun Sandher (Loughborough) and Sojan Joseph (Ashford) among those set to take their seats in Parliament next week.</p>

<p>For the Liberal Democrats, who had a good election all round gaining over 60 seats, Munira Wilson won back her Twickenham constituency.</p>

<p>One of the seats on the Labour watch list was Islington North, where suspended former party leader Jeremy Corbyn contested as an Independent to defeat his British Indian Labour challenger Praful Nargund.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After the successful implementation of the Unified Payments Interface or UPI for online ticket booking at Eiffel Tower, NPCI International Payments Limited (NIPL) today enabled the acceptance of UPI at Galeries Lafayette's flagship store in Haussmann, ahead of Paris Olympics.</p>

<p>This is in partnership with Lyra, a French leader in securing e-commerce and proximity payments.</p>

<p>Starting July 26, the Paris Olympics is expected to draw a large number of Indian visitors. According to Jawed Ashraf, Ambassador of India to France and Monaco, this will pave the way for the wide acceptance of UPI in France and support its internationalisation as a means of digital payments.</p>

<p>"Our collaboration with Galeries Lafayette in Paris not only enables UPI payments at a prestigious venue but also boosts UPI adoption as a convenient and secure cross-border payment method for Indian tourists," Ritesh Shukla, CEO of NPCI International, said.</p>

<p>As per NPCI, this partnership will benefit a multitude of Indian tourists visiting Paris every year, allowing them to use UPI at the Galeries Lafayette flagship store.</p>

<p>"Lyra is happy to have enabled for the first time in Europe the in-store acceptance of UPI in the iconic Department stores Galeries Lafayette Haussmann in Paris," said Christophe Mariette, Chairman of Lyra India.</p>

<p>NPCI also mentioned that this initiative aims to broaden UPI's market presence in France and Europe, driving further growth and adoption as a secure payment solution.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vangelia Pandeva Gushterova, also known as Baba Vanga, was a blind Bulgarian mystic who died in 1996 at the age of 85. Even after her death, people all across the world are still fascinated by her prophecies. Called the 'Nostradamus of the Balkans,' Baba Vanga claimed that she lost her sight at the age of twelve and then developed the gift of prophecy.</p>

<p>One of her most prominent forecasts, according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.marca.com/en/lifestyle/world-news/2024/07/03/668524b446163fc7398b45b3.html"><em>Marca.com</em></a>, was the September 11, 2001, attack on the Twin Towers in New York.</p>

<p>"Two metal birds will crash into our American brothers, wolves will howl from the bushes, and the blood of the innocent will flow in the rivers," she predicted, a message eerily similar to the tragic events that unfolded.</p>

<p>Among her many prophecies, one stands out: the date of the end of the world. According to Baba Vanga, the world will end in the year 5079 due to a cosmic event of "unimaginable" proportions.</p>

<p><strong>Here are Baba Vanga's Key Predictions for the Coming Decades:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>2025: </strong>A major conflict in Europe will lead to a significant reduction in the continent's population.</li>
	<li><strong>2028: </strong>Humanity will reach Venus in an attempt to find new sources of energy.</li>
	<li><strong>2033:</strong> The melting of the polar ice caps will cause a significant rise in sea levels.</li>
	<li><strong>2076: </strong>Communism will return globally.</li>
	<li><strong>2130: </strong>Contact with extraterrestrial civilisations.</li>
	<li><strong>2170: </strong>A global drought.</li>
	<li><strong>3005: </strong>A War on Mars.</li>
	<li><strong>3797: </strong>Destruction of the Earth, with humanity capable of moving to another planet within the solar system.</li>
	<li><strong>5079: </strong>The end of the world.</li>
</ul>

       <description><![CDATA[Why did Labour thump the Conservatives? The crumbling NHS, or National Health Service, state of the economy, and attendant concerns like price rise, were all high on the list of reasons for the defeat.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Out with the old, and in with the new (sort of), UK voters said Friday, handing <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/rishi-sunak" target="_blank">Rishi Sunak</a>'s Conservatives a thumping defeat in the general election, stripping it off nearly 250 seats in the 650-seat House of Commons. And Sir <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/topic/keir-starmer" target="_blank">Keir Starmer</a>'s Labour has been handed the keys to the castle.</p>

<p>Mr Starmer and his 'new' Labour will now form the next government. Addressing a cheering crowd of party faithfuls at a dawn victory rally in central London, he declared <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/uk-gets-its-future-back-labours-keir-starmer-in-victory-speech-6037737" target="_blank">the UK "gets its future back"</a>.</p>

<p>The scale of the Tories defeat is singular; in power for 14 years, the party was routed in Wales and Scotland, and saw some of its biggest leaders, including ex-Prime Minister Liz Truss, beaten.</p>

<h3><strong>Labour's Landslide</strong></h3>

<p>But perhaps the most chastening blow - the BBC is reporting the Conservatives have lost seats, in the shire counties of England, that they have held since the early 20th century. For example, Labour's Joe Morris beat the Tory's Guy Opperman to end the Tory's 100-year hold on the Hexham seat.</p>

<p>The Conservatives are set for one of their worst ever returns in a general election, and Labour, with over 400 seats, its best. Exit polls had predicted just such a scenario, giving Mr Starmer 405 seats.</p>

<h3><strong>Conservatives' Collapse</strong></h3>

<p>Rishi Sunak, the outgoing PM, called for an early election in May.</p>

<p>The warning signs were present then; indeed, they had been present for several weeks, if not months, prior, as UK voters battled a cost-of-living crisis, a growing immigration problem, and poor infrastructure and healthcare, among other issues, and the Tories a serious image problem.</p>

<p><strong>READ |&nbsp;</strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/uk-election-results-live-rishi-sunak-braces-for-huge-loss-as-early-results-herald-labour-keir-starmer-win-6037190" target="_blank">Labour Sweeps UK Polls, Rishi Sunak's Part's First Loss Since 2010</a></p>

<p>At that point the Conservatives - asking the British public for permission to install a sixth Prime Minister since 2010 - were already 20 points behind a rejuvenated Labour, but Mr Sunak seemed to believe he could close and overhaul the gap. Unfortunately, this did not happen.</p>

<h3><strong>Why Labour Beat Conservative?</strong></h3>

<p>Take your pick. But the crumbling NHS, or National Health Service, and the state of the economy, and attendant concerns like price rise, are high on the list of reasons for the defeat.</p>

<p>A poll by IPSOS Issues Index in June said concerns over slashing of funding for the NHS - a free public healthcare scheme that any other country would love to have - was top of the list, followed by the economy, immigration, price rise, housing and schools, defence and anti-terrorism, and crime.</p>

<p>Mr Sunak scored poorly on all these points, including overseeing the country's lowest growth rate since the early 19th century and a steep cost-of-living increase, the highest in 41 years.</p>

<p>The <strong>British economy</strong> has slowed significantly over the past decade, even accounting for the global crisis triggered by the Covid pandemic. GDP per capita grew just 4.3 per cent from 2007 to 2023.</p>

<p>In the previous 16 years that figure was a massive 46 per cent.</p>

<p>This meant incomes stagnated.</p>

<p>A report by the nonpartisan Centres for Cities research institute indicated Britons, on average, had <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/6/26/10200-how-much-worse-off-britons-are-after-14-years-of-tory-rule" target="_blank">£10,200 less to save or spend</a> between 2010 and 2022, compared to 1998-2010 growth rates.</p>

<p>And&nbsp;the UK's national debt - £2.7 trillion - is higher than at any point since the 1960s.</p>

<p>There did seem to be some relief soon; in May the International Monetary Fund spoke of a "soft landing" for the economy, and upgraded the growth forecast by 0.2 percentage points to 0.7.</p>

<p>And it was, perhaps, on the back of that expectation Mr Sunak called for the early election.</p>

<p>The <strong>NHS</strong> is seen by many to be the crown in the British government's public services.</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">Funding for the UK's national free healthcare scheme, the NHS, has been a key issue (File).</p>
</div>

<p>The Conservatives had repeatedly stressed the importance of the NHS, but that concern seemed not to translate into on-ground support for doctors, nurses, and medical professionals.</p>

<p>Budgetary allocations under the Tories paint a clear picture. Since they came to power in 2010 healthcare spending has grown by an average of 2.8 per cent per year, compared to 3.6 per cent in the past 50. This includes the period of the pandemic.</p>

<p>In April there were an estimated 7.6 million people waiting for treatment under the NHS scheme, of which over 50,000 had been on the list for more than a year. The median wait time was 14 weeks.</p>

<p>The number of people waiting for medical aid, including those with serious conditions, has tripled under Conservative rule, according to data from the NHS published by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/4/uk-general-election-2024-key-issues-by-the-numbers" target="_blank">Al Jazeera</a>.</p>

<p>Brexit had its say too, with movement restrictions meaning medical professionals from mainland Europe could either not be hired or chose not to sign up. As horrible as this sounds, this was good news for India, with the NHS turning to its former colony to fill over 2,000 doctors' posts.</p>

<p><strong>Immigration</strong> was also an issue. Mr Sunak's government had promised to crack down on illegal entrants into the UK, but its Rwanda policy - supposed to act as a major deterrent - failed to deliver.</p>

<p>In fact, two years after its announcement not one plane has taken off for the African nation.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://news.sky.com/story/general-election-labour-and-conservative-immigration-policies-explained-13146912" target="_blank">Sky News</a>, the Conservatives have spent over £300 million on this scheme, which they said would deter illegal immigrants entering the UK on small boats across the English Channel.</p>

<p>Under this policy, those caught would be sent to Rwanda while they apply for asylum.</p>

<p>As of March-end a total of 1.18 lakh people are waiting for an initial decision on their application.</p>

<p>The rising <strong>cost of living</strong> and skyrocketing <strong>house prices</strong>, as well as steep <strong>increases in rental prices</strong>, have also been a problem the Conservatives seemed not to be able to control.</p>

<h3><strong>Truss, Johnson's Contributions</strong></h3>

<p>It wasn't just Mr Sunak's failures that led to the Conservatives' downfall.</p>

<p>Boris Johnson was elected as the Tories' leader and the PM in July 2019, shortly before the pandemic struck. His dishevelled appearance and chaotic leadership precipitated a revolt by his ministers and, of course, the 'Partygate' scandal that referred to parties at 10, Downing Street during a lockdown.</p>

<p>Mr Johnson resigned in June last year following an investigation that he called a "witch hunt".</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">The Conservatives' last three Prime Ministers - Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss, and Boris Johnson (File).</p>

<p>He was followed by Ms Truss - the UK's fourth female PM and its shortest-serving leader.</p>

<p>Ms Truss - who lost her South West Norfolk seat - faced criticism for the way it handled the economy, including a controversial mini-budget that led to market turmoil. Her leadership was further undermined by U-turns on policy and a loss of confidence among MPs.</p>

<h3><strong>What Now For Labour?</strong></h3>

<p>Mr Starmer's leadership has been pivotal in Labour's revival.</p>

<p>Since taking up the role in early 2020, he has repositioned the party to the centre, and fixed problems within the party that include in-fighting and anti-Semitism.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Looking forward, he will want to avoid repeats of the Tories' mistakes, including&nbsp;October 2022, when Ms Truss' government proposed unfunded tax cuts that spooked markets and tanked the pound.</p>

<p>That ill-advised move cost her her job.</p>

<p>"We did it. Thank you truly... you have changed our country," Mr Starmer told triumphant supporters at a victory rally in central London.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rishi Sunak on Friday apologised to the public after his Conservatives were trounced by Labour in the UK general election, and said he would step down as party leader.</p>

<p>The 44-year-old former financier gambled on going to the country six months before he had to, hoping that better economic data would swing public support back towards the Tories.</p>

<p>But Thursday's vote indicated that Britons wanted to send a clear message to the party by kicking them out of power after 14 years of economic hardships, Brexit upheaval and Tory infighting.</p>

<p>"To the country, I would like to say first and foremost, I am sorry," he said outside the Prime Minister's residence at Downing Street, before heading to Buckingham Palace to tender his resignation as prime minister to King Charles III.</p>

<p>"I have given this job my all, but you have sent a clear signal that the government of the United Kingdom must change. And yours is the only judgement that matters."</p>

<p>"I have heard your anger, your disappointment, and I take responsibility for this loss."</p>

<p>The scale of the defeat made it inevitable that Sunak -- the conservative party's fifth leader since 2010 -- would have to step down as Tory head as well.</p>

<p>But he said that he would stay on in the role until the arrangements were made for an internal leadership contest, which is expected to be a fight for the ideological soul of the party.</p>

<p>Sunak saw a record number of his top ministerial team lose their seats, including defence secretary Grant Shapps and House of Commons leader Penny Mordaunt.</p>

<p>His immediate predecessor as prime minister, Liz Truss, also lost her seat.</p>

<p>Sunak -- an observant Hindu who is Britain's first prime minister of colour -- wished his successor Keir Starmer well, calling him "a decent, public-spirited man who I respect".</p>

<p>"One of the most remarkable things about Britain is just how unremarkable it is that two generations after my grandparents came here with little, I could become prime minister," he added.</p>

<p>"And that I could watch my two young daughters light Diwali candles on the steps in Downing Street. We must hold true to that idea of who we are."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Larry the Cat, Chief Mouser of 10 Downing Street, has shared his thoughts on the recent UK election results.&nbsp;The beloved feline posted a picture of himself standing at a miniature podium, complete with a tiny microphone as if delivering a speech. Larry's caption poked fun at the election outcome, saying, "The people have spoken and what they've said is mainly swear words aimed at the Tories."<br />
<br />
The post was a purr-fect jab at the Conservative Party's defeat in the general election.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">"The people have spoken and what they've said is mainly swear words aimed at the Tories"<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GeneralElection2024?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GeneralElection2024</a> <a href="https://t.co/jHR2iaGKML">pic.twitter.com/jHR2iaGKML</a></p>
— Larry the Cat (@Number10cat) <a href="https://twitter.com/Number10cat/status/1809092277354086895?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 5, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The UK's Labour Party, led by Keir Starmer, <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/uk-general-election-results-2024-live-keir-starmer-labour-party-tipped-for-historic-sweep-rishi-sunak-conservatives-6034921 ">secured a decisive victory</a> with most seats in the House of Commons and ending 14 years of Conservative rule. Rishi Sunak, the outgoing Prime Minister, conceded defeat as several cabinet members lost their seats.<br />
<br />
Larry is a brown-and-white tabby cat rescued from the Battersea Dogs and Cats Home. PM David Cameron and his wife chose him as a pet for their children.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Throughout the political turmoil of the past 14 years, Larry has remained a constant presence in Downing Street, serving under five Conservative prime ministers since 2011. The cat has since completed 13 years in the Parliament home.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Last year, <a href="http:// https://x.com/Number10cat/status/1625773929942904834?lang=en ">Larry celebrated his 12 years</a>, saying how he was appointed Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office “12 years ago” and boasted about outlasting “four Prime Ministers and have been in charge here longer than Thatcher, Blair, Churchill and Disraeli.”<br />
<br />
With the current change in government, Larry will soon welcome his first Labour prime minister, Keir Starmer. The departure of Rishi Sunak also means Larry will bid farewell to Nova, the fox-red labrador retriever.<br />
<br />
Earlier, Rishi Sunak's wife Akshata Murty revealed the behind-the-scenes dynamics of <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/larry-the-cat-or-nova-the-dog-akshata-murty-on-power-struggle-at-10-downing-street-4422196 ">Downing Street's furry residents</a>. “Nova has mixed emotions about (living here) because she sometimes doesn't get on with Larry the Cat. And they've had some heated exchanges and Larry's come out on top," she said.<br />
<br />
In November 2022, Larry voiced his displeasure <a href="https://x.com/Number10cat/status/1587323660817375232 ">on X</a> when Rishi Sunak's family moved in with Nova, saying, "ANOTHER dog?! Bring back Liz Truss..."<br />
<br />
This wasn't the first time Larry had had a problem with canine companions in Downing Street. In 2019, when Boris Johnson's Jack Russell Cross, Dilyn, joined the household, Larry <a href="https://x.com/Number10cat/status/1168478009692708864 ">tweeted</a>, "Confirmation that Downing Street is going to the dogs...."&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[According to The Verge, the feature discovered in the WhatsApp Beta for Android version 2.24.14.7 harnesses a combination of user-provided images, text prompts, and Meta's AI Llama model to generate these custom avatars.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WhatsApp is in the process of developing a new feature that will enable users to create personalised AI avatars of themselves, capable of being placed in various virtual settings.</p>

<p>According to The Verge, the feature discovered in the WhatsApp Beta for Android version 2.24.14.7 harnesses a combination of user-provided images, text prompts, and Meta's AI Llama model to generate these custom avatars.</p>

<p>According to the screenshots captured by The Verge, users will have the ability to envision themselves "in any setting, from the forest to outer space."</p>

<p>The generated images are reportedly reminiscent of those produced by popular AI generators like Lensa AI or Snapchat's "Dreams" selfie feature.</p>

<p>To generate these personalised avatars, WhatsApp users will initially need to submit photographs of themselves, which will serve as reference images for Meta AI.</p>

<p>Subsequently, users can create their avatars by typing commands such as "Imagine me" followed by a description of the desired setting in Meta AI chat or by using "@Meta AI imagine me..." in other WhatsApp conversations.</p>

<p>This feature is expected to be optional and will require users to manually enable it in WhatsApp settings.</p>

<p>Furthermore, users will have the flexibility to delete the reference images stored in Meta AI settings at any time, ensuring privacy and control over personal data.</p>

<p>Despite its innovative potential, there is no specific timeline for the general availability of this new AI avatar feature. WhatsApp continues to roll out support for its Meta AI chatbot and real-time AI image generation capabilities, particularly in the United States.</p>

<p>Therefore, the launch of the AI avatar feature may be subject to gradual deployment as WhatsApp and Meta navigate the complexities associated with generative AI tools, according to The Verge.</p>

<p>Given previous challenges with generative AI technologies, Meta appears to be adopting a cautious approach to ensure the functionality and security of this upcoming feature.</p>

<p>As development progresses, WhatsApp users can anticipate a new dimension of personalisation and creativity in their messaging experience, facilitated by advanced AI capabilities.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Elections in both the United Kingdom and France reflected voter discontent. While France has seen a rise in the far-right National Rally (RN) party, the UK has witnessed a resurgence by the Labour Party.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the recent elections in France, a surprise dissolution of parliament triggered by President Emmanuel Macron saw a dramatic rise of the far-right National Rally (RN) party, while in the United Kingdom, the Labour Party won by an unprecedented margin and ended 14 years of Conservative rule. Both elections revealed voter discontent in the two countries.</p>

<h3><strong>The Rise Of The Far-Right In France</strong></h3>

<p>On June 30, the first leg of the French elections took place. An attempt to halt the momentum of the resurgent RN, however, saw Mr Macron's decision to dissolve parliament spectacularly backfire. RN, led by Marine Le Pen won the highest vote share, polling 33 per cent, the left-wing New Popular Front (NFP) garnering 28 per cent and Mr Macron's centrist bloc could manage only 20.7 per cent in votes tally. This result set the stage for the second round of polling to be held on July 7.</p>

<p>Mr Macron's suspension of parliament was meant to solidify a clear majority for his administration after getting heavily beaten during the European Parliament parliament. However, it was meant to unify opposition against the RN, but it seems it has emboldened the far-right instead. The polls correctly predicted that the RN would lead, and Macron's approval ratings collapsed to 36 per cent, as indicated by polls.</p>

<h3><strong>The Revival Of Labour In UK</strong></h3>

<p>Across the Channel, the UK saw its own political earthquake. On Friday, Keir Starmer's Labour Party surmounted the odds and registered a historic win, ending Rishi Sunak's Conservative Party's 14-year rule. The election results reflect widespread dissatisfaction with the Tory government, particularly in the wake of Liz Truss's short-lived and disastrous tenure and Mr Sunak's leadership in its aftermath.</p>

<p>Ms Truss's brief premiership of only 49 days, which was marked by unfunded tax cuts upsetting the markets damaged the reputation of the Conservative Party. Mr Sunak's attempts to steady the ship were insufficient to regain public trust.</p>

<p>Mr Starmer's leadership has been pivotal in Labour's revival. Since taking up the role in early 2020, he has repositioned the party to the centre, and fixed problems within the party that include in-fighting and anti-Semitism. Opinion polls consistently showed Labour significantly ahead of the Tories, which reflected the public mood that was in favour of change.</p>

<h3><strong>Mainstreaming The Far-Right</strong></h3>

<p>RN's rise cannot be attributed solely to the mistakes of Mr Macron. Ms Le Pen's deliberate efforts to soften the party's image have been instrumental. Since inheriting leadership from her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, in 2011, she has worked to shed the party's extreme-right reputation. The 2018 rebranding from the National Front to the National Rally marked a significant step in this transformation. In a decisive move to break from the past, Ms Le Pen expelled her father from the party in 2015 following his repetition of a contentious Holocaust remark.</p>

<p>Still, the party did not shake off its xenophobic rhetoric. Jordan Bardella, the party's would-be prime minister, has vowed to bar dual nationals from several state jobs.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Reflections For Conservative Party</strong></h3>

<p>The electoral result, the worst for the Tories since 1906, brought home deep differences among the party ranks. party leaders such as Suella Braverman and Penny Mordaunt have criticised the failure of the party to connect with voters.</p>

<p>"I want to briefly address the results around the country, and there's only one thing I can say... sorry. I'm sorry. The Great British people voted for us over 14 years and we did not keep our promises... we acted like we were entitled to your votes," Ms Braverman said as quoted by the BBC. "I'm sorry my party didn't listen to you."</p>

<p>There is also uncertainty in which direction the Tories will take in the future, with calls for a more coherent policy to gain back the trust of the voters.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Chinese tech companies, from industry giants to ambitious startups, converged at the World AI Conference in Shanghai this week to showcase their latest innovations and express strong support for the country's artificial intelligence sector.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chinese tech companies, from industry giants to ambitious startups, converged at the World AI Conference in Shanghai this week to showcase their latest innovations and express strong support for the country's artificial intelligence sector even as it faces U.S. sanctions.</p>

<p>More than 150 AI-related products and solutions are being exhibited at the conference, with a small number of foreign firms such as Tesla and Qualcomm joining the predominantly Chinese line-up, according to the event organizer.</p>

<p>The conference has also served as a launchpad for some companies to introduce their latest AI products.</p>

<p>One notable example is SenseTime, which previously focused on facial recognition technology but recently shifted its attention to generative AI following the release of ChatGPT by OpenAI in late 2022.</p>

<p>On Friday, the company unveiled its SenseNova 5.5, its most advanced large language model (LLM), which is being touted as a rival to OpenAI's GPT-4o in areas such as mathematical reasoning.</p>

<p>Despite challenges posed by U.S. sanctions that limit access to advanced chips, many executives at the conference expressed confidence that Chinese companies will continue to thrive in the AI sector.</p>

<p>Zhang Ping'an, the executive in charge of Huawei's cloud computing unit, told a forum that the idea that a shortage of the most advanced artificial intelligence chips will hinder China's aim to be a leader in AI needs to be "abandoned".</p>

<p>"Nobody will deny that we are facing limited computing power in China," Zhang said. "If we believe that not having the most advanced AI chips means we will be unable to lead in AI, then we need to abandon this viewpoint."</p>

<p>To address the lack of access to cutting-edge chips, Zhang called for more innovation in areas such as cloud computing.</p>

<p>This was echoed by Liu Qingfeng, chairman of AI company Iflytek, which, like Huawei, has been placed on a sanctions list that bars it from purchasing advanced chips from U.S. companies.</p>

<p>On the WeChat account of state-owned China News Service, Liu said in an interview many of the LLMs developed by Chinese companies, including Iflytek's, have been able to rival OpenAI's GPT-4.</p>

<p>"We must have our own LLMs that are independently developed and controlled by China, capable of benchmarking against the highest global standards and continuously narrowing the gap," he said.</p>

<p>Some executives, including the CEO of Chinese search engine giant Baidu, Robin Li, have urged the AI industry to shift its focus away from the development of LLMs, which require massive amounts of computing power and AI chips, and instead prioritize the adoption of AI.</p>

<p>"Without applications, having only foundational models, whether open-source or closed-source, is worthless," Li said at the conference.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The elections in the UK saw Labour registering a landslide victory and ending the Tories' 14-year grip on power. Keir Starmer will replace Rishi Sunak as the Prime Minister after Labour won 410 of the 650 seats in the House of Commons, the most since Tony Blair's 1997 landslide. The election will reshape the political landscape in the UK, with task cut out for the incoming Prime Minister. But how much will Mr Starmer be paid for the epic job?</p>

<p>According to UK Parliament, the Prime Minister is entitled to an annual salary of 172,153 pounds. His earnings are made up of 80,807 pounds for the role of Prime Minister, and an additional 91,346 pounds (<a href="https://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/members/pay-mps/">revised on April 1, 2024</a>) for being an MP.</p>

<p>However, out of the total amount, 75,440 pounds is actually claimed. As per the House of Commons website, MPs pay the same tax and national insurance as any other employed person across the country.</p>

<p>The job of a PM has never been astronomically well-paid compared with other professions of similar responsibility. According to an old by <em>BBC News</em> report, previous prime ministers have previously found themselves drowning in debt and requiring a bail-out from the monarchy.</p>

<p>A report in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/uk-prime-minister-salary-rishi-sunak-b2342294.html"><em>The Independent</em></a> said that there has been a significant fall in the standard of living for UK Prime Ministers over the centuries. In the 18th century, William Pitt received 10,500 pounds per annum as first lord of the Treasury. The Marquess of Salisbury, incumbent PM at the turn of the 20th century, was on 5,000 pounds per annum - or a half a million pounds according today's exchange rates.</p>

<p>By 1937, the prime minister's annual pay was the equivalent of a modern 600,000 pounds.</p>

<p>The Public Duty Costs Allowance (PDCA), which was established following the resignation of Margaret Thatcher, allows former Prime Ministers to claim up to 115,000 pounds annually for the "necessary office costs and secretarial costs arising from their special position in public life". These costs can be claimed for life.</p>]]></content:encoded>

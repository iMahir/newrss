       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's campaign said Saturday it had been hacked, blaming "foreign sources" for distributing internal communications and a dossier on running mate J.D. Vance.</p>

<p>Trump's campaign implied Iran was behind the move as news outlet Politico reported it had received emails with the campaign material from a source who refused to identify themselves.</p>

<p>"These documents were obtained illegally from foreign sources hostile to the United States, intended to interfere with the 2024 election and sow chaos throughout our Democratic process," Donald&nbsp;Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement.</p>

<p>Steven Cheung cited a report from Microsoft this week that said Iranian hackers "sent a spear phishing email in June to a high-ranking official on a presidential campaign."</p>

<p>The materials received by Politico included research on vetting Vance, Donald&nbsp;Trump's vice presidential pick.</p>

<p>In 2016, a hack of Democratic National Committee emails -- blamed on Russians -- exposed internal party communications, including about candidate Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>Donald&nbsp;Trump, who would go on to win the election, was criticized for encouraging the hack.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Volodymyr Zelensky acknowledged for the first time on Saturday that Ukrainian forces were fighting in Russia's Kursk region and said the operation was part of Kyiv's drive to restore justice after Russia's 2022 invasion.</p>

<p>Russia said Ukrainian forces pushed into Kursk region last Tuesday and Russian military bloggers have acknowledged they made some headway, while saying the situation had since stabilised.</p>

<p>Zelensky had previously stayed silent about the operation.</p>

<p>In his nightly video address, the president said he had discussed the operation with top Ukrainian commander Oleksandr Syrskyi, while not forgetting the battles troops face on the difficult eastern front.</p>

<p>"Today, I received several reports from commander-in-chief Syrskyi regarding the front lines and our actions to push the war onto the aggressor's territory," he said.</p>

<p>"I am grateful to every unit of the defence forces for ensuring that. Ukraine is proving that it can indeed restore justice and ensure the necessary pressure on the aggressor."</p>

<p>Zelensky had previously alluded to the operation, praising the military's ability "to surprise" and thanking them for taking Russian soldiers prisoner to be used in future negotiations, specifically referring to the past week.</p>

<p>In paying tribute to Ukrainian forces along the 1,000-km (600-mile) front line, Zelensky made special mention of actions in northern Sumy region, across the border from Russia's Kursk region.</p>

<p>Russia has stepped up its attacks of guided bombs and other aerial strikes in Sumy, prompting mass evacuations.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon's Iran-back Hezbollah group said it launched on Saturday explosive-laden drones at a north Israel army base following the killing of a Hamas commander in south Lebanon a day earlier.</p>

<p>Hezbollah fighters launched "squadrons of explosive-laden drones" at the Michve Alon base near the Galilee town of Safed "in response to the attack and assassination carried out by the Israeli enemy in the city of Sidon" on Friday, the group said in a statement.</p>

<p>Hezbollah's media office said it was "the first time" the group had targeted that base.</p>

<p>On Friday, an Israeli strike on a vehicle in the south Lebanon city of Sidon killed a Hamas commander, the Palestinian group and the Israeli military said.</p>

<p>Hamas said in a statement that Samer al-Hajj was killed "in a Zionist strike in the city of Sidon".</p>

<p>The Israeli military said that its aircraft struck the Sidon area and "eliminated" Hajj, whom it identified as "a senior commander" for Hamas in Lebanon.</p>

<p>It was the first strike of its kind in Sidon since Hamas launched its October 7 attack on Israel, triggering war in Gaza and prompting its Lebanese ally Hezbollah to begin trading near-daily cross-border fire with the Israeli army in a bid to tie down its troops.</p>

<p>Ten months of cross-border violence has killed some 562 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters but also including at least 116 civilians, according to the AFP tally.</p>

<p>On the Israeli side, including in the annexed Golan Heights, 22 soldiers and 26 civilians have been killed, according to army figures.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brazilian emergency crews on Saturday recovered the remains of the 62 victims aboard an airliner that plunged to the ground in the town of Vinhedo, near Sao Paulo the day before, killing all on board.</p>

<p>The bodies of most of the victims - 34 males and 28 females - had already been moved to Sao Paulo's police morgue for identification. The bodies of the pilot and co-pilot were identified earlier in the day, said Dario Pacheco, mayor of Vinhedo.</p>

<p>Four people with dual citizenship were among the victims, three Venezuelans and one Portuguese woman, said regional carrier Voepass, which operated the aircraft.</p>

<p>The Venezuelans were a 4-year-old boy, his mother and grandmother, local outlet Globo News reported. The boy's dog was also on the flight, which the family was taking to later head to Colombia, according to the outlet.</p>

<p>On Friday Voepass said the plane was carrying 57 passengers and four crew, but on Saturday the firm confirmed another unaccounted-for passenger had been on the flight, putting the number of casualties at 62.</p>

<p>Authorities are using seat assignments, physical characteristics, documents and belongings such as cell phones to identify the victims, firefighter Maycon Cristo said at the crash site earlier on Saturday as the bodies were being pulled from the wreckage.</p>

<p>Relatives of the victims were brought to Sao Paulo to provide DNA samples to aid in identification of the remains, said state civil defense coordinator Henguel Pereira.</p>

<p>The plane's so-called "black box" containing voice recordings and flight data was undergoing analysis, said Marcelo Moreno, the head of Brazilian aviation accident investigation center Cenipa, at a press conference in Vinhedo.</p>

<p>The plane, an ATR-72 turboprop, was bound for Sao Paulo from Cascavel, in the state of Parana, and crashed around 1:30 p.m. (1630 GMT) in Vinhedo, some 80 km (50 miles) northwest of Sao Paulo. Despite coming down in a residential area, no one on the ground was hurt.</p>

<p>The aircraft was flying normally until 1:21 p.m., when it stopped responding to calls, and radar contact was lost at 1:22 p.m., Brazil's air force said in a statement.</p>

<p>Pilots did not report an emergency or adverse weather conditions, the air force added.</p>

<p>Franco-Italian ATR, jointly owned by Airbus and Leonardo, is the dominant producer of regional turboprop planes seating 40 to 70 people. ATR told Reuters on Friday that its specialists were "fully engaged" with the investigation into the crash.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's military said at least 19 Palestinian operatives were killed Saturday in a pre-dawn strike on a school compound in Gaza City, where rescuers reported 93 dead.</p>

<p>"It can be confirmed at this time that at least 19 Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists were eliminated" in the strike on Al-Tabieen religious school, the military said in a statement.</p>

<p>It cited "an intelligence investigation" and giving the names of the alleged operatives it said had been killed.</p>

<p>It said the operatives had been operating from a Hamas command and control centre located in the compound in order to plan attacks against Israel and its security forces.</p>

<p>"The strike was carried out using three precise munitions," it said, adding that "no severe damage was caused to the compound where the terrorists were situated".</p>

<p>In another statement later Saturday, the military said: "There is a high probability that... Ashraf Juda was at the military headquarters at the Al-Tabieen school that was targeted."</p>

<p>Juda is a top operative of Islamic Jihad, the military said.</p>

<p>"It is not yet clear whether he was hit during the strike."</p>

<p>Rescue workers in Gaza have said the strike killed 93 people, including women and children. The attack has sparked international condemnation despite Israel's claims it was targetting operatives.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Turkey began unblocking Instagram Saturday evening after depriving access to millions of users for nine days.</p>

<p>"Following our negotiations with representatives of Instagram, we will unblock access starting from 9:30 pm (1830 GMT) after they agreed to respond to our demands," transport and infrastructure minister Abdulkadir Uraloglu said on X.</p>

<p>Instagram access began to progressively return after that time, AFP reporters noted.</p>

<p>"Since the beginning, we have wanted social media platforms to respect the laws of the Republic," Uraloglu insisted.</p>

<p>The platform had been blocked since the morning of August 2 for reasons that were never fully explained.</p>

<p>Saturday evening the minister mentioned "violations linked to content", adding that Instagram had refused to delete thousands of posts involving "gambling, drugs and abuse of children".</p>

<p>Meta, the owner of Instagram, denied not cooperating, saying it had withdrawn almost 2,500 posts in the first half of the year at the request of Turkish authorities.</p>

<p>President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's communications director, Fahrettin Altun, accused Instagram of blocking messages of condolence for Ismael Haniyeh, political leader of the Palestinian group Hamas and a close ally of Erdogan's.</p>

<p>Haniyeh was killed in Tehran last month in an attack blamed on Israel.</p>

<p>Between 60 and 70 percent of Turkey's 85 million inhabitants have an Instagram account, and about $57 million of business is carried out on the site each day, according to Emre Ekmekci, vice-president of an e-commerce association.</p>

<p>Access to the online game Roblox, particularly popular in Turkey, remained blocked for a fourth day Saturday evening.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Bangladesh's interim leader Muhammad Yunus on Saturday condemned attacks on the minority communities in the violence-hit nation, terming them as "heinous", and urged the youth to protect all Hindu, Christian, and Buddhist families from harm.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh's interim leader Muhammad Yunus on Saturday condemned attacks on the minority communities in the violence-hit nation, terming them as "heinous", and urged the youth to protect all Hindu, Christian, and Buddhist families from harm.</p>

<p>Members of minority communities in Bangladesh faced at least 205 incidents of attacks in 52 districts since the fall of the Sheikh Hasina-led government on August 5, according to two Hindu organisations -- Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council and the Bangladesh Puja Udjapan Parishad -- in the country.</p>

<p>Thousands of Bangladeshi Hindus have been trying to flee to neighbouring India to escape the violence.</p>

<p>Reaching out to students who are at the forefront of the protests, Yunus, a Nobel laureate, cautioned them not to let their efforts be sabotaged by those seeking to undermine their progress, the Dhaka Tribune newspaper reported.</p>

<p>"There are many standing by to make your efforts futile. Don't fail this time," he said while addressing the students at the Begum Rokeya University in Rangpur city.</p>

<p>Yunus unequivocally condemned the attacks on minority communities in the country, calling the acts "heinous".</p>

<p>He urged the students to protect all Hindu, Christian, and Buddhist families from harm.</p>

<p>“Are they not the people of this country? You have been able to save the country; can't you save some families?...You must say — no one can harm them. They are my brothers; we fought together, and we will stay together,” he asserted, underscoring the need for national unity.</p>

<p>Stressing the importance of youth leadership, Yunus said, "This Bangladesh, is now in your hands. You have the power to take it wherever you want. This isn't a matter of research — it's a power within you.” He also urged the people of Bangladesh to emulate the way student activist Abu Sayed stood valiantly during the anti-government demonstrations that led to the toppling of the Sheikh Hasina government.</p>

<p>Sayed, 25, of Rangpur's Begum Rokeya University, was among the first protesters to be killed in police firing on July 16 during the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement.</p>

<p>Yunus, who was sworn in on Thursday as the head of the interim government, met with Sayed's family members in Rangpur's Pirganj upazila, The Daily Star newspaper reported.</p>

<p>“We have to stand the way Abu Sayed stood...Abu Sayeed's mother is everyone's mother. We have to protect her, protect her sisters, protect her brothers. Everyone has to do it together,” he told reporters after meeting Sayed's family.</p>

<p>Yunus said that the responsibility of building a new Bangladesh is for every Bangladeshi.</p>

<p>“We will remember him (Abu Sayed) through this. Therefore, we should ensure that we do the work (needed),” he said.</p>

<p>“Abu Sayed is no longer a member of just one family. He is the child of all families in Bangladesh. The children who will grow up and attend school and college will know about Abu Sayed and will say to themselves, ‘I too will fight for justice.' Abu Sayed is now in every home,” Yunus said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, thousands of Hindu agitators, including students, blocked the Shahbagh intersection for the second consecutive day on Saturday, protesting attacks on their homes, shops, and temples in various parts of the country, The Daily Star newspaper reported.</p>

<p>They shouted slogans such as "Save the Hindus," "Why are my temples and homes being looted? We want answers," "Hindu persecution in independent Bangladesh, it will not continue," "Religion is for individuals, the state is for everyone," and "Ensure the safety of Hindus".</p>

<p>A number of Hindu temples, households and businesses were vandalised, women assaulted and at least two Hindu leaders affiliated with the Awami League party headed by Hasina were killed in the violence in Bangladesh after she fled the country, according to community leaders in Dhaka.</p>

<p>The protesters warned that if immediate measures are not taken to stop the persecution of Hindus, they will go for continuous protest programmes.</p>

<p>They also demanded the formation of a ministry for minorities, the establishment of a minority protection commission, the enactment and implementation of strict laws to prevent all forms of attacks on minorities, and the allocation of 10 per cent of parliamentary seats for minorities.</p>

<p>In another major development, Bangladesh's Chief Justice Obaidul Hassan and five other top judges on Saturday tendered their resignations, five days after the fall of the Hasina regime amid massive street protests and students marching towards the apex court demanding a revamp of the judiciary.</p>

<p>The 65-year-old top judge revealed his decision around 1 pm after protesters of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement gathered at the apex court premises. The students had issued an ultimatum to him and the judges of the Appellate Division to resign by 1 pm “I feel it is necessary to share a special news with you. Our chief justice resigned a few minutes back. His resignation letter has already reached the law ministry,” law adviser, equivalent to the minister of the newly-installed interim government, Prof Asif Nazrul said in a Facebook video message.</p>

<p>Appellate Division Justice Md Ashfaqul Islam has been appointed as the acting chief justice following Hassan's resignation, Supreme Court's Public Relations Officer Md Shafiqul Islam told the media.</p>

<p>Several other top officials, including Dhaka University Vice-Chancellor Professor Dr Maksud Kamal and Bangla Academy Director General Professor Dr Md Harun-Ur-Rashid Askari, resigned from their posts in the wake of new protests by students and other demonstrators.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris now leads Donald Trump in three crucial battleground states, according to new polls published Saturday, apparently eroding the advantage the former president has enjoyed there over the past year.</p>

<p>The polls of likely voters by The New York Times and Siena College showed Harris leading Trump by an identical 50 percent to 46 per cent margin in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p>

<p>Under the US Electoral College voting system, those three populous Midwestern states are considered key to victory for either party.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The polls are a reversal of surveys in those states which for nearly a year had shown Trump either tied with or slightly leading Democratic President Joe Biden, who dropped out of the race last month and endorsed Harris instead.</p>

<p>Much can change in the nearly three months before the November 5 election. The polling showed voters still prefer Trump on the key issues of the economy and immigration, though Harris had a 24-point advantage when voters were asked whom they trust on the issue of abortion.</p>

<p>Democrats, in any case, have taken heart in the surge of enthusiasm that has greeted Harris's candidacy, with many expressing relief after 81-year-old Biden stepped aside.</p>

<p>Her announcement Tuesday of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate also appears to have energized Democrats.</p>

<p>The Harris-Walz surge helped cut short a rise in support for Trump that followed the July 13 attempt on his life and the Republicans' successful national convention last month.</p>

<p>But Harris has enjoyed an even bigger bump in favorability -- up 10 points among registered voters in Pennsylvania in just a month, the Times/Siena polling found.</p>

<p>Voters said they saw her as more intelligent than Trump and having a better temperament to govern.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French police on Saturday released US star rapper Travis Scott after 36 hours in custody in Paris over suspected violence, a US-based representative for the artist and prosecutors said.</p>

<p>The 33-year-old, who has had multiple nominations for Grammy Awards, was arrested after fighting with one of his own security guards at a five-star hotel in Paris.</p>

<p>"Travis Scott has been released with no charges," the representative said.</p>

<p>The Paris prosecutor's office confirmed the "release from custody of Travis Scott today as well as the dropping of the case over the offence being insufficiently established".</p>

<p>Police had been called to the Georges V hotel early on Friday, where they arrested the rapper for "violence against a security agent" who had intervened to separate the artist from his bodyguard, the prosecutor's office had said.</p>

<p>A US representative for Scott had said later that evening that management was in "direct communication with Parisian authorities to swiftly resolve" the matter.</p>

<p>Mr Scott was seen attending the Olympics men's basketball semi-finals on Thursday evening.</p>

<p>The rapper, whose real name is Jacques Bermon Webster II, has had previous brushes with the law in the United States.</p>

<p>The music star was arrested in Miami Beach in June for trespassing and disorderly intoxication. Police said he was involved in a fight on a yacht.</p>

<p>In November 2021, 10 people were killed in a crush at his show at a pop festival in his home city of Houston, Texas.</p>

<p>But he continues to be a prolific songwriter and producer. Scott's "Utopia" was a nominee for Best Rap Album at this year's Grammy Awards. And he has merchandising deals with Nike, video game maker Epic Games and McDonald's fast food chain.</p>

<p>Scott has two children with social media influencer and entrepreneur Kylie Jenner.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>White body bags littered the floor and mourning filled the air after a school housing displaced Palestinians was struck with Israeli missiles Saturday -- a horrific and increasingly common sight in the Gaza war.</p>

<p>Dawn prayers were shattered by the early morning triple air strike from Israeli warplanes, which gutted Al-Tabieen religious school and mosque in Gaza City.</p>

<p>In the hellish aftermath, body parts were strewn around the rubble and charred, bloodied bodies slumped in the wreckage of the two-storey complex.</p>

<p>Grim-faced volunteers piled corpses in blood-stained blankets into an ambulance, as seriously wounded men lay groaning on the ground.</p>

<p>Gaza's civil defence agency said at least 93 people were killed, 17 of them women and children, making it one of the war's deadliest strikes.</p>

<p>Israel's military disputed the death toll, saying the school was targeted with "precision munitions" because it "served as an active Hamas and Islamic Jihad military facility".</p>

<p>Such incidents have become a pattern in recent weeks. According to an AFP tally, at least 14 schools sheltering Gaza's displaced have been hit since July 6, killing more than 280 people.</p>

<p>"Peaceful people -- women, children, and youths -- were performing the Fajr prayer as usual when suddenly a missile hit them," said Abu Wassim, who lives nearby and came to survey the scene.</p>

<p>"They were reduced to remains. Children were torn apart, and women were burned. What can we say or do? What is in our power?"</p>

<p><strong>- 'They were just praying' -</strong></p>

<p>As the sun climbed and mourners gathered, one man stroked the face of a dead child shrouded in a plastic body bag.</p>

<p>"They dropped a missile on them while they were just praying. Fear God, people! Fear God, Arabs!" a woman wailed over the body.</p>

<p>Another man looked lost as he held a small corpse wrapped in a blanket. Nearby, six body bags lay on the ground, three of them children. Tattered Korans were piled on a window ledge.</p>

<p>"We woke up before dawn to the sound of a strike," said Sakr, a resident from the neighbourhood who gave just one name.</p>

<p>"We headed to the site and found body remains of civilians who were peacefully performing prayers. We found bodies of children scattered in the street."</p>

<p>Another man said: "You can't even recognise the bodies, there were scattered remains.</p>

<p>"The ones who were struck are displaced people taking shelter in a school. What's their fault? What have they done wrong?"</p>

<p>Mohammad Al-Mughayyir, director of the supply and equipment department of Gaza's civil defence service, told AFP that six schools in Gaza City had been targeted in the past week alone.</p>

<p>Israeli military spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Nadav Shoshani said that about 20 Hamas and Islamic militants were operating from the Al-Tabieen complex.</p>

<p>"The compound, and the mosque that was struck within it, served as an active Hamas and Islamic Jihad military facility," he posted on X.</p>

<p>Later on Saturday, Gaza civil defence agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal told journalists that the strike "directly targeted" two floors of the school.</p>

<p>The strike hit "the upper floor housing women and children and the ground floor that was used for prayers by the displaced people," he said.</p>

<p>The Gaza war was triggered by Hamas's October 7 attack that resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Palestinian militants seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held in Gaza, including 39 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed at least 39,790 people, according to the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A week of fast-paced developments in Bangladesh, which saw Sheikh Hasina's ouster, widespread violence and the formation of an interim government, has been capped off with the country's chief justice agreeing to step down on Saturday. While it is unclear when elections will be held, what is certain is that the Khaleda Zia-led Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), one of the two big political parties in the country, will be playing a key role in them.</p>

<p>Speaking exclusively to NDTV on Saturday, Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, the general secretary of the BNP, said that the stepping down of the chief justice was brought about by student protests because he was known to be closely associated with Ms Hasina's regime, which "killed many people" in the country.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-08/4l797np_mirza-fakhrul-islam-alamgir_625x300_10_August_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>In the wide-ranging interview, Mr Alamgir said that Ms Zia will lead the BNP in the elections if she is fit enough to do so and that the party would work to improve the India-Bangladesh relationship if it comes to power. He said that the attacks on Hindus in the country were a result of some people trying to take advantage of the situation and stressed that they were not part of any "systematic agenda".</p>

<p>The BNP leader also said he believes that the Bangladesh army will not interfere in the political process going forward and also claimed that no extremist elements were involved in the protests.</p>

<p>Asked about the chief justice stepping down, Mr Alamgir said, "The chief justice is known here as an associate of the former regime, which killed so many people in this country and extraordinary, unprecedented corruption was done during this period... So there was always a demand for his removal. He was not exactly free, fair and neutral and that's why the demand was very high."</p>

<p>"The judiciary in Bangladesh has totally been destroyed. It is an institution but, with the help of the last regime, it was totally politicised," he added.</p>

<p><strong>Election Timeframe?</strong></p>

<p>While Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has taken oath as the head of an interim government and is seen as popular among the movement that led to Ms Hasina being ousted, the question on everyone's mind is when elections will be held again in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>When Mr Alamgir was asked about this and the role 78-year-old Khaleda Zia, who was released from prison this week, would be able to play in the elections, he said, "She's very sick. She's in the hospital. She's suffering from multidisciplinary diseases. Her treatment was not going well in this country and we we requested the judiciary as well as the government several times to send her abroad, but that didn't happen... Doctors say she's not fit to travel right now and we will have to wait for some time before taking her outside the country. If she's physically fit, she will definitely contest the election."</p>

<p>The BNP leader said that while his party is ready for polls at any point, the interim government would need more time to conduct them.</p>

<p>"The entire election machinery has become totally polluted and they are not in a position to hold a free-and-fair election. So they will have to bring some reforms in the election system as well," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Alamgir also rubbished a claim made by Sheikh Hasina's son, Sajeeb Wazed, that the prime minister had not resigned, as well as reports that she was removed at gunpoint.</p>

<p>"The President himself, in the presence of political parties and the army, said she had resigned. There was no coercion or anything... It was a revolution. When the mob of lakhs of people was moving towards Ms Hasina's residence, her security forces and the armed forces told her she had two choices: stay here and be mobbed or leave the country. And, at the last moment, she decided to leave the country,"she said.</p>

<p><strong>Ties With India, Attacks On Minorities</strong></p>

<p>Mr Alamgir emphasised that the India-Bangladesh relationship would continue to be sound and said the BNP would strive to improve it if it came to power.</p>

<p>When the leader was asked about attacks on minorities in the country, including Hindus, Buddhists and Christians, and whether there was a systemic attack, he said, "This is not at all true. When there is a change in our country or any country, especially in third-world countries, there are some people who try to take advantage... In Bangladesh, unfortunately, with every revolution, leaders of the incumbent party are victimised, whether they are Muslims or Hindus. There may be some sporadic attacks (on minorities) but it was not at all a political or systematic agenda. Never," he said, claiming that communal harmony in the country is "superb".</p>

<p><strong>UN Involvement</strong></p>

<p>When the BNP leader was asked whether there would be a vendetta against the supporters of Ms Hasina's Party - the Awami League - or a purge of former army and police officers seen as close to her government, he said that the United Nations has been asked to conduct an investigation.</p>

<p>"If anybody is found guilty of violating human rights, systematic killing of the opposition or enforced disappearances, naturally, their cases will be investigated and they'll be taken to task," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Alamgir also said that he did not believe that there would be any interference from the army in the political process going forward.</p>

<p>"People have confidence in the army that they are the saviours of the country. So I don't think they will do anything which will go against the will of the people," he said.</p>

<p><strong>Extremist Elements?</strong></p>

<p>The violence in the country has died down to a large extent, Mr Alamgir said, and sought to allay fears of extremist elements being involved in the movement against Ms Hasina's rule.</p>

<p>"The Jamaat (Jamaat-e-Islami) is not an extremist political party, but there were other extremist groups in Bangladesh and I don't believe they are in existence now... Extremist elements are not involved (in protests) in any way. Not at all. It is totally (led by) students and most of them are very progressive elements. Some of the people leading the movement are extraordinarily talented. I am certain and I believe that this revolution will definitely succeed," he added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai has revealed that former YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki, who passed away after two years of living with lung cancer, once took him for an ice cream and a walk around campus during his Google interview 20 years ago.</p>

<p>Remembering the days when he joined Google, Mr Pichai said he was so fortunate to have spent so many years working with Susan closely.</p>

<p>"Susan always put others first, both in her values and in the day to day. I'll never forget her kindness to me as a prospective 'Noogler' 20 years ago," Mr Pichai wrote.</p>

<p>He further said: "I was sold - on Google and Susan. She was absolutely loved by her teams. Her time on earth was far too short, but she made every minute count".</p>

<p>Mr Pichai termed Susan's loss as devastating for "all of us who know and love her, for the thousands of Googlers she led over the years, and for millions of people all over the world who looked up to her" as she created incredible things at Google, YouTube and beyond.</p>

<p>Susan was one of Google's earliest employees and had received a 'Google Founders Award' for making AdSense, which helped tremendously in Google's advertising. Her tenure as CEO of YouTube saw the platform's growth into a global powerhouse, impacting millions of content creators and billions of viewers.</p>

<p>Mr Pichai said that Susan's journey, from the garage she rented to Larry Page and Sergey Brin (Google founders) to leading teams across consumer products and building Ads business to becoming the CEO of YouTube, one of the world's most significant platforms, "is inspiring by any measure".</p>

<p>But she didn't stop there. As one of the earliest Googlers -- and the first to take maternity leave -- Susan used her position to build a better workplace for everyone.</p>

<p>In the years that followed, her advocacy around parental leave set a new standard for businesses everywhere. Susan was also deeply passionate about education.</p>

<p>Over the last two years, Susan devoted herself to making the world better through her philanthropy, including supporting research for the disease that ultimately took her life.</p>

<p>"I know that was very meaningful to her and I'm so glad she took the time to do it," said Pichai, adding that let's honour Susan's memory by continuing to build a Google she would be proud of.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korea is launching more balloons believed to be carrying trash southward, South Korea's military said Saturday, the latest in a series of border barrages that have ignited a tit-for-tat propaganda war.</p>

<p>North Korea has sent thousands of trash-filled balloons southward since May, saying they are retaliation for propaganda balloons launched by South Korean activists.</p>

<p>The latest launch comes as relations between the two Koreas are at one of their lowest points in years, with the North recently announcing the deployment of 250 ballistic missile launchers to its southern border.</p>

<p>The nuclear-armed North was "again launching (suspected) trash balloons aimed at the South," Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement late Saturday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It advised the public to refrain from touching the balloons and to report them to authorities.</p>

<p>Last month, balloons launched by Pyongyang hit the South Korean presidential compound in the capital, prompting the government to mobilise chemical response teams to collect them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In response to the balloon barrages, Seoul has resumed propaganda broadcasts along the frontier, suspended a tension-reducing military deal and restarted live-fire drills in some border areas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The isolated North is extremely sensitive about its people's exposure to South Korean pop culture. According to a recent South Korean government report, a man was executed in 2022 for possession of content from the South.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Seoul's military said a suspected North Korean had defected to the South across a de facto maritime border in the Yellow Sea, with some experts suggesting the decision may have been influenced by the South's resumed propaganda broadcasts, which include news reports as well as K-pop content.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Authorities in Japan urged people to avoid hoarding as anxiety over a possible megaquake triggered a spike Saturday in demand for disaster kits and daily necessities.</p>

<p>In its first such advisory, the weather agency said a huge earthquake was more likely in the aftermath of a magnitude 7.1 jolt in the south on Thursday which left 14 people injured.</p>

<p>At a Tokyo supermarket on Saturday, a sign was put up apologising to customers for shortages of certain products it attributed to "quake-related media reports".</p>

<p>"Potential sales restrictions are on the way", the sign said, adding bottled water was already being rationed due to "unstable" procurement.</p>

<p>On Saturday morning the website of Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten showed portable toilets, preserved food and bottled water topping the list of the most sought-after items.</p>

<p>In Tokyo, some residents were ramping up their disaster preparedness.</p>

<p>Bar employee Kokoro Takeuchi said she had ordered bottled water online following Thursday's tremor.</p>

<p>"I'm very worried," the 27-year-old told AFP.</p>

<p>"The bar I work at is underground so if a quake happens all of a sudden, there's a good chance we might not be able to escape. So I've been trying to figure out how best to evacuate," she said.</p>

<p>But others were more resigned to the inevitability of the megaquake.</p>

<p>"I am worried of course, but overthinking about it will get you nowhere", company worker Mika Nakagawa, 34, told AFP.</p>

<p>"If it happens, then that's that," she said.</p>

<p>Some retailers along the Pacific coastline also reported similar disaster-related supplies in high demand, according to local media reports.</p>

<p>The advisory concerns the Nankai Trough "subduction zone" between two tectonic plates in the Pacific Ocean, where massive earthquakes have hit in the past.</p>

<p>- Low risk -</p>

<p>It has been the site of destructive quakes of magnitude eight or nine every century or two, with the central government previously estimating the next big one would strike over the next 30 years roughly with a 70 percent probability.</p>

<p>Experts however emphasise the risk, while elevated, is still low, and the agriculture and fisheries ministry urged people "to refrain from excessively hoarding goods".</p>

<p>A magnitude-5.3 tremor rocked the Kanagawa region near Tokyo Friday, triggering emergency alarms on mobile phones and briefly suspending bullet train operations.</p>

<p>Most seismologists believe the Friday jolt had no direct link to the Nankai Trough megaquake, citing distance.</p>

<p>On social media platform X, spam posts taking advantage of fears over the megaquake are rapidly mushrooming.</p>

<p>Public broadcaster NHK said spam disguised as helpful quake-related tips was being posted every few seconds on X, with links that instead direct users toward porn or e-commerce sites.</p>

<p>Such posts are "making it increasingly difficult for users to reach genuine information about quakes", NHK said.</p>

<p>Sitting on top of four major tectonic plates, the Japanese archipelago of 125 million people sees some 1,500 quakes every year, most of them minor.</p>

<p>On January 1, a 7.6-sized jolt and powerful aftershocks hit the Noto Peninsula on the Sea of Japan coast, killing at least 318 people, toppling buildings and knocking out roads.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Days after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's resignation as Bangladesh Prime Minister, the country's Chief Justice Obaidul Hassan also agreed to vacate his post "in principle".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Days after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's resignation as Bangladesh Prime Minister, the country's Chief Justice Obaidul Hassan also agreed to vacate his post "in principle". The decision came after the protestors gathered outside the court in the capital Dhaka and demanded the resignation of Hassan and the justices of the Appellate Division.</p>

<p>Mr Hassan, appointed last year, was considered loyal to ousted PM Sheikh Hasina, who fled the country on Monday and has since been sheltering in New Delhi.</p>

<p>Mr Hassan will be tendering his resignation after consulting President Mohammed Shahabuddin this evening, Dhaka Tribune reported, adding that Army personnel were stationed in the main and annexe building as well as other areas around the Supreme Court as they urged hundreds of protesters gathered there to maintain peace.</p>

<p>Obaidul Hassan earlier oversaw the much-criticised war crimes tribunal, which ordered the execution of Sheikh Hasina's opponents. His brother was her longtime secretary.</p>

<p>More than 450 people have been killed so far in the student-led protests that started in July against quotas in government jobs before they also started calling for Hasina's resignation.</p>

<p>Post Hasina's sudden resignation, some of the top appointees, including the central bank governor and the national police chief, were forced out of office, AFP reported.</p>

<p><strong>Appeal for unity</strong></p>

<p>Bangladesh's interim leader Muhammad Yunus on Saturday called for religious unity as he embraced the weeping mother of student protestor Abu Sayed. The 25-year-old was among the first ones to be killed in police firing on July 16 during the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement.</p>

<p>"Our responsibility is to build a new Bangladesh," said Yunus, who returned from Europe this week.</p>

<p>The caretaker administration in the country has stated that restoration of law and order is its "priority".</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the police union declared a strike a few days ago, saying its personnel would not return to work until their safety was assured. As per reports, more than half of the country's police stations were reopened by Saturday.</p>

<p><strong>Attack on minorities</strong></p>

<p>The fall of the Sheikh Hasina-led government has triggered both jubilation and acts of vandalism in Bangladesh. Protestors earlier ransacked her official residence in Dhaka, while the statues of her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, were defaced and brought down.</p>

<p>Multiple reports and TV footage have shown vandalism, looting and attacks on the minorities and their place of worship, Reuters reported.</p>

<p>Hindus constitute about 8% of the Muslim-majority Bangladesh, which has a total population of nearly 170 million people. They have largely supported Hasina's Awami League party in polls.</p>

<p>On Friday, the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council wrote to Yunus asking him to protect the minorities, claiming their homes, businesses and temples were being targeted.</p>

<p>Hundreds of Hindus held a protest march on Friday and shouted slogans demanding peace.</p>

<p><strong>How protests started</strong></p>

<p>Nationwide protests in the South Asian country started after the High Court reinstated a quota system that reserved 30 per cent of government jobs for the family members of freedom fighters and veterans from Bangladesh's 1971 War of Independence.</p>

<p>However, this order was later suspended by the Supreme Court. The quota system was scrapped by Sheikh Hasina's government in 2018 following similar student-led protests.</p>

<p><strong>Protestors' demand</strong></p>

<p>The protestors demanded the government scrap the quota system, claiming that it was majorly benefitting only the Awami League.</p>

<p><strong>What is Bangladesh's quota system?</strong></p>

<p>Introduced in 1972, the quota system in the country has since undergone several changes. Before being abolished in 2018, the system back then reserved 56 per cent of seats in government jobs for various groups. However, the majority of these quotas were benefitting the freedom fighters' families.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two prominent Indian-American lawmakers have sought the US' direct intervention to stop the "coordinated attacks" against minority Hindus in Bangladesh, underlining that instability in the region, "fuelled by religious intolerance and violence", is not in the interest of America or its allies.</p>

<p>Members of minority communities in Bangladesh faced at least 205 incidents of attacks in 52 districts since the fall of the Sheikh Hasina-led government on August 5, according to two Hindu organisations -- Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council and the Bangladesh Puja Udjapan Parishad -- in the violence-hit nation.</p>

<p>Thousands of Bangladeshi Hindus have been trying to flee to neighbouring India to escape the violence.</p>

<p>In a letter dated August 9 to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Congressman Shri Thanedar said he is not alone in his stance against the atrocities being committed against Hindus in Bangladesh. Many in the international community, including some from his own district, have condemned the violent actions being committed against minority groups in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>"With Muhammad Yunus stepping up as the interim Prime Minister for Bangladesh, the United States has an obligation to assist this new government, to ensure that violence and civil unrest comes to an end. I urge the Biden administration to grant persecuted Bangladesh Hindus and other religious minorities temporary protected status as refugees," the Congressman from Michigan wrote to Blinken.</p>

<p>Mr Yunus, the 84-year-old Nobel laureate, was sworn in on Thursday as the head of an interim government in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>A number of Hindu temples, households and businesses were vandalised, women assaulted and at least two Hindu leaders affiliated with the Awami League party headed by Hasina were killed in the violence in Bangladesh after she fled the country, according to community leaders in Dhaka.</p>

<p>Mr Thanedar urged Mr Blinken to work closely with Yunus and his government to bring "an end to the coordinated attacks against the Bangladesh Hindus".</p>

<p>He underlined that Mr Yunus has called for an end to the violence and welcomed his willingness to rebuild the country.</p>

<p>"This is a critical time for Bangladesh, and we must do everything we can to support them in their efforts to bring an end to the violent actions and rhetoric being targeted towards Hindus in the country," said the Indian-American lawmaker.</p>

<p>In a letter dated August 8 to Mr Blinken, a copy of which was released to the press on Friday, Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi said credible eyewitness reports of the anti-Hindu attacks in various media reports demonstrate the scale of the attacks.</p>

<p>"I am writing to you regarding the fluid situation in Bangladesh and the rise of coordinated anti-Hindu violence in the wake of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's resignation. Now that Muhammad Yunus has been sworn in as Chief Adviser for the interim government, it is of utmost urgency that the United States engage with his government for both bringing the violence to an end and the perpetrators to justice," Mr Krishnamoorthi wrote.</p>

<p>"Sadly, this is not the first time that anti-government protests in Bangladesh have metastasised into anti-Hindu violence. The anti-Hindu riots in October 2021 left nine people dead amidst the destruction of hundreds of homes, businesses and temples...In 2017, more than 107 Hindus were killed and 37 'disappeared'...following the International Crimes Tribunal conviction of Jamaat-e-Islami leader Delwar Sayeedi for war crimes," he said.</p>

<p>Mr Krishnamoorthi underlined that instability in the region, "fuelled by religious intolerance and violence, is clearly not in the interest of the United States or our allies".</p>

<p>He urged Mr Blinken to engage "directly" with the interim government and exert US influence to help his administration end the violence and "bring those responsible to justice".</p>

<p>Mr Thanedar in his letter noted that political violence in Bangladesh is not a new phenomenon and that the country has experienced many coups and leadership changes since its inception in 1971.</p>

<p>Targeting of its Hindu population is also not new. Hindus only make up eight per cent of Bangladesh's population, exposing this minority to risk of discrimination and violence, the Congressman said.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With its sleek interior and freshly ground coffee, the cafe run by Belarusian exile Sasha Avdevich may at first glance seem like yet another trendy spot in Warsaw.</p>

<p>But the lowered, wheelchair-accessible countertop and a sticker reading: "The barista on shift has a hearing impairment" in Polish, English and Belarusian reveal this is no ordinary business.</p>

<p>Avdevich, himself a wheelchair user, founded the first "Inclusive Barista" coffee shop while still in Belarus and quickly shot to fame as a disability campaigner in the country controlled with an iron fist by strongman President Alexander Lukashenko.</p>

<p>The 40-year-old activist took part in the unprecedented mass protests that swept Belarus after a 2020 election slammed by rights groups as fraudulent.</p>

<p>As Lukashenko brutally cracked down on dissent, Avdevich knew he had to flee.</p>

<p>"A lot of people called me back then and said, 'Sasha, if you don't want to end up in a coffin, leave the country,'" he told AFP.</p>

<p>He recounted the Covid pandemic-era journey that saw him flee to Georgia initially, then travel on to the Canary Islands before applying for international protection in France.</p>

<p>He eventually moved to Poland, now home to tens of thousands of fellow Belarusians, who, like Avdevich, fled the repression.</p>

<p>"There are many migrants with disabilities," Avdevich said.</p>

<h3><strong>Rap battle, speed dating&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>As he settled in Warsaw, Avdevich launched barista training for people in wheelchairs, threw festivals where the trainees brewed coffee from specially adapted carts, and began to draw up plans for his first cafe in Poland.</p>

<p>When he found a commercial space suited to people with disabilities, close to his flat and in the city's increasingly popular Praga district, Avdevich and his business partner decided to give it a shot.</p>

<p>"We had money for three months of rent, and we were like: 'Come on, whatever happens, we'll do it,'" he said.</p>

<p>Opened in April, the cafe hires people with various disabilities as well as migrants, not only from Belarus.</p>

<p>The founders said they want their cafe to be as "international" -- and inclusive -- as possible.</p>

<p>"We recently organised a rap battle, we will organise a speed dating event soon," Avdevich said.</p>

<p>The cafe is also launching an inclusive DJing school.</p>

<p>Avdevich lost the use of his legs when he broke his back in a motorbike accident in 2011.</p>

<p>"There's no surgery for this type of disability... it's not possible to walk again, even if I was Bill Gates," Avdevich laughed.</p>

<p>Shortly after the accident, he said he told himself "OK, I'm alive. What can I do? I have working arms.</p>

<p>"And now we're here, in our coffee shop, making this world better."</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Twin jailbreaks in Bangladesh killed at least 12 inmates and freed hundreds more in the chaotic days after the ouster of autocratic premier Sheikh Hasina, officials told AFP Saturday.</p>

<p>An interim government is struggling to restore law and order with police going on strike after Hasina's sudden resignation and flight abroad after 15 years in power.</p>

<p>This week's prison escapes, both north of the capital Dhaka, are the latest in a series of breakouts during weeks of nationwide unrest leading up to her toppling.</p>

<p>Six convicts were killed at Jamapur Prison on Thursday after prison guards were assaulted by escapees, warden Abu Fatah told AFP.</p>

<p>"They attacked us with iron rods and sharp weapons. They torched my office. Then tried to break out and take all 600 prisoners with them," he said.</p>

<p>"We were forced to open fire. At least six inmates were killed including one who was stabbed to death."</p>

<p>Fatah said guards managed to quell the attack before anyone escaped.</p>

<p>On Tuesday another six prisoners were shot dead during a mass breakout at a high security prison in Kashimpur, just 30 kilometres (20 miles) north of Dhaka, warden Lutfor Rahman told AFP.</p>

<p>Rahman said the inmates used iron tools and rebar rods to attack guards and broke through the jail's main gate, forcing army soldiers and jail guards to open fire.</p>

<p>"At least 203 prisoners also managed to escape," he said.</p>

<p>Kashimpur High-Security Prison hosts some of Bangladesh's most notorious convicts, including Islamist extremists and murderers.</p>

<p>Rahman said none of the high-profile inmates had managed to break out of their cells.</p>

<p>Numerous attempted and successful jailbreaks have taken place across Bangladesh since protests against Hasina's government began last month.</p>

<p>More than 800 prisoners fled a jail in the central district of Narsingdi in July when a mob of thousands attacked the British colonial-era institution and set the warden's office on fire.</p>

<p>On Monday, the day of Hasina's ouster, more than 500 inmates fled a jail in the northern district of Sherpur.</p>

<p>More than 450 people died during weeks of clashes between police and protesters leading up to Hasina's ouster, including dozens of police officers.</p>

<p>Police unions declared a strike on Tuesday and said officers would not resume duty until their safety was assured.</p>

<p>More than half of the country's police stations have since reopened, according to the force.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A drone attack on Rohingya fleeing Myanmar killed many dozens of people, including families with children, several witnesses said, describing survivors wandering between piles of bodies to identify dead and injured relatives.</p>

<p>Four witnesses, activists and a diplomat described drone attacks on Monday that struck down families waiting to cross the border into neighbouring Bangladesh.</p>

<p>A heavily pregnant woman and her 2-year-old daughter were among the victims in the attack, the single deadliest known assault on civilians in Rakhine state during recent weeks of fighting between junta troops and rebels.</p>

<p>Three of the witnesses told Reuters on Friday that the Arakan Army was responsible, allegations the group denied. The militia and Myanmar's military blamed each other. Reuters could not verify how many people had died in the attack or independently determine responsibility.</p>

<p>Videos posted to social media showed piles of bodies strewn across muddy ground, their suitcases and backpacks scattered around them. Three survivors said more than 200 had died while a witness to the aftermath said he had seen at least 70 bodies.</p>

<p>Reuters verified the location of the videos as just outside the coastal Myanmar town of Maungdaw. Reuters was not able to independently confirm the date the videos were filmed.</p>

<p>One witness, 35-year-old Mohammed Eleyas, said his pregnant wife and 2-year-old daughter were wounded in the attack and later died. He was standing with them on the shoreline when drones began attacking the crowds, Eleyas told Reuters from a refugee camp in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>"I heard the deafening sound of shelling multiple times," he said. Eleyas said he lay on the ground to protect himself and when he got up, he saw his wife and daughter critically injured and many of his other relatives dead.</p>

<p>A second witness, Shamsuddin, 28, said he survived with his wife and newborn son. Also speaking from a refugee camp in Bangladesh, he said that after the attack many lay dead and "some people were shouting out from the pain of their injuries".</p>

<p>Boats carrying fleeing Rohingya, members of a mostly Muslim minority who face extreme persecution in Myanmar, also sank in the Naf River that separates the two countries on Monday, killing dozens more, according to two witnesses and Bangladesh media.</p>

<p>Medecins Sans Frontieres said in a statement the aid organisation had treated 39 people who had crossed from Myanmar into Bangladesh since Saturday for violence-related injuries, including mortar shell injuries and gunshot wounds. Patients described seeing people bombed while trying to find boats to cross the river, the statement said.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the United Nations High Commission for Refugees said the agency was "aware of the deaths of refugees from the capsize of two boats in the Bay of Bengal" and it had heard reports of civilian deaths in Maungdaw but that it could not confirm the numbers or circumstances.</p>

<h3><strong>FIGHTING IN THE REGION</strong></h3>

<p>The Rohingya have been long persecuted in Buddhist-majority Myanmar. More than 730,000 of them fled the country in 2017 after a military-led crackdown that the U.N. said was carried out with genocidal intent.</p>

<p>Myanmar has been in turmoil since the military seized power from a democratically elected government in 2021, and mass protests evolved into widespread armed struggle.</p>

<p>Rohingya have been leaving Rakhine for weeks as the Arakan Army, one of many armed groups fighting, has made sweeping gains in the north, home to a large population of Muslims.</p>

<p>Reuters has previously reported that the militia burned down the largest Rohingya town in May, leaving Maungdaw, which is under siege by the rebels, as the last major Rohingya settlement aside from grim displacement camps further south. The group denied the allegations.</p>

<p>Activist groups condemned this week's attacks. A senior Western diplomat said he had confirmed the reports.</p>

<p>"These reports of hundreds of Rohingya killed at the Bangladesh/Myanmar border are, I'm sorry to say, accurate," Bob Rae, Canada's ambassador to the United Nations and a previous special envoy to Myanmar, posted on X on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Myanmar's junta blamed the Arakan Army in a post on its Telegram channel.</p>

<p>The militia denied responsibility. "According to our investigation, family members of terrorists tried to go to Bangladesh from Maungdaw and the junta dropped the bomb because they left without permission," Arakan Army spokesman Khine Thu Kha told Reuters, referring to Muslims who have joined Rohingya armed groups fighting against the Arakan Army.</p>

<h3><strong>TRYING TO GET TO SAFETY</strong></h3>

<p>Reuters was able to confirm the location of the videos seen on social media from the position and shape of the mountain and shoreline, which matched file and satellite imagery of the area.</p>

<p>The fencing featured in one of the videos also matched file imagery of the location. The location of the videos matched the area described by Shamsuddin.</p>

<p>Eleyas described how his wife and daughter died in the aftermath of the attack, and his desperate efforts to find a boat that would take them to Bangladesh.</p>

<p>Before his wife died, "We apologised to each other for any wrongs we may have done in our lives," he said.</p>

<p>Around midnight, he said, he finally found a small boat and managed to cross the border with it.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

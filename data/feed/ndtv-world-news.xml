       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Norwegian traveller managed to board a plane at Munich airport without a ticket two days in a row -- and even flew to Sweden on the second occasion, police said Tuesday.</p>

<p>The 39-year-old sneaked past security at Germany's second-busiest airport for the first time on August 4.</p>

<p>Passengers are supposed to scan boarding passes at an automatic gate but he stood close to another traveller and got through without one, the Bild daily reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He then snuck past airline staff at the gate and boarded the plane.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But the aircraft was fully booked and his deception was discovered as he did not have a seat. The man was handed over to police, who charged him but let him go, the paper said.</p>

<p>Undeterred, the Norwegian returned a day later, used the same technique, and boarded a flight to Sweden that was not fully booked, said police spokesman Sebastian Pinta.</p>

<p>However on arrival in Stockholm, he attracted the attention of airport staff as he wanted to return to Munich immediately, and he was handed over to the police.</p>

<p>Pinta insisted the man did not pose any danger.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He is under investigation for unlawful entry and transport fraud, he added.</p>

<p>Munich airport said it was investigating how the man had bypassed security checks.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Germany has seen an explosion of cases of bluetongue virus this year, authorities said Tuesday as fears increase across Europe about the disease affecting sheep and cattle.</p>

<p>The country has registered 1,885 outbreaks of bluetongue virus serotype 3 (BTV-3) since the start of 2024, according to the Friedrich Loeffler Institute, Germany's top animal disease research centre.</p>

<p>During the whole of 2023, there were just 23 outbreaks.</p>

<p>"There has been a real wave since the beginning of July in farms with susceptible animals," a spokeswoman for the institute told AFP.</p>

<p>New cases are being added every day and the number of outbreaks could exceed 2,000 by as soon as Thursday, the spokeswoman said.</p>

<p>The institute was unable to provide information on mortality rates.</p>

<p>Bluetongue is a non-contagious, insect-borne viral disease that affects ruminants such as cows and sheep but not pigs or horses. It is difficult to control once it takes hold.</p>

<p>It is not a risk to humans, but in animals it causes high fevers, mouth ulcers and swollen heads.</p>

<p>Support for farmers in tackling the disease through vaccinations is patchy in Germany as the responsibility falls to local authorities in the country's 16 states.</p>

<p>The first outbreak of BTV-3 was registered in Germany on October 12, 2023, according to the institute.</p>

<p>Since then, other outbreaks have been concentrated in the west and centre of the country, in North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate, Hesse and Lower Saxony states.</p>

<p>The government has issued an emergency order to temporarily authorise three BTV-3 vaccines, pending official authorisation from the EU.</p>

<p>Since October 2023, cases of bluetongue have also appeared in other countries including the Netherlands and Belgium.</p>

<p>The disease has also recently hit France, causing alarm among farmers.</p>

<p>BTV-3 is particularly deadly for sheep but can also cause a significant drop in milk production in cows, according to the German institute.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korea said on Tuesday it had deployed its first sniffer dog trained to detect bedbugs to prevent a possible infestation as athletes return from the Paris Olympics.</p>

<p>South Korea won 32 medals, including 13 golds, to finish eighth overall in the medal standings, and around 140 of its athletes have returned to Seoul over the past week.</p>

<p>The sniffer dog, named Ceco, was deployed at the main airport in Seoul as part of an initiative between the government and South Korea's largest pest control company, Cesco.</p>

<p>Ceco, a two-year-old beagle, is trained to detect the smell of pheromones unique to bedbugs and can locate the blood-sucking pests within two minutes with an accuracy rate of 95 percent, Cesco said in a statement.</p>

<p>"From August 9 to September 8 -- the day the Paralympics concludes -- bedbug detection dog services will be available at Incheon Airport for those who wish to utilise them," said a spokesperson for the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency.</p>

<p>The initiative also includes bedbug control experts with more than 10 years experience to help search luggage. Aircraft disinfection has also been increased from once a month to once a week, focusing on the Paris-Incheon route.</p>

<p>South Korea had been largely bedbug-free for years but infestations rose as travel rebounded after the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>More than 950 cases were reported between November and February, official statistics show.</p>

<p>Paris struggled with a bedbug outbreak last year, with a surge of reported sightings sending a shudder through France during the summer and autumn and prompting several school closures.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Sheikh Hasina, in first comments after ouster, says those involved in Bangladesh violence should be investigated]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ousted Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in first comments after leaving Dhaka, has sought that rioters in the country be punished. She has also sought justice for the vandalism to the statue of her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who was also the Founding Father of Bangladesh.</p>

<p>In a three-page emotive statement posted on X by her son, Sheikh Hasina reminisced about the family members she lost when her father was assassinated on August 15, 1975. Mujibur Rahman's sons and their wives, his brother's family, close colleagues and associates, were wiped out the same night by the army as part of a coup. &nbsp;</p>

<p>After paying her respects to them, she turned to the present day, saying the dance of destruction across the country in the name of protest, has also led to many deaths -- of "students teachers, police, journalists, social workers, common people, leaders and workers of the Awami League, pedestrians and office workers".</p>

<p>"For those who have lost their loved ones like me, i extend my deepest sympathy. And for those involved in this slaughter, this destruction, I demand that investigations be held and they be caught and given appropriate punishment," read a rough translation of her statement in Bengali.</p>

<p>The protesters had not only targeted her, they had also targeted the house she grew up in, one that was turned into a museum and was visited by many great and powerful from foreign shores.</p>

<p>"That is now dust,,, And the memories we had -- that have been reduced to ashes… with the disrespect shown to Mujibur Rahman, under whose leadership we got our freedom, recognition, self-respect... the blood shed by thousands of freedom fighters has been desecrated... I demand justice for this from my countrymen," she added.</p>

<p>She added that the coming August 15 be marked as a day of mourning, passed in showing respects and praying for martyrs at "Bangabandhu Bhavan".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina, only 28 when Mujibur Rahman was assassinated, remained in exile from 1975 to late 1980s. While in exile, she rose through the ranks to head the party her father founded and dived into politics. In 1996, she steered Awami League to victory in the national election, becoming the first woman Prime Minister of Bangladesh.</p>

<p>The wave of student protests that saw her out of office had started weeks ago over quota in government jobs for the families of freedom fighters. But the government's resistance had turned it into demands for Sheikh Hasina's resignation.</p>

<p>As the violence spiked, the army took action, and Sheikh Hasina had to hand in her resignation under a 45-minute ultimatum.</p>

<p>She is currently in India, the next part of her journey still un-announced. But the 76-year-old intends to go back to Bangladesh whenever the elections are held, her son has said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine said Tuesday it would not hold on to Russian territory captured in its surprise cross-border incursion and offered to stop raids if Moscow agreed a "just peace".</p>

<p>Ukrainian forces entered Russia's Kursk region last Tuesday, taking over two dozen settlements in the biggest attack by a foreign army on Russian soil since World War II. Russia said Tuesday it had fended off new attacks in Kursk.</p>

<p>More than 120,000 people have fled the area and Ukraine's military chief Oleksandr Syrsky said Monday that his troops controlled about 1,000 square kilometres of Russian territory.</p>

<p>At least 800 square kilometres was under Ukrainian control as of Monday, according to an AFP analysis of data from the US-based Institute for the Study of War.</p>

<p>Foreign ministry spokesman Georgiy Tykhy on Tuesday said Kyiv was not interested in "taking over" Russian territory and defended Ukraine's actions as "absolutely legitimate".</p>

<p>"The sooner Russia agrees to restore a just peace... the sooner the raids by the Ukrainian defences forces into Russia will stop," he told reporters.</p>

<p>Ukraine meanwhile said it was imposing movement restrictions in a 20-kilometre zone in Sumy region along the border with Kursk region due to an "increase in the intensity of hostilities" and "sabotage" activities.</p>

<p>Russia's defence ministry said it had "foiled" new Ukrainian attacks in Kursk by "enemy mobile groups in armoured vehicles to break through deep into Russian territory".</p>

<p>Alexander Bortnikov, head of Russia's FSB security service, also said in a statement that Ukraine had carried out the attack "with the support of the collective West".</p>

<p><strong>'I saw a lot of death'</strong></p>

<p>Since launching its invasion in February 2022, Russia has captured territory in southern and eastern Ukraine and subjected Ukrainian cities to missile and drone barrages.</p>

<p>Ukraine's offensive was the biggest cross-border action since the invasion and it caught Russia off guard.</p>

<p>"They didn't protect the border," a Ukrainian serviceman who took part in the offensive and identified himself as Ruzhyk told AFP in Sumy region.</p>

<p>"They only had anti-personnel mines scattered around trees at the side of the road and a few mines that they managed to quickly throw along the highways," he said.</p>

<p>A 27-year-old squad leader, who identified himself as Faraon, was sparing but direct in his description of battles in Kursk.</p>

<p>"I saw a lot of death in the first few days. It was terrifying at first but then we got used to it," he told AFP.</p>

<p>"There have been many deaths," he repeated stood next to a forest road leading to the frontier, without elaborating.</p>

<p>Ukrainian military analyst Mykola Bielieskov told AFP: "Russian complacency prevailed".</p>

<p>"Russia assumed that since it had initiative elsewhere, Ukraine wouldn't dare to do things we've seen," he said, referring to months of Russian advances along the front.</p>

<p>ISW figures also showed that Russian troops had captured 1,360 square kilometres of Ukrainian territory since the start of 2024.</p>

<p><strong>'Sow discord'&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has vowed to "dislodge" Ukrainian troops.</p>

<p>Putin told a televised meeting with officials on Monday that "one of the obvious goals of the enemy is to sow discord" and "destroy the unity and cohesion of Russian society".</p>

<p>Putin also said Ukraine wanted to "improve its negotiating position" for any future talks with Moscow.</p>

<p>Regional governor Alexei Smirnov told the same meeting that Ukrainian forces had entered at least 12 kilometres into the region and the new front was now 40 kilometres wide.</p>

<p>Russia had conceded earlier that Ukrainian forces had penetrated up to 30 kilometres (20 miles) into Russian territory in places.</p>

<p>A Ukrainian security official told AFP, on condition of anonymity, at the weekend, that Ukraine sought to "stretch the positions of the enemy, to inflict maximum losses and to destabilise the situation in Russia as they are unable to protect their own border".</p>

<p>The Ukrainian official said thousands of Ukrainian troops were involved in the operation.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United Auto Workers Union said on Tuesday it has filed federal labour charges against Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk over attempts to threaten and intimidate workers.</p>

<p>The action came after Musk and Trump held a two-hour conversation on social media platform X Monday night, during which the two discussed workers walking off the job to go on strike.</p>

<p>"You're the greatest cutter," Trump said during the conversation. "I mean, I look at what you do. You walk in, you just say: 'You want to quit?' They go on strike - I won't mention the name of the company - but they go on strike. And you say: 'That's okay, you're all gone.'"</p>

<p>Under federal law, workers cannot be fired for going on strike, and threatening to do so is illegal under the National Labor Relations Act, the UAW said in its statement.</p>

<p>The UAW has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris in her bid for U.S. president. She met with union officials and workers last week near Detroit.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A rocket fired from the war-torn Gaza Strip fell in the sea off Israel's Tel Aviv on Tuesday, Israel's army said, as Hamas militants announced their first attack on the city in months.</p>

<p>"A short while ago, a projectile that was identified crossing from the Gaza Strip fell in the maritime space in central Israel," an army statement said, as an AFP journalist reported hearing a boom in the city at the same time.</p>

<p>The army added that "simultaneously, an additional projectile that did not cross into Israeli territory was identified".</p>

<p>Hamas armed wing, the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, said it fired two M90 rockets at Tel Aviv, their first attack on the Israeli commercial hub since May.</p>

<p>"Al-Qassam Brigades bombarded the city of Tel Aviv and its suburbs with two M90 missiles in response to the Zionist massacres against civilians and the deliberate displacement of our people," a statement by the group said.</p>

<p>The attack came with Israel on high alert for an attack by Iran and its proxies following the killings of senior figures from Hamas and Hezbollah, the Lebanese armed group.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United Nations said Tuesday their human rights offices in Sanaa had been taken over by Yemen's Houthi rebels, with the UN's rights chief demanding they leave immediately and return all seized assets.</p>

<p>On August 3, the Iran-backed Houthis sent a delegation to the UN Human Rights Office's premises in Sanaa and forced staff to hand over the keys. They are still in control of the premises, the Geneva-based office said.</p>

<p>"Entering a UN office without permission and seizing documents and property by force are wholly inconsistent with the privileges and immunities of the United Nations," UN rights chief Volker Turk said in a statement.</p>

<p>"This is also a serious attack on the ability of the UN to perform its mandate, including with respect to the promotion and protection of human rights, which my office is there to defend.</p>

<p>"Ansar Allah forces must leave the premises and return all assets and belongings immediately."</p>

<p>The Houthis are engaged in a long-running civil war that has triggered one of the world's worst humanitarian crises. More than half of the population is dependent on aid in the Arabian Peninsula's poorest country.</p>

<p>The rebels seized control of the capital Sanaa in September 2014, prompting a Saudi-led military intervention on behalf of the government the following March.</p>

<p>In June this year, the Houthis detained 13 UN staff, including six employees of the Human Rights Office, plus more than 50 staff from non-governmental organisations, plus an embassy staff member.</p>

<p>The Houthis claimed they had arrested "an American-Israeli spy network" operating under the cover of humanitarian organisations -- allegations emphatically rejected by the UN Human Rights Office.</p>

<p>Two other UN Human Rights staff had already been detained since November 2021 and August 2023 respectively. They are all being held incommunicado.</p>

<p>"I appeal again, with a heavy heart, for their immediate and unconditional release," said Turk.</p>

<p>"It is crucial that the de facto authorities respect the United Nations and its independence, release all detained UN staff immediately, and create conditions in which my office and other UN agencies can continue their critical work for people of Yemen without threats or hinderance."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Africa's top public health body declared what it termed a "public health emergency of continental security" on Tuesday over an outbreak of mpox that spread from the Democratic Republic of Congo to neighbouring countries.</p>

<p>Mpox is transmitted through close contact and causes flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions. Most cases are mild but it can kill.</p>

<p>The outbreak in Congo began with the spread of an endemic strain, known as Clade I. But the new variant, known as Clade Ib, appears to spread more easily through routine close contact, particularly among children.</p>

<p>The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) warned last week that the viral infection's rate of spread was alarming.</p>

<p>It said that over 15,000 mpox cases and 461 deaths were reported on the continent this year so far, representing a 160% increase from the same period last year.</p>

<p>Mpox has been endemic in parts of Africa for decades after it was first detected in human in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1970.</p>

<p>A milder version of the virus spread to over a hundred countries in 2022, largely through sexual contact, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a public health emergency of international concern, its highest level of alert.</p>

<p>The WHO ended the emergency 10 months later, saying the health crisis had come under control.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Starbucks said Tuesday that Brian Niccol, chief executive at Chipotle, would be the coffee chain's new CEO -- just over a year after current boss Laxman Narasimhan took over the role.</p>

<p>Mr Narasimhan steps down as chief executive and as a member of the Starbucks board "with immediate effect," said the company in a statement.</p>

<p>The leadership shifts come as Starbucks pushes to turn around its business, while contending with broad-based sales declines in its most recent financial results.</p>

<p>Starbucks has cited weakening consumer sentiment and difficult market conditions in China as factors in its troubles.</p>

<p>"Brian is a culture carrier who brings a wealth of experience and a proven track record of driving innovation and growth," said Starbucks board chair Mellody Hobson in a statement as the comapny announced the leadership changes.</p>

<p>Niccol has served as Chipotle's CEO since 2018.</p>

<p>In naming him Starbucks' new CEO, the company noted that his work at Chipotle had "driven significant growth and value creation," citing revenue that has nearly doubled and rising profit.</p>

<p>Narasimhan, a veteran of PepsiCo and other consumer brands, had taken over the top spot in 2023 after a period working with longtime Starbucks CEO and interim boss Howard Schultz.</p>

<p>The statement noted that Narasimhan, during his tenure, drove innovation in the brand's supply chains and boosted its store operations.</p>

<p>Niccol will start in his new role on September 9, with Starbucks chief financial officer Rachel Ruggeri serving as interim CEO until then.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gone are the slogans of last week, demanding the "killer dictator" quit: if you ask Bangladesh's youth whether they're hopeful about the future, the writing literally is on the wall.</p>

<p>Students who led the weeks of protests that toppled autocratic premier Sheikh Hasina are back on the streets to give the capital Dhaka a makeover.</p>

<p>They are whitewashing walls to clear politically charged graffiti accusing her of murder and demanding her resignation at the height of this month's unrest.</p>

<p>In their place, they are daubing elaborate and colourful murals hinting at widespread faith among Bangladeshis of a better tomorrow.</p>

<p>"We want to reform our Bangladesh," Abir Hossain, 21, said as he and half a dozen classmates decorating a kerbside wall with the image of a bird flying out of its cage.</p>

<p>"We're feeling proud," he told AFP. "The bird is now free. We're independent now."</p>

<p>Students in paint-smeared shirts chatted and laughed with friends as they renovated the visual landscape of Shabagh, a leafy central neighbourhood that hosts the elite Dhaka University.</p>

<p>Colourful murals exhorted the public to "destroy the iron doors of prison" and celebrated Bangladesh's "rebirth".</p>

<p>"When the protests started, there were a lot of negative things written here," Fiyaz Hossain, 21, told AFP.</p>

<p>"We are erasing them... so people younger than us don't say them," he added.</p>

<p>"We're writing other things that they can say in the future."</p>

<p><strong>'Shoot me in the chest'</strong></p>

<p>Graffiti denouncing "Killer Hasina" proliferated on walls around Dhaka as the protests against her 15-rule intensified, and it is disappearing just as quickly.</p>

<p>"We want to deliver a message to the public that we have liberated this country from a dictator, and now we have to work together," Nafisa Sara, 19, told AFP during a quick break from the paintbrush.</p>

<p>"The people will see that if the students and all of us work together, we can build the country," she added.</p>

<p>But the impromptu public works project also shows that rancour towards the former leader remains widespread.</p>

<p>More than 450 people were killed in the unrest that ended last week when Hasina abruptly resigned and fled to India.</p>

<p>One of the murals depicts Abu Sayeed, a student shot dead in the northern city of Rangpur, the first student killed in a police crackdown on protests.</p>

<p>Footage of Sayeed's last moments has been shown repeatedly on Bangladeshi television since Hasina's departure breathed new life into a repressed media landscape.</p>

<p>The painting shows an image that has now been etched onto the national consciousness: the 25-year-old stretching his arms out wide in a defiant confrontation with riot police.</p>

<p>It is captioned with his reported last words: "Shoot me in the chest".</p>

<p>A Dhaka court on Tuesday ruled that a criminal investigation for murder could proceed against Hasina, two of her senior lieutenants and four police officers for a separate police killing during the unrest.</p>

<p>The caretaker government that took office after her departure has yet to comment on whether it supports the case, or whether Hasina should return from exile to face some form of justice.</p>

<p>Student groups have in recent days held rallies to demand just that.</p>

<p>"She must be brought back to the country," said Mohiuddin Rony, 25, "and she must face trial".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japan's unprecedented megaquake advisory has prompted thousands of hotel cancellations in areas flagged as high-risk, dealing businesses a heavy blow in what would have been one of the busiest seasons, hoteliers said Tuesday.</p>

<p>The weather agency said last week a huge earthquake was more likely in the aftermath of a magnitude 7.1 jolt in the south on Thursday, which left at least 15 people injured.</p>

<p>The advisory, the first of its kind, doesn't mean a colossal tremor is imminent, but that the risk of such an event has now been elevated, if still low, authorities have said.</p>

<p>Subject to the warning is the so-called "Nankai Trough" 800-kilometre (500-mile) undersea zone that runs from Shizuoka, west of Tokyo, to the southern tip of Kyushu island.</p>

<p>In western Kochi, among the regions projected to be hit hardest, at least 9,400 people have cancelled their hotel bookings since the alert was issued last week, according to a local hotel union.</p>

<p>The cancellations covering the period August 9 to 18, amount to a loss of around 140 million yen ($948,000) in revenue, Susumu Nishitani, a union representative told AFP.</p>

<p>The warning coincided with Japan's annual "obon" holiday, a busy season for tourism businesses when many Japanese visit their hometowns and pay respects to ancestors.</p>

<p>"Normally all hotels and inns in our city would be fully booked at this time of the year", Nishitani said.</p>

<p>Thousands more cancellations are expected in the neighbouring Matsuyama city's Dogo Onsen, one of the hot springs believed to have inspired animation studio Ghibli's globally acclaimed film "Spirited Away", public broadcaster NHK said.</p>

<p>The megaquake advisory is set to be lifted on Thursday this week if no abnormalities in seismic activity are detected, local media have reported.</p>

<p>"It is our slight hope that new reservations will start trickling in once the warning is lifted," Nishitani said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Only a ceasefire deal in Gaza stemming from hoped-for talks this week would hold Iran back from direct retaliation against Israel for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on its soil, three senior Iranian officials said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Only a ceasefire deal in Gaza stemming from hoped-for talks this week would hold Iran back from direct retaliation against Israel for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on its soil, three senior Iranian officials said.</p>

<p>Iran has vowed a severe response to Haniyeh's killing, which took place as he visited Tehran late last month and which it blamed on Israel. Israel has neither confirmed or denied its involvement. The US Navy has deployed warships and a submarine to the Middle East to bolster Israeli defenses.</p>

<p>One of the sources, a senior Iranian security official, said Iran, along with allies such as Hezbollah, would launch a direct attack if the Gaza talks fail or it perceives Israel is dragging out negotiations. The sources did not say how long Iran would allow for talks to progress before responding.</p>

<p>With an increased risk of a broader Middle East war after the killings of Haniyeh and Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr, Iran has been involved in intense dialogue with Western countries and the United States in recent days on ways to calibrate retaliation, said the sources, who all spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.</p>

<p>In comments published on Tuesday, the US ambassador to Turkey confirmed Washington was asking allies to help convince Iran to de-escalate tensions. Three regional government sources described conversations with Tehran to avoid escalation ahead of the Gaza ceasefire talks, due to begin on Thursday in either Egypt or Qatar.</p>

<p>"We hope our response will be timed and executed in a way that does not harm a potential ceasefire," Iran's mission to the UN said on Friday in a statement. Iran's foreign ministry on Tuesday said calls to exercise restraint "contradict principles of international law."</p>

<p>Iran's foreign ministry and its Revolutionary Guards Corps did not immediately respond to questions for this story. The Israeli Prime Minister's Office and the US State Department did not respond to questions.</p>

<p>"Something could happen as soon as this week by Iran and its proxies... That is a US assessment as well as an Israel assessment," White House spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Monday.</p>

<p>"If something does happen this week, the timing of it could certainly well have an impact on these talks we want to do on Thursday," he added. At the weekend, Hamas cast doubt on whether talks would go ahead. Israel and Hamas have held several rounds of talks in recent months without agreeing a final ceasefire.</p>

<p>In Israel, many observers believe a response is imminent after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Iran would "harshly punish" Israel for the strike in Tehran.</p>

<p>Iran's regional policy is set by the elite Revolutionary Guards, who answer only to Khamenei, the country's top authority. Iran's relatively moderate new president Masoud Pezeshkian has repeatedly reaffirmed Iran's anti-Israel stance and its support for resistance movements across the region since taking office last month.</p>

<p>Meir Litva, a senior researcher at Tel Aviv University's Alliance Center for Iranian Studies, said he thought Iran would put its needs before helping its ally Hamas but that Iran also wanted to avoid a full-scale war.</p>

<p>"The Iranians never subordinated their strategy and policies to the needs of their proxies or protégées," Litva said. "An attack is likely and almost inevitable but I don't know the scale and the timing."</p>

<p>Iran-based analyst Saeed Laylaz said the Islamic Republic's leaders were now keen to work towards a ceasefire in Gaza, "to obtain incentives, avoid an all-out war and strengthen its position in the region."</p>

<p>Laylaz said Iran had not previously been involved in the Gaza peace process but was now ready to play "a key role."</p>

<p>Iran, two of the sources said, was considering sending a representative to the ceasefire talks, in what would be a first since the war started in Gaza.</p>

<p>The representative would not directly attend the meetings but would engage in behind-the-scenes discussions "to maintain a line of diplomatic communication" with the United States while negotiations proceed. Officials in Washington, Qatar and Egypt did not immediately respond to questions about whether Iran would play an indirect role in talks.</p>

<p>Two senior sources close to Lebanon's Hezbollah said Tehran would give the negotiations a chance but would not give up its intentions to retaliate.</p>

<p>A ceasefire in Gaza would give Iran cover for a smaller "symbolic" response, one of the sources said.</p>

<p>Israel launched its assault on Gaza after Hamas fighters entered southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and capturing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Since then, nearly 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli offensive in Gaza, according to the health ministry.</p>

<p><strong>APRIL MISSILES</strong></p>

<p>Iran has not publicly indicated what would be the target of an eventual response to the Haniyeh assassination.</p>

<p>On April 13, two weeks after two Iranian generals were killed in a strike on Tehran's embassy in Syria, Iran unleashed a barrage of hundreds of drones, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles towards Israel, damaging two airbases. Almost all of the weapons were shot down before they reached their targets.</p>

<p>"Iran wants its response to be much more effective than the April 13 attack," said Farzin Nadimi, senior fellow with the Washington Institute for Near East policy."</p>

<p>Nadimi said such a response would require "a lot of preparation and coordination" especially if it involved Iran's network of allied armed groups opposing Israel and the United States across the Middle East, with Hezbollah the senior member of the so-called "Axis of Resistance," that along with Iraqi militias and Yemen's Houthis have harried Israel since Oct. 7.</p>

<p>Two of the Iranian sources said Iran would support Hezbollah and other allies if they launched their own responses to the killing of Haniyeh and Hezbollah's top military commander, Fuad Shukr, who died in a strike in Beirut the day before Haniyeh was killed in Tehran.</p>

<p>The sources did not specify what form such support could take.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The US said on Monday that it expected peace talks slated for Thursday to go ahead as planned, and that a ceasefire agreement was still possible. Axios reported that US Secretary of State Antony Blinken planned to set off on Tuesday for discussions in Qatar, Egypt and Israel.</p>

<p>The Israeli government said it would send a delegation to Thursday's talks, but Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that ran Gaza before the war, requested a workable plan to implement a proposal it has already accepted rather than more talks.</p>

<p>A Hamas official told Reuters that a CNN report saying the group planned to attend on Thursday was wrong.</p>

<p>"Our statement the other day was clear: what is needed is the implementation, not more negotiation," said the official, who declined to be named owing to the sensitivity of the issue.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Israeli airstrikes killed 19 Palestinians in the central and southern Gaza Strip on Tuesday, medics said.</p>

<p>One strike killed six people in Deir Al-Balah, including a mother and her twin four-day-old babies, while seven other Palestinians were killed in a strike on a house in the nearby Al-Bureij camp.</p>

<p>Four people were killed in two separate strikes on the Al-Maghazi camp in the central Gaza Strip and Rafah in the south, and two were killed in a strike on a house in the Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood of Gaza City in the north, medics said.</p>

<p>The Israeli military and the armed wings of Islamic Jihad and Hamas said they were fighting in several areas, 10 months into a war in which almost 40,000 Palestinians have been killed, including many commanders and fighters.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said it had killed Palestinian gunmen and dismantled military structures in Khan Younis, located weapons and explosives in Rafah, and struck rocket launchers and sniper posts in central Gaza.</p>

<p>A ceasefire deal would aim to end fighting in Gaza and ensure the release of Israeli hostages held in the enclave in return for many Palestinians jailed by Israel.</p>

<p>Hamas wants a deal to end the war while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says it can only end when Hamas is eradicated.</p>

<p>In Deir Al-Balah, one of the most overcrowded places in Gaza with hundreds of thousands of displaced, many were desperate for a truce.</p>

<p>"Enough, we are no longer able to tolerate the war, the starvation and the frequent displacement," said Ghada, a mother of six who two days ago had to leave her tent in Khan Younis under new Israeli evacuation orders.</p>

<p>"I hope this time they will reach a ceasefire. If they don't, I don't know how much longer we can survive," she told Reuters via a chat app.</p>

<p>A Hamas-led attack on Israeli communities around the Gaza Strip on Oct. 7 killed some 1,200 people, with more than 250 taken into captivity in Gaza, according to Israeli tallies, in one of the most devastating blows against Israel in its history.</p>

<p>In response, Israeli forces have razed much of Gaza, displaced most of the population, and killed around 40,000 people, according to the Palestinian health ministry, in a war that has caused horror around the world. Israel says it has lost more than 300 soldiers.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UK government on Tuesday pledged to prioritise mental health as a report into a fatal stabbing rampage by a psychotic patient identified a litany of errors by medical authorities.</p>

<p>19-year-old students Grace O'Malley-Kumar and Barnaby Webber and school caretaker Ian Coates died in the attacks in the central English city of Nottingham last June.</p>

<p>Health Minister Wes Streeting said it was time to put a greater focus on mental health, amid growing public concern about treatment waiting times and big increases in demand.</p>

<p>"It's time we prioritise mental health so we will be updating the Mental Health Act to bring care into the 21st century to ensure that care is appropriate, proportionate and compassionate -- while keeping the public safe," he wrote in The Sun Daily.</p>

<p>Victims' relatives said the report revealed "a catalogue of continual failures" lasting years in the handling of paranoid schizophrenic Valdo Calocane who carried out the killings.</p>

<p>"It's really hard to actually pinpoint one particular point, because the failings are so systemic and they're so gross," said Emma Webber whose son Barnaby died.</p>

<p>And she warned that what happened in Nottingham was "not a one-off tragedy".</p>

<p>"There are more Valdo Calocanes out in our community," she said.</p>

<p>According to the report, repeated medical assessments of Calocane underplayed the serious risk he posed to others.</p>

<p>Key details were "minimised or omitted" such as his refusal to take his medication, violent behaviour and persistent symptoms of psychosis.</p>

<p>"Poor decision-making, omissions and errors of judgments contributed to a situation where a patient with very serious mental health issues did not receive the support and follow-up he needed," said Chris Dzikiti of the Care Quality Commission which produced the report.</p>

<p>Sanjoy Kumar, the father of Grace O'Malley-Kumar, said doctors had to take greater responsibility for releasing "dangerous" patients.</p>

<h3><strong>Public safety</strong></h3>

<p>"It's not about depriving people of their liberty. It's about holding clinicians responsible who put people like that out on our streets," said Kumar, a practising doctor.</p>

<p>"We have lost the absolute love of our life, our lovely, beautiful and brave daughter, Gracie, and at the end of the day what we want to see is that the public is safe," he said.</p>

<p>"I think the nation is crying out for safety from these crimes," he added.</p>

<p>Calocane was given an indefinite hospital order in January after admitting manslaughter due to diminished responsibility.</p>

<p>Prosecutors accepted his not guilty pleas to murder after multiple medical experts concluded he had paranoid schizophrenia.</p>

<p>Streeting, a member of the UK's new Labour government, said the state-funded National Health Service (NHS) had accepted the recommendations about improvements to the care of patients with serious mental illness.</p>

<p>Measures already in place include 2.3 billion pounds ($2.9 billion) a year increase in funding "to transform services".</p>

<p>"Action is already underway to address the serious failures," he said in a statement, adding that he wanted to "assure myself and the country" that the errors seen in Nottingham "are not being repeated elsewhere".</p>

<p>There has been growing alarm in the UK at the state of mental health provision over recent years as the NHS struggles with increased demand, a post-Covid backlog and staffing and funding issues.</p>

<p>The NHS says some 5.3 million children and young people were in contact with mental health services in 2023/24, up 8.1 percent on the previous year and over 25 percent in 2021/22.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Israeli strike killed 10 members of a Gaza family in the territory's southern district of Khan Yunis Tuesday, leaving only one survivor -- a three-month-old girl, a medic told AFP.</p>

<p>"Ten members of the Abu Haya family were killed in an Israeli strike on Abassan in east Khan Yunis," the medic from Nasser Hospital told AFP on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>"There is only one survivor from the family, a baby girl named Rim. She is just three months old," he said, identifying the 10 other members of the family -- two parents and their eight children.</p>

<p>The girl, wrapped in a black cloth, stirred strong emotion in the courtyard of Nasser Hospital, a place now known for grieving families searching for dead or wounded loved ones.</p>

<p>"This little girl was pulled out of the rubble. Her whole family is dead. Who will take care of her now?" asked Ibrahim Barbakh, a resident of Khan Yunis, as he held the baby.</p>

<p>Rescue workers, witnesses and medical sources reported further Israeli air strikes and shelling in several parts of the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, some of them deadly.</p>

<p>The war in Gaza was sparked by an unprecedented attack by Palestinian operative group Hamas on Israel on October 7, which resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 39,929 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which does not provide details on civilian and operative deaths.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Ukraine said Tuesday it was not interested in "taking over" territory it had captured during its cross-border incursion into Russia's Kursk region, calling Ukrainian operations there "absolutely legitimate".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine said Tuesday it would not hold on to Russian territory captured in its surprise cross-border incursion and offered to stop raids if Moscow agreed a "just peace".</p>

<p>Ukrainian forces entered Russia's Kursk region last Tuesday, taking over two dozen settlements in the biggest attack by a foreign army on Russian soil since World War II. Russia said Tuesday it had fended off new attacks in Kursk.</p>

<p>More than 120,000 people have fled the area and Ukraine's military chief Oleksandr Syrsky said Monday that his troops controlled about 1,000 square kilometres of Russian territory.</p>

<p>At least 800 square kilometres was under Ukrainian control as of Monday, according to an AFP analysis of data from the US-based Institute for the Study of War.</p>

<p>Foreign ministry spokesman Georgiy Tykhy on Tuesday said Kyiv was not interested in "taking over" Russian territory and defended Ukraine's actions as "absolutely legitimate".</p>

<p>"The sooner Russia agrees to restore a just peace... the sooner the raids by the Ukrainian defences forces into Russia will stop," he told reporters.</p>

<p>Ukraine meanwhile said it was imposing movement restrictions in a 20-kilometre zone in Sumy region along the border with Kursk region due to an "increase in the intensity of hostilities" and "sabotage" activities.</p>

<p>Russia's defence ministry said it had "foiled" new Ukrainian attacks in Kursk by "enemy mobile groups in armoured vehicles to break through deep into Russian territory".</p>

<p>Alexander Bortnikov, head of Russia's FSB security service, also said in a statement that Ukraine had carried out the attack "with the support of the collective West".</p>

<p><strong>- 'I saw a lot of death' -</strong></p>

<p>Since launching its invasion in February 2022, Russia has captured territory in southern and eastern Ukraine and subjected Ukrainian cities to missile and drone barrages.</p>

<p>Ukraine's offensive was the biggest cross-border action since the invasion and it caught Russia off guard.</p>

<p>"They didn't protect the border," a Ukrainian serviceman who took part in the offensive and identified himself as Ruzhyk told AFP in Sumy region.</p>

<p>"They only had anti-personnel mines scattered around trees at the side of the road and a few mines that they managed to quickly throw along the highways," he said.</p>

<p>A 27-year-old squad leader, who identified himself as Faraon, was sparing but direct in his description of battles in Kursk.</p>

<p>"I saw a lot of death in the first few days. It was terrifying at first but then we got used to it," he told AFP.</p>

<p>"There have been many deaths," he repeated stood next to a forest road leading to the frontier, without elaborating.</p>

<p>Ukrainian military analyst Mykola Bielieskov told AFP: "Russian complacency prevailed".</p>

<p>"Russia assumed that since it had initiative elsewhere, Ukraine wouldn't dare to do things we've seen," he said, referring to months of Russian advances along the front.</p>

<p>ISW figures also showed that Russian troops had captured 1,360 square kilometres of Ukrainian territory since the start of 2024.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Sow discord' -</strong></p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has vowed to "dislodge" Ukrainian troops.</p>

<p>Putin told a televised meeting with officials on Monday that "one of the obvious goals of the enemy is to sow discord" and "destroy the unity and cohesion of Russian society".</p>

<p>Putin also said Ukraine wanted to "improve its negotiating position" for any future talks with Moscow.</p>

<p>Regional governor Alexei Smirnov told the same meeting that Ukrainian forces had entered at least 12 kilometres into the region and the new front was now 40 kilometres wide.</p>

<p>Russia had conceded earlier that Ukrainian forces had penetrated up to 30 kilometres (20 miles) into Russian territory in places.</p>

<p>A Ukrainian security official told AFP, on condition of anonymity, at the weekend, that Ukraine sought to "stretch the positions of the enemy, to inflict maximum losses and to destabilise the situation in Russia as they are unable to protect their own border".</p>

<p>The Ukrainian official said thousands of Ukrainian troops were involved in the operation.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A video showing billionaire Elon Musk scrolling through his phone and laughing during an event in New York became a topic of discussion on social media. The video was recorded when Mr Musk was sitting right next to US President-elect Donald Trump at Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/watch-donald-trump-elon-musk-in-front-row-seats-at-ufc-event-7039660">heavyweight bout</a> on Saturday. While the high-decibel event was on, the Tesla chief (and soon going to be the head of US' Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE) was seen cracking up while scrolling through his phone. Many social media users said the richest man on the planet is enjoying memes.</p>

<p>Resharing the post on his own timeline, Mr Musk commented, "I am watching myself watch this!" The video also shows Mr Trump gesturing to Mr Musk, encouraging him to focus on the fight.</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I'm watching myself watch this ? <a href="https://t.co/37GMB1EQN9">https://t.co/37GMB1EQN9</a></p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p></p>

<p>The clip and Mr Musk's comment soon amassed thousands of responses on X (the platform he bought in 2022).</p>

<p>"This guy bought Twitter cause he was bored. Because he has no yacht and his jet is small. No crazy mansion I know of. What else? Just video games and memes. Until someone provoked him into politics," one user commented.</p>

<p>"I love seeing Elon happy, if we can make him laugh with some memes after everything he is going through just for trying to make the world and the West better, it's awesome," said another.</p>

<p>"Bahahaha.. he might fight Zuck by end of tonight," a third user said.</p>

<p>Mr Musk accompanied Mr Trump, UFC chief executive Dana White, and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, country rock artist Kid Rock, RFK Jr, among others. Mr Trump's sons Eric and Don Jr were also in the audience for the bout.</p>

<p>After Jon Jones defended his heavyweight title with a third-round technical knockout against fellow American Stipe Miocic in the main event, the fighter celebrated with Trump's trademark 'YMCA' dance.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[In our new research, published today in Nature, we explored the ability of tiny marine organisms called plankton to adapt to global warming.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Global temperature records <a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement">are expected</a> to <a href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/year-2024-set-end-warmest-record">exceed the 1.5 °C threshold</a> for the first time this year. This has happened much sooner than predicted. So can life on the planet adapt quickly enough?</p>

<p>In our new research, published today in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08029-0">Nature</a>, we explored the ability of tiny marine organisms called plankton to adapt to global warming. Our conclusion: some plankton are less able to adapt now than they were in the past.</p>

<p>Plankton live in the top few metres of ocean. These algae (phytoplankton) and animals (zooplankton) are transported by ocean currents as they do not actively swim.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGII_SummaryForPolicymakers.pdf">Climate change is increasing</a> the frequency of heatwaves in the sea. But predicting the future effects of climate change is difficult because some projections depend on <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/factsheets/IPCC_AR6_WGI_Regional_Fact_Sheet_Ocean.pdf">ocean physics and chemistry</a>, while others consider the effects <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/downloads/outreach/IPCC_AR6_WGII_FactSheet_Biodiversity.pdf">on ecosystems and their services</a>.</p>

<p>Some data suggest that current climate change have already altered the marine plankton dramatically. Models project a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25385-x">shift of plankton</a> towards both poles (where ocean temperatures are cooler), and losses to zooplankton in the tropics but might not predict the patterns we see in data. <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-3/">Satellite data for plankton biomass</a> are still too short term to determine trends through time.</p>

<p>To overcome these problems, we have compared how plankton responded to past environmental change and modelled how they could respond to future climate changes. As the scientist Charles Lyell said, <a href="https://www.geolsoc.org.uk/PodcastPresentPast">“the past is the key to the present”</a>.</p>

<p>We explored one of the best fossil records from a group of marine plankton with hard shells called <em>Foraminifera</em>. This <a href="https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.873570">comprehensive database</a> of current and past distributions, compiled by researchers at the <a href="https://www.marum.de/en/AG-Micropaleontology-Paleoceanography.html">University of Bremen</a>, has been collected by hundreds of scientists from the seafloor across the globe since the 1960s. We compared data from the last ice age, around 21,000 years ago, and modern records to see what happened when the world has previously warmed.</p>

<p>We used computational models, which combine climate trends with traits of marine plankton and their effect on marine plankton, to simulate the oceanic ecosystems from the last ice age to the pre-industrial age. Comparing the model with the data from the fossil record is giving us support that the model simulated the rules determining plankton growth and distribution.</p>

<p>We found that some subtropical and tropical species' optimum temperature for peak growth and reproduction could deal with seawater warming in the past, supported by both fossil data and model. Colder water species of plankton managed to drift to flourish under more favourable water temperatures.</p>

<p>Our analysis shows that <em>Foraminifera</em> could handle the natural climate change, even without the need to adapt via evolution. But could they deal with the current warming and future changes in ocean conditions, such as temperature?</p>

<h2>Future of the food chain</h2>

<p>We used this model to predict the future under four different degrees of warming from 1.5 to 4 °C. Unfortunately, this type of plankton's ability to deal with climate change is much more limited than it was during past warming. Our study highlights the difference between faster human-induced and slower-paced geological warming for marine plankton. Current climate change is too rapid and is reducing food supply due to ocean stratification, both making plankton difficult to adapt to this time.</p>

<p>Phytoplankton produce around 50% of the world's oxygen. So every second breath we take comes from marine algae, while the rest comes from plants on land. Some plankton eat other plankton. That in turn gets eaten by fish and then marine mammals, so energy transfers further up the food chain. As it photosynthesises, phytoplankton is also a natural carbon fixation machine, storing 45 times <a href="https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/11/1783/2019/">more carbon than the atmosphere</a>.</p>

<p>Around the world, many people depend heavily on food from the ocean as their <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-3/">primary protein sources</a>. When climate change threatens marine plankton, this has huge knock-on effects throughout the rest of the marine food web. Plankton-eating marine mammals like whales won't have enough food to prey on and there'll be fewer fish to eat for predators (and people). Reducing warming magnitude and slowing down the warming rate are necessary to protect ocean health.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President-elect Donald Trump has said he might install his picks for top administration posts without first winning approval in the U.S. Senate. This would erode the power of Congress and remove a significant check on his authority as president.</p>

<p><strong>HOW IS A CABINET APPROVED?</strong></p>

<p>According to the U.S. Constitution, the Senate and the president share the power of appointing top administration officials. Typically, senators question nominees for Secretary of Defense and other top posts at public hearings before voting on their fitness for office.</p>

<p>Roughly 1,000 government positions require Senate confirmation through a majority vote in the 100-seat chamber.</p>

<p>Most of Trump's Cabinet picks easily won confirmation during his first 2017-2021 term in office. But the Senate rejected some candidates and others, like Labor Secretary nominee Andrew Puzder, were forced to withdraw after it became clear they would not have enough support to win a confirmation vote.</p>

<p>The process has slowed as partisan divisions have deepened. Democratic President Joe Biden's cabinet appointees took an average of 191 days to win confirmation compared with an average of 85 days for Republican President George W. Bush, according to the Partnership for Public Service, which oversees presidential transitions.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT HAS TRUMP CALLED FOR?</strong></p>

<p>This time around, Trump wants the Senate to give up that gatekeeping role and allow him to make "recess appointments," even though his Republicans will control the chamber next year with at least 52 seats.</p>

<p>He has called for the chamber to adjourn after he takes office in January, which would allow his personnel to take their positions without having to undergo Senate scrutiny.</p>

<p>That would allow boundary-pushing picks like former Representative Matt Gaetz to serve as U.S. attorney general and vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to take charge of the Department of Health and Human Services.</p>

<p><strong>HOW DO 'RECESS APPOINTMENTS' WORK?</strong></p>

<p>The U.S. Constitution says the president can make recess appointments to fill vacant positions when the Senate is not in session, though officials appointed in this manner can only serve two years at most.</p>

<p>Past presidents have taken advantage of this clause. Democrat Barack Obama made 32 recess appointments, while Bush made 171, according to the Congressional Research Service.</p>

<p>Since 2007, Congress had increasingly used scheduling tricks to prevent this from happening.</p>

<p>Rather than formally adjourning when it wants to leave town, the Senate now typically holds occasional "pro forma" sessions in which a single lawmaker briefly wields the gavel but no work is done, keeping the chamber technically in session.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court upheld this practice in 2014, ruling that a president can only make a recess appointment when the Senate is out of session for 10 days or longer.</p>

<p>Trump's gambit would require the Senate to adjourn for at least that long, which could be difficult. It's not clear how many Republicans would voluntarily give up one of the Senate's most significant powers.</p>

<p><strong>CAN TRUMP FORCE A RECESS?</strong></p>

<p>Maybe. The Constitution gives the president the power to adjourn Congress when the Senate and the House of Representatives disagree on whether they should leave town. Trump could invoke this power if the Republican-controlled House votes to adjourn and the Senate does not.</p>

<p>That tactic has never been used before, according to conservative scholar Ed Whelan, who called on House Speaker Mike Johnson to reject it. "Johnson can and should immediately put an end to this scheme," he wrote in the Washington Post on Nov. 14.</p>

<p><strong>WILL REPUBLICANS OPPOSE TRUMP?</strong></p>

<p>Republicans will control the House and the Senate by narrow margins next year, giving them little room for error if they want to go along with Trump's proposal.</p>

<p>In the Senate, Trump allies like Florida Senator Rick Scott quickly signaled support while other Republicans have said they are reluctant to surrender such a significant power.</p>

<p>Incoming Senate Republican Leader John Thune has not ruled it out. "All options are on the table, including recess appointments," he said on Fox News on Nov. 14.</p>

<p>Republicans could warm to the idea if Democrats manage to block or slow down some of Trump's nominees next year. A recess appointment could allow them to avoid having to hold up-or-down votes on a divisive nominee like Kennedy, a former Democrat who has spread misinformation on vaccines and supports abortion rights.</p>

<p>In the House, Johnson, a close Trump ally, has not yet publicly said what he thinks of the idea. If he were to pursue it, he would have to keep nearly all of his fellow Republicans on board as he will likely start next year with a majority of fewer than three votes in the 435-seat chamber.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[In the aftermath of the US election, much focus has been on the consequences for abortion rights across the US, and whether this will affect state-led initiatives to roll back restrictive legislation.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the aftermath of the US election, much focus has been on the consequences for <a href="https://theconversation.com/what-a-second-trump-presidency-means-for-abortion-laws-across-the-us-243437">abortion rights across the US</a>, and whether this will affect state-led initiatives to roll back restrictive legislation.</p>

<p>What has received much less attention is what will happen next to abortion services, sexual and reproductive health, and health more widely across many parts of the world, as a direct result of a decision President Trump is likely to take on his first day in office.</p>

<p>The US is by far the largest donor of aid for global health, providing US$15.8 billion (£7.8 billion) in 2022, compared to the <a href="https://donortracker.org/donor_profiles/united-kingdom/globalhealth">next three largest donors</a> Germany (US$4.4 billion), Japan ($3.2 billion) and the UK (US$2 billion). That means restrictions and reductions on that aid can have enormous consequences around the world.</p>

<p>In 1984, President Reagan implemented the Mexico City Policy (which became widely known as the <a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/explainers/what-global-gag-rule">global gag rule</a>), under which any organisation providing abortion services (defined widely from actual abortion provision to basic advice) was banned from receiving US aid – even if that funding was not being spent on abortion services. Since then, Democratic administrations have removed this rule, only for succeeding Republican presidents to reinstate it.</p>

<p>Based on his track record in his first presidency, Trump is likely to bring back this kind of restriction on aid when he returns to the White House. His first administration reintroduced this policy and <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2020/04/unprecedented-expansion-global-gag-rule-trampling-rights-health-and-free-speech">vastly expanded the scope</a> of its focus well beyond family planning services to include HIV/AIDS treatment, sanitation and public health more widely.</p>

<p>The amount of funding affected by these rules rose from around $600 million under Bush-era workings of the global gag rule to <a href="http://www.msichoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/msi-briefing-impact-of-the-ggr-on-reproductive-healthcare.pdf">around US$12 billion</a>. The ruling will apply not just to the organisations directly receiving USAID funding, but to any organisation they work with, even if using non-USAID funds for that work.</p>

<p>The potential impact of these restrictions on how countries can use their public health funding is significant; the performance of the previous Trump administration suggests health organisations are right to be worried about what may be coming.</p>

<p>Research over decades shows that when the global gag rule is in place the health of women and children in particular are put at risk.</p>

<p>A study in <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7888016/">Kenya</a>, for example, found sexual and reproductive health services (which may include abortion services, but also offer critically important services for pregnant and new mothers, infants and children) were closed. Stocks of contraceptives also declined as a consequence of these restrictions on how aid was spent. In <a href="https://pai.org/resources/access-denied-uganda/">Uganda</a>, organisations reportedly stopped providing services designed to reduce death from unsafe abortions, worried even this might fall into the vague definitions of “abortion services”.</p>

<p>Leading international reproductive health charity <a href="https://www.msichoices.org/latest/the-impact-of-the-global-gag-rule-on-frontline-reproductive-healthcare/">Marie Stopes International</a> saw its overall funding fall by 17% in 2017 during Trump's first term, over its refusal to agree to the terms of the global gag rule. In some countries abortion rates rose by <a href="https://www.msichoices.org/latest/the-impact-of-the-global-gag-rule-on-frontline-reproductive-healthcare/">up to 40%</a>, with many expected to be unsafe, as US funding for safe abortion facilities disappeared.</p>

<p>There's likely to be an increase in maternal and child mortality. The death rate from safe abortions is very small (around 1 per 100,000 births). Unsafe abortions, by contrast, are incredibly dangerous, with a death ratio of <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/abortion">200 per 100,000</a> abortions.</p>

<p>This type of restriction on how US aid can be spent doesn't just affect abortion services. It also undermines wider sexual and reproductive health services, including family planning access and information. The result is that unwanted pregnancy rates increase at the same time as abortion service provision is reduced, with the inevitable consequence of pushing many women into dangerous unsafe abortion procedures. One <a href="https://www.aidsmap.com/news/jun-2022/us-gag-rule-leads-90000-additional-hiv-infections-annually">study</a> suggested an additional 30,000 maternal and child deaths occurred annually as a direct result.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/issue-brief/impact-of-the-mexico-city-policy-literature-review/">review</a> of research findings on the impact of these public health restrictions carried out by policy organisation KFF, showed declines in usage of modern contraception, increases in pregnancies and rates of unsafe abortions.</p>

<p>The affect on advice on and availability of modern contraception, especially condoms, also brings with it additional health challenges. Best practice has long suggested integrating sexual health services with other health services including HIV testing and treatment, screening for some cancers and antenatal care, can improve health outcomes.</p>

<p>Undermining one aspect of these services has a knock-on effect on all of them. A 2022 <a href="https://www.aidsmap.com/news/jun-2022/us-gag-rule-leads-90000-additional-hiv-infections-annually">study</a> suggested that across highly US-aid dependent countries, there have been an additional 90,000 new HIV infections every year when the global gag rule has been in force.</p>

<h2>Reduced access to contraception</h2>

<p>Nepal, which enshrined the right to abortion and requires all government health facilities to offer free abortion services in its 2018 Safe Motherhood and Reproductive Health Rights Act, is one country that could be particularly badly affected. The US is the <a href="https://www.state.gov/u-s-relations-with-nepal/">largest bilateral donor</a> for health in Nepal and has provided more than <a href="https://gh.bmj.com/content/bmjgh/7/7/e008752.full.pdf">three-fifths of aid</a> for family planning and reproductive health under President Biden. One <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7888035/">study</a> found maternal and child health services in Nepal as a whole worsened under Trump's last term, not just those parts linked to abortion services.</p>

<p>Contraception services declined and stocks frequently ran out, increasing risks of unwanted pregnancies. Organisations working on abortion were also often excluded from ministry of public health consultations, despite abortion being legal in the country, over government fears of the consequences for <a href="https://gh.bmj.com/content/bmjgh/7/7/e008752.full.pdf">US aid flows</a>.</p>

<p>When these kind of restrictions are in place the number of abortions has increased. And much of that increase is happening in unregulated, dangerous places, adding to the risk of death for pregnant women.</p>

<h2>What might happen next?</h2>

<p>Under previous US presidents, other donors have increased their commitments in order to try and protect sexual and reproductive health services and wider public health from the devastating <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/feb/16/uk-to-host-summit-seeking-extra-funds-for-family-planning">impact of US policy</a>.</p>

<p>It is critical that donors, especially those in Europe (including the UK), announce their plans now for how they will step up their support to protect women's health and access to safe abortions, in order to prevent the closure of these vital services. Not just for the next four years but for the longer term.</p>

<p>These restrictions create the precise opposite of what they set out to achieve, resulting in more abortions and more deaths. But more than that, they are deeply harmful and dangerous to women who have no say over a policy that presents a danger to their lives.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <description><![CDATA[The cold open started with the Trump-Biden meeting as several of the Republican leader's cabinet picks paid him a visit.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Saturday Night Live (SNL) has mocked President-elect Donald Trump's picks for the cabinet ahead of the inauguration, slated for January 20, 2025. The cold open also poked fun at Trump's highly animated meeting with President Joe Biden at the Oval Office last week which prompted a deluge of reactions on social media. While Trump's character was portrayed by James Austin Johnson, Dana Carvey -- a regular SNL cast member, played Biden with Alex Baldwin also making a cameo appearance as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. -- the new health czar.</p>

<p>The skit started with the Trump-Biden meeting as several of the Republican leader's cabinet picks paid him a visit. Trump said he loved running for the president while hated being one. "Maybe I hate it here too. It's no joke," Carvey's character replied.</p>

<p>"But I can't go back to Mar-a-Lago, Joe, because Elon [Musk] is there, and he will not leave, It's like, What about Bob? He's walking around in his bathing suit, showing me videos of rockets and monkeys with computers in their heads. This guy's cringe," Trump added.</p>

<p>As Biden appears to give his would-be-successor some advice, Trump replies: "I already know how to do president. It's all about surrounding yourself with the best people, and I am very fastly picking the most epic Cabinet of all time."</p>

<p>"They're some of the most dynamic, free-thinking, animal killing, sexually criminal, medically crazy people in the country," he adds, with Carvey's Biden asking: "Who are you thinking about?"</p>

<p>"Well, we've got Elon and Matt Gaetz: that's an Alien versus Predator. We've got, we've got Kristi Noem and RFK Junior. They're killing the dogs; they're killing the bears. And Melania will be working remotely from divorce," Trump replied.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Gaetz, played by Sarah Sherman, then arrives in a costume mocking the attorney general nominee's appearance. "Of course, I had to resign from Congress because the confirmation process comes at the busiest time of year for me," Gaetz said.</p>

<p>Baldwin's character appears at the end and states: "Americans need someone to teach them how to be healthy, someone like me - a 70-year-old man with movie star looks and a worm in his brain."</p>

<h3><strong>Musk slams SNL</strong></h3>

<p>Earlier, Elon Musk had slammed SNL for producing a skit that mocked him. The episode hosted by comedian Bill Burr featured Carvey playing the billionaire.</p>

<p>"SNL has been dying slowly for years, as they become increasingly out of touch with reality. Their last-ditch effort to cheat the equal airtime requirements and prop up Kamala before the election only helped sink her campaign further," said Musk in a post on X (formerly Twitter).</p>

<p>Mr Musk has been appointed to Mr Trump's cabinet where he will be co-leading the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency alongside Vivek Ramaswamy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In what claims to be the only woman-run cafe in the capital of Indonesia's most conservative province, owner Qurrata Ayuni says she and her baristas provide an alternative to rowdy, smoke-filled male haunts.</p>

<p>The 28-year-old opened Morning Mama cafe last year to create a space that caters to women in Banda Aceh, known as the city of 1,001 coffee shops.</p>

<p>"I thought why not open a place that is comfortable for women?" she said.</p>

<p>While the province has long been known as the site of the world's deadliest tsunami and a decades-long separatist insurgency, Aceh's draw for visitors is often the coffee.</p>

<p>The traditional "sanger" latte, mixed with condensed milk, is a popular staple.</p>

<p>Aceh's strong connection to coffee started hundreds of years ago with Dutch colonial rulers. Now, its farmers cultivate world-renowned beans in lush highlands.</p>

<p>Aceh still catches attention for its ultra-conservative values, including by-laws that require Muslim women to wear hijabs.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/dcg89p0s_indonesia-women-run-cafe-in-sharia-district-afp_625x300_18_November_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>While women are not banned from working in the only region in Muslim-majority Indonesia to impose Islamic law, running a coffee shop is seen as a man's job.</p>

<p>"It's extremely difficult for women in Aceh to pursue education or a career, facing not only legal restrictions but also social bullying," said Andreas Harsono of Human Rights Watch.</p>

<p>Despite widespread criticism, public whipping remains a common punishment for a range of offences in the province, including gambling, alcohol consumption and relations outside marriage.</p>

<p>Independent career paths are mostly viewed as out of reach for Aceh's young women, but Qurrata was undeterred.</p>

<h2><strong>TIME FOR CHANGE</strong></h2>

<p>Qurrata, who owns her cafe without a business partner, saw a demand for a space for women to work or meet friends.</p>

<p>She and her team of baristas pour fresh coffee to mostly hijab-wearing customers, with children's books and menstruation pads on sale nearby.</p>

<p>"There's no cigarette smoke, it's not noisy, it's really cosy," she said, adding that some men also have coffees at her shop.</p>

<p>"It's a statement that women can own businesses, make decisions and lead," she said.</p>

<p>"Now is the time for change."</p>

<p>The entrepreneur says women are stepping up, pointing to at least 1,000 applying for a barista job.</p>

<p>"I want to offer them the chance to change the course of their lives," she said.</p>

<p>Caca, a 23-year-old barista, said it was a "really cool job" rare in Aceh.</p>

<p>The cafe's regulars hail Morning Mama as a spot where women can be themselves.</p>

<p>"I feel more connection if I ask something with a woman barista," said 21-year-old student Meulu Alina. "I don't feel any nervousness. It's more like talking with your sister."</p>

<h3><strong>HELPING OTHERS</strong></h3>

<p>Before starting her business, Qurrata overcame the loss of her parents at the age of eight in the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, which killed more than 200,000 people.</p>

<p>Her village near Banda Aceh was completely destroyed, but she survived and was raised by her aunt and uncle.</p>

<p>Qurrata said she wants to channel her grief into helping other women.</p>

<p>"It's a platform to help others find their own resilience, much like I did," she said.</p>

<p>Photography jobs allowed her to build savings and confidence, taking a leap into business after her uncle encouraged her and helped financially.</p>

<p>Other women were still "afraid to start", she said, for fear men will say bad things.</p>

<p>"People here tend to believe that women should stay at home," she said.</p>

<p>But "the older generation understands that times have changed."</p>

<p>Owner of Aceh's popular Solong coffee shop, Haji Nawawi, said he would not employ women but locals had accepted them making coffee elsewhere, calling it "normal" as values "from outside" Aceh had entered the province.</p>

<p>Qurrata employs five women alongside two men.</p>

<p>Revenue fluctuates, but Qurrata says her ultimate aim is to inspire other women.</p>

<p>"Women are capable of so much more than we're often given credit for. We can be leaders, creators, and innovators," she said.</p>

<p>"So don't just sit back. Don't be afraid."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US had never approved Kyiv to use long-range missiles in Russia, until now.</p>

<p>The Biden administration has made a significant policy change, allowing Ukraine to use US-made ATACMS missiles to strike targets inside Russia for the first time.</p>

<p>This decision comes just two months before President Joe Biden hands over power to Donald Trump, who has expressed scepticism about US military aid to Ukraine.</p>

<p>Ukraine has been using ATACMS missiles against Russian targets in occupied Ukrainian territory for over a year, but the US had previously prohibited their use inside Russia due to concerns about escalating the conflict.</p>

<p>"It would substantially change the very essence, the nature of the conflict. This will mean that Nato countries, the USA and European states, are fighting with Russia", Putin had said in September.</p>

<p>However, the recent deployment of North Korean troops to support Russia in the Kursk border region has prompted the policy change.</p>

<p>The Lockheed Martin ballistic missiles are some of the most powerful missiles provided to Ukraine, with a range of up to 300km (186 miles), and will likely be used to defend against Russian and North Korean troops in the Kursk region, targeting military bases, infrastructure, and ammunition storage.</p>

<p>Officials from both the countries - Ukraine and US expect a counter-offensive by Russia and North Korea to regain the Kursk territory.</p>

<p>While the supply of missiles may not be enough to turn the tide of the war, they could grant Ukraine an advantage at a time when Russian troops are gaining ground in the country's east.</p>

<p>Western diplomats have welcomed the decision as an "overdue symbolic move" to demonstrate military support for Ukraine, but caution that it may not be decisive.</p>

<p>"The West has decided on such a level of escalation that it could end with the Ukrainian statehood in complete ruins by morning," Andrei Klishas, a Senator of the Russian Federation said.</p>

<p>Vladimir Dzhabarov, also a Senator of the Russian Federation, has said that this is a "very big step" towards World War Three.</p>

<p>Donald Trump's stance on the issue remains unclear, with some of his officials advocating for continued aid to Ukraine while others suggest cutting off support.</p>

<p>His son, Donald Trump Jr, wrote this on social media, "The military industrial complex seems to want to make sure they get World War Three going before my father has a chance to create peace and save lives."</p>

<p>National Security Adviser Michael Waltz says that Trump might accelerate the delivery of weapons to Ukraine to get Russia to negotiate. Since the president-elect had a goal of resolving the conflict within a day, this might support his plan.</p>

<p>However, JD Vance, Vice President elect said "we've done more than our fair share" during a speech in May. "I do not think that it is in America's interest to continue to fund an effectively never-ending war in Ukraine," he added.</p>

<p>According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German research organisation, the US has allocated 56.799 billion euros as military help as of October 2024 and stands as the greatest supplier of arms to Ukraine.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's ties with China will remain unchanged despite the election of Donald Trump as US president, an adviser to Iran's supreme leader said in remarks carried by ISNA news agency.</p>

<p>Ali Akbar Velayati said Trump's return to the White House in January would not "impact" Iran's foreign policy, "particularly its ties with China", according to ISNA.</p>

<p>"Iran and China have long-standing, close and cordial cultural and historical relations and they have had many positive effects on each other," he was quoted as saying.</p>

<p>The comments were made during a meeting with Cong Peiwu, the Chinese ambassador to Tehran, the news agency said in its report on Sunday night.</p>

<p>Velayati, who served as foreign minister for 16 years until 1997, currently advises Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</p>

<p>China is Iran's largest trading partner and a major buyer of its sanctioned oil.</p>

<p>Iranian Oil Minister Mohsen Paknejad said last week that the Islamic republic had no "serious concerns" regarding oil sales following Trump's election.</p>

<p>Trump, who implemented a "maximum pressure" policy against Iran during his first term, has named Marco Rubio, a politician known for his hostility toward both China and Iran, as his secretary of state.</p>

<p>This policy involved the imposition of both old and new sanctions on Tehran, complicating Beijing's efforts to engage Iran in its extensive Belt and Road infrastructure initiative.</p>

<p>In 2021, China and Iran signed a 25-year strategic agreement that encompasses various areas, including energy, security, infrastructure and communications.</p>

<p>In September, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi reassured Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian that China would "support" Iran, regardless of how the international and regional situation evolves.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A quietly growing belief in Silicon Valley could have immense implications: the breakthroughs from large AI models -- the ones expected to bring human-level artificial intelligence in the near future -- may be slowing down.</p>

<p>Since the frenzied launch of ChatGPT two years ago, AI believers have maintained that improvements in generative AI would accelerate exponentially as tech giants kept adding fuel to the fire in the form of data for training and computing muscle.</p>

<p>The reasoning was that delivering on the technology's promise was simply a matter of resources -- pour in enough computing power and data, and artificial general intelligence (AGI) would emerge, capable of matching or exceeding human-level performance.</p>

<p>Progress was advancing at such a rapid pace that leading industry figures, including Elon Musk, called for a moratorium on AI research.</p>

<p>Yet the major tech companies, including Musk's own, pressed forward, spending tens of billions of dollars to avoid falling behind.&nbsp;</p>

<p>OpenAI, ChatGPT's Microsoft-backed creator, recently raised $6.6 billion to fund further advances.&nbsp;</p>

<p>xAI, Musk's AI company, is in the process of raising $6 billion, according to CNBC, to buy 100,000 Nvidia chips, the cutting-edge electronic components that power the big models.</p>

<p>However, there appear to be problems on the road to AGI.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Industry insiders are beginning to acknowledge that large language models (LLMs) aren't scaling endlessly higher at breakneck speed when pumped with more power and data.</p>

<p>Despite the massive investments, performance improvements are showing signs of plateauing.</p>

<p>"Sky-high valuations of companies like OpenAI and Microsoft are largely based on the notion that LLMs will, with continued scaling, become artificial general intelligence," said AI expert and frequent critic Gary Marcus. "As I have always warned, that's just a fantasy."</p>

<h3><strong>'No wall'</strong></h3>

<p>One fundamental challenge is the finite amount of language-based data available for AI training.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to Scott Stevenson, CEO of AI legal tasks firm Spellbook, who works with OpenAI and other providers, relying on language data alone for scaling is destined to hit a wall.</p>

<p>"Some of the labs out there were way too focused on just feeding in more language, thinking it's just going to keep getting smarter," Stevenson explained.</p>

<p>Sasha Luccioni, researcher and AI lead at startup Hugging Face, argues a stall in progress was predictable given companies' focus on size rather than purpose in model development.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The pursuit of AGI has always been unrealistic, and the 'bigger is better' approach to AI was bound to hit a limit eventually -- and I think this is what we're seeing here," she told AFP.</p>

<p>The AI industry contests these interpretations, maintaining that progress toward human-level AI is unpredictable.</p>

<p>"There is no wall," OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted Thursday on X, without elaboration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anthropic's CEO Dario Amodei, whose company develops the Claude chatbot in partnership with Amazon, remains bullish: "If you just eyeball the rate at which these capabilities are increasing, it does make you think that we'll get there by 2026 or 2027."</p>

<h3><strong>Time to think</strong></h3>

<p>Nevertheless, OpenAI has delayed the release of the awaited successor to GPT-4, the model that powers ChatGPT, because its increase in capability is below expectations, according to sources quoted by The Information.</p>

<p>Now, the company is focusing on using its existing capabilities more efficiently.</p>

<p>This shift in strategy is reflected in their recent o1 model, designed to provide more accurate answers through improved reasoning rather than increased training data.</p>

<p>Stevenson said an OpenAI shift to teaching its model to "spend more time thinking rather than responding" has led to "radical improvements".&nbsp;</p>

<p>He likened the AI advent to the discovery of fire. Rather than tossing on more fuel in the form of data and computer power, it is time to harness the breakthrough for specific tasks.</p>

<p>Stanford University professor Walter De Brouwer likens advanced LLMs to students transitioning from high school to university: "The AI baby was a chatbot which did a lot of improv'" and was prone to mistakes, he noted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The homo sapiens approach of thinking before leaping is coming," he added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Are Beijing-Islamabad ties under strain? Last month's bombing near Karachi airport, which killed two Chinese engineers and wounded a third, may well be a turning point. These bombings, claimed by the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), were the latest in a string of attacks on Beijing's interests in Pakistan, which began in 2016. They have angered China, which has pushed Pakistan to begin formal negotiations for a joint security management system.</p>

<p>Last Monday, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said that Beijing “will continue supporting Pakistan's counterterrorism effort[s] and socioeconomic development”. Pakistani officials who have direct knowledge of the previously unreported negotiations told Reuters that the Chinese want to bring in their own security, something that Pakistan is not in support of. Beijing has sent Islamabad a written proposal to “allow the dispatch of security agencies and military forces into each other's territory to assist in counterterrorism missions and conduct joint strikes”.</p>

<p>Pakistan, for its part, was amenable to setting up a joint security management system wherein Chinese officials could attend security meetings. It had also requested Beijing for greater help in improving its intelligence capabilities instead of direct involvement. But, it remains averse to having Chinese security and military forces on its territory.</p>

<h2><strong>Why China Is Frustrated</strong></h2>

<p>China does not seem to be in the mood to be placated—and not without reason. Two major deadly attacks have occurred this year—one was in October last month in Karachi, and another in March in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). The latter attack, on a Chinese envoy, was carried out by affiliates of Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and resulted in the deaths of five Chinese nationals working on the Dasu dam project.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following the October bombings, the Chinese response was unusually blunt. It has been pushing for a thorough probe and investigation into the attacks as well as for a large-scale counterterrorism operation. The Chinese embassy, strongly condemning the “terrorist attack”, recently requested Pakistan to “thoroughly investigate the attack, severely punish the perpetrators, and take all necessary measures to protect the safety of Chinese citizens, institutions and projects in Pakistan”, and asked “Chinese citizens, enterprises and projects in Pakistan to be vigilant, pay close attention to the security situation, strengthen security measures, and make every effort to take safety precautions”. This is not surprising because these two attacks are certainly not the only ones targeting Chinese interests and personnel in Pakistan.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>The Balochistan Conflict</strong></h2>

<p>The roots of these tensions go back to Baloch dissatisfaction. However, the other broad underlying factor is Pakistan's inability to assimilate all its ethnic groups and provinces into a cohesive national identity, both culturally and economically. The narrative of Pakistani Balochistan follows a familiar trajectory. It has been seen earlier in the history of East Pakistan (which ultimately decided its destiny as Bangladesh), of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, and of the Northwest Frontier Province (now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa). The steady depletion of natural resources of these provinces, the dispossession of their populaces, the erosion of local autonomy, negligence towards development, the suppression of ethnic identity and culture, demographic changes and the brutal crushing of any dissent or opposition are all-too-familiar patterns.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Balochistan is a resource-rich province with natural gas and mineral deposits, including coal, chromites, barytes, sulphur, marble, iron ore, quartzite, uranium, limestone and 95% of the world's asbestos. Nevertheless, the province continues to languish under neglect, with the Baloch people alleging internal colonisation by Pakistan's dominant Punjab province. The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) continues to press ahead with its demands for secessionism, with Pakistan launching large-scale anti-insurgency operations to crush the agitation. Hundreds of Baloch have lost their lives and many more "disappeared" under these operations.</p>

<h2><strong>Why CPEC Has Become A Bone Of Contention</strong></h2>

<p>The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the flagship programme of China's ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), passes majorly through Balochistan and is meant to bring in all the fruits of development. But the project has added to Baloch anxiety. The CPEC, a network of road, rail, power grid and cable connections, links China's Xinjiang to the Gwadar Port in Balochistan Province. The Baloch allege dissatisfaction with and exploitation by the CPEC, whereby thousands have been displaced on their own land without adequate compensation or employment opportunities. There are charges of corruption and ambiguity, with many believing that only Pakistani elites and China would benefit from the project. The result has been a string of attacks on Chinese personnel and interests, interrupting the implementation of the CPEC. For instance, in 2018, the BLA attacked the Chinese consulate in Karachi. Two years later, it attacked the Pakistan Stock Exchange, where the Chinese are major investors. In 2022, a female Baloch suicide bomber targeted Karachi University, killing three Chinese teachers. Last year, the BLA set six Chinese mobile towers on fire.</p>

<p>These tensions have considerably slowed down the progress of the CPEC, with many projects having been stalled. The Chinese, who have invested almost $64 billion into the corridor, are visibly upset. In 2021, a Pakistan Senate panel expressed concern over the slow progress of the CPEC and the Chinese dissatisfaction, given that around 135 Chinese companies are engaged in the CPEC. The Chinese Ambassador in Islamabad had also complained that Pakistan had "destroyed CPEC”.</p>

<h2><strong>A Breakdown Of Ties?</strong></h2>

<p>Along with the stalled projects and lost profits, body bags containing the remains of Chinese workers returning to the country have added to China's frustrations. This has led to pressure on Islamabad to launch a full-blown counterinsurgency operation in Balochistan. It has also contributed to the erosion of confidence and a possible devaluation of bilateral ties with Pakistan. Analysts have pointed out that in the last few joint statements—most notable being the latest one released during the visit of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to China—Pakistan is no longer mentioned as a “highest priority” country for China, a tag that featured in previous joint statements. Also, the idea of extending the CPEC to Afghanistan—mooted during a trilateral meeting in 2023 between then-Pakistani foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, Chinese foreign minister Qin Gang, and acting Afghan foreign minister Malawi Amir Khan Muttaqi—is no longer being discussed.</p>

<p>Pakistan neither wants to engage in another massive counterterrorism operation nor does it want Chinese security forces to guard CPEC projects. Yet, $30 billion of its $126-billion total external foreign debt is owed to China. It is also seeking another $7 billion from the International Monetary Fund. Not a pretty picture: not for Pakistan, not for China, and certainly not for the CPEC.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China reiterated calls Monday for a peaceful settlement to the war in Ukraine, after Washington cleared Kyiv to use long-range American missiles against military targets inside Russia.</p>

<p>"An early ceasefire and a political solution serve the interests of all parties," foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian told a regular briefing, when asked about the US decision.</p>

<p>"The most urgent thing is to promote the cooling down of the situation as soon as possible," he said.</p>

<p>China presents itself as a neutral party in the Ukraine war and says it is not sending lethal assistance to either side, unlike the United States and other Western nations.</p>

<p>But it remains a close political and economic ally of Russia and NATO members have branded Beijing a "decisive enabler" of the war, which it has never condemned.</p>

<p>On Monday, Lin said: "China has always encouraged and supported all efforts conducive to a peaceful resolution of the crisis."</p>

<p>Beijing, he added, "is willing to continue to play a constructive role in the political resolution of the Ukraine crisis in its own way".</p>

<p>Lin also rebuffed reports that EU officials had obtained proof that Russian drones being used in the war were being manufactured in China.</p>

<p>Beijing "has never provided lethal weapons to parties in the conflict, and has from the beginning strictly controlled military and dual-use drones in accordance with laws and regulations", he said.</p>

<p>"It is hoped that relevant countries and persons will not make wild speculations or smear and slander China without factual basis."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian lawmaker Maria Butina said on Monday that the administration of President Joe Biden was risking World War Three if it had allowed Ukraine to use US-made weapons to strike deep into Russia.</p>

<p>"These guys, Biden's administration, is trying to escalate the situation to the maximum while they still have power and are still in office," Ms Butina told Reuters.</p>

<p>"I have a great hope that (Donald) Trump will overcome this decision if this has been made because they are seriously risking the start of World War Three which is not in anybody's interest."</p>

<p>Reuters, citing two US officials and a source familiar with the decision, reported on Sunday that Biden's administration has made the decision to allow Ukraine to make the strikes with US weapons deep into Russia.</p>

<p>The New York Times also reported that Joe Biden's administration had made the decision. The Kremlin has yet to comment on the reports.</p>

<p>"The West has decided on such a level of escalation that it could end with the Ukrainian statehood in complete ruins by morning," Andrei Klishas, a senior member of the Federation Council, Russia's upper chamber of parliament, said on the Telegram messaging app.</p>

<p>Vladimir Dzhabarov, first deputy head of the Russian upper house's international affairs committee, said that Moscow's response will be immediate. "This is a very big step towards the start of World War Three," the TASS state news agency quoted Dzhabarov as saying.</p>

<p>Russia would be forced to take what Putin called "appropriate decisions" based on the new threats.</p>

<p>Leonid Slutsky, chairman of the State Duma lower house's foreign affairs committee, said that US authorisation of strikes by Kyiv on Russia with US ATACMS tactical missiles would lead to the toughest response, Russian news agencies reported.</p>

<p>"Strikes with US missiles deep into Russian regions will inevitably entail a serious escalation, which threatens to lead to much more serious consequences," TASS news agency quoted Slutsky as saying.</p>

<p>President Vladimir Putin said on September 12 that Western approval for such a step would mean "the direct involvement of NATO countries, the United States and European countries in the war in Ukraine" because NATO military infrastructure and personnel would have to be involved in the targeting and firing of the missiles.</p>

<p>In late October, Putin said that Russia's defence ministry was working on different ways to respond if the United States and its NATO allies help Ukraine to strike deep into Russia with long-range Western missiles.</p>

<p>"I guess there are some people in the United States who have nothing to lose for whatever reason or who are completely off the grid so much that they simply do not care," said Ms Butina, who spent 15 months in US prison for acting as an unregistered Russian agent and is now a lawmaker for the ruling United Russia party.</p>

<p>Vladimir Putin had also updated its nuclear doctrine to say that if Moscow came under direct attack from the West, Russia may even consider a nuclear response. Joe Biden's decision for allowing Ukraine to use western missiles to target Moscow is a step that risks such a response.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A private video of Pakistani TV host and influencer Mathira Mohammad was leaked on social media recently, adding to the series of similar controversies involving Pakistan TikTok star Imsha Rehman and <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/indonesian-celeb-lydia-onics-alleged-private-video-leaked-after-imsha-rehman-and-minahil-malik-7023908">Indonesian e-sports star </a>Lydia Onic. Several explicit clips, allegedly showing Mathira in a compromising position, have been doing rounds. However, the videos could not be verified.</p>

<p>The 32-year-old influencer, reacting to this, said that people are misusing her name and photoshoot pictures and creating fake photos.</p>

<p>"People are misusing my name and my photoshoot pictures and adding fake stuff in please have shame ! Keep me out of this trashy nonsense." she wrote on X (formerly Twitter).</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

— Mathira (@IamMathira) <a href="https://twitter.com/IamMathira/status/1856695359373718007?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Mathira, apart from a TV host, is also a model, dancer, singer, and actor. She has over two million followers on Instagram and around 59,000 followers on X.</p>

<p>The recent incident has yet again sparked a discussion on deepfake videos and data breaches.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, a private video of Pakistan TikTok star <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/who-is-imsha-rehman-pakistani-tiktok-star-caught-in-video-leak-scandal-7030925">Imsha Rehman</a> went viral, showing her in an intimate position. She faced a lot of backlash from social media users, who accused her of intentionally making the video public to gain attention. Shortly after this, Rehman called the negative comments "overwhelming" and deactivated her social media accounts.</p>

<p>Before this, an alleged intimate video of another Pakistani social media personality Minahil Malik with her boyfriend was circulated online, forcing her as well to deactivate her accounts. She also claimed that the video was "fake" and lodged a complaint with the&nbsp;Federal Investigation Agency (FIA).</p>

<p>On November 15, another explicit video purportedly showing Indonesian e-sports star Lydia Onic was leaked online. It is not yet confirmed if it was the&nbsp;content creator in the clip.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Indian-origin CEO has claimed that he received death threats after his social media post about the company's 84-hour workweek with “no work-life balance” went viral. Daksh Gupta, the CEO of AI startup Greptile, sparked a wave of controversy with a post detailing his company's demanding work culture.</p>

<p>Following the backlash, he mentioned that his inbox was a mix of "20 per cent death threats and 80 per cent job applications." The barrage of criticism came after Mr Gupta shared that employees at Greptile typically worked from 9 am to 11 pm or later, adding Saturdays were regular workdays and there was occasional work on Sundays too. He explained the company's “environment is high stress, and there is no tolerance for poor work.”</p>

<p>Mr Gupta now tells potential candidates during the first interview that “Greptile offers no work-life balance."</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">now that this is on the front page of reddit and my inbox is 20% death threats and 80% job applications, here's a follow up<br />

— Daksh Gupta (@dakshgup) <a href="https://twitter.com/dakshgup/status/1855670370659111242?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 10, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>In his follow-up post, he was sympathetic to employees who feel overworked and underpaid, particularly in software jobs outside the US. Mr Gupta clarified the intense work culture was not meant to be permanent, adding it was part of the early growth phase of a startup.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“This way of working isn't supposed to be forever because it isn't sustainable. It's the first year or two of a startup which is like reaching escape velocity. Like people said in the comments, as we mature we'll hire older, more experienced people who have families and can't work 100 hours a week, and naturally we would adapt like any good organisation,” he explained.</p>

<p>Mr Gupta's first post came under intense scrutiny, with many lambasting his approach and calling it a promotion of a “toxic work environment” and a “terrible mindset.” Some praised his transparency but warned that such conditions, unless accompanied by fair compensation, bordered on modern-day slavery.</p>

<p>In response to critics who suggested his approach was influenced by his Indian background, Mr Gupta clarified that his management style was shaped more by his experience in San Francisco's fast-paced startup culture than any cultural factors. "This is NOT meant to be prescriptive. Many other startups started the way we are starting," he added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will seek to build a "pragmatic" relationship with China that is "rooted in the UK's national interests" when he meets President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Brazil on Monday.</p>

<p>The meeting is the first to take place between a British prime minister and Xi since 2018, as Starmer's Labour government seeks to reset ties with China following years of tensions over human rights, Hong Kong, and allegations of Chinese espionage.</p>

<p>Relations between London and Beijing deteriorated in the last decade as Britain grew concerned that an open door to Chinese investment could pose national security risks, and that China's military and economic assertiveness may be acting against its interests.</p>

<p>But Starmer appears to be prioritising the need to boost trade to grow the economy, a task that may become more difficult if US President-elect Donald Trump follows through on his threat to impose tariffs on all imports and as Britain's economy continues to adapt to life outside the European Union.</p>

<p>"Close cooperation with the world's leading economies is vital to secure investment into the UK, and create the jobs needed to catalyse growth," Starmer said in a statement.</p>

<p>China is Britain's sixth-largest trading partner, accounting for 5% of goods and services trade worth 86.5 billion pounds ($112 billion), while Britain has a 1.2% market share of Chinese trade.</p>

<p>Xi and Starmer spoke for the first time in August, with the British prime minister stating that the two countries must be able to talk frankly about their disagreements while pursuing closer economic ties. Xi responded that he hoped Britain would treat China "objectively and rationally."</p>

<p>The Labour administration, which took power in July, has commissioned an audit of the UK-China relationship, and a more pro-business approach will draw fierce criticism from the opposition Conservative party which remains wary of Beijing.</p>

<p>British Foreign Secretary David Lammy visited China last month and finance minister Rachel Reeves is considering travelling to Beijing in early 2025.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two masked men broke into Britain's royal Windsor Castle estate last month and stole two vehicles from a barn, the Sun newspaper reported on Monday.</p>

<p>King Charles and his wife Camilla were not in the estate at the time of the incident but Prince William and his family were believed to be at Adelaide Cottage, part of the Windsor Castle estate, the Sun reported.</p>

<p>The men used a stolen truck to break through a security gate at night and then scaled a six-foot fence, the paper said.</p>

<p>Local police said officers were called to a report of a burglary on Crown Estate land in Windsor, west of London, just before midnight on Oct. 13.</p>

<p>"Offenders entered a farm building and made off with a black Isuzu pick-up and a red quad bike. They then made off towards the Old Windsor/Datchet area," Thames Valley Police told the newspaper. "No arrests have been made at this stage and an investigation is ongoing."</p>

<p>Windsor Castle previously faced a security scare in 2021 when authorities arrested a man with a crossbow in the grounds of the castle who said he had wanted to kill Queen Elizabeth.<br />

A video of Hana-Rawhiti Kareariki Maipi-Clarke soon took social media by storm on Thursday, with many appreciating the 22-year-old Te Pati Maori MP's bold statement.<br />
<br />
Ms Maipi-Clarke was joined by other MPs and spectators in the gallery. Moments later, speaker Gerry Brownlee briefly suspended the session.<br />
<br />
<strong>Who is Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>At 22, Hana-Rawhiti Kareariki Maipi-Clarke is the youngest sitting Member of Parliament in New Zealand in nearly two centuries. She represents Te Pati Maori in New Zealand's Parliament.</li>
	<li>Ms Maipi-Clarke studied at Te Wharekura o Rākaumangamanga in Huntly, New Zealand.</li>
	<li>She made headlines after being elected in the 2023 New Zealand elections. She performed the traditional haka during her maiden speech as well.</li>
	<li>Ms Maipi-Clarke gained attention in a local poll, where she was listed among the top five “preferred Prime Minister” candidates after Luxon's popularity dropped due to controversial policies. Both she and her father were considered candidates to represent Te Pati Maori in the 2023 elections. Ms Maipi-Clarke was ultimately chosen for her “youthful perspective.”</li>
	<li>She has been a vocal critic of Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and his conservative government, accusing them of undermining Maori rights.</li>
	<li>At 17, she <a href="http:// https://www.teaonews.co.nz/2020/07/03/17-year-old-launches-book-about-maramataka-maori/" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">published a book</a> called <em>Maahina,</em> focusing on maramataka, the Maori lunar calendar. She was inspired to explore this topic after attending a lecture by Rangi Matamua on Matariki.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Last year, she led a training course for the New Zealand Warriors about maramataka and Matariki.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two teenagers led police on a high-speed chase that ended in a fiery crash leaving both suspects arrested and facing multiple charges. Nineteen-year-old Michael Howell-McGlynn and Kristine Elisabeth Romero were on Thursday pulled out from the burning wreckage of a stolen 2015 Subaru Forrester after a dramatic pursuit through Berthoud, Colorado, US.<br />
<br />
The chase began after 4 am when officers from the Larimer County Sheriff's Office spotted the Subaru idling in a parking lot. Upon attempting to stop the vehicle, the suspects accelerated quickly, reaching speeds exceeding 160 kmph. As the teens neared an intersection, officers attempted to stop them by ramming their car. The Subaru struck a curb, crashed into a tree, and burst into flames.<br />
<br />
Despite the intense heat and smoke, officers managed to pull Howell-McGlynn and Romero from the vehicle, recovering a rifle from the wreckage. Both teens were taken to the hospital for treatment of their injuries and later booked into the Larimer County Jail.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Howell-McGlynn faces charges of reckless driving, obstructing a peace officer, and vehicular eluding, resulting in bodily injury to another. Romero is charged with conspiracy to commit a class 4 felony and an outstanding warrant for assault on a peace officer.<br />
<br />
In their mugshots, Howell-McGlynn appeared battered, his head wrapped in bandages with blood trickling down his chest, while Romero displayed a striking look with her two-toned hair, metallic silver eyeshadow, and a swollen, bloodied lip.<br />
<br />
Larimer County Sheriff John Feyen condemned the reckless behaviour, saying, “This driver's reckless behaviour shows a disturbing disregard for the safety of others. Our deputies will continue to protect this community and apprehend dangerous criminals who threaten lives and property in Northern Colorado,' as per the <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/17/us-news/colorado-carjackers-lead-cops-on-wild-chase-and-pose-for-near-perfect-mugshots/ " rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">NY Post</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

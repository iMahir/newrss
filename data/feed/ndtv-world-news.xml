       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eminent Indian Americans on Wednesday welcomed the re-election of Donald Trump as the 47th president of the United States and assured to work with him on several issues, including that of the US-India relationship.</p>

<p>"Congratulations to President Donald Trump on his decisive victory. We are in a golden age of American innovation and are committed to working with his administration to help bring the benefits to everyone," Google CEO Sundar Pichai said.</p>

<p>"The American people have spoken. Congratulations to President Trump on a strong win. Now, it's time for the American people to come together, pray for our country, and start the process of a peaceful transition," former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley said.</p>

<p>"That begins with Kamala Harris conceding. You can't just talk about unity in a campaign, you have to show it regardless of the outcome," Ms Haley said.</p>

<p>"What a great day for America! Let's take a moment to celebrate. Then begins the hard work to get our country back on track!" said former Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal.</p>

<p>"It's almost morning in America," said Vivek Ramaswamy, a Trump confidant. "Now let's go save a country," he said.</p>

<p>"Congratulations to President Trump. We look forward to working with him and his administration on issues of bilateral importance in the US-India relationship, and on global challenges that the two countries can lead on together," said M R Rangaswami, founder, Indiaspora, a community engagement platform.</p>

<p>"Congratulations President Elect Trump! America failed to elect its First Women President again! People have voted for a change to handle border issues, economy, immigration, crime, wars! I respect their choice. We did all we can!" said Ajay Jain Bhaturia, a major fundraiser of the Kamala Harris campaign.</p>

<p>New York-based prominent entrepreneur Al Mason said: "God saved Trump from two assassination attempts - there is a reason for the same. Trump is going to be a messiah for the American people and the rest of the world. There will be a very prosperous America, a safer world free of wars. In fact, a golden era begins for the United States of America."</p>

<p>Dr Krishna Reddy, chair of Indian American Friendship Council, congratulated Trump for the super victory. "This is the beginning of super US-India relations and together we keep the world safe again. This is the great strength of Indian Americans to build a robust economy again and Indian Americans are a great part of this success," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris called Donald Trump on Wednesday to congratulate him for winning the 2024 presidential election, one of her senior aides said, following a bitter and contentious race.</p>

<p>Democrat Harris discussed with Mr Trump the importance of a peaceful transfer of power and being a President for all Americans, said the aide, confirming that Ms Harris will deliver remarks in Washington later today.</p>

<p>During the acrimonious campaign, the Democratic presidential candidate had described Mr Trump as a unique threat to democracy, but her campaign in the end underwhelmed voters.</p>

<p>She will deliver her concession speech in Washington today (2.30 am IST).</p>

<p>Mr Trump had never conceded defeat four years ago when his supporters ransacked the US Capitol. He returned to the White House with wider margins than before despite a criminal conviction, two impeachments while last in office and warnings from his former chief of staff that he was a "fascist."</p>

<p>At 78, Mr Trump will be the oldest President during his inauguration scheduled on January 20. Had Ms Harris won, she would have been the first woman president of the US. "It's a political victory that our country has never seen before," Mr Trump said earlier today in his victory speech.</p>

<p>Global leaders swiftly pledged to work with Mr Trump, despite concerns in some parts of the world about his "America First" approach. Among the most worried countries will be Ukraine, which Russia invaded in 2022.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi was among the first leaders who dialled Mr Trump to congratulate him. "Had a great conversation with my friend, President Donald Trump, congratulating him on his spectacular victory. Looking forward to working closely together once again to further strengthen India-US relations across technology, defence, energy, space and several other sectors," PM Modi said in a post on X.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Had a great conversation with my friend, President <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@realDonaldTrump</a>, congratulating him on his spectacular victory. Looking forward to working closely together once again to further strengthen India-US relations across technology, defence, energy, space and several other sectors.</p>
— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) <a href="https://twitter.com/narendramodi/status/1854206814545740140?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>Mr Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance have scoffed at the billions of dollars in US assistance to Ukraine under outgoing President Joe Biden, with their aides musing about forcing Ukraine to make concessions to end the war.</p>

<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky congratulated Trump and said he hoped the new US leader would help Ukraine find a "just peace."</p>

<p>Ms Harris entered the race in July after the visibly ageing Biden dropped out. She ran a centrist campaign that highlighted Mr Trump's inflammatory messaging and use of racist and sexist tropes. But his apocalyptic warnings about immigration found their mark with voters battered by the post-Covid economy and eager for change after the Biden years.</p>

<p>Hispanic and Black Americans, seen as crucial voting blocs for Harris, moved in greater numbers toward Mr Trump, who won a majority of Latino men, exit polls had shown.</p>

<p>Mr Trump is the first US President in more than a century to win a non-consecutive second term, and the only person to be elected President as a convicted felon -- he is scheduled to face sentencing in a New York court for fraud on November 26.</p>

<p>He is also a longtime sceptic of climate change who is expected again to reduce US global commitments, although one of his top campaign surrogates was fellow billionaire Elon Musk, owner of electric vehicle maker Tesla.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Voters approved most of the referendums expanding the right to abortion in US states on Tuesday, while Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota rejected such measures, giving anti-abortion advocates their first victories since the US Supreme Court ended the constitutional right to the procedure in 2022.</p>

<p>A proposal to amend Florida's state constitution to guarantee abortion rights fell short of the 60% vote threshold needed to pass, Edison Research projected on Tuesday.</p>

<p>In Nebraska, voters faced two opposing ballot measures. They approved one enshrining the state's current 12-week ban, with exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother, The Associated Press projected. At the same time they rejected a measure that would have added the right to access abortions to the state constitution, the AP projected.</p>

<p>South Dakota voters rejected a proposed amendment that would have guaranteed abortion rights in the state constitution, the Associated Press projected. Abortion is presently banned in South Dakota, with few exceptions.</p>

<p>Edison projected abortion rights measures would pass in Arizona, Missouri, Nevada, Colorado, New York, Maryland and Montana.</p>

<p>The Missouri ballot measure was a notable win, marking the first time that voters in a state enforcing a total abortion ban approved a constitutional amendment that will guarantee abortion rights through fetal viability. The measure's passage will not automatically void the state's ban, but abortion rights advocates now expect they will win a legal battle to restore abortion rights within months.</p>

<p>Before Tuesday, seven states had put the issue of abortion rights directly to voters following the U.S. Supreme Court decision to overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling. Abortion rights campaigns had won all of those elections.</p>

<p>Edison Research said the Florida measure was approved by 57% of voters with 95% of votes counted. Since it failed to meet the 60% threshold, a ban on abortions after the sixth week of pregnancy that came into affect in May will stand.</p>

<p>Florida's ban after the sixth week has few exceptions.</p>

<p>Anti-abortion advocate Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, called Florida's result "a momentous victory." Her group also celebrated the results in Nebraska and South Dakota, and thanked politicians such as South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem and Nebraska Governor Jim Pillen.</p>

<p>Anna Hochkammer, director of Florida Women's Freedom Coalition, which backed that state's measure, noted that 57% still represented a majority of voters.</p>

<p>"The fight goes on because the women and girls of Florida continue to suffer," she said.</p>

<p>The Democratic Party's presidential candidate, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, had sought to build support for Tuesday's ballot measures that propose amending state constitutions to enshrine a right to abortion.</p>

<p>Democrats have blamed the Republican Party, led by former President Donald Trump, for the abortion bans that many of the measures sought to void. More than a dozen states banned abortion in all or most cases after the Supreme Court - with a Trump-appointed conservative majority - gutted the federal right to abortion.</p>

<p>Trump, a Florida resident, had said he would vote against the ballot measure, after initially appearing to suggest he would vote in favor.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump planned to name Kashyap Patel the deputy director of the CIA in the final weeks of his administration.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol class="CetSht_ol">
	<li class="CetSht_li">Kashyap 'Kash' Patel is of Gujarati ancestry and has said that his parents grew up in East Africa. According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/10/kash-patel-trump-national-security-council/679566/">The Atlantic</a>, his father fled Uganda, ruled by Idi Amin, in the 1970s and moved to the US.&nbsp;</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Mr Patel was born and raised in Garden City, New York in 1980. Raised Hindu, his senior-yearbook quote was by Jewish theologian Abraham Joshua Heschel: "Racism is man's gravest threat - the maximum of hatred for a minimum reason."</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">According to his Department of Defense profile, Mr Patel completed his undergraduate studies at the University of Richmond before returning to New York to earn his law degree, along with a Certificate in International Law from University College London Faculty of Laws in the UK.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The 44-year-old served as the former Chief of Staff to Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller. Before that, as the Deputy Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Counterterrorism at the National Security Council, he executed several of then-President Donald Trump's top priorities, including eliminating ISIS and al-Qaeda leadership like al-Baghdadi and Qasem al-Rimi, and the repatriation of many American hostages.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">He had also served as the National Security Advisor and Senior Counsel for the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, where he spearheaded the investigation into the Russian active measures campaign to influence the 2016 presidential election.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Having begun his career as a public defender, he tried many complex cases, including those related to murder, narco-trafficking and financial crimes in state and federal courts.&nbsp;</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The Atlantic report describes Mr Patel as the man "who will do anything for Trump", who is now the president-elect after pulling off a remarkable victory in the just-concluded elections.&nbsp;</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The report says Mr Patel joined the then-Trump administration in 2019 as a 40-year-old lawyer and rose up the ranks rapidly.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Trump also, the report said, planned to name Patel the deputy director of the CIA in the final weeks of his administration, but faced pushback.&nbsp;</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">At a gala of young Republicans last year, Trump had a message for Mr Patel: "Get ready, Kash. Get ready".</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The glass ceiling for women in politics just got even more daunting, as the prospect of a female US president has been shattered once again by Donald Trump. This isn't the first time Trump has stood in the way of history being made - he previously defeated Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election.</p>

<p>As the Center For American Women And Politics mentions, "Once again, a woman has reached for the highest office in American politics, has come close to breaking that barrier, but ultimately was not elected."</p>

<p>It's worth noting that women have been fighting for a spot in the Oval Office for centuries. Victoria Woodhull, a trailblazing stockbroker, newspaper publisher, and social reformer, was the first woman to actively pursue the presidency back in 1872.</p>

<p>Despite facing numerous challenges, including being four years too young to serve as president according to the US Constitution, Woodhull's courage paved the way for future generations of women in politics.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Harris' loss is reminiscent of Hillary Clinton's, except for the fact that Trump won all of the swing states this year whereas in 2016 he missed Nevada.</p>

<p>Both parties were endorsed by celebrities in their own style. Harris was backed by a guild of female celebrities such as Taylor Swift, Jennifer Lopez, Beyonce, Lady Gaga and Oprah Winfrey, whereas Trump had his own mantuary with Elon Musk, Hulk Hogan, Joe Rogan and more.</p>

<p>However, they were judged by double standards. Michelle Obama, former first lady, was of the opinion that, "We expect her to be intelligent and articulate, to have a clear set of policies, to never show too much anger, to prove time and time again that she belongs" talking about Harris. "But for Trump, we expect nothing at all. No understanding of policy, no ability to put together a coherent argument, no honesty, no decency, no morals."</p>

<p>The question remains: when will the glass ceiling finally shatter, paving the way for a woman to become the President of the United States?</p>

<p>At Trump's Pennsylvania town-hall, he had said, "Let's not do any more questions. Let's just listen to music", after a few people had some medical emergency. One of the songs that played in those 40 minutes was "It's a Man's, Man's, Man's World" by James Brown.</p>

<p>It's all about the politics in the playlist.</p>

<p>The fight continues.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shares in Tesla soared in pre-market trading Wednesday after Donald Trump claimed victory in the US presidential election and hailed the electric car company's boss Elon Musk as a "genius".</p>

<p>Tesla shares were up more than 15 percent at $289.44 in after-hours deals before the opening bell on Wall Street.</p>

<p>Investors welcomed the prospect of a Trump victory as Wall Street futures -- bets on what the price of a stock will be at a later date -- jumped as the former president appeared poised to defeat Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Musk shared a photo on his social media platform X showing him with Trump at an election watch party in Florida, and the Republican candidate singled him out during a celebratory speech.</p>

<p>"We have a new star, a star is born: Elon," Trump said, marvelling at Musk's SpaceX rocket and the deployment of the Starlink satellite internet service during Hurricane Helene.</p>

<p>"He's an amazing guy," Trump said. "He's a character, he's a special guy, he's a super genius."</p>

<p>Musk staunchly supported Trump during the campaign through America PAC, a political action committee that contributed tens of millions of dollars and doled out $1 million giveaways to registered voters in key states.</p>

<p>"Tesla shares are rising due to his special ties with Donald Trump," Andrea Tueni, analyst at Saxobank, told AFP.</p>

<p>Trump, Tueni said, "owes him a lot".</p>

<p>Investors are betting that their closeness "will turn into something positive for Tesla", Tueni added.</p>

<p>Trump said during the campaign that, if he won the White House, he would install the tech billionaire at the head of a government efficiency commission to eliminate "trillions" of dollars in wasteful spending.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's return to the White House next year could bring economic pain and difficult decisions for Canada's Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, once branded a "far-left lunatic" by the Republican.</p>

<p>The potential consequences include trade disputes that push Canada into recession since 75% of its exports go to the US, as well as thousands of people pouring north across the US border, analysts and economists said.</p>

<p>Trump's victory adds to Trudeau's trouble at a time polls show he would likely lose to his Conservative opponent in an election that must be held within a year. Canada's slowing economy and a rapid surge in the cost of living over the past few years are top campaign issues, which come against the backdrop of diplomatic disputes with China and India that have hampered efforts to diversify trade.</p>

<p>Canada, the world's No. 4 crude oil producer, is especially vulnerable to Trump's plan for a 10% tariff on all imports and his vow to boost US energy production.</p>

<p>Laura Dawson of the Future Borders Coalition, which seeks to smooth bilateral trade and travel, said the real challenge will be gradually declining investor confidence in America's northern neighbour.</p>

<p>"For&nbsp;Canada, four years of a Trump presidency could be very long indeed," she said.</p>

<p>Trump called Trudeau "a far-left lunatic" in 2022 for requiring truck drivers crossing the border to be vaccinated against COVID-19. In June 2018, Trump walked out of a G7 summit in Quebec and blasted the Canadian leader for being "very dishonest and weak."</p>

<p>Trudeau, who has been in power since 2015, congratulated Trump on Wednesday and said the friendship between the two nations was the envy of the world.</p>

<p>"I know President Trump and I will work together to create more opportunity, prosperity, and security for both of our nations," Trudeau said on X.</p>

<p>Asked about Trump's win on Wednesday, Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland sought to reassure Canadians.</p>

<p>"A lot of Canadians were anxious throughout the night and I want to say ... that Canada will be absolutely fine," she said. "We have a strong relationship with the United States, we have a strong relationship with President Trump and his team."</p>

<p>In January, however, Trudeau told reporters another Trump presidency would be "a step back" that made life tough for Canada.</p>

<p>Desjardins Economics analysts forecast Trump's policies would result in real Canadian gross domestic product falling by 1.7% by end-2028 compared to what would have happened under a Democratic president.</p>

<p>The Canadian Chamber of Commerce said Trump's planned 10% tariff would cut Canada's real income by 0.9% annually and labor productivity by nearly 1%. If other countries retaliate, setting off a trade war, real income would drop by 1.5% annually, with labor productivity falling by nearly 1.6% each year, the chamber said.</p>

<p>Trump first took office in 2017 vowing to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, the trilateral trade deal with Mexico and Canada, complaining that trading partners were taking advantage of the US.</p>

<p>After 18 months of sometimes rancorous talks, which at one point saw the United States and Canada imposing sanctions on each other's products, the pact was reborn as the US-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) deal.</p>

<p>Trump said on Oct. 11 he would use an existing USMCA clause to start renegotiating the treaty in 2026.</p>

<p>"I'm going to have a lot of fun," he said.</p>

<p><strong>RECESSION INDUCING</strong></p>

<p>David Doyle, Macquarie's head of economics for the Americas, said Trump's promised policies had the potential to be a significant economic shock for Canada.</p>

<p>"It's possible that it is a recession-inducing event because it's on such an enormous scale that we really haven't seen for almost 100 years," he said.</p>

<p>Canada staved off the worst during the USMCA talks by proactively sending officials and politicians to dozens of US states to highlight the benefits of free trade.</p>

<p>Kirsten Hillman, the long-serving Canadian ambassador in Washington, said Canada has "a very good ability to push back" on the 10% tariff proposal and had already been talking to Trump's camp about it.</p>

<p>"We've been spending a lot of time talking to the Trump team, his advisers, saying ... this just isn't the right move," she told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. in mid-October.</p>

<p>Liberal officials are careful not to say anything derogatory in public about the Republican leader.</p>

<p>But in January, Trudeau told a meeting of senior Liberals that a second Trump administration would be of "a magnitude more challenging" for Canada than the first, according to a source who was present in the room.</p>

<p>Policy clashes seem inevitable, both domestically and internationally, especially if Trump follows through on his plan to deport millions of people living in the US illegally.</p>

<p>"I predict you're going to have a huge flood north of many of those folks trying their chances here," said Jason Kenney, former immigration minister in the Conservative government that ruled from 2006 to 2015.</p>

<p>"We could have a true crisis in terms of homelessness and pressure on our social system just months away," he told a podcast organized by the National Post before the election.</p>

<p>The United States and Europe could well retreat into hostile competing blocs, stranding Canada in the middle, said Kim Richard Nossal, professor of politics at Queen's University in Kingston and author of a book on Canada's likely isolation if Trump's movement were to regain power.</p>

<p>"The implications for Canada are, in my view, dramatic," he said, predicting Trump would insist Ottawa spend far more on defense.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's return to power in the United States will have a positive outcome on Israeli interests, several experts interviewed by AFP said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Still, some were cautiously optimistic at the prospect of a second Trump term, given his unpredictability during his first term from 2017 to 2021, particularly when it came to foreign policy.</p>

<p><strong>Why such enthusiasm over Trump's win?</strong></p>

<p>Former president Trump favoured Israel many times in his first term, and Israeli leaders were among the first to congratulate him on Wednesday as soon as he claimed victory.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated Trump over "history's greatest comeback!", and newly appointed foreign affairs minister Gideon Saar hailed him as a "true friend of Israel".</p>

<p>Opinion polls showed that 66 percent of Israelis wanted Trump back in power, with pundits pointing to his family ties to Israel and his daughter's conversion to Judaism.</p>

<p>During his first term, Trump broke the historic US policy of neutrality over the status of Jerusalem, whose eastern half has been occupied by Israel since 1967.</p>

<p>As early as 2017, he recognised the city as Israel's capital and the following year moved the American embassy there.</p>

<p>Trump also recognised Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, the strategic northern region annexed by Israel in 1967 and which the international community views as Syrian territory.</p>

<p>Trump's government also said it did not view Israeli settlements in the West Bank as illegal, despite international law saying they are.</p>

<p>Lastly, American diplomats in Trump's first administration largely facilitated the normalisation of Israeli ties with more Arab states, which Israelis view as a way of securing their country's future.</p>

<p><strong>What do Israelis expect from him?</strong></p>

<p>With Israel at war for more than a year and amid several diplomatic setbacks, "Trump's win is a big emboldening for Netanyahu", according to Mairav Zonszein, an expert at the International Crisis Group, pointing to the two leaders' similar political style.</p>

<p>She added that the result was hailed by the "far right and the settler right in Israel", who expect a US policy that is more favourable to settlers in the West Bank.</p>

<p>Analysts noted that Trump will favour Israel's interests on the international scene.</p>

<p>"Considering what he said and what he's done before, we expect him to be tougher on Iran," said international relations expert Yonatan Freeman of Jerusalem's Hebrew University.</p>

<p>Freeman predicted new talks with Iran pushing "for a better deal for Israel's security", enabled by the new American president.</p>

<p>Several experts pointed to the issue of US military support. President Joe Biden waved this as a potential pressure point in Gaza war ceasefire talks, but it would no longer be a threat under Trump.</p>

<p><strong>What are the main challenges?</strong></p>

<p>"It is sometimes preferable to deal with predictable people even if we don't really like them, rather than unpredictable people,", Yossi Mekelberg, an expert on Israeli geopolitics at Chatham House, told AFP.</p>

<p>Mekelberg pointed to past disputes between Trump and Netanyahu, including in 2020 when Trump saw Netanyahu's congratulations to Biden on winning the election as a betrayal.</p>

<p>Trump's statements since then have sometimes seemed contradictory, between his support for Israel and his wish for an end to the war in Gaza, despite overtures from Netanyahu.</p>

<p>In July, both men met when the Israeli prime minister visited the United States, suggesting that the two may have patched things up.</p>

<p>"You can't really analyse someone that has no coherent line of thinking," Mekelberg concluded.</p>

<p>Zonszein said some Israeli leaders appear to have prematurely decided on Trump's position on "Israel's treatment of Palestinians".</p>

<p>"It's not necessarily clear that he would kind of just stand aside while Israel continues to de facto annex the West Bank", she said, pointing to his past opposition to aspects of Israel's annexation plan and his support for the Abraham Accords.</p>

<p>The 2020 Abraham Accords saw Bahrain, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates establish formal ties with Israel.</p>

<p>Because of strategic alliances and diplomatic dynamics, "it's not at all certain that Trump will be happy to support Israel's war on all fronts", Zonszein said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>Saudi Arabia's King Salman and his son, de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, congratulated Donald Trump on his election victory on Wednesday, state media reported.</p>

<p>The two leaders sent cables to Trump, who cultivated warm Saudi ties during his first administration. King Salman hailed "close relations between the two friendly countries and peoples, which everyone seeks to strengthen and develop in all fields", the official Saudi Press Agency (SPA) said.</p>

<p>Later on Wednesday, SPA reported that Prince Mohammed called to congratulate Trump on his win and "expressed the kingdom's aspiration to strengthen the historical and strategic relations between the two countries, wishing the friendly American people progress and prosperity under His Excellency's leadership".</p>

<p>After taking office in 2017, Trump quickly courted Saudi Arabia, long an important energy and security partner for Washington.</p>

<p>His first overseas visit was to the Saudi capital Riyadh, where he basked in an elaborate welcome involving a sword dance and a fly-past of air force jets.</p>

<p>The honeymoon period later cooled, with Prince Mohammed faulting Trump for failing to respond more aggressively after a 2019 attack widely blamed on Iran halved the Gulf kingdom's crude output.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden criticised Saudi Arabia harshly while on the campaign trail for human rights abuses including the 2018 killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.</p>

<p>But the relationship with Biden dramatically improved, and the two sides attempted to negotiate a so-called mega-deal in which Saudi Arabia would recognise Israel in exchange for a defence pact with the United States and help on a civilian nuclear programme.</p>

<p>That deal was put on ice after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7 last year, triggering war in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>Last week, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan told an investor forum in Riyadh that his government could potentially move "quite quickly" on some bilateral agreements with Washington even if the mega-deal remained out of reach.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's science minister, Hossein Simaei, on Wednesday described a female student's public act of stripping down to her underwear as "immoral and uncustomary".</p>

<p>"She broke the norms, and her behaviour was not based on sharia, was immoral and uncustomary," Simaei said on the sidelines of a weekly cabinet meeting, adding she had not been expelled from her university.</p>

<p>Footage circulated online Saturday showing a woman, identified as a student at the Islamic Azad University in Tehran, sitting and briefly walking around campus and later on the street in her underwear.</p>

<p>"Those who republished this footage spread prostitution," said Simaei, adding such incidents "should not be encouraged as they are neither morally nor religiously justified."</p>

<p>Media outlets in Iran shared a blurred clip of the student.</p>

<p>Amnesty International said she "was violently arrested after she removed her clothes in protest against abusive enforcement of compulsory veiling by security officials."</p>

<p>Covering the neck and head and dressing modestly became mandatory for women in Iran following the 1979 Islamic revolution.</p>

<p>Government spokesman Fatemeh Mohajerani dismissed reports that the incident began with a hijab warning and denied she was violently arrested.</p>

<p>"The issue was actually something else," she said, noting that "this level of nudity is not accepted anywhere."</p>

<p>"The girl was not dealt with harshly in any way," she added.</p>

<p>In a statement Saturday, the university said the girl was "handed to the police station" and found to be "under severe pressure and suffering from a mental disorder."</p>

<p>Months-long nationwide protests shook Iran following the September 2022 death in custody of 22-year-old Iranian-Kurd Mahsa Amini.</p>

<p>Amini had been arrested for allegedly violating the Islamic republic's strict dress code for women, requiring them to cover their head and neck and wear modest clothing in public.</p>

<p>Her death triggered months-long protests in Iran, with hundreds of people, including dozens of security personnel, killed in the unrest. Thousands of demonstrators were arrested.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many congratulations are coming Donald Trump's way after he secured a historic comeback to the White House as the United States' 47th President. One such greeting came from celebrated Indian chef Vikas Khanna, along with a gentle reminder.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a post on Instagram, Vikas Khanna shared a picture of him shaking hands with Donald Trump when the latter visited India during his last stint as US President in 2020. Addressing Trump as "Mr President", Vikas Khanna said that he hopes to cook Indian cuisine at the White House and reminded Trump of a promise made by him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Hello Mr. President! Hope to cook Indian cuisine at The White House as you promised the last time we met," he captioned the post.&nbsp;</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump's pledge to stop renewable energy projects on "day one" of his potential presidency has sent shockwaves through the industry, causing renewable energy shares to plummet.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's pledge to stop renewable energy projects on "day one" of his potential presidency has sent shockwaves through the industry, causing renewable energy shares to plummet.&nbsp;“We are going to make sure that that ends on day one,” Trump said about offshore wind farms.<br />
According to a Reuters report, the world's largest offshore wind developer Orsted fell as much as 14 per cent while wind turbine makers Vestas and Nordex traded down around 11 per cent and 7.5 per cent respectively.</p>

<p>This isn't Trump's first rodeo with renewable energy; in his previous campaign, he claimed that solar panels require massive spaces, like entire deserts, to generate energy. However, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, the actual land requirement for solar panels is relatively small, with most utility-scale solar operating today taking up less than 600,000 acres.</p>

<p>If Trump follows through on his promise, it could have significant implications for the renewable energy sector as he might try to eliminate or reduce tax credits for renewable energy projects, which could cripple the industry's growth.</p>

<p>He could dismantle environmental regulations put in place by the Biden administration, making it easier for fossil fuel companies to operate.</p>

<p>A Trump presidency could lead to a shift in energy policy, prioritising fossil fuels over renewable energy sources.</p>

<p>Trump has vowed to end the electric vehicle mandate, which could harm the EV industry and its related infrastructure. Donald Trump's stance on electric vehicles has taken a dramatic turn.</p>

<p>Just last December, he posted on Truth Social that EV supporters should "rot in hell". However, after talks with Elon Musk, Tesla's CEO and the world's richest man, Trump suddenly softened his tone. Now, he claims to be "for electric cars" and thinks they're suitable for "a small slice" of the population.</p>

<p>At a recent rally, Trump admitted that his change of heart was largely due to Musk's endorsement. "I'm for electric cars - I have to be, because Elon endorsed me," Trump said. "I have no choice". This shift is quite surprising, considering Trump's history of criticising electric vehicles, even calling them a "hoax".</p>

<p>It's essential to note that Trump's ability to implement these changes would depend on various factors, including congressional support and potential pushback from states, businesses, and activists. Nevertheless, the uncertainty surrounding Trump's energy policies has already caused concern among renewable energy investors and proponents.</p>

<p>Solar stocks are plummeting due to concerns that a second Trump presidency could jeopardise the Inflation Reduction Act, a crucial legislation that has driven a clean energy surge in the US by offering tax incentives to boost solar power. The act has been instrumental in fuelling growth in the renewable energy sector.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[In a meeting with one of America's most powerful unions in September at its Washington headquarters, Vice President Kamala Harris said she'd protect union jobs and workers' livelihoods better than Donald Trump.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a meeting with one of America's most powerful unions in September at its Washington headquarters, Vice President Kamala Harris said she'd protect union jobs and workers' livelihoods better than Donald Trump.</p>

<p>But leaders of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, long staunchly allied with her Democratic Party, appeared unconvinced. When Harris argued that her Republican rival was no champion of the working class, the union bosses grilled her, questioning whether she and President Joe Biden had done enough for union workers, according to a Teamster leader who recounted the Sept. 16 meeting to Reuters. Within days, the union publicly embarrassed Harris by declining to endorse a Democratic presidential candidate for the first time since 1996.</p>

<p>In the wake of Harris' loss of the 2024 presidential election, her tense exchange with union leaders underscores a critical failure of her campaign: connecting with working-class voters anxious about the economy and high prices.</p>

<p>Following Biden's dramatic withdrawal just months before Election Day, Harris threw her campaign together as if it were an airplane being built while in flight, her advisers told reporters. The 60-year-old former prosecutor and U.S. senator pressed a case that Trump was a threat to democracy and women's rights, while promoting a populist economic platform and reproductive freedoms.</p>

<p>Her entrance upended a race that her party had looked set to lose. She made history as the first woman of color at the top of a major party ticket. She triggered a surge in enthusiasm, broke fundraising records - raising $1 billion in less than three months - and drew endorsements from celebrities ranging from pop star Taylor Swift to actor and former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.</p>

<p>But Harris' campaign ultimately failed to overcome deep-seated voter concerns about inflation and immigration - twin issues that opinion polls showed favored Trump. Her loss underscores a profound shift in American politics over the past decade as blue-collar voters have turned increasingly Republican - a trend Trump appears to have accelerated.</p>

<p>Harris also struggled to counter another Trump-era trend: a torrent of misinformation unprecedented in modern U.S. elections. An avalanche of misrepresentations and falsehoods about her record was spread by the former president and amplified on right-wing websites and media, including conspiracy theories on issues ranging from migrant crime to voter fraud.</p>

<p>When asked by Reuters during the race about misinformation amplified by Trump, his campaign officials typically either repeated the falsehoods or did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>By early Wednesday morning, Trump had won 279 electoral votes to Harris' 223, with several states yet to be counted. This account of how Harris lost is based on Reuters interviews with Harris campaign staffers, White House officials, Democratic Party advisors and close allies.</p>

<p>It was always going to be a heavy lift. The U.S. has only once elected a president - Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 - who wasn't a white man. As the daughter of an Indian mother and Jamaican father, Harris had risen higher in the country's leadership than any other woman.</p>

<p>The only other woman to get as close as she did - Hillary Clinton, defeated by Trump in 2016 - staked her candidacy in part on becoming the first female president. In the wake of Clinton's loss, Harris resisted putting her identity at the center of her campaign, said close aides and advisors. Instead, she tried to galvanize voters on issues that mattered to women and Black voters in the election - from abortion rights to middle-class tax cuts and housing affordability.</p>

<p>But those messages struggled to break through at a time when many voters were fixated on rising consumer prices during the first three years of the Biden administration.</p>

<p>"Despite fairly strong economic growth, especially after a major global pandemic, most Americans weren't feeling like they were getting ahead economically," said Melissa Deckman, a political scientist and chief executive of Public Religion Research Institute, a nonpartisan research firm. "The Harris campaign did not necessarily do a good job of explaining how her policies would help the middle class, or at least that message wasn't really resonating with a lot of voters."</p>

<p>A majority of voters said they trust Trump more to handle the economy, with 51% saying they did so compared to 47% for Harris, according to a preliminary national exit poll conducted by data provider Edison Research. And the voters who identified the economy as their primary concern voted overwhelmingly for Trump over Harris - 79% to 20%.</p>

<p>The economy proved to be a much bigger concern among voters than reproductive rights, with 31% of voters saying the economy mattered most in deciding how to vote compared with 14% who cited abortion. The election also saw a large gender gap. Harris won 54% of women voters in the country, while Trump won 44%, the preliminary exit polls showed.</p>

<p>The Harris and Trump campaigns and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>"America has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate," Trump said early on Wednesday to a roaring crowd of supporters at the Palm Beach County Convention Center.</p>

<p><strong>ELECTORAL GOLD</strong></p>

<p>The election was punctuated by dramatic twists, including two assassination attempts against Trump and the stunning decision by Biden to abandon his re-election bid on July 21.</p>

<p>Democrats coalesced behind Harris with astonishing speed, locking up her party's nomination within two weeks, excited by her potential to flip the generational argument on Trump. Two decades her senior, Trump had successfully cast the 81-year-old Biden as a frail and confused old man. She would turn that on its head, many Democrats hoped.</p>

<p>Some Democratic strategists questioned the wisdom of one of her first big decisions: picking Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as running mate over Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, a deft speaker with proven political strength in a must-win state. Her campaign had hoped the gun-owning Walz, a liberal policy champion and plain-speaking National Guardsman from the Midwest, would help her win over rural white voters.</p>

<p>Walz had generated buzz before Harris picked him by branding Trump and his running mate, Senator JD Vance of Ohio, as "weird" on national television in July, winning Democratic hearts and media attention. Later, though, Walz gained unwelcome attention for misstatements of his biography, including his military service, and for an uneven debate performance against Vance.</p>

<p>Walz and Vance didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>Still, the Harris campaign believed her signature issues - reproductive rights and Trump's divisiveness - would energize a coalition of women, Black voters, young Americans, independents and "Never Trump" Republicans, sweeping her to the White House.</p>

<p>Well before the race began, Harris emerged as a spokesperson for abortion rights. When the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 officially reversed Roe v. Wade, declaring the constitutional right to abortion no longer existed, the setback for women's reproductive rights created an unexpected opening for Harris.</p>

<p>The ruling catapulted her from the political periphery into the heart of America's culture wars. Opinion polls showed most Americans disapproved of the court's decision - and Harris became the face of an issue that Democratic strategists saw as electoral gold.</p>

<p>For the first time in Biden's presidency, he handed a decisive issue entirely to his vice president. She went on the road, speaking forcefully on a subject that played an outsized role in helping Democrats stave off an expected bloodbath in the 2022 congressional elections. After the midterms, with the Democrats having held the Senate and swung to a slight minority in the House of Representatives, Harris was now seen as a viable future leader in the party.</p>

<p>Still, even after Biden stepped aside, concerns lingered among some top White House aides over the former San Francisco district attorney's political skills - including a perception that she hadn't made a mark as VP, her short-lived campaign for the 2020 Democratic nomination and her limited experience courting conservative voters in battleground states. Some also questioned whether she could overcome the long history of racial and gender discrimination in the U.S.</p>

<p>After securing the nomination, Harris initially put many of those concerns to rest. She revitalized a beleaguered Democratic campaign, attracting record-high funding and a groundswell of support. She soon moved ahead of Trump in the polls, a sign she was sparking enthusiasm among voters, particularly among women. Trump had previously been seen as the front-runner, partly based on his perceived strength on the economy after several years of high inflation under Biden.</p>

<p>She aced her first big test - a Sept. 10 televised debate against Trump.</p>

<p>As Harris's team prepared for what would be her only in-person face-off with Trump, they focused on ways to unnerve the former president and draw attention to his frequent falsehoods on policies, according to several aides involved in the preparations. Harris holed up in Pittsburgh with advisers and conducted mock debates for the prime-time showdown, the aides said.</p>

<p>The strategy paid off. Harris appeared to get under her rival's skin during the debate. She pressed Trump on the economy, Ukraine, healthcare, the January 2021 Capitol riots and abortion, leaving him rattled and struggling to respond.</p>

<p>Fundraising spiked: Her campaign said it raised $47 million in the 24 hours after the debate. Most voters thought Harris had won, polls showed. Trump shot down offers for another debate, claiming he'd already beaten her.</p>

<p>On the campaign trail, Harris mocked Trump's debate performance, including his comment that he had "concepts of a plan" to replace a federal health care law. As she gained in polls, Harris' campaign believed she was opening up states that had been out of reach for Biden, including North Carolina, where the president had his narrowest loss against Trump in 2020 and where she was drawing even in the polls with Trump.</p>

<p><strong>'IT COULD COST US THE ELECTION'</strong></p>

<p>North Carolina was the scene of her next big test, the late September Hurricane Helene, one of the deadliest storms to hit the U.S. in the last 50 years. The storm shifted focus from messages at the foundation of Harris' campaign to the handling of the disaster by the Biden-Harris administration.</p>

<p>It hit just as her lead was narrowing. Trump went on the attack, criticizing the Democratic administration's response to the disaster and tying it to his strongest issue, immigration. As the death count rose and swathes of North Carolina lay devastated, Trump amplified and spread falsehoods, including a claim that Harris spent disaster-assistance money on housing illegal migrants.</p>

<p>In response to a recent request for comment by Reuters about false claims about how disaster funds were being used, the Trump campaign repeated accusations that money had been spent on housing migrants in the country illegally.</p>

<p>Harris cut short a campaign swing and flew to Washington on Sept. 30 for a briefing on Biden's emergency response. On her plane, three staffers sat on the floor, ripping apart briefing books, replacing the pages with new notes, a Reuters reporter witnessed.</p>

<p>The disaster, which killed more than 200 people, marked a shift in the race, as misinformation around the administration's response and Trump's hard-line rhetoric on immigration gained traction. The baseless claims included that the government covered-up deaths, confiscated charitable donations and diverted disaster funds to help immigrants. Harris' campaign struggled to address both the false claims and voters' concerns about an uptick in illegal border crossings during Biden's presidency.</p>

<p>One jurisdiction that illustrated the risks for Harris was Buncombe County, a North Carolina Democratic stronghold of about 280,000 people hammered by the storm. In its aftermath, Democrats stopped targeting potentially persuadable Republican voters there because of concerns they had become too hostile amid the misinformation, Kathie Kline, Buncombe County Democratic chair, told Reuters. In the end, Trump won the state.</p>

<p>As the race tightened through October, and polls indicated a toss-up, alarm spread among Democratic strategists.</p>

<p>They focused on shoring up the so-called Blue Wall of Democratic states: Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Eight years ago, when Trump beat Hillary Clinton, he breached the Blue Wall by winning all three states, each by less than a percentage point. In 2020, Biden won them back. Holding the Blue Wall now was Harris' best path to the White House, the strategists reasoned. But they had a problem: Michigan and the Gaza War.</p>

<p>Michigan's large population of Arab Americans and Muslims helped cement Biden's 2020 victory in the state. Trump turned off many of these voters in his first term, in part by banning immigration to the U.S. from a number of Muslim countries early in his tenure.</p>

<p>In the race's final stretch, Muslim and Arab-American voters told Reuters they were disappointed Harris did not distance herself more from Biden's unwavering support of Israel during the Gaza war. In the final weeks, Trump aggressively courted their vote. Many said they would sit out the election or vote Republican.</p>

<p>Harris staffers knew that disillusioned Muslim and Arab-American Democrats were a risk. "It could cost us the election," said a senior Michigan operative for Harris in July.</p>

<p>The campaign ultimately concluded it was impossible to fully win back those voters. To offset their loss, campaign officials said they focused in the final weeks on marshaling enough support from union workers and Black voters in Detroit, the nation's largest Black-majority city.</p>

<p><strong>ECONOMIC THREATS</strong></p>

<p>But few issues threatened Harris like inflation.</p>

<p>Her campaign had hoped the economic recovery from the pandemic would be a winning issue. Growth is markedly more robust in the U.S. than in other major industrial nations. Stock-market indexes are near record highs.</p>

<p>Instead, the issue eroded Democratic support throughout much of 2024 as union workers and non-college-educated white voters broke for Trump, polls showed. Sharp increases in housing and food costs frustrated voters, overshadowing a strong job market. Trump blamed Harris for the spike during her and Biden's time in office.</p>

<p>While most unions have long supported Democratic candidates, rank-and-file workers in recent years have moved behind Trump, proving a decisive factor in his victory. There were some positive signs for Harris. The AFL-CIO, the largest federation of unions, saw a surge in female members supporting Harris and willing to volunteer for her, AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler told Reuters.</p>

<p>In the final weeks of the race, Harris' momentum appeared to have stalled, with polls showing her edge over Trump narrowing. By mid-October, the race was a dead heat in crucial states.</p>

<p>A pronounced gap in polling between men and women had emerged, too. While Harris cut away at the Republicans' longstanding edge with white voters overall by gaining ground with white women, Trump appeared to be boosting his advantage with men.</p>

<p>Harris shifted strategy in an attempt to win over more men and Republicans. The campaign dispatched running mate Walz on a tour in mid-October to reach male voters. Harris also held campaign events with former lawmaker Liz Cheney, one of Trump's fiercest Republican critics and one of the most prominent conservatives to endorse the Democrat. Days later, Trump suggested Cheney should face gunfire in combat, drawing outrage among Democrats and pundits.</p>

<p>The vice president also sharpened her attacks on Trump. In an Oct. 29 speech billed as her closing argument, Harris warned of the dangers of another Trump presidency. He was "unstable" and sought "unchecked power," she told a rally held at the spot in Washington where Trump addressed his supporters before they attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. With a well-lit White House behind her, she cast herself as a defender of democracy, unity and freedom.</p>

<p>She also sought to reassure voters about the cost of living. Trump's proposals to raise tariffs would amount to "a 20% national sales tax" on imported goods, she said. She vowed to "protect hard-working Americans who aren't always seen or heard."</p>

<p>In the end, not enough of those Americans believed her.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vice President and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris will deliver a speech conceding defeat in the US presidential election to Republican candidate Donald Trump, the White House said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Harris will deliver the speech at 4 pm local time (2.30 am IST on Thursday) at Howard University in Washington.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the vice president had cancelled her election night speech after it became clear that former president Trump would cross the magic mark of 270 electoral college votes and return to the White House as the 47th president of the United States.</p>

<p>Despite polls predicting that the election was too close to call, Trump steamrolled Harris and went on to pick up key swing states, including Pennsylvania, Georgia and Wisconsin, setting the stage for his return to the Oval Office.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He also won the popular vote, becoming the first Republican to do so in 20 years, after George W Bush in 2004.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Delivering a victory speech to a room full of roaring supporters in Florida, Trump said "America has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate".&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Powerful, Unsuccessful Campaign</strong></p>

<p>Harris, who had 224 electoral college votes as of Wednesday night against Trump's 280, ran a powerful campaign in her bid to become the first woman president of the United States. The 60-year-old former prosecutor also made history as the first black woman and the first South Asian woman to get the presidential nomination from a major party. She raised $1 billion in less than three months and was endorsed by celebrities like Taylor Swift, Beyonce and Oprah as well as several Republicans.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But her campaign failed to overcome Trump and his MAGA (Make America Great Again) movement's messaging around the economy and immigration, which proved to be key concerns for voters going into this year's elections. Several polls showed that people felt they were better off under Donald Trump during his presidency (2016-2020) than they were under the Joe Biden-Harris administration.</p>

<p>Experts said that as the vice president in an unpopular administration, Harris could not successfully portray herself as the candidate of change, which is something Trump did very effectively. Asked during a daytime show about what she would do differently from Biden, Harris had said, "Not a thing comes to mind".</p>

<p>Many felt Harris was also handicapped by the fact that she had only a few weeks to campaign after Biden dropped out of the race in July. Trump, on the other hand, had been getting his message out to voters since before the 2016 elections and continued to occupy a space in the national consciousness in the US even after leaving office in 2020.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Record Setter</strong></p>

<p>At 78, Trump is the oldest person to be elected the president of the US and only the second to be elected for two non-consecutive terms - after Grover Cleveland in 1897. The former president survived an assassination attempt during the campaign and, after the victory, described the political movement helmed by him as the greatest of all time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We are going to help our country heal, fix our borders, we made history for a reason tonight. We have achieved the most incredible political win. I want to thank the American people. I will fight for you and your family with every breath in my body," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Stock markets surged in the US and several other countries, including India, after his victory.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain's Prince William said today that his wife Kate was doing "really well" and had been amazing in a year when she has undergone preventative chemotherapy for cancer.</p>

<p>The British heir to the throne is currently in South Africa where he will later host the annual awards ceremony for his multi-million-dollar Earthshot Prize. He made the trip without Kate who is still recovering from her treatment.</p>

<p>He said she would be cheering him on from their home in Britain.</p>

<p>"She's doing really well thanks," he told the BBC ahead of his environmental prize's awards ceremony in Cape Town. "She's been amazing this whole year. I know she will be really keen to see tonight be a success."</p>

<p>As well as Kate, he said he hoped their three children George, 11, Charlotte, 9, and Louis, 6, would also be watching on proudly, saying they as a family did what they could to help the environment.</p>

<p>"We go through all the basics of recycling and making sure we minimise water use and turning off lights when we leave the house and stuff like that," he said.</p>

<p>William set up the Earthshot prize to find innovations to combat climate and other green issues in 2020, inspired by U.S. President John F. Kennedy's 1960s "moonshot" project which led to the 1969 lunar landing. Five winners receive 1 million pounds ($1.3 million) every year to drive their projects.</p>

<p>Asked how he could convey his Earthshot message during a tough political climate for environmental causes, he told the BBC: "I think everyone wants some hope and wants some optimism."</p>

<p>He said the young people of Africa who would attend the awards would show how important the issue was to them.</p>

<p>"Without them, you know, the future is looking pretty bleak," he said.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Ms Clark's progress was validated by the Dunedin PACE blood test, which examines biomarkers associated with ageing.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US woman was recently recognized by the "Rejuvenation Olympics" for achieving a slower ageing rate than billionaire Bryan Johnson, known for using his son's blood to maintain a youthful appearance. Julie Gibson Clark, a dedicated biohacking enthusiast, has managed to slow her ageing process by an impressive 34% compared to the average person. As the daughter of a NASA astronaut, Ms Clark has drawn on both discipline and innovation, sharing that her daily longevity routine costs just $12 a day.</p>

<p>Ms Clark's progress was validated by the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/news/epidemiologists-develop-state-art-tool-measuring-pace-aging" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>Dunedin PACE blood test</em></a>, which examines biomarkers associated with ageing.</p>

<p>Her commitment to health began in childhood, inspired by her father, a former NASA astronaut from the 1970s Skylab missions, who taught her to view food as fuel and prioritize nutrition for optimal performance. Although Ms Clark, now 56 and a professional recruiter, embraced these principles more earnestly in adulthood, her focus has since turned to longevity and stress reduction, aiming to stay active and healthy to fully enjoy life and time with her teenage son, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.businessinsider.in/science/health/news/a-56-year-old-recruiter-sets-aside-12-a-day-for-her-longevity-routine-to-slow-aging-heres-how-she-spends-it-/amp_articleshow/114990175.cms" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>Business Insider</em></a> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over the past 25 years, Clark has steadily refined her personal health regimen. Starting with dietary supplements and home-cooked meals in her 30s to address chronic acid reflux, her approach eventually expanded. She eliminated alcohol and phased out antidepressants, crediting her improvements to dietary and lifestyle changes. Clark keeps her routine flexible, making adjustments that align with her core intention- a long, fulfilling life centred on travel, learning, and family.</p>

<p>"You've got to figure out your 'why,' your intention, and your resources," Clark told Business Insider, emphasizing the importance of a clear, sustainable goal in biohacking.</p>

<p>Ms Clark's method prioritizes affordability and simplicity, diverging from high-cost interventions. Rejecting short-term "beach body" trends, she views her practices as lifelong. Her routine builds slowly, adding new habits one at a time until they feel as natural as brushing one's teeth.</p>

<p>Her daily routine includes morning prayer, a 7 AM workout followed by a sauna and cold shower, and a meditation break in the afternoon. Clark describes her post-workout sauna and cold shower as a "mini spa" experience, a cornerstone of her wellness routine.</p>

<p>Diet plays a central role, with Clark aiming for a pound of vegetables each day, focusing on a colourful mix from purple carrots to sweet potatoes. She balances this with lean proteins like chicken, eggs, and locally sourced meats.</p>

<p>She particularly enjoys spinach, which she keeps on hand for easy summer meals and blends into a mid-morning "greens latte" in colder months. Rich in fibre, vitamins, and phytochemicals, Clark's vegetable-heavy diet supports longevity, providing a range of health benefits backed by science.</p>

<p>Medical professionals endorse her choices. Dr Dean Sherzai, an expert in dementia prevention, recommends leafy greens for brain health. Clark's diet, which includes Omega-3s and B vitamins for brain function and energy, is further bolstered by leafy greens to address common magnesium deficiencies.</p>

<p>New research also suggests that hormone therapy and vitamin D supplementation could support healthy ageing in postmenopausal women. Studies have associated vitamin D and calcium intake with a reduced risk of certain cancers in women, adding further benefits to Clark's nutritional approach.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump's second presidential term could herald a new wave of attacks on abortion access across the United States -- with or without a Republican-controlled Congress.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's second presidential term could herald a new wave of attacks on abortion access across the United States -- with or without a Republican-controlled Congress.</p>

<p>Here's a closer look at the legal tools available to a future administration intent on curtailing the right -- and how abortion rights defenders are preparing to fight back.</p>

<p><strong>- Federal actions -&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>For advocates of abortion rights, the nightmare scenario is a Republican-controlled Congress enacting sweeping national restrictions or an outright ban.</p>

<p>But even without that, Trump could "do a lot of damage to abortion access" through federal actions and judicial appointments, American University law professor Lewis Grossman told AFP.</p>

<p>The Republican former president's Supreme Court picks were pivotal in dismantling decades of legal precedent protecting the national right to abortion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While Trump has at times hinted at moderation during the 2024 campaign -- even suggesting he might veto any anti-abortion "ban" that lands on his desk -- some fear Project 2025 as the real battle plan.</p>

<p>Published by the ultra-conservative Heritage Foundation, the document offers a roadmap for harsher executive branch restrictions, developed with input from former Trump officials. Trump has publicly distanced himself from the document.</p>

<p><strong>- New conditions on abortion pills -&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Experts predict abortion pills could be Trump's first target.</p>

<p>Mifepristone, which prevents pregnancy progression, and misoprostol, which empties the uterus, accounted for nearly two-thirds of US abortions last year, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.</p>

<p>Medical abortion used to require in-clinic visits. However, President Joe Biden's government made prescription by telehealth and pills in the mail permanent in 2021.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A Trump administration might reinstate in-person requirements or roll back other eased regulations, said George Washington University law professor Sonia Suter -- a simpler step than rescinding approval, though that is also possible.</p>

<p><strong>- Reviving obscenity law -&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Anti-abortion activists are eyeing the Comstock Act, a 19th-century law prohibiting the mailing of "obscene" materials, including items for "producing abortion."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The US Justice Department under Biden currently interprets this law as inapplicable to approved abortion pills.</p>

<p>But Suter told AFP that a broad interpretation could apply to "anything used to produce an abortion -- materials for surgical abortions -- which could effectively create a national ban."</p>

<p>This could disrupt the supply chain in clinics and hospitals across states where abortion is currently legal -- or where it may soon be permitted through state-level referendums on November 5.</p>

<p>"There is nothing nefarious or 'backdoor' about enforcing the laws that Congress has enacted and repeatedly reaffirmed," conservative lawyer and scholar Josh Craddock told AFP.</p>

<p><strong>- Judicial appointments and more -</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
A Trump administration could also seek to undo the stringent patient privacy protections put in place by Biden for women seeking abortions out-of-state, said Suter, paving the way for possible prosecutions when they return home.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although the Supreme Court's conservative majority has already overturned Roe v Wade, experts say the power to appoint federal judges remains paramount.</p>

<p>Courts may soon be called on to decide the fate of state laws that make it harder for women to access care in more abortion-friendly states, Grossman explained.</p>

<p><strong>- Fightback begins -</strong></p>

<p>Abortion rights advocates swiftly branded Trump's election victory a "deadly threat."</p>

<p>A second Trump administration would compound the "harms" of the first "with new, potentially far worse ones," warned Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights in a statement Wednesday.</p>

<p>"We will vigorously oppose any and all attempts to roll back progress," she said, vowing to "take the fight to them at every turn."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's return to the White House with his protectionist policies poses threats for the global economy, with the prospect of new trade wars, resurgent inflation and slower growth, experts say.</p>

<p><strong>Global trade threatened?</strong></p>

<p>During his first term in office from 2017 to 2021, Trump often resorted to punitive tariffs in disputes with trade partners.</p>

<p>In this 2024 campaign, he pledged to impose an additional 60 percent import tariff on Chinese products and an extra 10 percent tariff on products from the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Taking into account the probable retaliatory measures from Beijing and Brussels, the impact on the European Union economy will be $533 billion through 2029, $749 billion for the United States and $827 billion for China, according to a study by the Roland Berger consulting firm.</p>

<p>A separate study by the London School of Economics estimated that the impact on emerging market nations such as India, Indonesia and Brazil would be much less.</p>

<p>Jamie Thompson, head of macroeconomic forecasting at London-based Oxford Economics, said he sees little shot-term economic impact due to the delays in implementing policies, but they could be positive for growth.</p>

<p>"While the outlook for 2025 is essentially unchanged, global growth is likely to be a little stronger in 2026 and 2027 on the back of the election result, as the impact of looser US fiscal policy more than offsets the drag from targeted tariff measures," he told AFP.</p>

<p>But if across-the-board tariffs are imposed it "could leave the global economy around 0.75 percent smaller -- and global trade down some three percent -- by the end of the decade," he added.</p>

<p>The prospects for international cooperation, which can boost trade and growth, will also be dimmer under a second Trump administration, said Tara Varma, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution, a US think tank.</p>

<p>"The multilateral world of the 1990-2000s will no longer exist," she said, adding that she anticipates a brutal change in US policies.</p>

<p><strong>A surge in inflation?</strong></p>

<p>Donald Trump's policies could also rekindle inflation, which cooled following a series of interest-rate hikes that the Federal Reserve began to unwind this year.</p>

<p>The Peterson Institute for International Economics, a US think tank, estimated it could add between two and four percentage points to China's inflation rate.</p>

<p>The impact of "immigration policy is as important as global trade" on inflation, noted for his part Gilles Moec, chief economist at insurer Axa.</p>

<p>If Trump follows through with talk of a massive expulsion of unauthorised immigrants it could aggravate the labour shortage in the United States.</p>

<p>The Pew Research Center estimated that 8.3 million unauthorised workers could be affected.</p>

<p>The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated this could add more than two percentage points to the US inflation rate next year, 0.2 percentage points in Europe and 0.6 percentage points in China.</p>

<p>Moec noted the surge in inflation would force central banks to hit the brakes on the cycle of interest rate cuts they began earlier this year as inflation subsided.</p>

<p>Analysts had been looking at lower interest rates to spur consumers to spend and companies to invest and put some more wind into the sails of the global economy.</p>

<p><strong>Trade war to snuff out growth?</strong></p>

<p>The trade war that Trump has threatened to wage against China risks sapping global growth.</p>

<p>Asia accounts for 60 percent of global growth, but would be hit hard by a trade war between the United States and China, the International Monetary Fund warned earlier this month.</p>

<p>The United States has also been one of the fastest growing developed economies but Trump's policies risk shaving two percentage points off US GDP per year between 2027 and 2031 from baseline estimates, according to a forecast from the Peterson Institute.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Millions of Americans on Wednesday celebrated <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/78-year-old-donald-trump-oldest-person-to-be-elected-us-president-6957306#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll_Imagetopscroll" target="_blank">Donald Trump's remarkable return to the White House</a> - the 78-year-old defied pre-poll predictions to become the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/2024-us-elections-donald-trump-set-to-become-first-republican-to-win-popular-vote-in-20-years-6955598" target="_blank">first Republican in 20 years to win the popular vote</a> en route to the presidency. But not everyone was quite so happy.</p>

<p>Among his critics was Vanity Fair, a monthly magazine on popular culture and current affairs, which featured Mr Trump on the cover of its newest digital issue, with a sequence of numbers highlighting the legal disputes that still surround the President-elect.</p>

<p>At the top of the list is the&nbsp;<strong>34</strong>&nbsp;<strong>felony charges</strong> the incoming American President faced in a criminal case in the State of New York. The court ruled Mr Trump altered business records to hide over $400,000 in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/he-should-be-adult-star-stormy-daniels-breaks-silence-on-donald-trumps-conviction-in-hush-money-trial-5802000" target="_blank">payments made to Stormy Daniels</a>, an adult film actor, to try and conceal details of their sexual encounter. He was convicted - the next number, <strong>1 conviction</strong> - on all counts in May.</p>

<p>Mr Trump - who slammed the entire case as a "witch hunt" and protested his innocence - is the first felon to be elected as President of the United States. He has said he will appeal the verdict.</p>

<p>Sentencing was delayed till after the result of this election; it will be held on November 26, while a separate hearing on immunity for the incoming President is expected on November 12.</p>

<p>If the latter hearing goes as Mr Trump will want - i.e., if the court rules he enjoys immunity as a former President - then the former will be dismissed, since the guilty verdict will be overturned.</p>

<p>Even if there is to be no immunity, Mr Trump can now surely postpone any sentencing, although he cannot, as President, pardon himself since this is a state and not federal case.</p>

<p>In the extremely unlikely case the sentencing goes through, Mr Trump could face a maximum of four years in prison, but sentencing a President-elect days before he takes oath (on January 20) would be unprecedented. Mr Trump has also asked for the case to move to a federal court.</p>

<p>The next number - <strong>2&nbsp;cases pending</strong>.</p>

<p>In the first pending case are four charges in a Washington, D.C. court accusing Donald Trump of spreading false claims of election fraud to try and block collection and certification of votes cast in the 2020 election. This is, perhaps, the big one, since it deals with the January 2021 attack on the Capital.</p>

<p>The attack - by a mob of Donald Trump's supporters - was widely seen as being precipitated by incendiary speeches from the outgoing President, claiming, as he had for weeks earlier without any evidence, that his election win had been "stolen by emboldened radical-left Democrats".</p>

<p><strong>FROM THE ARCHIVE |</strong> <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-capitol-violence-donald-trump-summoned-supporters-to-wild-protest-and-they-did-2348901" target="_blank">Trump Summoned Supporters To "Wild" Protest. They Came</a></p>

<p>The US Supreme Court offered some relief for Mr Trump after ruling some of his actions had immunity, but prosecutors then revised charges to name him as a private citizen instead.</p>

<p>Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges and cast the prosecutions as politically motivated.</p>

<p><strong>FROM THE ARCHIVE |&nbsp;</strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-calls-his-speech-before-us-capitol-siege-totally-appropriate-2351514" target="_blank">"Appropriate": Trump Defends Speech Before Capitol Violence</a></p>

<p>The trial date for this has not yet been set, and with Mr Trump's election win now, it is unclear if and when this will move forward. As President, Mr Trump can pardon himself for these charges.</p>

<h3><strong>The Georgia Case</strong></h3>

<p>In the second case, the President-elect and 18 others are accused of criminal conspiracy in trying to overturn his defeat in Georgia in 2020; he lost the state's 16 electoral votes to Democrat Joe Biden, but popular vote loss was less than 0.5 per cent - 49.47 to Mr Biden and 49.24 to Mr Trump.</p>

<p>The investigation hinges on a call Mr Trump allegedly made, asking a senior George polling official to "find 11,780 votes" - which would have put him a single vote ahead of his rival.</p>

<p>Mr Trump pleaded not guilty, but the trial itself has been delayed by his team seeking to disqualify the public prosecutor for a romantic relationship with a man she hired to work on the case.</p>

<p>Oral arguments on that matter are scheduled for December 5, but Mr Trump's lawyers are already looking ahead and have said they will ask the court for a suspension of proceedings based on the argument a President ought not to face a criminal prosecution while in office.</p>

<p>As with the New York case, Mr Trump cannot pardon himself as this is a state case, and he also cannot shut down these proceedings as he could the Washington, D.C. charges.</p>

<p>However, this case has also been paused with no certainty on when it will resume.</p>

<p>The other numbers on the Vanity Fair cover pertain to Mr Trump's <strong>2 impeachments</strong> - one in December 2019 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, and the other in 2021, after the Capitol attack. In both cases Donald Trump was acquitted by the Senate.</p>

<p>The Vanity Fair cover also mentions Mr Trump's <strong>6 bankruptcy filings</strong>, and conclude on a sharply scathing note: "<strong>4 more years</strong>... the 47th American President."</p>

<p>But these numbers are trumped by another - 280, the number of electoral college votes in Mr Trump's pocket and which confirm that he will be the next President of the United States, despite a spirited (and hopeful) but ultimately futile challenge by Democrat Kamala Harris.</p>

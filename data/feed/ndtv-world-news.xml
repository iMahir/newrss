       <description><![CDATA[It all started with an AI-generated "MySpiritHalloween.com" website that published details of a Macnas Halloween Parade event, asking Dublin city residents to join in from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Artificial Intelligence can do a lot. But nobody - at least not the partygoers in Dublin, Ireland - realised that it would pull out a party trick on Halloween this year. Dublin residents hit the streets in anticipation of a Halloween carnival full of wonky costumes and trick-or-treat shenanigans, but there was no parade.</p>

<p>It all started with an AI-generated "MySpiritHalloween.com" website that published details of a Macnas Halloween Parade event, asking Dublin city residents to join in from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. during Halloween week. What happened next left a lot of the people on the streets and on the internet confused. As reported by Vice, thousands lined the streets of Dublin but were left bemused by the absence of a parade.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

No Gardai around, no official announcement, people waiting on the wrong side of the road...<br />

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The city police had to come into action to clear the streets, according to netizens who posted about the downer on TikTok. The city police, also known as Gardai in Ireland, took to X (formerly twitter) to inform the citizens that there was no real parade scheduled and asked the people to clear the streets safely.</p>

<p>It was later found out that the website that ran the article with the event details was allegedly an SEO company based in Pakistan that had done so for ad revenues. In an Interview with Vice, the owner of the website, Nazir Ali, insisted that the whole debacle was a "big misunderstanding."</p>

<p>Ali explained that he runs an SEO company that ranks articles on Google for ad revenues. He suggested that the website was an honest work of humans and AI was used only for "10 per cent" of the work, insisting that fully AI-generated content does not get ranked so high on Google. "We asked ChatGPT to write the article for us, but it wasn't ChatGPT by itself. So, we took help from AI, we took help from ChatGPT, but we optimised that ourselves."</p>

<p>Whatever the case might be, it was a big no-show downer for Dublin party enthusiasts. Next time you plan to go to a party that was posted online, Think twice! AI might just be playing "Trick or Treat" with only tricks up its sleeve.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Neft Daslari lies deep in the Caspian Sea, around 100 kilometres off the coast of Azerbaijan's capital Baku.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Deep in the Caspian Sea, around 100 kilometres off the coast of Azerbaijan's capital Baku, lies Neft Daslari, the world's oldest offshore oil platform. Also known as “Oil Rocks”, this vast, rusting city has been shrouded in mystery for decades.<br />
<br />
“The degree of mystery was enormously high,” filmmaker Marc Wolfensberger, who first discovered Neft Daslari in the late 1990s, told <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/06/climate/oil-rocks-neft-daslari-caspian-sea-city/index.html " rel="nofollow,noindex">CNN</a>. “It was beyond anything I had seen before.”<br />
<br />
Constructed in the late 1940s during the Soviet era, Neft Daslari began as a lone drilling rig on a tiny island and has since grown into an extensive network of oil wells, production sites, and over 100 miles of bridges. At its peak, this floating city housed more than 5,000 inhabitants and produced millions of tonnes of oil. Today, fewer than 3,000 workers remain, working 15-day rotations amid an environment slowly being reclaimed by the sea.<br />
<br />
Neft Daslari has long faced environmental issues, with concerns over pollution and oil spills in the Caspian. Mirvari Gahramanli, head of the Oil-Workers Rights Protection Organisation, has raised alarm over untreated wastewater and reports of oil discharge.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
SOCAR, Azerbaijan's state-run oil company, pledged to take action, saying in a 2019 post that it would “take appropriate administrative measures on employees who pollute the environment.” Still, environmental advocates remain worried about the platform's long-term impact.<br />
<br />
As production dwindles, so does Neft Daslari's significance in Azerbaijan's oil industry, with output now down to under 3,000 tonnes per day. With COP29 around the corner, where global leaders will discuss climate initiatives, Neft Daslari is an obvious symbol of the fossil fuel industry's environmental costs.<br />
<br />
Mr Wolfensberger believes the city could have a future beyond oil. “It's really the cradle of offshore oil exploration,” he said. Many, including energy experts, see potential in converting Neft Dasları into a tourist destination or even a museum, honouring its legacy. For now, however, the rusting platform continues its slow decline.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Donald Trump call each other friends, but analysts say that looming trade disputes will test their cosy relationship when the latter again becomes US president.<br />
The bear hugs and bonhomie both men have shared during their official encounters belie Trump's occasionally aggressive posture towards New Delhi in his first term, when he dubbed India a "tariff king" and "trade abuser".</p>

<p>Trump pledged to impose "reciprocal" tariffs on countries that have trade surpluses with the United States, a move that could stymie industries in the world's fifth-largest economy.</p>

<p>"Look at the direction Trump wants to take America... to bring economic and industrial activity back to the US," Indrani Bagchi, the chief executive of the Delhi-based Ananta Aspen Centre think-tank, told AFP.</p>

<p>"For decades America has lived off the idea that things are produced elsewhere and you get them cheap," she added.</p>

<p>"If manufacturing indeed moves back to the US, what does that mean for countries that have a trade surplus with America?"</p>

<p>India is the ninth-largest trading partner of the United States, with a trade surplus of more than $30 billion in the 2023-24 financial year.</p>

<p>PM Modi's government has also sought to promote local manufacturing through its "Make in India" campaign, offering simplified laws and generous tax concessions for new enterprises.</p>

<p>This initiative has borne fruit with a growing presence by Apple and other tech giants seeking to diversify their supply chains out of China.</p>

<p>And India's biggest tech companies, including TCS and Infosys, have become corporate leviathans by giving their American counterparts a means to outsource their information technology needs to a cheaper labour force.</p>

<p>All could take a hit if Trump seeks to fulfil his pledge to bring jobs back onshore and unleash a "tariff war", Ashok Malik of business consultancy The Asia Group told AFP.</p>

<p>Trump's reprisal of his aggressive first-term trade policy will again be primarily aimed at China "but won't leave India unaffected," he added.</p>

<h2><strong>'A friend of mine'</strong></h2>

<p>PM Modi and Trump heaped praise on each other in a joint appearance at a Houston stadium during Trump's first term in 2019, touting a close, personal alliance in front of tens of thousands of Indian-Americans.</p>

<p>Around 50,000 people attended the event, billed as the largest gathering ever staged for a foreign leader other than the pope in the United States.</p>

<p>PM Modi returned the favour the next year by hosting Trump at a rally in his home state of Gujarat that was attended by an estimated 100,000 people.</p>

<p>"He's a friend of mine," Trump said of PM Modi on a podcast hosted by comedian Andrew Schultz last month.</p>

<p>"On the outside, he looks like he's your father. He's the nicest. Total killer."</p>

<p>Professor Harsh V Pant of King's College London told AFP that India stood to benefit from the personal warmth shared between the two leaders.</p>

<p>"Modi is certainly the kind of strong leader Trump likes," he said.</p>

<p>"Embracing Modi is politically convenient, optics are good, and there are a lot of positives for Modi to exploit."</p>

<h2><strong>Migration 'PR disaster'</strong></h2>

<p>The years ahead nonetheless threaten major diplomatic frictions that could upset their mutual camaraderie.</p>

<p>India is among the largest sources of legal migration into the United States, but tens of thousands of Indians have also entered the country illegally in recent years by crossing the Canadian and Mexican borders.</p>

<p>That will necessarily be a problem when Trump pursues his avowed policy to crack down on illegal immigration, Bagchi said.</p>

<p>"We are looking at a PR disaster if Indians are picked up and mass deported," she added.</p>

<p>India has unveiled a slew of new partnerships with the United States under the Modi government, including in defence, technology and semiconductor production.</p>

<p>The world's most populous country is also a member of the US-led Quad alliance, with Australia and Japan, seen as a means of countering China's growing strength in the Asia-Pacific.</p>

<p>Trump's "unpredictability" raises doubts whether this trajectory of ever-closer cooperation will continue, said Pant.</p>

<p>"The fact that he doesn't view the world in a strategic sense, there is a transactionalism always inherent in his approach -- that makes it complicated and brings uncertainty."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After Donald Trump's landslide victory in the US presidential election, a family photo posted by his granddaughter, Kai, has drawn massive attention -- for the unexpected presence of tech mogul Elon Musk. The billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, holding his son X Æ A-12, stood on the edge of the Trump family circle telling position. Trump's wife, Melania, was absent in the photo.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Posting the image on X, Kai Trump wrote, “The whole squad.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Donald Trump won the presidential elections on Tuesday, defeating Democratic rival Kamala Harris by 69 electoral votes. During <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-election-results-live-thats-why-i-love-you-big-elon-musk-mention-in-donald-trumps-victory-speech-6955600 ">his victory speech</a>, Trump took the opportunity to publicly thank Mr Musk for his support, calling him a “special guy” and a “super genius.” “We have a new star. A star is born: Elon. He is an amazing guy,” Trump said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He also mentioned the billionaire spent two weeks in Philadelphia, in different parts of Pennsylvania, campaigning with Trump. “Only Elon can do this. That's why I love you, Elon," Trump said.</p>

<p>Mr Musk, who endorsed Trump after an assassination attempt in July, played a prominent role in the election cycle, donating more than $100 million to Trump's re-election campaign. He campaigned aggressively in swing states, and used his social media platform, X, to attack Trump's opponents and rally support.</p>

<p>Trump has reciprocated Mr Musk's support by offering him a prominent role in his administration. The President-elect suggested creating a new position of “government efficiency,” with the X owner at the helm. On the campaign trail, Trump even hinted at Mr Musk being the potential “Secretary of Cost-Cutting” – a position Mr Musk is interested in taking.</p>

<p>According to Reuters, Mr Musk's financial backing of Trump is part of a broader strategy to protect his companies from government regulation and secure access to critical subsidies.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[In his victory speech, Donald Trump had said that America's borders will be sealed immediately, apart from mentioning the possible reduction of taxes.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In his first speech even before the number of electorate votes in his favour crossed the halfway mark, President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday announced various measures his administration will implement during his second term in the White House. These ranged from immigration to taxes to conflicts.</p>

<p><strong>Here is a look at the seven key priorities:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>End Wars:</strong> "I'm not going to start wars, I'm going to stop wars," the Republican US presidential nominee said in his victory speech. "We had no wars, for four years we had no wars. Except we defeated ISIS," Mr Trump said. While it is not clear whether he referred to the Russia-Ukraine war or the one in Middle East, he said he will&nbsp;end the conflict "within 24 hours" of assuming office.</li>
	<li><strong>Deport undocumented migrants:&nbsp;</strong>America's borders will be sealed immediately, allowing no illegal immigrants to enter the country, Mr Trump said in his victory speech. This is a promise he has repeatedly mentioned in his campaign speeches, to the extent of vowing the biggest mass deportation in US history. He also pledged to finish building the wall on the Mexico border.</li>
	<li><strong>Lower inflation, increase tax cuts: </strong>Mr Trump said he will Trump&nbsp;"end inflation" and sweeping tax cuts.</li>
	<li><strong>Cut climate regulations:&nbsp;</strong>"Leave the oil to me," Mr Trump quipped during his victory speech, referring to supporter Robert F Kennedy Jr's career as an environmental lawyer who opposed big oil. "He's a great guy, and he really means that he wants to do some things, and we're going to let him go to it. I just said, 'But Bobby, leave the oil to me,'" he told his supporters. The Republican has vowed to increase production of US fossil fuels.</li>
	<li><strong>No national abortion ban:</strong> Mr Trump had&nbsp;said during the presidential primary with rival Kamala Harris that he would not enact a national abortion ban, leaving to states to decide their own laws on the matter.</li>
	<li><strong>New tariffs on foreign goods; China snub:</strong> Mr Trump&nbsp;has proposed tariffs of at least 10 percent&nbsp;on foreign goods. Amid cold ties with China, he said imports from the country could bear an additional 60 percent tariff.</li>
	<li><strong>Pardon some accused in Jan 6 Capitol riots: </strong>Mr Trump said he will pardon some of the people convicted for being a part of the riots witnessed at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. On the day, his supporters had forced their way into&nbsp;the building to protest the 2020 Presidential victory of Joe Biden.</li>

       <description><![CDATA[The OpenAI CEO along with his four colleagues- Kevin Weil, Srinivas Narayanan, and Mark Chen held an "Ask Me Anything" on social media website Reddit, spilling the beans on some important updates regarding their flagship product, ChatGPT.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The recent Reddit AMA by OpenAI offered a glimpse into what ChatGPT has in store for its users across the globe., They AMA was led by the key leadership at OpenAI - CEO Sam Altman, Chief Product Officer Kevin Weil, Senior Vice President of Research Mark Chen, and Vice President of Engineering Srinivas Narayanan. They answered everything from the scoop on ChatGPT updates to the broader vision they see for the future of AI. Their comments on the questions that Redditors posted reflect the roadmap to OpenAI's ambitious future.</p>

<p>First off, Sam Altman answered the one question that is on every AI enthusiast's mind: When is GPT-5 coming? The answer was a bit anticlimactic when he admitted that it was not slotted for this year, but something "really good" was on the cards instead.<img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/7aq6mbbg_reddit-1_625x300_07_November_24.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></p>

<p>The new release will apparently be more advanced and better than before, with improvements not just in text but also to other multimedia inputs as well.</p>

<p>The most interesting note for daily users of ChatGPT is the announcement by Kevin Weil that revealed OpenAI is working on an expansion of the context window-that is to say, how many tokens the model can hold in memory at a given time. This means a user will be able to carry on deeper, more continuous conversations with ChatGPT, which is going to drastically improve efficiency for tasks like long-form conversations and intricate code. "We're working on it!" Weil responded to a question asking for a longer context window, adding that the current 32k token limit "is way too small compared to other AI models".</p>

<p>And if ChatGPT's voice capabilities, released only a few months back caught your attention, you're in for a bigger treat. Kevin hinted that the chatbot might soon be able to "sing to you," suggesting an added voice interaction update that could even include music.</p>

</div>

<p>OpenAI's DALL-E image generation model is also under refinement though all the details about the release of the next iteration are still under the covers.</p>

<p>Altman and his team also seemed incredibly enthusiastic about autonomous AI agents- an AI system that can take actions on your behalf without the prompts of a user- an AI clone of yourself. "This will be a big theme of 2025."</p>

<p>AI agents reflect a significant step toward Altman's larger stated goal: AGI, or Artificial General Intelligence, which is essentially AI that could potentially understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being is capable of. Altman also answered in the affirmative when another user asked whether AGI was achievable with the currently available hardware.</p>

<p>Apart from the announcements, there were also reflections on the past and present of ChatGPT. Mark Chen, the company's research SVP, acknowledged that the AI model has had a persistent problem with "hallucinations" whereby ChatGPT confidently provides information it knows to be incorrect. "Our models learn from human-written text, and humans sometimes confidently declare things they aren't sure about."</p>

<p>Chen suggested that this challenge is being met by OpenAI using reinforcement learning- a mechanism whereby models get feedback on accuracy by themselves- and by grounding the responses of ChatGPT in more trusted sources. Chen believes these improvements will gradually make ChatGPT much more reliable and accurate.</p>

<p>So, while a ChatGPT-5 may not be on the horizon, there is still plenty to look up to in terms of our AI future. This AMA was not just peppered with information, but also gave an inside on the personalities behind the AI flagbearer ChatGPT. One curious Redditor asked, "I'm curious, why did you write all your names correctly capitalized, except for 'sam altman - ceo' all in smalls?" Kevin Weil, the company's "product guy" replied, "It's sams vibe."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a first sighting so far north, an emperor penguin appeared on a beach in Australia, thousands of kilometres from its Antarctic home. The malnourished penguin, “way bigger than a seabird,” was spotted on Friday on Ocean Beach in Denmark, Western Australia.</p>

<p>It now remains in the care of a trained and registered local wildlife carer, according to a statement from Australia's Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions (DBCA). “The rehabilitation process is expected to take a few weeks,” a DBCA spokesperson said, as per <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/06/science/emperor-penguin-australia-scli-intl/index.html" rel="nofollow,noindex">CNN</a>, adding the wildlife carer is being supported by a DBCA officer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ocean Beach is more than 3,540 km north of Antarctica, suggesting the penguin swam much further to reach Australia. Belinda Cannell, a research fellow at the University of Western Australia, told <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-11-05/emperor-penguin-rare-sighting-ocean-beach-wa-denmark/104559588" rel="nofollow,noindex">ABC</a> News the penguin might have followed a current north from Antarctica. “What they tend to do is follow certain currents where they're going to find lots of different types of food,” Ms Cannell said. “So maybe those currents have just tended to be a little bit further north towards Australia than they normally would.”</p>

<p>Local surfer Aaron Fowler shared his experience with ABC News, recalling the moment he saw the penguin. “It was massive, it was way bigger than a sea bird and we're like, what is that thing coming out of the water? And it kind of had a tail sticking out like a duck,” Ms Fowler said. “It stood up in the waves and just waddled straight up to us, an emperor penguin, he was probably about a meter high, and he was not shy at all.”</p>

<p>Mr Fowler added, “He tried to do like a slide on his belly, thinking it was snow, I guess, and just face-planted in the sand and stood up and shook all the sand off.”</p>

<p>Emperor penguins are the largest and heaviest of all penguin species, standing up to 45 inches tall and weighing up to 88 pounds. They are only found in Antarctica, where they rely on sea ice for breeding and protection. However, they face growing threats from climate change as rising temperatures put their icy habitats at risk.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-023-00927-x" rel="nofollow,noindex">Nature study</a> published in August 2023 revealed that four of the five emperor penguin colonies in the Bellingshausen Sea experienced a “catastrophic breeding failure” in 2022 due to severe loss of sea ice. This marks the first such recorded incident and contributes to predictions that more than 90 per cent of emperor penguin colonies will be “quasi-extinct” by 2100 as global temperatures rise.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's Ambassador to India, Reuven Azar expressed his views on Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 US presidential elections and spoke to ANI about prospective foreign policy shifts of the United States. He also shared his expectations from India amid rising tensions in the Middle East.</p>

<p>On being asked what policy shifts Israel is expecting after the change in the administration, Ambassador Azar called the electoral decisions "quite significant political development in the United States".</p>

<p>He shared that since they had previously interacted and worked with the Trump presidency, Israel knows how they work. "We're looking forward to engaging with them. During the first Trump administration, a lot of achievements were achieved in the Middle East, especially the Abraham Accords. We are looking forward to the expansion of that".</p>

<p>He also added, "First of all, we have to concentrate on finishing the war, finishing the job, neutralizing the threats that we have against us in our region. And if we are successful in neutralizing those threats, I think it will lay the foundations for creating the stability and prosperity that we all want".</p>

<p>On being asked about response towards the statement by Hamas wherein it called for US to end its support to Israel, the Ambassador said, " I think that what we should concentrate right now is in making sure that Gaza will no longer be held hostage by Hamas, especially not the Palestinian population.".</p>

<p>He said, "They (Palestinians) deserve a much more moderate and mature leadership that will engage with us (Israel) in creating the stability that we need in our region, in negotiating peace, in giving the Palestinians a real chance to rule themselves with a government that will actually seek cooperation and not the destruction of our country".</p>

<p>Ambassador Azar said that while coming towards a resolution of the conflicts in West Asia, "India is going to be an essential part of it because it (India) has a lot of things to offer to countries in our region".</p>

<p>He also commented on Israel's expectations from the government of India when it comes to the tensions in West Asia. "We are continuing our dialogue with the Indian government".</p>

<p>"We are all waiting for a situation in which we can reengage in projects of connectivity between Asia and Europe in working together with governments in the region to lay the foundations for the logistic and economic infrastructure that we need in order to do more trade, cooperate more in technology, and advance solutions that solve day-to-day issues for normal people in the world".</p>

<p>India's 2023 G20 presidency saw the country bringing forward the idea of the India-Middle East Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC).</p>

<p>The corridor would provide reliable and cost-effective cross-border ship-to-rail transit network to supplement existing maritime routes, thereby increasing efficiency, reducing costs, securing regional supply chains, increasing trade accessibility, enhance economic cooperation, generate jobs and lower greenhouse gas emission, resulting in a transformative integration of Asia, Europe and the Middle East. However due to the conflict in West Asia the project is facing challenges.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran on Thursday called Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election an opportunity for the United States to reassess past "wrong policies".</p>

<p>Trump, who is set to return to the White House in January after defeating US Vice President Kamala Harris in Tuesday's election, had pursued a "maximum pressure" strategy on Iran during his first term.</p>

<p>"We have very bitter experiences with the policies and approaches of different US governments in the past," foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei was quoted as saying by state news agency IRNA.</p>

<p>Trump's win, he added, was a chance "to review previous wrong policies".</p>

<p>Iran and the United States have been adversaries since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, which overthrew the Western-backed shah, but tensions peaked during Trump's first term from 2017 to 2021.</p>

<p>Before Trump was declared the winner on Wednesday, Iran had dismissed the US election as irrelevant.</p>

<p>"The general policies of the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran are fixed," said government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter who becomes president. Plans have already been set so that there is no change in people's livelihood," she added.</p>

<p>During his first term, Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and imposed harsh sanctions on the Islamic republic.</p>

<p>In 2020, under Trump's presidency, the United States killed revered Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps general Qasem Soleimani in an air strike on Baghdad airport.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The victim's daughter told police that her mother's new haircut was the motive behind the attack.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Pennsylvania man has been arrested and charged with homicide after allegedly fatally stabbing his girlfriend in a violent attack. According to court documents obtained by <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.pennlive.com/crime/2024/11/man-charged-with-homicide-in-fatal-central-pa-stabbing.html">PennLive</a></em>, Benjamin Gual, 49, allegedly stabbed his 50-year-old girlfriend to death because he was upset that she had cut her hair.&nbsp;The victim's daughter reportedly told police that her mother's new haircut was the motive behind the attack. She further revealed that Gual had previously threatened to stab her mother over the haircut, prompting Carmen Martinez-Silva to seek temporary refuge at her daughter's home overnight.</p>

<p>After spending the night at her daughter's home, Martinez-Silva visited her brother's residence and simultaneously asked a friend to inform Gual that their relationship was over, according to the probable cause affidavit. Meanwhile, Gual had been searching for her and eventually tracked her down to her brother's home.</p>

<p>Upon arrival, Gual was initially told by Martinez-Silva's brother that she wasn't there. However, when he returned minutes later, he violently attacked the brother with a knife. Martinez-Silva intervened in an attempt to protect her sibling, but Gual turned his aggression towards her, unleashing a frenzied stabbing attack.</p>

<p>Martinez-Silva was found dead at the scene by cops while her brother suffered multiple stab wounds.&nbsp;Two bystanders who attempted to intervene and stop the stabbing spree narrowly escaped being knifed by Gual.</p>

<p>When police arrived at the scene, they found Benjamin Gual still present, sitting in his car with the knife used in the attack still in his hand. The knife had visible blood on it, according to court documents. Gual has been charged with multiple counts, including homicide, attempted homicide, aggravated assault, and reckless endangerment.&nbsp;He is currently being held at the Lancaster County Jail without bail, pending further legal proceedings.</p>

<p>A <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-us-honor-carmen-martinezs-memory?fbclid=IwY2xjawGYpbRleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHbFtSJhqc8MOwFiIDl_x_mKB8OSDu1PLKaY478hSVMKZ6hGO0tpStKnaFw_aem_Wk4Ggb2pYrjmh1iuBfBQbw">GoFundMe page</a> has been set up by Martinez-Silva's family to raise funds for her funeral. ''The family is devastated by this loss we would've never imagined a tragedy like this would happen to our beloved Carmen. We know this time is hard for a lot of us, but we are please asking it you feel in your heart to donate anything that will help the family to be able to put her to rest as she deserves,''&nbsp;part of the fundraiser reads.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>World leaders raced to congratulate Donald Trump on Wednesday as he triumphed in a stunning US election victory over Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>European leaders in particular were quick to extend their best wishes and offers of cooperation, in contrast to a much cooler reaction when Trump won for the first time in 2016.</p>

<p>There were some exceptions, such as Russia, where the foreign ministry frostily commented on the outcome but let it be known that no congratulations would be forthcoming from President Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>Here are Wednesday's reactions, with many being expressed even before the election win was confirmed:</p>

<p><strong>China: 'mutual respect'</strong></p>

<p>Without directly mentioning Trump, foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told a regular briefing that China hopes for "peaceful coexistence" with the United States.</p>

<p><strong>Mexico: 'no concern'</strong></p>

<p>President Claudia Sheinbaum said Trump's election victory was "no cause for concern", despite his threats of tariffs and mass migrant deportations.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Exit polls showed that Kamala Harris had an eight-point advantage among women voters -- but that was nearly half what Joe Biden had mustered four years ago.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>She needed their support, but it wasn't enough: Kamala Harris failed to get as many women to back her as she had hoped, despite a presidential campaign heavily focused on abortion access, in the face of Donald Trump's macho rhetoric.</p>

<p>Exit polls conducted by CNN showed that the Democratic vice president had an eight-point advantage among women voters -- but that was nearly half what Joe Biden had mustered four years ago.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the flip side, the Republican once and future president had a 13-point lead over his rival with men, as opposed to an eight-point boost when he faced Biden in 2020.</p>

<p>"I think there were high expectations going into the election about how women would vote," Sabrina Karim, a professor at Cornell University, told AFP.</p>

<p>"But it is always important to remember that women are not a monolithic group," and "their concerns are multi-faceted," Karim noted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The CNN exit poll shows Harris's dominance with Black women voters, for example, while Trump did better with white women.</p>

<p>"The Harris campaign's strong focus on abortion likely energized some women to vote, but a single issue was not enough to bring a diverse range of women to vote for Harris," Karim said.</p>

<p>Nathalie Feldgun, a lawyer in New York, said she felt it was time for Trump to return to the Oval Office.</p>

<p>"The country doesn't have a border. It's not a country," said Feldgun, who had been persuaded by the Republican's stark anti-immigration rhetoric.</p>

<p>The economy -- and inflation in particular -- played a major role in the election, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In many US households, women are the primary shoppers, and felt the pinch as prices of basic goods soared.</p>

<p>"I have five children, and the economy for the past three-and-a-half years was bad," Tessa Bonet, a 51-year-old immigrant from Guyana who lives in New York, told AFP at Trump's giant Madison Square Garden rally.</p>

<p>"I'm here for change and my eyes are wide open," she said. "Trump means well for us -- yes, regular Americans."</p>

<p>Harris did not make her identity as a Black woman also of South Asian descent a major part of the campaign, relying on surrogates like former first lady Michelle Obama, Republican former lawmaker Liz Cheney or celebrities like Beyonce to do it for her.</p>

<p>But neither Obama's powerful feminist speeches nor an endorsement from pop megastar Taylor Swift prevented Trump from scoring a decisive victory, despite the repeated sexist remarks he made at his opponent's expense.</p>

<p>Just a week ago, he made waves when he told one campaign rally in an anti-crime appeal: "I want to protect the women of our country... whether the women like it or not."</p>

<p>The 78-year-old Trump even called the 60-year-old Harris "mentally disabled" and "retarded," and suggested she would become "a playtoy" for other world leaders if elected.</p>

<p>At the last minute, the Harris campaign tried to bet that women in conservative households would secretly vote for her despite the misgivings of their husbands, but the strategy was a flop.</p>

<p>In an ad financed by a progressive Christian group, and narrated by Oscar winner Julia Roberts, a woman is shown voting for Harris -- and hiding it from her apparently Trump-leaning spouse.</p>

<p>"In the one place in America where women still have a right to choose, you can vote any way you want, and no one will ever know," Roberts says.</p>

<p>"Did you make the right choice?" the husband asks his wife, who responds: "Sure did, honey," exchanging a smile and a wink with another woman voter.</p>

<p>"That was an appealing idea, but now we know it's pretty much just wishful thinking," said Alex Keena, a professor of political science at Virginia Commonwealth University.</p>

<p>For Karim, "gender dynamics are not limited to women, but what masculine appeal Trump has for a diverse range of men."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Exit polls showed that Trump got a boost from Latino voters, while Biden had largely beaten him with that part of the electorate four years ago.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US allies at NATO scrambled Wednesday to put a brave face on the return of Donald Trump to the White House amid fears the unpredictable Republican could upend European security and pull the plug on Ukraine support.&nbsp;Trump sealed a dramatic comeback to power after sweeping to victory in the US presidential election against Democrat Kamala Harris.&nbsp;</p>

<p>NATO chief Mark Rutte - chosen recently in part due to his good relations with Trump -- was quick to congratulate the victor and played up the positive impact he could make.</p>

<p>"His leadership will again be key to keeping our Alliance strong. I look forward to working with him again to advance peace through strength through NATO," Rutte said.</p>

<p>But beneath the veneer of calm, there remains deep disquiet about what Trump could do to European security as an aggressive Russia wages war on Ukraine just beyond NATO's border.</p>

<p>The volatile former reality TV star rattled NATO during the campaign by saying he'd encourage Moscow to "do whatever the hell they want" to members not spending enough on defence.</p>

<p>Senior diplomats at NATO, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive issues, sought to put a positive spin on his return for a second term, saying it could push Europe to get serious about protecting itself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Why be scared by Trump now? It is going to be rough, but at least he will pump some energy into the whole thing," one diplomat said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump's first term in power was a rollercoaster for NATO as the bulldozing president lambasted European allies such as Germany for weak defence spending and reportedly even mulled pulling Washington out.</p>

<p>But officials said that not only did the alliance survive -- it actually emerged stronger as Trump and his no-holds-barred style pressured Europe to spend more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"During his first term, our working relationship focused on bolstering transatlantic security and adapting NATO for the future. In a world of growing instability, strong US leadership remains essential," former NATO head Jens Stoltenberg wrote on X.</p>

<p>- 'A different world' -<br />
Analyst Camille Grand of the European Council on Foreign Relations said there are "two theories" on how a second Trump term could go for NATO.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"One is that it will be like the first time, unpleasant but not catastrophic," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Or, we are today in a different world with a Trump entourage who are unwaveringly Trumpist, who share his doubts about alliances, support for Ukraine; and especially during the first mandate there was no war in Europe."</p>

<p>In a bid to appeal to Trump, NATO leaders have sought to repeatedly credit him with making other allies cough up more on defence.</p>

<p>The urgency on spending in Europe was ramped up by Moscow's 2022 invasion of Ukraine and now 23 of the 32 NATO members reach the target of spending two percent of gross domestic produce on defence -- up from just three a decade ago.</p>

<p>Now the feeling is that Europe will have to do even more to make sure it can stand on its own.</p>

<p>"I expect a serious push to finally start taking our security and defence in Europe seriously, to invest much more, to finally do it," said one former senior NATO diplomat.</p>

<p>But the ex-official warned to expect more rhetoric from Trump questioning Washington's commitment to NATO's collective defence clause that would "undermine security" and could embolden Russia and China.</p>

<p>For Ukraine, already struggling to hold back the Kremlin's forces on the battlefield, the picture appears grim.</p>

<p>Trump has cast doubt on continuing US military support for Kyiv and promised to cut a quick deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war.</p>

<p>"If Trump starts negotiations with Russia, it will be very transactional, not built on values and principles -- and this may lead to a result that would be catastrophic for Ukraine and for the whole of Europe," the former diplomat said.</p>

<p>Other officials agreed that Ukraine was in a perilous position, but said Trump coming to power could give Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky the cover to make hard compromises.</p>

<p>And if Putin pushes for too much he could find the notoriously whimsical Trump far from pliant -- and even willing to back Kyiv harder if the Kremlin doesn't give ground.</p>

<p>"The Russians always make exaggerated demands," said the first NATO diplomat.</p>

<p>"If they annoy Trump too much, they will get something in return they weren't counting for."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Donald Trump's victory was, let's say, an emphatic contradiction of the legacy media's confidence that the race was “too close to call”. So, did the traditional media genuinely get it wrong? Or was it an inspired act of wishful thinking? We might never know, but that's a mystery for another day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today, let's talk about the man of the hour: Elon Musk. The billionaire who spent months reshaping Twitter (now X) after he bought it in 2021, was duly accused by the mainstream media of amplifying certain voices and curbing others. Nevertheless, he did indeed seem to play his part in shaping public opinion like a maestro. I couldn't help but wonder whether Trump would pause during his victory lap in Florida to give a shoutout to Musk, perhaps for handing him this sweet electoral success on a digital platter.</p>

<h2><strong>'An Amazing Guy'</strong></h2>

<p>Often magnanimous in praise, Trump indeed gave Musk his due with loud cheers from the gathering crowd, declaring, “A star is born!” and calling him “an amazing guy”. &nbsp;If Trump were a Bollywood fan, he might as well have said to the Tesla boss, "<em>Jo jeeta wahi Sikander</em>"! For, Musk, the Great Gambler, gambled his entire empire—X, Tesla, SpaceX and other ventures—for Trump. And it has now paid off handsomely.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Podcaster Joe Rogan's millions of followers might point out that his endorsement was a game-changer. Who knows, it might have been. Roger, the world's most-followed podcaster, endorsed Trump in the campaign's final days and reached millions. He also interviewed Trump's running mate, JD Vance, and yes, Musk, too. For those who do not know, Rogan has 18 million subscribers on YouTube and 14 million on Spotify. Musk has 200 million followers on X. No traditional media has such reach. Legacy media honchos may not like this data, but it is hard to argue against the fact that Musk's massive reach and his hands-on approach to steering the Trump campaign in the right direction paid rich dividends.</p>

<h2><strong>Musk's Spaces Session</strong></h2>

<p>As voting drew to a close, Musk decided to hit Spaces for a live chat on X. I joined in—and so did 17,000 others, staying glued to every word for a full hour. He held court like a seasoned political analyst, fielding questions and giving his take on the election's high stakes and the future of American politics. It was a one-man show, no doubt, in support of his new-found ally, Trump. “This will be the last election” if Trump doesn't win, he warned, in reply to a question, still unsure of the impending victory on election night, making it clear he saw this election as a final stand. And yet, he sounded confident of Trump's triumph as he saw a steady increase in his popularity in all the seven swing states. At one point, he declared that Trump could take all the seven swing states. That, indeed, turned out to be true.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The world's richest man helped create a Political Action Committee (PAC), called America PAC, whose primary task was to support Trump's presidency by encouraging early voting and mail-in ballots in swing states. As we witnessed, in terms of early voting trends, some states started seeing record numbers. According to the Election Lab at the University of Florida, over 8 million Americans had voted early, with 1.8 million voting in person and 6.5 million returning mail ballots. Musk emphasised in his Spaces chat how much the American PAC mobilised voters to go to the polling booths to vote.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>The Failure Of Mainstream Media</strong></h2>

<p>If we are to take mainstream media, such as <em>The New York Times</em> and <em>The Washington Post </em>at their word, Musk didn't just throw a fistful of dollars at Trump's campaign. He, according to these papers, poured a whopping $80-120 million into America PAC—practically his own political slush fund for Trump. Musk isn't your average billionaire donor either: normally, most big donors write a cheque and watch from the sidelines. Musk, however, officially hopped on to the campaign ride after he endorsed his man in July. US media have it: he wasn't just a silent partner, he was frequently on the phone with Trump, sometimes even taking the stage beside him. In a campaign season packed with uncertainties and political slugfest, Musk managed to stand out by transforming himself into a real-time megaphone for Trump.</p>

<p>Right now, Musk's popularity in the US is perhaps next only to Trump. It wouldn't be a stretch to say that many would have even rooted for him to be a future presidential candidate if he could run for the coveted post (he can't as he was not born in the US). Even so, he has managed to make waves in the 2024 presidential election. His bold $1 million voter petition giveaway has stirred up questions about election law. Experts were divided: some claimed it edges into sketchy legal territory, while others argued that it's a loophole-free move, as signing his petition isn't explicitly tied to voter registration. A petition challenging Musk's move was thrown out by court.</p>

<h2><strong>Musk's Moment Of Reckoning</strong></h2>

<p>Ironically, Musk, 53, was, not so long ago, a moderate Democrat. He and twice-elected Barack Obama were known to be buddies. He had endorsed Obama both in 2008 and 2012. He had even donated to his re-election campaign. During the Biden presidency, he described himself as "half Democrat, half Republican" and "socially liberal and fiscally conservative".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Musk's endorsement of Trump came hot on the heels of Trump surviving a July 2024 assassination attempt. He wasted no time, conveying his “full support” and wishing Trump a speedy recovery. He later praised Trump's policies, especially on immigration and meritocracy, leaving little doubt about his loyalty. His endorsement clearly boosted Trump's profile among conservative and libertarian crowds. Musk's alignment with the Republican's divisive policies has drawn its share of criticism, but there's no denying that his influence helped give Trump a substantial leg up in visibility and credibility.</p>

<h2><strong>Biden's Snub Was Unwise</strong></h2>

<p>But what really pushed Musk into Trump's arms? &nbsp;Apparently, it was none other than Joe Biden. It was widely reported in 2021 that when Tesla officials reached out to the White House several times, they were repeatedly rebuffed. Apparently, the Biden administration's wish to avoid angering the powerful United Auto Workers union, which had been critical of Tesla's labour practices, was the main reason behind this snubbing.</p>

<p>More frustratingly for Musk, he was believed to be quite angry when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rejected SpaceX's application for nearly $900 million in broadband subsidies, citing that the company failed to "meet basic programme requirements". Musk disagreed with the decision, stating that Starlink, SpaceX's satellite internet service, was the only provider actively solving rural broadband issues at scale. Musk felt the decision was part of a "pattern of regulatory harassment" against him. Several times, Musk vented his frustration against government regulatory authorities, terming them anti-development. After Biden came to power, the scrutiny of Musk's various ventures intensified, with investigations and actions from at least seven federal agencies.</p>

<h2><strong>Musk, Now A Regulator To The Regulators?</strong></h2>

<p>Many have asked, what's in it for Musk? Fair question. Trump isn't exactly coy about it—he has already dangled the role of the head of a “government efficiency commission” before Musk, practically promising him a front-row seat to slice through federal spending and chop down regulatory bodies. When asked about Trump's offer on a live Spaces chat, Musk sounded ready to roll, claiming he'd tackle government “over-spending” by paring back agencies. “There shouldn't be more referees than players,” he quipped, nodding at the countless regulatory bodies in the system, which, he says, stifle innovation more than they support it.</p>

<p>It's funnily ironic, though. Musk, who thrived under government oversight to launch EVs, rockets and even internet satellites, is now poised to lead the charge against the very regulatory labyrinth that boosted his empire, but which also of course sometimes harassed him. Conflict of interest? Maybe. But Musk seems more than happy to play regulator to the regulators.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump won the US Presidential elections on Tuesday, defeating Vice-President Kamala Harris by 69 electoral votes. While Harris still carried New Jersey, Trump significantly reduced the gap from previous elections in the historically blue state. Having lost New Jersey by double digits in 2016 and 2020, Trump finished election night just five points behind Harris, the closest margin for a Republican presidential candidate in the state since George W Bush's 2.4-point loss in 1992.</p>

<p>This shift is significant considering the massive growth of registered Democratic voters in New Jersey who outnumber Republicans by a 900,000-voter margin. Yet, Trump's surge indicates that the state's traditionally solid Democratic slant is beginning to erode.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump's influence extended beyond New Jersey, with the Republicans securing victories in key swing states of Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina, and Georgia, and currently leading in Arizona and Nevada. Trump even rallied in South Jersey, suggesting the state could be competitive, mentioning as recently as the weekend before the election that "a little birdie" told him he was leading Harris in New Jersey.</p>

<p>"We had a beautiful day yesterday," said Jose Arango, Republican Party chair of urban Hudson County, a region traditionally dominated by Democrats. Mr Arango believes that working-class Hispanics in Hudson County, struggling with rising rents and taxes, are increasingly dissatisfied with the status quo.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hudson County, home to a 41 per cent Hispanic population, saw a shift from 26 per cent support for Trump in 2020 to around 35 per cent this year. Similarly, Passaic County, which also boasts a significant Hispanic population, voted for Trump, contributing to a much closer-than-expected race in New Jersey's traditionally Democratic 9th District. Democrat Nellie Pou won the district by only 4 points, a visible contrast to her 34-point victory in 2020, Politico reported.</p>

<p>"We certainly saw a wave, a red wave, around the country last night," Ms Pou said, as per the outlet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The shifting demographics in Passaic County, home to one of the largest Arab American populations in the US, also played a significant role. "I think people are at a point where they're willing to use any means electorally to get their voice out," Ali Aljarrah, senior adviser for the Council on American-Islamic Relations Action New Jersey, told Politico. "It's not exclusive to the Arab or Muslim community. We see the Hispanic community even in Hudson County go rightwards."</p>

<p>Despite the unexpectedly tight race, Democrats managed to hold onto all nine of their House seats and retain a US Senate seat, which hasn't been Republican since 1972.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Hollywood-led fundraisers helped raise tens of millions of dollars for Kamala Harris's record-breaking campaign war chest.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A raft of celebrities from Taylor Swift and Beyonce to George Clooney and Harrison Ford proved unable to prevent Kamala Harris's crushing defeat in the US election, underlining the limited impact of sweeping star endorsements on voters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Instead, it was Donald Trump and the Republicans -- who received scant support from the entertainment industry at large, but tapped into a targeted subset of well-known, hypermasculine influencers -- who won comfortably.</p>

<p>So, did the Democrats' long-standing Hollywood and music industry connections, including last-minute rally appearances from Lady Gaga and Jennifer Lopez, make any difference at all in the end?</p>

<p>"Not in this election, clearly," said New York University arts professor Laurence Maslon.</p>

<p>"At the end of the day, people probably realize that Beyonce and George Clooney don't have to worry about the cost of gas or the cost of eggs -- so maybe they're sort of irrelevant," he told AFP.</p>

<p>Celebrity endorsements have long been part of the fabric of US elections, harking back to the days when Frank Sinatra wrangled the "Rat Pack" to support John F. Kennedy in 1960.</p>

<p>Even this year, Hollywood-led fundraisers helped raise tens of millions of dollars for Harris's record-breaking campaign war chest.</p>

<p>But their impact in actually influencing votes has always been a "mixed bag," said Arizona State University associate professor Margaretha Bentley, who teaches a public policy course on Taylor Swift.</p>

<p>"It's never going to be the golden ticket that everybody's looking for," she said.</p>

<p>Mark Harvey, author of "Celebrity Influence: Politics, Persuasion, and Issue-Based Advocacy," agreed that we "shouldn't be terribly surprised" by the lack of celebrity impact.</p>

<p>"There isn't a real strong science behind this idea that celebrities can influence people to vote for candidates," he said.</p>

<p>- 'Macho' -<br />
Famous supporters have only ever been effective when advocating on very specific issues on which they are widely regarded as expert, added Harvey.</p>

<p>As Donald Trump delivered his victory speech early Wednesday, the new president-elect was flanked by -- and showered praise on -- famous names from the world of sport.</p>

<p>UFC boss Dana White was lovingly hailed as "tough" and "a piece of work," while golfer Bryson DeChambeau was celebrated as "fantastic" and even having a "slightly longer" drive than the golf-loving Trump.</p>

<p>Loud cheers -- and a significant portion of Trump's address -- were devoted to his best-known supporter of all, tech billionaire Elon Musk.</p>

<p>Trump also received a last-minute endorsement from Joe Rogan, the influential host of one of the world's top podcasts.</p>

<p>The Republican may have benefited from these associations because, in an election "largely driven by cultural issues, one of the most potent cultural issues was masculinity," said Harvey.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This sort of 'be a real man,' the Trump 'macho' sort of thing... it's the kind of thing that Joe Rogan plays all the time."</p>

<p>- 'Shocked' -<br />
For the Democrats, this latest scarring experience will require a "deep self-analysis... of what they did and didn't do, and what might have been successful," including with celebrity endorsements, said Bentley.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ashley Spillane, author of the report "Celebrities Strengthening Our Culture of Democracy," agreed there was "debate" about the "value and impact of celebrity endorsements of candidates."</p>

<p>But there is still "robust evidence that celebrities do have a real impact in promoting overall, nonpartisan civic engagement," she wrote via email, pointing to Swift's endorsement of Harris, which was credited with driving 400,000 people to a voter registration site.</p>

<p>Even if their endorsements failed, Hollywood celebrities showed no indication Wednesday that they would remain silent.</p>

<p>Waking up to the news of Trump's victory, several well-known figures took to social media to vent their frustrations.</p>

<p>Oscar winner Jamie Lee Curtis said Trump's win would usher in "a sure return to a more restrictive, some fear draconian time."</p>

<p>"Fascist with total power... That may have been the last free election," wrote actor John Cusack. "Horror is coming."</p>

<p>Pop singer Cardi B, who appeared at a Harris rally last Friday, simply wrote: "I hate yall bad."&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice-President Kamala Harris conceded the 2024 presidential race to Donald Trump, ending a campaign many Democrats hoped would usher in the country's first female president. In her speech, Kamala Harris accepted the people's mandate for Trump after what was a hard-fought campaign.<br />
<br />
<strong>Struggles with Biden ties and defining her own path</strong><br />
<br />
Harris' campaign struggled from the very beginning, with issues that later proved insurmountable. According to a report in <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/06/politics/harris-campaign-went-wrong/index.html" rel="nofollow,noindex">CNN</a>, key moments, including her appearance on ABC's ‘The View,' showcased her challenge in differentiating herself from the Biden administration. Asked what she would have done differently from Biden, Harris said, “There is not a thing that comes to mind.” Realising the potential misstep, she added that she would consider including a Republican in her Cabinet.<br />
<br />
Despite efforts from campaign aides to clarify her stance, the perception that she was closely tied to Biden's policies became a persistent hurdle. According to a Democratic source, who spoke to CNN, Harris avoided highlighting her differences with Biden on key policies, such as capital gains taxes and child tax credits, out of loyalty. Yet, as the campaign progressed, she appeared hesitant, losing the confident approach that characterised her earlier appearances.<br />
<br />
<strong>Difficulty in building voter trust and support</strong><br />
<br />
Political observers and senior campaign aides pointed to Harris' inability to establish a clear identity apart from Biden as one of the key reasons for her struggle to connect with undecided voters. By the time she began articulating stronger views on contentious issues, such as Biden's support for Israel and his handling of the economy, many voters had already formed their impressions, leading some to turn towards other candidates.<br />
<br />
In retrospect, some Democratic strategists argue that Biden's continued influence over the party might have inadvertently hindered Harris' chances. The CNN report said that a few aides had even urged Biden to step back following the 2022 midterms to allow for a primary process that could have better prepared the party's candidate for the general election.<br />
<br />
<strong>Late optimism fails to deliver</strong><br />
<br />
Harris' campaign was marked by a rollercoaster of optimism and frustration. In the weeks leading up to Election Day, there was some hope among senior campaign staffers as Harris appeared to gain momentum in key battleground states. Yet, it was all short-lived. Aides cited a powerful ground campaign and endorsements from prominent figures, including Liz Cheney and former President Bill Clinton, as evidence of their strength. But that extensive network and high-profile support proved insufficient.<br />
<br />
“I can't imagine… what it would be like if Donald Trump won because he is telling us such dark and sinister things that he's going to do, and I believe him,” New Jersey Senator Cory Booker said in an interview during a campaign event in Pennsylvania, one of the crucial battleground states. Booker stressed the need for Democrats to stay engaged, regardless of the outcome, telling his staff that resilience is essential.<br />
<br />
Tensions within Harris' campaign also emerged as a significant factor. The sudden campaign reshuffle in July, when she replaced Biden as the Democratic candidate, left her team feeling underprepared. Campaign insiders reported internal disputes regarding Harris' running mate, with Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro initially seen as a strong choice due to his appeal in key swing states. Harris ultimately selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, someone she felt aligned more with her campaign values. Yet, this decision raised eyebrows among some Democrats, who felt Shapiro would have provided a stronger counterpoint to Trump's candidacy.<br />
<br />
As results poured in on election night, the mood at Harris' campaign headquarters shifted rapidly. Anticipation turned to disappointment as it became evident that Trump was pulling ahead.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[2024 US Elections: The United States has a new President-Elect, and it's Donald Trump, who brings, above all, unpredictability to the White House.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States has a new President-Elect, and it's Donald Trump, who brings, above all, unpredictability to the White House. It's been just over twenty-four hours since his election, and the world, especially the Middle-East, is attempting to make sense of what the new leader will bring to the table.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Tuesday night, when Trump emerged triumphant, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has had a complex relationship with Trump, was one of the first world leaders to congratulate the US President-elect, calling his win "history's greatest comeback." While outgoing President Joe Biden threw his weight behind Netanyahu's war on Gaza, it remains to be seen how Trump approaches it. During his campaign trail, the President-elect never specified his plans for the Middle East.</p>

<p>But Gaza is not the only place Israel is militarily involved in. It's locked in another intense battle with Iran, while also targeting Hezbollah in Lebanon, making it perhaps the biggest issue on Trump's agenda, come January 20th.</p>

<p>Trump's first term had some notable decisions in the Middle East. This included selecting Saudi Arabia for his inaugural foreign trip, strengthening Israel's regional ties with the "Abraham Accords", and applying heavy pressure on Iran.</p>

<h3><strong>Palestine and Gaza</strong></h3>

<p>With the Biden administration failing to secure a ceasefire in Gaza and Israel now embroiled in fresh conflicts with Iran and Hezbollah in Lebanon, Trump has to detail a clear path for where the US stands in all this.</p>

<p>One Israeli official hinted that Netanyahu might aim to wrap up the offensive in Gaza early in Trump's second term, aiming to present the Republican leader with a quick diplomatic win. "Nobody in Israel wanted Harris. Nobody trusted her over here," the official told CNN.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Netanyahu will face a much tougher president than he is used to in the sense that I don't think that Trump would tolerate the wars in the manner that they are happening," said Mustafa Barghouti, leader of the Palestinian National Initiative. Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli diplomat, echoed this, suggesting Trump would want a quick resolution, telling Netanyahu to "wrap it up; I don't need this."</p>

<p>Some fear he may even endorse Israel's potential annexation of parts of the West Bank, a move that may all but end the two-state solution.</p>

<h3><strong>Saudi Arabia</strong></h3>

<p>Saudi Arabia's King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman extended congratulations, with the United Arab Emirates highlighting the "enduring partnership based on shared ambitions for progress." Meanwhile, Iran downplayed the election, with government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani saying, "There is no significant difference" in US policies, regardless of leadership.</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which established close ties with Trump during his first term, are expected to continue aligning with the US, though with greater caution. Gulf states have increasingly diversified their diplomatic and economic alliances, particularly with China, joining BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.</p>

<h3><strong>Iran</strong></h3>

<p>Trump's prior "maximum pressure" campaign on Iran strained Tehran economically and politically. With his second term, experts predict a resurgence of this hardline approach. "The Islamic Republic appears as fragile as the threats against it are formidable," said Ali Vaez of the International Crisis Group, noting that Iran's leadership may struggle to balance mounting challenges under Trump's watch.</p>

<p>Should Netanyahu feel emboldened by Trump's return, there are concerns of possible escalation against Iran's nuclear facilities. It could heighten tensions, as both countries maintain competing regional influence and military capabilities.</p>

<p>"With Iran, there is a chance that Trump reverts to a maximum pressure stance," said Hasan Alhasan of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, noting that Gulf nations may experience increased US pressure to conform to this strategy. Balancing their deepening partnerships with China, especially in technology and infrastructure, might also become a challenge for these oil-rich states as they manage relations with Washington and Beijing under Trump's leadership.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Phoenix, Arizona, Jimmy Archuleta is happy with Donald Trump's victory. The car mechanic is one of a growing number of Americans of Hispanic origin cheering on the Republican's return to power.</p>

<p>"I don't think he's racist. He's just fed up with illegal immigrants," Archuleta told AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the wake of Kamala Harris' historic defeat in Tuesday's election, Democrats face the difficult task of identifying the reasons for their rout.</p>

<p>The erosion of support from the Latino electorate, which amounted to 10 percent of the electorate in 2024, ranks high on the list.</p>

<p>According to an exit poll published by NBC News on Tuesday, 53 percent of voters of Hispanic origin voted for Kamala Harris in this presidential election, compared to 45 percent for Donald Trump.</p>

<p>This breakdown contrasts with 2020, when Joe Biden won 59 percent of their votes and Donald Trump 38 percent, according to the Pew Research Center.</p>

<p>But the decline isn't new.</p>

<p>"I think it's clear this is a progression. We've seen a trend that began in 2016 and was reaffirmed in 2020 and that has taken a step forward in 2024," Roberto Suro, a professor at the University of Southern California, told AFP.</p>

<p><strong>Blue-Collar Conservatives</strong></p>

<p>To explain the shift towards Trump, he cites several factors.</p>

<p>"The idea that Latinos would react negatively to promises of stricter immigration policies has proven false," added the academic, who said some American Latino voters were prepared to vote for harsh, even xenophobic policies.</p>

<p>He believes this is because they draw "a distinction between two kinds of migration," separating those with longer-standing ties to the country from other newer arrivals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We see this in some of the pre-election polls, people saying 'I favor a legalization program for people who have been here for a long time and have children born here and have been working and don't have a criminal record, and who are part of the fabric of society.</p>

<p>"'And I want to return the recently arrived. I want a wall. I want border security. I want to send them back'," he added.</p>

<p>Religion, gender, and socio-economic determinants also play a role in this shift, he added.</p>

<p>"We've definitely seen among Mexican-American men, Evangelicals, who didn't attend college, and are working class, a consistent move toward Trump in election after election," he continued.</p>

<p>According to Edison Research, 54 percent of Latino male voters supported the Republican this year, compared to 36 percent in 2020.</p>

<p><strong>'Improve The Economy'</strong></p>

<p>This "very clear" shift toward Trump is also geographically defined, concentrated "along the border, in areas most directly affected by this new immigration," said Suro.</p>

<p>Interviewed on Wednesday in the streets of Phoenix, a major city in the border state of Arizona, Archuleta explained that inflation was one of the main reasons why he decided to support Trump.</p>

<p>"He's really a business genius, so I'm hoping he'll improve the economy," the Mexican-American told AFP.</p>

<p>"I just hope he'll make the price of groceries and gas more reasonable," he added.</p>

<p>For the 47-year-old, whose mother legally arrived from Mexico in the 1970s, the Republican will primarily target illegal immigrants, having promised to carry out mass deportations.</p>

<p>"I know that if someone sees me on the street, they don't know what my status is here," he said. "But for me, it's different. I'm not worried, I know I'm legal."</p>

<p>Archuleta didn't seem entirely convinced that the new president would follow through with mass deportations, which could threaten some of his undocumented friends.</p>

<p>"If they come here and get caught, it's part of the rules. They've always known the risks," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The UAE's National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) has attributed the recent hailstorms in the region to a low-pressure system originating from the Arabian Sea and extending to Oman. This weather pattern has brought moisture-laden air into the typically arid area, resulting in a significant shift in weather conditions. Consequently, thunderstorms, hail, and rainfall have swept across Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, defying the region's characteristic dryness and causing unprecedented weather events.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia's weather department has issued severe weather warnings for the coming days, cautioning residents to prepare for prolonged adverse conditions. The forecast predicts thunderstorms with heavy rainfall, hail showers and strong winds. These conditions may reduce visibility, disrupt travel, and impact daily life. Officials have urged residents to exercise caution and take necessary precautions due to the unusual weather.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine the fear of becoming a personal target of the richest man in the world - and his followers. That's what federal government employees are feeling after Elon Musk publicised their names.</p>

<p>As the co-chair of the Department of Government Efficiency, Musk has suggested mass-firings as he is publicly identifying "fake jobs" and associated federal employees on X.</p>

<p>Last week Elon Musk reposted the names and titles of employees holding climate-related government positions on X. These posts are made from an account with the handle Fentasyl and the name “Datahazard,”.&nbsp;They have received quite some negative attention with one woman even deleting her social media accounts.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/27/business/elon-musk-government-employees-targets/index.html" rel="noindex,nofollow">CNN</a>, current federal employees are apprehensive about being personal targets.</p>

<p>"These tactics are aimed at sowing terror and fear at federal employees. It's intended to make them fearful that they will become afraid to speak up," said Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But this is Musk's habitual way of operating where he singles out individuals who stand in his way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's his way of intimidating people to either quit or also send a signal to all the other agencies that 'you're next'," said Mary "Missy" Cummings who unintentionally provoked Musk by criticising Tesla when she was at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</p>

<p>Cummings said that she received death threats and a slew of attacks and had to relocate temporarily before moving houses. "He intended for them, for people just like this, to be intimidated and just go ahead and quit so he didn't have to fire them. So his plan, to some extent, is working," she said.</p>

<p>One of Musk's posts on X reads, "I don't think the US taxpayers should pay for the employment of a 'Director of Climate Diversification (she/her)' at the US International Development Finance Corporation," which he posted alongside a screenshot of the employee's name and location.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Vivek Ramaswamy has said that, "Most federal employees, like most human beings, are fundamentally good people and deserve to be treated with respect, but the real problem is the bureaucracy", although he did not comment on employees being singled-out by Musk.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan police said Wednesday they had arrested nearly 1,000 protesters who marched on the capital demanding the release of jailed ex-prime minister Imran Khan, after crowds were evicted from the city centre in a sweeping security crackdown.</p>

<p>Imran Khan has been jailed since August 2023, sidelined by dozens of legal cases he claims were confected to prevent his comeback in elections this year marred by rigging allegations.</p>

<p>Since the February vote, his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party has defied a government crackdown with regular rallies, but Tuesday's gathering was by far the largest to grip the capital since the poll.</p>

<p>More than 10,000 protesters surged into the city, defying a lockdown and a ban on public gatherings to skirmish with 20,000 security forces enlisted to turn them back.</p>

<p>Islamabad Police Inspector General Ali Nasir Rizvi said 954 protesters had been arrested between Sunday and Tuesday, when crowds came within one mile (1.6 kilometres) of a public square they aimed to occupy.</p>

<p>The government said at least one police officer and four state paramilitary personnel had been killed, before the main thoroughfare was cleared by forces armed with tear gas and batons early Wednesday.</p>

<p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said in a statement that security forces had "bravely repulsed the protesters" as PTI told activists on social media the rally was cancelled "for the time being".</p>

<p><strong>'High time' for talks</strong></p>

<p>Imran Khan made a statement from his cell outside Islamabad calling supporters to the capital on Tuesday.</p>

<p>But the crowds were led by his key lieutenant Ali Amin Gandapur and his wife Bushra Bibi, who was also jailed earlier this year but released last month.</p>

<p>"The movement is continuing and it will be ended only by Imran Khan," said Gandapur after retreating from Islamabad to northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province where he serves as chief minister.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called the protests "extremism". Since Sunday, his ministers held regular press conferences in central Islamabad vowing no mercy for the oncoming marchers.</p>

<p>But as they retreated from the capital, there were growing calls for reconciliation to prevent future flare-ups impacting regular citizens in the country of 240 million.</p>

<p>The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said in a statement that Imran Khan and Shehbaz Sharif's parties should "immediately enter a purposeful political dialogue".</p>

<p>"It is high time that they agree on a peaceful way forward instead of whipping up the emotions of their respective political workers and bringing the country to a standstill," the organisation said.</p>

<p>Michael Kugelman, South Asia Institute director at The Wilson Center, said on social media platform X that "Pakistan's protests had no winners".</p>

<p>Anger towards the establishment has increased over the crackdown, he said, while at the same time, PTI was forced to retreat.</p>

<p>"Pakistan on the whole is burdened by a worsening confrontation," he said.</p>

<p><strong>'Excessive force'</strong></p>

<p>Shehbaz Sharif's government has come under increasing criticism for deploying heavy-handed measures to quash PTI rallies.</p>

<p>Mobile internet was cut across Islamabad, schools shut on Monday remained closed Wednesday, and roadblocks prevented thousands of workers from reaching their jobs.</p>

<p>Amnesty International said that "as protesters enter the capital, law enforcement officials have used unlawful and excessive force".</p>

<p>Imran Khan, a charismatic 72-year-old former cricket star, served as premier from 2018 to 2022 and is the lodestar of PTI.</p>

<p>He was ousted by a no-confidence vote after falling out with the kingmaking military establishment, which analysts say engineers the rise and fall of Pakistan's politicians.</p>

<p>But as opposition leader, he led an unprecedented campaign of defiance, with street protests boiling over into unrest that the government cited as the reason for its crackdown.</p>

<p>PTI won more seats than any other party in this year's election, but a coalition of parties considered more pliable to military influence shut them out of power.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spanish traveller Alberto Blasco Ventas looked out at Ukraine's destroyed Irpin brige, blown up to stop Russian troops in 2022 and now a hotspot for thrill-seeking tourists visiting the country.</p>

<p>Russian forces had planned to cross the bridge in their attempts to seize the Ukrainian capital Kyiv at the beginning of the war.</p>

<p>The Russian army has since retreated hundreds of kilometres away, but launches near-daily missile and drone strikes on the Ukrainian capital that Blasco Ventas chose as his vacation spot.</p>

<p>"It's my first time in a war zone," the 23-year-old software engineer said. "I'm a little bit scared, I'm not going to lie, because you never know."</p>

<p>He was on a "dark tourism" tour offered by one of a dozen or so Ukrainian companies specialising in a marginal but growing sector -- allowing tourists to visit locations of tragic events.</p>

<p>To get to Ukraine, he shrugged off concerns expressed by his family and got on a flight to Moldova, followed by an 18-hour train ride.</p>

<p>The wannabe influencer filmed every step of the trip, which he planned to post on his YouTube channel -- followed by 115,000 people -- where he has already chronicled the "most horrible psychiatric hospital" in the United States and "the most dangerous border" in the world, between China, Russia and North Korea.</p>

<p><strong>'Like a vaccine'</strong></p>

<p>Before the war, Ukraine already hosted tens of thousands of tourists every year in Chernobyl, which saw the world's worst nuclear disaster in 1986.</p>

<p>Answering critics that would consider such trips morbid or immoral, Blasco Ventas insisted he was acting "with respect".</p>

<p>War Tours, which organised his visit, said it has accommodated around 30 customers since January, mainly Europeans and Americans paying between 150 euros ($157) and 250 euros ($262) for the whole tour.</p>

<p>Part of the profits are given to the army, said company co-founder Dmytro Nykyforov who insisted the initiative was "not about money, it's about memorialization of the war."</p>

<p>Svitozar Moiseiv, the manager of tourism company Capital Tours Kyiv, said profits are negligible but the visits have an educational value.</p>

<p>"It's like a vaccine to prevent this from ever happening again," he said.</p>

<p>The visits generally centre around Kyiv and its suburbs that saw alleged massacres from Russian troops in the early 2022.</p>

<p>But some companies come closer to the front -- including a visit of several days in southern Ukraine costing up to 3,300 euros.</p>

<p><strong>'The next best thing'</strong></p>

<p>American Nick Tan, who works in finance for a New York tech company, was among those who wanted to go even further than Kyiv.</p>

<p>So he went in July to Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city that faces constant bombing from Russian forces, located around 20 kilometres away.</p>

<p>"I just wanted to see it because I think our lives in the West are just too comfortable and too easy," the 34-year-old said.</p>

<p>He said he wanted to get even closer to the front but was met with his guide's refusal.</p>

<p>The self-described thrill-seeker said he had already gone skydiving, regularly attended boxing classes and raves.</p>

<p>"Jumping out of planes and partying all night and punching people in the face just didn't do it for me anymore. So what's the next best thing? Going to a war zone."</p>

<p>His quest baffled some residents of the scarred Irpin suburb, who live under the constant threat of Russian air attacks.</p>

<p>"A Shahed drone recently fell 300 metres away from my house. I wouldn't have any desire to live through this kind of experience," said Ruslan Savchuk, 52.</p>

<p>"But if people want that for themselves, it's their right," he said.</p>

<p>Savchuk advises Irpin on its tourism strategy as a volunteer.</p>

<p>"Even a subject as difficult as war can lead to something good," he said, adding that tourists could generate useful incomes for local communities.</p>

<p><strong>'See our grief'</strong></p>

<p>But Mykhailyna Skoryk-Shkarivska, local councillor in Irpin and former deputy mayor of Bucha, said most residents are fine with "dark tourism" but some consider the profits from it as "blood money".</p>

<p>"There are accusations -- 'Why do you come here? Why do you want to see our grief?'," she said, recalling conversations with locals.</p>

<p>Mariana Oleskiv, head of the National Agency for Tourism Development, said the development of war tourism posed many ethical questions but that the market was bound to grow.</p>

<p>Her agency was preparing specific training for guides, as well as memorial tours in the Kyiv region.</p>

<p>The Russian invasion triggered an immediate collapse of the tourism industry, but the sector's revenues should this year exceed those of 2021 -- a year marked by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>That growth mainly comes from domestic tourism fuelled by Ukrainian men of fighting age who are generally not allowed to leave the country due to martial law.</p>

<p>Ukraine even recorded 4 million foreign visitors last year, according to Oleskiv.</p>

<p>The number is twice as high as it was in 2022, but comprises mainly business travellers.</p>

<p>Ukraine is already preparing for the post-war period, including by signing deals with Airbnb and TripAdvisor.</p>

<p>"War brought attention to Ukraine, so we have stronger brand. Everybody knows about our country," Oleskiv said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel today approached the International Criminal Court or ICC to appeal against its order to arrest Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu for "war crimes". In its appeal, Tel Aviv has asked the world court to suspend the arrest warrants against the prime minister and defence minister till the outcome of the appeal.</p>

<p>The world court had issued an arrest warrant against Benjamin Netanyahu, and his former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant for "war crimes" in the Gaza war between Israel and Hamas. It had also issued a similar arrest warrant against Hamas's military head Mohammed Deif.</p>

<p>In a statement issued after the appeal to the world court, the Israeli Prime Minister's Office said, "The State of Israel challenges the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the legitimacy of the arrest warrants issued. If the court rejects this request, it will further demonstrate to Israel's friends in the United States and around the world how biased the International Criminal Court is against the State of Israel."</p>

<p>In an official statement the world court had stated that "The Chamber issued warrants of arrest for two individuals, Mr Benjamin Netanyahu and Mr Yoav Gallant, for crimes against humanity and war crimes committed from at least 8 October 2023 until at least 20 May 2024, the day the Prosecution filed the applications for warrants of arrest."</p>

<p>The arrest warrants drew furious condemnation from Mr Netanyahu and other Israeli politicians. US and France have backed Mr Netanyahu and rejected the warrants, however, Western allies UK and Canada have said they will abide by it.</p>

<p>After the ruling, Prime Minister Netanyahu accused the world court at The Hague of "anti-Semitism" and vowed not to be deterred by it.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation or FBI is investigating bomb threats received by several of Donald Trump's nominees selected for key roles in his new administration.</p>

<p>The spokeswoman of the transition team that is looking after the handover process from the Biden Administration to the incoming Trump Administration confirmed the news about claims made by several of the President-elect's nominees and appointees about receiving "bomb threats".</p>

<p>In an official statement, Donald Trump's transition team spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said "Last night and this morning, several of President Trump's Cabinet nominees and Administration appointees were targeted in violent, unAmerican threats to their lives and those who live with them."</p>

<p>Ms Leavitt, however, did not give any details of which Trump nominees received these threats, though she said the range of these threats from "swatting" to "bomb threats".</p>

<p>When asked, the FBI confirmed that it was aware of "numerous bomb threats and swatting incidents". The top investigating agency went on to say that "we take all potential threats seriously."</p>

<p>Swatting is the practice in which police are summoned urgently to someone's house under false pretenses.</p>

<p>One of the Trump nominees, Elise Stefanik, who has been selected to be United States' UN Ambassador, said her residence in New York was targeted in a bomb threat. She issued a statement saying she along with her husband and small son were on their way home from Washington DC to celebrate Thanksgiving when they found out about the threat.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia said on Wednesday that it would expel one correspondent and one cameraman from Germany's ARD in a symmetrical response to German moves against journalists from Russia's Channel One that Berlin denied undertaking.</p>

<p>WDR, a regional arm of ARD responsible for the broadcasting association's news output from Russia, criticised Russia's decision to strip the two German journalists of their permits to work in the country.</p>

<p>"This is a drastic step. It restricts our ability to report from Moscow once again. We have been dealing with intimidation and restrictions on our reporting from Moscow for almost three years," said WDR programming director Joerg Schoenenborn.</p>

<p>WDR is assessing how it might continue its work in Moscow, it said in a statement</p>

<p>Pushing back against Russia's version of events, a German foreign ministry spokesperson denied that the Channel One office in Berlin was being shuttered, and said the Russian journalists' departure was related to residence law matters.</p>

<p>"Russian journalists can report freely and unhindered in Germany. A whole series of Russian journalists are also accredited with the Federal Press Office," the spokesperson told a regular government news conference.</p>

<p>Residence law falls within the competences of the regional states, or Laender, which make decisions independently of the federal government in Berlin, he added.</p>

<p>The spokesperson said the government was in close contact with German media in Moscow because of concerns that Russia was taking "very vehement" action against journalists.</p>

<p><strong>REPORT FROM RUSSIA</strong></p>

<p>Channel One had reported that Germany was closing its Berlin bureau and that two Russian journalists, a correspondent and cameraman, working for the channel had been ordered to leave Germany on security grounds.</p>

<p>"In response to the ban by German authorities on the presence and work of Channel One correspondents, we are forced to take reciprocal measures against journalists from the Moscow office of the German media group ARD," Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told reporters.</p>

<p>She said the two ARD staff had been ordered to hand over their accreditation documents and to leave Russia.</p>

<p>However, Zakharova said Moscow would consider accrediting new ARD journalists if Germany provided conditions for their Russian counterparts from Channel One to carry out "normal work" there.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A lawyer for the chief defendant in a French mass rape trial on Wednesday urged the court to recall his good side after prosecutors demanded lengthy jail terms for the dozens of suspects.</p>

<p>The main defendant, Dominique Pelicot, has admitted enlisting dozens of strangers to rape his then-wife while she was drugged and unconscious.</p>

<p>Prosecutors have called for a maximum 20-year jail term for the 72-year-old, who has been on trial in the southern city of Avignon since September with 49 other men for organising the repeated rape and sexual abuse of Gisele Pelicot.</p>

<p>Prosecutors also sought jail terms of between 10 and 18 years for most of the co-defendants, with a four-year punishment requested in only one case.</p>

<p>"With your verdict you will make clear that there is no such thing as ordinary rape," lead prosecutor, Laure Chabaud, told the court Wednesday.</p>

<p>"You will deliver a message of hope to the victims of sexual violence" and "return a part of humanity to Gisele Pelicot that she was robbed of", she said.</p>

<p>Kicking off closing arguments by some 30 defence lawyers -- scheduled to last until December 13 -- was Beatrice Zavarro, the lawyer for Dominique Pelicot.</p>

<p>He has been described as the "conductor" behind the sexual abuse of his former wife, the details of which have shocked France.</p>

<p><strong>'Accepted and admitted'</strong></p>

<p>Beginning by addressing her "deep respect" for Gisele Pelicot, her ex-husband's lawyer spent around an hour recalling that Dominique had been a "good husband, father and grandfather" according to all who knew him.</p>

<p>Zavarro plunged back into his traumatic childhood -- which he claims included sexual abuse -- and shaky mental state to explain his "perversity".</p>

<p>"People aren't born perverted, they become it," she said, repeating her client's own words from his first courtroom questioning.</p>

<p>"Dominique Pelicot has accepted and admitted the harm of which he is accused," Zavarro said.</p>

<p>But she insisted that he was not the "conductor" many of the other defendants painted him as, some claiming they were under his domination or even themselves drugged.</p>

<p>"What comes next is of course the sentence you will issue, perhaps distancing yourselves a little from the strongest requested by prosecutors," she told judges.</p>

<p>"He has been hoping to apologise 1,000 times, I don't know if you will listen to him, Madame, but he's saying it again," Zavarro added to Gisele Pelicot.</p>

<p>"Keep in mind the first Dominique, the one you cherished, hugged and loved deeply," she told Gisele and her children, who are co-plaintiffs in the case.</p>

<p>Earlier in the hearings, the court had heard how Gisele Pelicot told police her then-husband was a "super guy" before learning of the abuse.</p>

<p><strong>'Devil's advocate'</strong></p>

<p>Dominique Pelicot's decade-long abuse was only uncovered after he was arrested for filming up women's skirts in public.</p>

<p>The probe led investigators to his meticulously-kept records of the visitors to the family home in the town of Mazan.</p>

<p>Their trial has made Gisele Pelicot, who insisted the hearings be held in public, a feminist icon in women's fight against sexual abuse.</p>

<p>Pelicot is the only one of the 50 men to have fully confessed to the the crimes he is accused of.</p>

<p>Observers say his lawyer Zavarro has an impossible task on her hands.</p>

<p>If convicted, her client would be considered one of France's worst-ever sex offenders.</p>

<p>But Zavarro has refused to describe her client as a "monster", insisting instead that she represents a man who has committed "monstrous" crimes.</p>

<p>"I have become the devil's advocate against my will... as I have often told you, it's the two of us against the whole world," she told her client in court.</p>

<p>Lawyers for Pelicot's co-defendants are to lay out their closing arguments starting Thursday.</p>

<p>Most are expected to argue that their clients were manipulated by Dominique Pelicot to sexually abuse his wife.</p>

<p>Some have already argued that they assumed Pelicot had his wife's consent, and that they were playing a part in a libertine sex game.</p>

<p>The verdicts in the case are expected by December 20.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[China has freed three Americans considered wrongfully detained in a swap with the United States, US officials said Wednesday, meeting a key goal of outgoing President Joe Biden's administration.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China has freed three Americans considered wrongfully detained in a swap with the United States, US officials said Wednesday, meeting a key goal of outgoing President Joe Biden's administration.</p>

<p>The three Americans -- Mark Swidan, Kai Li and John Leung -- were the last prisoners in China classified by the State Department as wrongfully detained, although activists and families have raised the cases of other US citizens.</p>

<p>"Soon they will return and be reunited with their families for the first time in many years," a State Department spokesperson said on the eve of Thanksgiving, the American holiday associated with family reunions.</p>

<p>"Thanks to this administration's efforts and diplomacy with the PRC, all of the wrongfully detained Americans in the PRC are home," the spokesperson said, referring to the People's Republic of China.</p>

<p>A source close to the matter said that the three were being freed in a swap with Beijing for three Chinese nationals in US custody who were not identified.</p>

<p>Swidan was detained in late 2012 on a business trip to China on drug charges. His family and supporters say there was never any evidence he had drugs and that his driver and translator had blamed him.</p>

<p>In his early time in detention, Swidan was deprived of sleep and food and lost more than 100 pounds (45 kilograms), according to Dui Hua, a group that supports prisoners in China.</p>

<p>Swidan's mother Katherine, who lives in Texas, addressed a congressional hearing in September and accused the Biden administration of ignoring his plight.</p>

<p>"Our loved ones are not bargaining chips or political pawns; they are human beings whose rights and freedoms must be upheld and protected," she said.</p>

<p>Kai Li, a naturalized American born in Shanghai who ran a business exporting aircraft technology, was detained in 2016 and convicted of espionage for allegedly sending state secrets to US authorities.</p>

<p>He says he was sharing information routinely available on the internet as part of routine compliance with US export regulations.</p>

<p>Leung, a US citizen in his late 70s with permanent residency in Hong Kong, was also convicted of espionage. China said little about his case when he was first detained in 2021 but later accused him of spying on Chinese officials on behalf of the United States.</p>

<p><strong>Engagement with China</strong></p>

<p>In September, the United States secured the release of another American considered wrongfully detained -- David Lin, a pastor who had been jailed since 2006.</p>

<p>US officials later acknowledged that the release was part of a swap for a Chinese national following quiet diplomacy.</p>

<p>The approach is in sharp contrast to prisoner exchanges with Russia, in which Biden and President Vladimir Putin have personally greeted returning citizens at the airport.</p>

<p>The US prisoners in China have drawn comparatively less attention, although US lawmakers have been repeatedly raised their cases and the Biden administration insisted they remained a priority.</p>

<p>With the latest three, the outgoing administration has secured the release of more than 70 unjustly detained Americans around the world, officials said.</p>

<p>Biden most recently raised the prisoners' case personally with President Xi Jinping during their final meeting this month on the sidelines of the APEC summit in Peru, officials said.</p>

<p>Observers say that China has sought to show that, if the United States engages, it is willing to work constructively on certain areas of concern.</p>

<p>The Biden administration also says that China has taken action against producers of the precursor chemicals to fentanyl, the synthetic painkiller behind an overdose pandemic in the United States that has begun to decline.</p>

<p>President-elect Donald Trump has vowed a more confrontational approach and said on social media this week that he would immediately impose big tariffs on products from China, as well as US neighbors Mexico and Canada.</p>

<p>Both the Biden and Trump teams have described China as the most significant long-term adversary of the United States, but Biden has also emphasized the value of engagement.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Portugal, Spain and Greece are some of the popular destinations offering golden visas. Spain had issued around 800 golden visas during 2024.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ever imagined trading your current passport for one that opens doors to exciting new adventures? While it might sound like a far-fetched dream, several countries offer citizenship programs that could make it a reality.</p>

<p>Although obtaining a citizenship or residency is not cheap, if it is a priority, the investment is worth it. But before that, let's establish the difference between citizenship and residency.</p>

<p>Citizenship guarantees you all the rights a person born in that country would enjoy, for instance - having a passport and the right to vote. However, residency differs in a few ways. While it gives you the freedom to travel freely across the country, work and get paid there, it does not offer all the rights it would a citizen.</p>

<p>Moreover, temporary residency lasts for a set period of time while permanent residency does not have a cap on time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Golden visas are offered by some countries and are a way to obtain residency - but not citizenship. These visas are usually given in exchange for an investment in a country's economy. People donate to government-sponsored programs or invest in properties to take advantage of this.</p>

<p>Portugal, Spain and Greece are some of the popular destinations offering golden visas. Spain had issued around 800 golden visas during 2024.</p>

<p>Apart from golden visas, there are Citizenship by Investment Programs (CIP) that can get you a passport if you invest heavily or pay a fee for that country.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition to the above, there is an interesting visa which allows folks to live and work in the country while still paying taxes to their country of origin, called digital nomad visa. Estonia, Germany and Norway are countries that provide such visas.</p>

<p>Caribbean nations like Antigua and Barbuda, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, Grenada, and Dominica offer CIP programs with various options for investment. Cambodia, Singapore and Australia offer CIP programs too, with Cambodia being among the cheaper options, with investments starting at $245,000.</p>

<p>Singapore's program requires a $7 million investment for a two year residency program and Australia offers the program only to highly skilled individuals with a net worth exceeding $1 million. Countries like Turkey, Greece, Hungary and Brazil also offer golden visa programs.</p>

<p>Obtaining residency or citizenship in a foreign country can be a complex and costly process. However, with the right investment and guidance, it can also offer a world of opportunities and adventures. Whether you're looking for a golden visa, CIP, or digital nomad visa, there are several countries that offer relatively easy and affordable options.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Provisions for immunity from prosecution at the International Criminal Court apply to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the French foreign ministry said on Wednesday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Provisions for immunity from prosecution at the International Criminal Court apply to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the French foreign ministry said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>It said the Israeli leader was covered by immunity rules that apply to states which are not a party to the ICC. Israel is not an ICC member.</p>

<p>"A state cannot be held to act in a way that is incompatible with its obligations in terms of international law with regards to immunities granted to states which are not party to the ICC," the French statement said.</p>

<p>"Such immunities apply to Prime Minister Netanyahu and other ministers in question, and must be taken into consideration should the ICC ask us to arrest them and hand them over," it said.</p>

<p>Earlier Wednesday, Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot had already said that France considered that some leaders could enjoy immunity from ICC prosecution.</p>

<p>Asked if France would arrest Netanyahu if he stepped on French territory, Jean-Noel Barrot did not give a specific answer in an interview with Franceinfo radio.</p>

<p>He said France "is very committed to international justice and will apply international law based on its obligations to cooperate with the ICC."</p>

<p>But he added that the court's statute "deals with questions of immunity for certain leaders".</p>

<p>"It is ultimately up to the judicial authorities to decide," he added.</p>

<p>The ICC this month issued warrants for Netanyahu, former Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant and Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif. Netanyahu has slammed the move.</p>

<p>The EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has said the arrest warrants are "binding" and should be implemented.</p>

<p>However unlike some European states, France has so far taken a more cautious stance on the warrants.</p>

<p>Barrot's comments marked the first time a top French official has evoked a possible immunity.</p>

<p>- 'Deeply problematic' -<br />
Unconfirmed media reports have said that Netanyahu angrily raised the issue in telephone talks with President Emmanuel Macron and urged Paris not to enforce the decision.</p>

<p>France has been instrumental in efforts to end fighting in the Middle East and, with the United States, helped broker a ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon that came into force Wednesday.</p>

<p>Article 27 of the Rome Statute -- the foundation of the ICC -- states that immunity "shall not bar the Court from exercising its jurisdiction over such a person."</p>

<p>But article 98 says a state cannot "act inconsistently with its obligations under international law with respect to the... diplomatic immunity of a person."</p>

<p>France's stance on potential immunity for Netanyahu prompted some strong reactions Wednesday, both at home and abroad.</p>

<p>Amnesty International called the French stance "deeply problematic", saying it ran counter to the government's obligations as an ICC member.</p>

<p>"Rather than inferring that ICC indictees may enjoy immunity, France should expressly confirm its acceptance of the unequivocal legal duty under the Rome Statute to carry out arrest warrants," said Anne Savinel Barras, president of Amnesty International France.</p>

<p>French Green party boss Marine Tondelier, calling the government's stance "shameful", said it was probably the result of an agreement between the French and Israeli leaders.</p>

<p>"Surely that was the deal, that France would get a mention in the official statement announcing the ceasefire in Lebanon that was published by France and the United States yesterday," she said on X.</p>

<p>"Again, France is bending over backwards to meet Benjamin Netanyahu's demand to pick him over international justice," she said.</p>

<p>Barrot meanwhile hailed the ceasefire as a major success for France and expressed hope it would result in the "reform" of Lebanon after years of crisis.</p>

<p>The ceasefire provides "that the Israeli army withdraws from southern Lebanon... and that it is replaced by a massive deployment of the Lebanese armed forces".</p>

<p>"In this context, France will play its full part," Barrot said.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India today welcomed the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Lebanon saying that the move will help bring peace and stability in West Asia. New Delhi said that it has always recommended the path of diplomacy as the 21st Century is no longer an era for war.</p>

<p>"We welcome the ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon that has been announced. We have always called for de-escalation, restraint, and returh to the path of dialogue and diplomacy," a statement from the Ministry of External Affairs read.</p>

<p>"We hope that these developments will lead to peace and stability in the wider region," it added.</p>

<p>A ceasefire agreement between Israel and Lebanon came into effect today. Militant group Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, is based in Lebanon and the latest conflict with Israel started after Hezbollah attacked Israel with its rockets and projectiles in support of its regional ally Hamas, which is another militant group backed by Iran.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has been supporting Hamas - based in Gaza - in its war with Israel. Hamas had carried out a terrorist attack on Israel in October 2023 when it crossed the Gaza-Israel border and stormed a concert killing several Israeli nationals and taking many as hostages, some of whom are still in captivity. This is what triggered the latest war in the region. It has now been more than a year of war in the Middle-East in which tens of thousands of people have died.</p>

<p>Though the ceasefire, a welcome step, halts the war on the Lebanon-front, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in his statement clearly said that the focus on Hamas and Iran will not end.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Netanyahu has also warned that if Hezbollah breaks the deal, Israel will not honour it either and will strike back with full force. The peace deal has been achieved with the intervention of the United States and France, and US President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron are expected to make an official announcement shortly.</p>

<p>Displaced residents of south Lebanon have begun to return to their homes amid celebrations hours after the ceasefire.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of the war, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has repeatedly expressed his deep concern over the widening of the conflict in West Asia and reiterated India's call to de-escalate the situation.</p>

<p>Stating that "India is on the side of peace", PM Modi had also said that New Delhi will do whatever it can to help bring all sides to the dialogue table.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, External Affairs Minister (EAM) S. Jaishankar also met Lebanon Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib on the sidelines of Rome Mediterranean Dialogue. Speaking about the crises in West Asia as well as the war between Russia and Ukraine, Mr Jaishankar had said that "solutions are not going to come from the battlefield."</p>

<p>Speaking specifically about the Middle East conflict, Mr Jaishankar said, "The situation in the Middle East is obviously deeply concerning, both for what has happened and what may still come. India unequivocally condemns terrorism and hostage taking. It also regards large scale civilian casualties in military operations to be unacceptable. International humanitarian law cannot be disregarded. In immediate terms, we should all support a ceasefire."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A shocking video of a plane passenger violently attacking his chair in flight is going viral on social media. The viral clip, shared on Reddit, shows the passenger standing on his reclined seat, stomping it repeatedly as fellow passengers look in shock. At one moment, he also attempts to dismantle the seat by jumping on it violently. According to the <em>New York Post</em>, the incident took place on November 16 aboard a United Airlines flight from Austin to Los Angeles.</p>

<p>"Testing out the new lie-flat seats in United Economy," the caption of the Reddit post read.&nbsp;</p>

"The flight attendant walked by a couple times, nobody was doing anything," he recalled.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then, Mr Galofaro stepped in to stop the senseless rampage. He said that he along with two other passengers "zip-tied" the man's hands and feet and "seat belted him to the seat". Upon arrival, the disrupter was met by police.</p>

<p>"Local law enforcement met United Flight 502 upon arrival at Los Angeles International Airport after a customer became disruptive. We thank our crew for helping address the situation and working to ensure the safety of everyone on board," a United Airlines spokesperson said. They added that they subsequently "banned this customer from future United flights".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Galofaro, on the other hand, said he hopes to contact the culprit's family to see if he can offer any assistance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the comments section, users joked about the incident. "Maybe there was just a really big spider on the headrest," jokingly wrote one user. "DIY to improve seat comfort and quality," quipped another.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia warned the United States on Wednesday to halt what it called a "spiral of escalation" over Ukraine, but said it would keep informing Washington about test missile launches in order to avoid "dangerous mistakes".</p>

<p>The comments from Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov sent a signal that Moscow, which last week approved a new policy that lowered its threshold for the use of nuclear weapons, wants to keep communication channels open at a time of acute tensions with the U.S.</p>

<p>Ryabkov was speaking six days after Russia launched what it described as a new intermediate-range hypersonic ballistic missile called the Oreshnik against Ukraine - something he said had sent a clear message to the West.</p>

<p>"The signal is very clear and obvious - stop, you should not do this any more, you mustn't supply Kyiv with everything they want, don't encourage them towards new military adventures, they are too dangerous," state media quoted Ryabkov as saying.</p>

<p>"The current (U.S.) administration must stop this spiral of escalation," Ryabkov added. "They simply must, otherwise the situation will become too dangerous for everyone, including the United States itself."</p>

<p>President Vladimir Putin said last week that Russia fired the Oreshnik in response to Ukraine's first use of U.S. ATACMS ballistic missiles and British Storm Shadow cruise missiles to strike at Russian territory with permission from the West.</p>

<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Russia's use of the new missile - which Kyiv said reached a speed of 13,600 kph (8,450 miles per hour) - amounted to "a clear and severe escalation" in the war and called for strong worldwide condemnation.</p>

<p>The U.S. military said the missile was experimental and that Russia likely possessed only a handful of them.</p>

<h2>'VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION'</h2>

<p>The Kremlin has said Russia was not technically obliged to warn the United States about the launch of the Oreshnik because it was intermediate-range rather than intercontinental, but that Moscow informed the U.S. 30 minutes before the launch anyway.</p>

<p>"I am sure you understand that this was a stabilising factor in the very dangerous situation in which we currently find ourselves. We are committed to this practice and we hope that the United States will also be committed to it," Ryabkov was quoted as saying.</p>

<p>"And we also hope that such actions will help reduce the risks of miscalculation or dangerous mistakes."</p>

<p>In a separate development on Wednesday, Russia state news agency TASS quoted an official as saying Moscow was continuing work to put its Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile - part of its strategic nuclear arsenal - on combat duty.</p>

<p>Sarmat is designed to deliver nuclear warheads to strike targets thousands of miles away in the United States or Europe, but its development has been dogged by delays and testing setbacks.</p>

<p>In September, arms experts said Russia appeared to have suffered a catastrophic failure in the missile's latest test, leaving a deep crater at the launch silo.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Maldives, a tropical paradise in the Indian Ocean, is renowned for its crystal-clear turquoise waters, pristine white sand beaches and luxurious overwater villas. This archipelago of 1,200 islands offers an idyllic escape for honeymooners, adventurers and relaxation seekers alike. But from December 1, 2024, it will become costlier to leave the archipelago as Maldives as increased its exit fees, levied of passengers leaving a country, according to a report in <em>CNN</em>. The charges will primarily affect foreign travellers, the outlet further said.</p>

<p>For economy-class passengers, the fee will rise from $30 (Rs 2,532) to $50 (Rs 4,220), while business-class passengers will see an increase from $60 (Rs 5,064) to $120 (Rs 10,129). First-class travellers will pay $240 (Rs 20,257), up from $90 (Rs 7,597), and private jet passengers face a significant hike from $120 (Rs 10,129) to $480 (Rs 40,515).</p>

<p>This hike will apply to tourists from all nationalities and also doesn't take into account the length or duration of the flight, said the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/26/travel/maldives-departure-tax-increase-intl-hnk/index.html" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>CNN</em> report</a>.</p>

<p>Maldivian Inland Revenue Authority (MIRA), which announced the increase earlier this month, said the additional revenue will go towards the maintenance of Velana International Airport (MLE), the main airport in Maldives.</p>

<p>These taxes are usually added to the ticket prices, so tourists won't feel the pinch. Some airlines have already posted messages on their websites, advising customers to buy tickets before November 30 to avoid the new tax.</p>

<p>Since Maldives has warm weather the entire year, people visit the island country to view sunsets and indulge in spa. Famous for its privacy and exclusivity, it's a top destination for celebrities and travellers seeking tranquillity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh National Hindu Grand Alliance General Secretary, Mrityunjay Kumar Roy on Wednesday, strongly condemned the petition demanding ban on International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) in Bangladesh and stressed that the Hindu organisation is 'peaceful' in nature and works for the welfare of poor.</p>

<p>This comes after a petition was filed by a lawyer demanding a ban on ISKCON in the country, calling it a "radical organisation" engaging in activities designed to provoke communal unrest, as reported by the local media.</p>

<p>Speaking to ANI, Mrityunjay Kumar Roy said, "We strongly oppose this statement of those who are saying that Iskcon should be banned. What did Iskcon do? Iskcon is the international consciousness of Sri Krishna...it is a peaceful organisation which talks about Shri Krishna and works for the welfare of the poor."</p>

<p>This comes amid the row over the arrest of former priest of ISKCON Bangladesh, Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari, over sedition charges, which led to protests and unrest in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Union Minister Sukanta Majumdar also condemned the arrest of priest Chinmoy Krishna Das and the rise in attacks against minorities.</p>

<p>Highlighting the recent attacks on Hindu temples and the atrocities faced by Hindus in Bangladesh since the political turnover, Mr Majumdar said, "Chinmoy Prabhu's arrest and the attack on minorities in Bangladesh is concerning. We demand that he be released immediately because he was protesting peacefully. Since the political turnover in Bangladesh, Hindu temples are being destroyed and Hindus are being subjected to atrocities. Raising a voice against this cannot be called sedition."</p>

<p>Union Minister Giriraj Singh also condemned the arrest, and also slammed Lok Sabha Leader of Opposition, Rahul Gandhi and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav over their 'silence' on the issue.</p>

<p>"People are speaking of going to Sambhal today. But Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav are ignoring Bangladesh where Hindus are being subjected to a lot of violence. I suggest that Hindus should protest against this atrocity in Bangladesh," he said.</p>

<p>The petition in Bangladesh has alleged that ISKCON has been promoting religious events with the intent of inciting sectarian violence, imposing its beliefs on traditional Hindu communities, and forcibly recruiting members from lower Hindu castes.</p>

<p>It has accused ISKCON of taking over Sanatan temples, evicting members of the Sanatan community, and carrying out communal attacks on mosques. It has also accused ISKCON of "destabilizing" the country and "collaborating with Indian media" to promote communal discord, Dhaka Tribune reported.</p>

<p>Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari was presented before a Chittagong court on Tuesday. The court denied his bail plea and sent him to custody. Das has been accused of sedition for allegedly raising a flag on a stand displaying Bangladesh's national flag.</p>

<p>The arrest has sparked widespread outrage, with many calling for his immediate release.</p>

<p>Notably, ISKCON Bangladesh issued a statement on Tuesday denouncing the arrest of Chinmoy Krishna Das and called upon the government authorities to promote peaceful coexistence.</p>

<p>ISKCON Bangladesh also issued a list of demands to the government for subsequent violence and attacks against Sanatanis in various regions of Bangladesh.</p>

<p>"We express our serious concern and strongly denounce the recent arrest of Chinmoy Krishna Das, spokesperson for the "Bangladesh Sammilito Sanatani Jagaran Jot". We also condemn the subsequent violence and attacks against Sanatanis in various regions of Bangladesh. We urge the government authorities, to promote peaceful coexistence for the Sanatani community", the statement said.</p>

<p>"As a representative of the "Bangladesh Sammilito Sanatani Jagaran Jot" and a Bangladeshi citizen, Chinmoy Krishna Das has been a vocal advocate for the protection of minority groups in the nation. It is essential to uphold his right to free speech and to support his efforts to encourage others to defend this right. Ensuring justice and fair treatment for him is crucial", the statement added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Billionaire philanthropist and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates once gave a brilliant answer to one of the most common job interview questions that would have most of us stumped. During a 2020 interview for NBA star Stephen Curry's YouTube series called 'State of Inspiration', Mr Gates was asked to play the role of a junior software engineer interviewing for a job at Microsoft. He was then asked a few questions to which the tech magnet revealed important points and prospective that might help you for your next big career move.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the most common job interview questions the billionaire was asked was salary expectations. "What is your salary expectation for the role?" the host of the show asked Mr Gates. To this, the tech mogul didn't give an actual figure, but he explained how best to answer the question.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I hope the option package is good. I'm able to take risk and I think the company has a great future, so I prefer to get stock options even more than cash compensation," Mr Gates advised, per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/carminegallo/2020/11/01/watch-bill-gates-give-brilliant-30-second-answers-to-common-job-interview-questions/" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>Forbes</em></a>. "I hear some other companies are paying a lot, but treat me fairly and emphasize the options," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By saying he is willing to take shares of a company instead of a mega salary shows the interviewer that he is a risk-taker and believes in the firm, its products and its future. According to <em>Forbes</em>, he also gives himself leverage in any salary discussion by saying, "I hear other companies are paying a lot". This reminds the interviewer that this job candidate is in high demand, but treat him fairly and he'll be a team player.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the YouTube show, Mr Gates also answered other job interview questions that candidates dread answering. One important question that interviewers usually ask is: "Why should we hire you?"&nbsp;</p>

<p>Answering this, Mr Gates responded, "You should look at the codes that I've written. I write software programs way beyond any classes that I've taken. I think I've gotten better over time, so take a look at how ambitious I've been there."</p>

<p>"I do think I can work well with people. I might criticize their code a little harshly, but overall, I like to be on a team. I like ambitious goals. I like thinking through how we can anticipate the future. Software is cool, and I want to be involved," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Gates' answer shows off his achievements while also showing how his skills have improved over time. His answer also points out his ability to work well with others as well as reflects on where he could have improved. Overall, his answer demonstrates his high standards of excellence - an important quality recruiters look for and admire in a job candidate.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Several in Trump's team now see a direct approach from Trump, to build on a relationship that already exists, as most likely to break the ice with Kim.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President-elect Donald Trump's team is discussing pursuing direct talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, hoping a fresh diplomatic push can lower the risks of armed conflict, according to two people familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>Several in Trump's team now see a direct approach from Trump, to build on a relationship that already exists, as most likely to break the ice with Kim, years after the two traded insults and what Trump called "beautiful" letters in an unprecedented diplomatic effort during his first term in office, the people said.</p>

<p>The policy discussions are fluid and no final decisions have been made by the president-elect, the sources said.</p>

<p>Trump's transition team did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>What reciprocation Kim will offer Trump is unclear. The North Koreans ignored four years of outreach by U.S. President Joe Biden to start talks with no pre-conditions, and Kim is emboldened by an expanded missile arsenal and a much closer relationship with Russia.</p>

<p>"We have already gone as far as we can on negotiating with the United States," Kim said last week in a speech at a Pyongyang military exhibition, according to state media.</p>

<p>During his 2017-2021 presidency, Trump held three meetings with Kim, in Singapore, Hanoi, and at the Korean border, the first time a sitting U.S. president had set foot in the country.</p>

<p>Their diplomacy yielded no concrete results, even as Trump described their talks as falling "in love." The U.S. called for North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons, while Kim demanded full sanctions relief, then issued new threats.</p>

<p>It was not clear what result a new diplomatic effort would yield. An initial Trump goal would be to reestablish basic engagement but further policy aims or a precise timetable have not been set, the people said. And the issue may take a backseat to more pressing foreign policy concerns in the Middle East and Ukraine, according to one person briefed on the transition's thinking.</p>

<p>North Korean state media have not yet publicly mentioned the re-election of Trump, and Kim said this month that the United States was ramping up tension and provocations, raising the risks of nuclear war.</p>

<p>Trump and some of his allies left office with the impression that the direct approach was Washington's best shot at influencing behavior north of the demilitarized zone, which has divided the Korean Peninsula for seven decades. The countries' war was never technically ended even as the guns fell silent.</p>

<p>On Friday, Trump named one of the people who implemented that initial North Korea strategy, former State Department official Alex Wong, as his deputy national security adviser. "As Deputy Special Representative for North Korea, he helped negotiate my Summit with North Korean Leader, Kim Jong Un," Trump said in a statement.</p>

<p>TENSIONS RISE</p>

<p>Trump inherits an increasingly tense situation with Kim when he returns to the White House in January, as he did in 2017, an atmosphere allies expect the incoming president to confront head-on.</p>

<p>"My experience with President Trump is he's much more likely to be open to direct engagement," said U.S. Senator Bill Hagerty, a Trump ally, in an interview with Reuters earlier this year. "I'm optimistic that we can see an improvement in the relationship and perhaps a different posture adopted by Kim Jong Un if that dialogue were reopened again."</p>

<p>Washington has a dossier of concerns over the country's expanding nuclear weapons and missile program, its increasingly hostile rhetoric to South Korea and its close collaboration with Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>These topics are expected to feature in Biden administration transition briefings for Trump aides, according to a U.S. official. The Trump team has yet to sign transition agreements, which could limit the scope of some of these briefings.</p>

<p>The White House did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Particularly concerning to Washington are the prospects of increased sharing of nuclear or missile technology between Russia and North Korea and the deployment of thousands of North Korean troops to Russia to help in the war with Ukraine.</p>

<p>Reuters reported on Monday that North Korea is expanding a key weapons manufacturing complex that assembles a type of short-range missile used by Russia in Ukraine, citing researchers at a U.S.-based think tank who examined satellite images.</p>

<p>U.S. officials said those factors raise the risk of a conflict between multiple nuclear armed nations in Europe or Asia, including the United States and its allies, which include South Korea and Japan.</p>

<p>American troops are deployed throughout the region to deter North Korea, and Trump has insisted that U.S. allies share more of the cost for those deployments.</p>

<p>In his final meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping earlier this month in Peru, Biden asked for Beijing to use its leverage to reel in North Korea.</p>

<p>Opportunity for China and the U.S. to work together may be limited as Trump vows vast tariffs on Chinese goods and stacks his inner circle with China hardliners, such as Marco Rubio as secretary of state and Representative Mike Waltz as national security adviser.</p>

<p>Trump said last month the two countries would have had "a nuclear war with millions of people killed," but that he had stopped it, thanks to his ties with the North's leader.</p>

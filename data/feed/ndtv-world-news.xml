       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh today summoned India's envoy to Dhaka amid tensions between both countries over the surge in violence against Hindu minorities in Bangladesh. Indian High Commissioner Pranay Verma arrived at the Foreign Ministry Office in Dhaka at 4 pm local time.</p>

<p>Apart from the violence against the Hindu minority in Bangladesh, that New Delhi has raised on several occasions with Dhaka, tensions between both sides have also been high since former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India after being forced to step down by protesters.</p>

<p>Without giving any details about why the envoy was summoned, Bangladesh's Foreign Affairs Adviser Touhid Hossain just said, "He (Verma) has been asked to come."</p>

<p>"The Indian High Commissioner has been summoned by acting foreign secretary Reaz Hamidullah," Bangladesh's state-run news agency said.</p>

<p>India has taken up the issue of Hindus being targeted in Bangladesh and priests being arrested by the authorities in Bangladesh. There have also been multiple incidents of violence, vandalism and desecration targeting the minority Hindu community.</p>

<p>There has been no official statement from the Ministry of External Affairs in New Delhi regarding the summoning of the Indian envoy.</p>

<p>More details are awaited.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mere weeks before the completion of his Presidential term, outgoing president Joe Biden approved a crucial sale of defence equipment to India. He notified the Congress about the decision on Monday.<br />
The US has authorised the sale of MH-60R Multi-Mission Helicopter Equipment and related ones at the cost of USD 1.17 billion.</p>

<p>This will enhance India's submarine warfare capabilities by deterring present and future threats the Defense Security Cooperation Agency told the Congress.</p>

<p>"This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by helping to strengthen the United States - India strategic relationship and improving the security of a major defense partner which continues to be an important force for political stability, peace, and economic progress in the Indo-Pacific and South Asia regions," the DSCA said.</p>

<p>It also included advanced data transfer systems; external fuel tanks; AN/AAS 44C(V) forward looking infrared (FLIR) systems; an operator machine interface assistant; spare containers; facilities study, design, construction and support; support and test equipment; munitions; and integration and test support.</p>

<p>The principal contractor for this deal will be Lockheed Martin Rotary and Mission Systems.</p>

<p>20 US government or 25 contractor representatives will be required to travel to India temporarily for the implementation of this sale to provide technical support and management oversight.</p>

<p>On March 6th this year India's Defence took a modern turn as the Indian Navy had commissioned the newly inducted MH 60R Seahawk, a maritime variant of the Blackhawk helicopter, at INS Garuda, Kochi.</p>

<p>Here are some key features of the MH-60R Helicopters:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Advanced digital sensors include the multi-mode radar, electronic support measures system, electro-optical/infrared camera, datalinks, aircraft survivability systems, dipping sonar and sonobuoys.</li>
	<li>The fully-integrated mission system processes sensor data to build a complete situational picture of the ocean surface and subsea domain.</li>
	<li>With actionable knowledge, the crew can track, target and engage ships or submarines effectively and efficiently.</li>
	<li>Weapons include torpedoes, air-to-ground missiles and rockets, and crew served guns.</li>
</ol>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.business-standard.com/external-affairs-defence-security/news/us-okays-1-2-bn-mh-60r-helicopter-equipment-sale-to-india-why-it-matters-124120300570_1.html" rel="noindex,nofollow">Business Standard</a>, the MH-60Rs intended for the Indian Navy are equipped with specialised systems tailored to Indian requirements and have reportedly been customised, including the addition of Identification Friend-or-Foe (IFF) transponder units from Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL).</p>

<p>Lockheed is also collaborating with Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) for integrating such systems. As stated on their website, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/products/sikorsky-mh-60-seahawk-helicopters.html" rel="noindex,nofollow">Lockheed Martin's</a> Performance Based Logistics program for the U.S. Navy MH-60R helicopters enable 95 per cent flight readiness and availability - a rate unmatched by other maritime helicopters.</p>

<p>330 MH-60rs are operational worldwide. Including the Indian Navy, these helicopters are in operation with the U.S. Navy, Royal Danish Navy, Royal Australian Navy and Royal Saudi Naval Forces. These helicopters are additionally designed for search, rescue, medical evacuation, command, control and vertical replenishment missions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Despite a tripling of vehicle numbers, pollution levels have decreased, making Beijing a model for other cities tackling similar problems.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China was once nicknamed as the "Kingdom of Bicycles" because of the widespread practice of cycling in this densely populated nation. There was a time when a bicycle was one of the "three rounds" every Chinese house desired, together with a wristwatch and a sewing machine.</p>

<p>However, the country has faced many challenges since it transitioned from bicycles to automobiles and other combustion engines. This shift led to complex problems for the environment, society, and economy. Beijing became known specifically for its poor air quality and a lot of haze.</p>

<p>The fast-growing population, along with high vehicle count and economic expansion, causes this much pressure on Beijing's ecology.</p>

<p>Despite these obstacles, Beijing has improved its air quality significantly in recent years, serving as a model for other cities, particularly in South Asia, facing comparable problems.</p>

<p>As China emerged as the world's largest automobile producer and consumer, it grappled with the detrimental impacts of increased oil consumption, but now China's skies are clearer, and its air quality has drastically improved.</p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.weforum.org/videos/beijingc-cut-air-pollution/#:~:text=Since%202013%2C%20PM2.,more%20than%20300%20in%202023.">World Economic Forum,</a> the Chinese capital has cut fine particle pollution by 64% and sulphur dioxide by 89% since 2013-now other cities are following its lead.</p>

High-efficiency terminal treatment facilities were continuously renovated, and ultralow emission standards were enforced during this period.</p>

<p>The prevention and control of vehicle pollution have long been critical tasks in Beijing's air pollution control. Focusing on new vehicles, in-use vehicles, and fuel quality, Beijing has implemented a series of local emission standards and comprehensive control measures, as well as strengthened traffic management and economic incentives continuously.</p>

<p>Although the number of vehicles increased threefold in Beijing during the last two decades, the total pollutant emissions decreased remarkably.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spain has registered its warmest November since record-keeping began more than six decades ago, even after October ended with its worst floods in a generation, official data showed Tuesday.</p>

<p>November's average temperature was 12.4 degrees Celsius (54.3 Fahrenheit), which was 0.5 degrees Celsius higher than the previous record for the month in 1983, and 2.8C higher than the November average between 1991 and 2020, national weather agency AEMET said on social media.</p>

<p>It was the highest average temperature for a month of November since the agency began to keep records in 1961.</p>

<p>"It was also a very dry November overall," the agency said, adding that precipitation was 40 percent below normal levels "despite the abundant rains" during the first days of the month in the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>Torrential rains on October 29 caused flash floods that killed at least 230 people and swept away cars and wrecked homes and businesses, mainly in the eastern region of Valencia on the Mediterranean coast.</p>

<p>The storm was followed by several episodes of heavy rain in the region during the first week of November that hampered the clean-up operation.</p>

<p>Spain endured its second-hottest year on record in 2023 with an average temperature of 15.2C, just below the record 15.5C registered in 2022.</p>

<p>As global temperatures rise because of climate change, scientists have warned that heatwaves and other extreme weather events like droughts and wildfires will become more frequent and more intense.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korean actor Park Min-jae has died at the age of 32, <em>CNA Lifestyle</em> reported citing South Korean news agencies. Mr Min-jae died from sudden cardiac arrest on November 29, Friday, while travelling to China. Despite his brief career, the actor made significant contributions to several notable Korean dramas including<em> 'Little Women', 'Call It Love', 'The Korea-Khitan War', 'Snap And Spark',</em> and <em>'True To Love'.</em>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"A beautiful actor who loved acting and always did his best, Park Min-jae has gone to heaven," Mr Min-jae's agency Big Title said in a statement. "We will no longer be able to see his acting, but we will always remember him with pride," it continued. The agency also stated that the 32-year-old did not have major health issues before leaving for China, per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://cnalifestyle.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/park-min-jae-death-korean-actor-414661" rel="noindex,nofollow">outlet</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Big Title's CEO Hwang Ju Hye also expressed his grief online. "The guy who said he would conquer China and go on a month-long trip has gone on a much longer journey. It was so sudden and so shocking... The family must be feeling unimaginable sorrow... Min Jae, there's still so much we wanted to say and do together. I was grateful to have been your representative, even if only for a short time, and I'm deeply sorry. I will never forget the name, Actor Park Min Jae," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Separately, Mr Min-jae's brother Park Jae-hyung took to Instagram to post details of the actor's funeral service. A wake to honour the late actor will be held in Room 9 of the Seoul National University Hospital Funeral Hall. The funeral is scheduled for December 4. As of now, the location for his burial has not been confirmed.</p>

<p>"Our beloved brother has gone to rest peacefully. We hope as many people as possible can come to see him off. We kindly ask for your understanding as we are unable to personally contact everyone," the actor's brother said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Min-jae's demise also left many of his fans in disbelief. "my condolences to you all," commented one user. "Our deepest condolences to his family, friends, and fans during this difficult time. May he rest in peace," commented another.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japan is planning to use AI to police anime and manga pirating websites that the pop-culture powerhouse accuses of costing it billions of dollars in lost revenue every year.</p>

<p>There are at least 1,000 websites illegally offering free downloads of Japanese content, mostly its globally-renowned manga graphic novels, a group of domestic publishers claimed earlier this year.</p>

<p>But under a 300 million yen ($2 million) pilot scheme proposed by Tokyo's cultural agency, AI will scour the web for sites pirating manga books and anime cartoons, using an image and text detection system.</p>

<p>"Copyright-holders spend a significant amount of human resources trying to manually detect pirated content online," cultural agency official Keiko Momii told AFP on Tuesday.</p>

<p>But human moderators can "barely keep up" with constantly proliferating illegal content, the agency said in a written document.</p>

<p>The initiative features in the agency's supplementary budget request for this fiscal year ending in March.</p>

<p>It is inspired by a similar project in South Korea and if successful could also be applied to other illegally shared films and music.</p>

<p>Japan, the birthplace of comic and cartoon epics such as "Dragon Ball" and game franchises from "Super Mario" to "Final Fantasy", sees the creative industries as a driver for growth on par with steel and semiconductors.</p>

<p>In its revised "Cool Japan" strategy released in June, the government said it aims to boost exports of these cultural assets to 20 trillion yen ($130 billion) by 2033.</p>

<p>Around 70 percent of pirating sites offering Japanese content operate in foreign languages including English, Chinese and Vietnamese, Japanese publishers say.</p>

<p>In 2022, Japan's gaming, anime and manga sectors raked in 4.7 trillion yen ($30 billion) from abroad -- close to microchips exports at 5.7 trillion yen, government data shows.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Talks in London on Tuesday between British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Greek counterpart Kyriakos Mitsotakis have rekindled hopes of a deal for the repatriation of the Parthenon Marbles from the British Museum in 2025.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Talks in London on Tuesday between British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Greek counterpart Kyriakos Mitsotakis have rekindled hopes of a deal for the repatriation of the Parthenon Marbles from the British Museum in 2025.</p>

<p>Here are some of the key facts concerning the 200-year-old debate:</p>

<p><strong>What are the Parthenon Marbles?</strong></p>

<p>Known in Britain as the Elgin Marbles, the 2,500-year-old sculptures for centuries adorned the Parthenon temple built at the pinnacle of ancient Athens's power at the Acropolis citadel in honour of the city's patron goddess, Athena.</p>

<p>It was partially destroyed during a Venetian bombardment in 1687, and in the early 1800s, workmen took friezes from the monument on the orders of the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, Scottish nobleman Thomas Bruce, known as Lord Elgin.</p>

<p>Elgin sold the marbles to the British government, which in 1817 passed them on to the British Museum where they remain one of its most prized exhibits.</p>

<p>The British Museum notes that smaller Parthenon frieze collections and fragments are also in the Louvre and museums in Copenhagen, Munich, Vienna and Wurzburg.</p>

<p><strong>Greek and British positions</strong></p>

<p>Athens has for decades demanded the return of the sculptures, a campaign revived in the 1980s by emblematic Greek actress Melina Mercouri during her stint as minister for culture.</p>

<p>The Greek authorities maintain that the sculptures were looted by Elgin.</p>

<p>But London insists that the sculptures were "legally acquired" by Elgin.</p>

<p>The British aristocrat had long maintained he had received permission from the Ottoman Sultan to remove antiquities from the Acropolis.</p>

<p>But in June, Turkey's spokesperson at a meeting of UNESCO's Intergovernmental Committee for Promoting the Return of Cultural Property to its Countries of Origin or its Restitution in Case of Illicit Appropriation (ICPRCP) said no such document, known as a firman, had been found in Ottoman archives.</p>

<p><strong>Where are we at now?</strong></p>

<p>The Guardian newspaper on Monday said that the talks on returning the sculptures to Athens were "well advanced".</p>

<p>"Sources have said that talks between the Greek foreign ministry and George Osborne, the chair of the British Museum, are moving towards 'an agreement in principle' to reunify the antiquities in Athens," the daily said.</p>

<p>Mitsotakis has made the repatriation of the Marbles a personal priority since coming to power in 2019.</p>

<p>Greek media have reported that his close confidant George Gerapetritis, now foreign minister, years ago was tasked alongside Culture Minister Lina Mendoni with seeing this through.</p>

<p>Mendoni on Tuesday told state TV ERT said there was a "positive climate" globally in favour of the repatriation of antiquities, but that the issue needed "time and appropriate maturation".</p>

<p>Three fragments of Athens's Parthenon temple, kept by the Vatican for centuries, were returned to Greece last year in what Pope Francis called a gesture of friendship.</p>

<p>Public opinion in Britain in past decades has steadily moved in favour of returning the Marbles.</p>

<p>A YouGov poll on Monday found that 53 percent of respondents said the British Museum should return the sculptures to Greece, with 24 percent opposed.</p>

<p>A 1963 British law prevents the museum from giving away treasures.</p>

<p>In October, Greek government spokesman Pavlos Marinakis said a deal could involve "some partnerships on the conservation of antiquities, the exchange of exhibits in temporary exhibitions and other joint initiatives to raise awareness of ancient Greek culture".</p>

<p>Officials have suggested that using the word "deposit" in a possible agreement could enable both sides to skirt the ownership issue entirely.</p>

<p>In 2022, when the Antonino Salinas Museum in Palermo sent to Greece a Parthenon marble fragment, the Greek culture ministry said it was "a deposit, not a loan" and would remain in the Greek capital for the next eight years.</p>

<p>Greece subsequently said it had reached a legal agreement with the Sicilian regional government to make the return permanent.</p>

<p>The Greek culture ministry in 2022 also brokered a deal to acquire 161 Bronze Age antiquities formerly in the collection of US billionaire and philanthropist Leonard Stern.</p>

<p>The agreement involved the artifacts gradually returning to Greece over the next 25 years after being displayed at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US President-elect Donal Trump, during his last week's meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, reportedly joked about making Canada the 51st state of the United States to avoid high tariffs.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donal Trump, during his last week's meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, reportedly joked about making Canada the 51st state of the United States to avoid high tariffs. Mr Trudeau flew to Florida on Friday to have dinner with the incoming US President after the latter threatened to slap high tariffs on Canadian imports unless Ottawa prevents migrants and drugs from crossing the frontier.</p>

<p>During dinner at Mr Trump's private Mar-a-Lago estate, the Canadian Prime Minister reportedly promised the President-elect that Ottawa would toughen controls over the long undefended joint border.&nbsp;Canada sends 75 per cent of all goods and services exports to the United States and tariffs would badly hurt the economy.</p>

<p>However, new details have emerged about the meeting, which Mr Trump had earlier called "very productive."</p>

<p>Quoting two people who heard the discussion, Fox News reported that during dinner, Mr Trump told Mr Trudeau that if Ottawa cannot handle his list of demands, including controlling the border issues and paying the trade deficit, then Canada should become "a state or two" with Mr Trudeau as their governor.</p>

<p>The US President-elect told his northern counterpart that Canada has failed the US border by allowing large amounts of drugs and people across the border, "including illegal immigrants from over 70 different countries." He also raised the issue of the US trade deficit with Canada, which he reportedly estimated to be more than $100 billion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The President-elect threatened to levy a 25 per cent tariff on all Canadian goods on day one after he takes office on January 20, 2025, if Canada did not fix both issues by then.</p>

<p>When Mr Trudeau opined that Canada cannot levy such a high tariff as it would "kill the Canadian economy completely", Trump asked, "So your country can't survive unless it's ripping off the U.S. to the tune of $100 billion?"</p>

<p>He then jokingly suggested to Trudeau that Canada become the 51st state, which caused the prime minister and others to laugh nervously, sources told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-suggests-canada-become-51st-state-after-trudeau-said-tariff-would-kill-economy-sources" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">Fox News</a>.</p>

<p>At this moment, "someone at the table chimed in and advised Trump that Canada would be a very liberal state, which received even more laughter," the report said.</p>

<p>To this, Mr Trump reportedly suggested that Canada could become two states-- a conservative and a liberal one-- and told Mr Trudeau that if he cannot handle his list of demands, then "Canada should really become a state or two and Trudeau could become a governor."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The DoJ and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently filed an indictment and a civil complaint in the New York District Court against the top Adani Group officials.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The recent indictment by the US Department of Justice (DoJ) of Adani Group officials is nothing but a frivolous expense and once President-elect Donald Trump assumes office, such wasteful exercises involving the government offices with overseas businesses will probably fade away, ace global investor Mark Mobius told news agency IANS on Tuesday.</p>

<p>His comment came as serious questions are now being raised regarding the independence of the US DoJ and its indictment against the Adani Group, and whether it is being used for "politically motivated actions".</p>

<p>"My guess is that Donald Trump will come in and whoever he appoints to run the Justice Department will say, what are you guys doing? Sticking your nose into Indian businesses? Spending all this money on a trial which probably won't go anywhere?" Mr Mobius told news agency IANS.</p>

<p>Mr Mobius, who runs the Mobius EM Opportunities Fund for emerging markets, further stated that there is a "good chance" that the Justice Department will move away from the Adani probe and the trial.</p>

<p>"I believe that there would be another implication where the Justice Department will be reorganised in America, and will be asked to get less and less involved in overseas situations and more and more with domestic issues," said the top investor.</p>

<p>The DoJ and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently filed an indictment and a civil complaint in the New York District Court against the top Adani Group officials. However, the Adani Group vehemently refuted the allegations, terming it 'baseless', and said it would seek legal recourse to defend itself.</p>

<p>According to Mobius, a lot of people are now beginning to realise that with Trump assuming office, "this DoJ situation in the US will probably go away".</p>

<p>On Adani Portfolio stocks performing well despite the US-related developments, he said that the situation with the hedge funds going after the Adani Group seemed to have fizzled out.</p>

<p>"A lot of investors began to look at this and said, well, Adani is under pressure but at the end of the day, their business will continue to operate well and probably will continue to do well in the future," Mr Mobius noted.</p>

<p>Adani stocks have roared back from initial hiccups, and are now surging almost daily on the Indian benchmark indices. They added more than Rs 2 lakh crore to their market cap in just a three-day rally.</p>

<p>A Bernstein report on Adani Group companies on Tuesday stated that the Group is currently in a much stronger position than it was during the Hindenburg attack in January 2023.</p>

<p>Despite facing some US-related developments, the Adani Group is on solid footing across four key areas: no share pledge, leverage, debt repayment and valuations, the report mentioned.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/india-china-ties" target="_blank">India-China ties</a> - "abnormal" since April 2020, when the two militaries clashed in parts of eastern Ladakh, leading to fatalities on both sides for the first time in 45 years - have improved recently, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar told the Lok Sabha Tuesday, explaining that "continuous diplomatic engagement since then (has) set our ties in the direction of some improvement".</p>

<p>India remains committed, Mr Jaishankar said, to engaging with China "through bilateral talks to arrive at a fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable settlement for the border issue".</p>

<p>It is, however evident, he told Parliament, that management of border areas will require further attention in light of our recent experiences. He flagged three key principles to be observed in all circumstances.</p>

<p>The first is that both sides should strictly respect and observe the LAC. The second is that neither should attempt to unilaterally alter the status quo, and the third is that agreements and understandings reached in the past must be fully abided by in their entirety.</p>

<p>"Members will recall the amassing of a large number of troops by China along the LAC (Line of Actual Control) in eastern Ladakh in April-May 2020 resulted in face-offs with our forces at a number of points. The situation also led to disruption of patrolling activities," the EAM began his remarks.</p>

<p>"It is to the credit of our armed forces that despite logistical challenges, and the then prevailing Covid situation, they were able to counter-deploy rapidly and effectively," he said.</p>

<p>"While a determined counter-deployment of adequate capability was the immediate response, there was also the imperative of a diplomatic effort to defuse tensions and restore peace and tranquility."</p>

<p>That diplomatic effort, which included nearly two dozen rounds of talks between military commanders, the most recent on August 29, led to the October agreement, under which Indian and Chinese troops returned to positions, and resumed patrolling routes, prior to the April 2020 face-off.</p>

<p>The agreement - announced hours before Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Russia for a BRICS Summit at which China's Xi Jinping would also be present - was seen as a roadmap to restoration of peace and tranquility along the LAC, a status quo the Indian government has often spoken about as the first, and a necessary, step towards any normalisation of relations between the two countries.</p>

<p>On that topic, Mr Jaishankar said the immediate priority - of disengagement of troops from friction points in eastern Ladakh, specifically in the Depsang and Demchok areas, had been "fully achieved".</p>

<p>The next priority is to consider de-escalation, which will address amassing of troops along the Line of Actual Control, which serves as the de facto international border, the External Affairs Minister said.</p>

<p>Mr Jaishankar's remarks came two weeks after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh met his Chinese counterpart,&nbsp;Dong Jun, for a first ministerial-level meet since the disengagement in eastern Ladakh.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Singh and Mr Dong, a former naval Commander appointed in December last year, met on the sidelines of a two-day, 10-nation ASEAN summit in Laos that began November 20.</p>

<p>Disengagement and patrolling in Depsang and Demchok follows similar positive actions on the north and south banks of the Pangong Lake in 2021, and in the contentious Gogra-Hot Springs area in September a year later. In each case the two sides withdrew to pre-April 2020 positions.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Kash Pate, President-elect Donald Trumps nominee to lead the FBI, has pledged to make the so-called "Diddy list" and the infamous Epstein files public after taking office.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kash Patel, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee to lead the FBI, has pledged to make the so-called “Diddy list” and the infamous Epstein files public after taking office. Speaking on a podcast, the Indian American loyalist of Mr Trump, who shares the president-elect's scepticism of the FBI and intelligence community, said he's committed to restoring trust in federal agencies by exposing decades of alleged corruption.</p>

<p>During the conversation on "Benny Johnson" podcast, Mr Patel said "trust in our agencies and departments" can only be restored by "giving the American people the truth."</p>

<p>“And that's what they feared about Donald Trump. He's gonna come in there and maybe give them the Epstein list, and maybe give them the P. Diddy list, you know, maybe he's gonna come up there and do all these things, and they're terrified,” he said</p>

<p>The term "Diddy list" refers to the names of public figures accused of being associated with the rapper Diddy's alleged "freak-off" parties, where sexual misconduct and grooming allegedly took place.</p>

<p>By picking Kash Patel to lead the United State's premier federal law enforcement agency, the incoming US President signalled his intention to overhaul the intelligence agency he has long criticized.</p>

<p>However, Mr Patel is expected to face an uphill battle to get a Senate confirmation to take over his appointed role, not only for&nbsp;professed fealty to Mr Trump but also his beliefs — revealed over the last year in interviews and his own book.</p>

<p>Time and again, the MAGA (Make America Great Again) loyalist has said that the century-old Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) should be radically overhauled. Kash Patel has proposed shutting down the FBI's Washington headquarters at J Edgar Hoover Building and dispersing its employees across the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I'd shut down the FBI Hoover Building on day one and reopen it the next day as a museum of the deep state,'" Patel said in a September interview on the “Shawn Kelly Show."&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Then, I'd take the 7,000 employees that work in that building and send them across America to chase down criminals. Go be cops. You're cops — go be cops," he added.</p>

<p>The first FBI employees moved into the current Pennsylvania Avenue headquarters 50 years ago, according to a report by the Associated Press (AP). Since then, the building reportedly housed scores of supervisors and leaders who make decisions affecting offices around the country and overseas.</p>

<p>Mr Patel's plan to completely shut the building would require legal, logistical and bureaucratic hurdles and the plan may reflect more of a rhetorical flourish than a practical ambition, the AP report said.</p>

<p>In a book last year titled, “Government Gangsters: The Deep State, the Truth and the Battle for Our Democracy,” he proposed a more modest reform of having the headquarters moved out of Washington “to prevent institutional capture and curb FBI leadership from engaging in political gamesmanship.”</p>

<p>As it happens, the long-term fate of the iconic building remains in flux regardless of the leadership transition. The General Services Administration reportedly selected last year Greenbelt in Maryland as the site for a new headquarters. However, current FBI Director Christopher Wray has raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest in the site selection process.</p>

<p>Mr Patel has also been a fierce critic of the FBI's use of its surveillance authorities under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and in his “Shawn Kelly Show” interview, he called for “major, major reform. Tons."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US presidents traditionally dole out pardons as they leave office but Joe Biden's "full and unconditional" pardon of his son Hunter is a rare instance involving a family member.</p>

<p>Bill Clinton granted a pardon to his half-brother Roger, who had served time in prison on 1985 drug charges, on January 20, 2001, his last day in office.</p>

<p>And Donald Trump pardoned Charles Kushner, a fellow real estate magnate whose son Jared is married to Trump's daughter Ivanka, at the end of his first term in the White House.</p>

<p>Trump, now president-elect, nominated Kushner, 70, who pleaded guilty in 2004 to tax evasion, witness tampering and making illegal campaign contributions, on Saturday to be the next US ambassador to France.</p>

<p>Kushner, who served 14 months in prison, admitted hiring a prostitute to seduce his brother-in-law, who was cooperating in the campaign finance inquiry, and sending a videotape of the encounter to his own sister.</p>

<p>Hunter Biden, who has struggled with alcohol and drug addiction, is the first child of a sitting president to receive a pardon.</p>

<p>His father, who leaves office on January 20, had repeatedly said he would not pardon his son -- but in announcing the move on Sunday he claimed that Hunter had been "selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted."</p>

<p>"I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice," Biden said.</p>

<p>"No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter's cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son -- and that is wrong," the president said.</p>

<p>Hunter Biden pleaded guilty to tax evasion in September and was facing up to 17 years in prison. He risked 25 years in prison for the felony gun charge but was not expected to receive such stiff sentences in either case.</p>

<p>Presidents have also used their constitutionally-mandated pardon powers over the years on close friends and political allies.</p>

<p>One of the most controversial pardons in recent years was that of former president Richard Nixon by his successor in the White House, Gerald Ford.</p>

<p>Ford granted a "full and unconditional" pardon to Nixon, who was facing potential prosecution over the Watergate scandal, on September 8, 1974.</p>

<p>Trump is the first former president convicted of a crime -- falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment to a porn star -- but he will not be able to pardon himself because the case involved state and not federal charges.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Saudi Arabia is investing in green innovation to transform its deserts, but accusations of greenwashing highlight the challenge of turning ambitious projects into climate solutions.</p>

<p>This week, Riyadh is hosting the United Nations COP16 conference on drought and desertification -- topics close to home for the Gulf kingdom, whose officials have said they aim to restore 40 million hectares of degraded land.</p>

<p>But while the country is a major investor in climate tech, it has not abandoned its longstanding defence of oil, and critics say its gestures toward environmental friendliness offer only limited benefits.</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia accounts for nearly 75 percent of Middle East investment in climate technology start-ups worldwide, according to a 2023 report by auditor PwC.</p>

<p>But its investment in green tech skews towards energy, with $363 million ploughed into climate-friendly energy solutions -- nearly 10 times as much as was invested in innovations related to food, agriculture and land-use, PwC said.</p>

<p>On a vast campus in the desert north of Jeddah, one project that could prove useful in the parched kingdom is using microorganisms to reduce the energy cost of treating wastewater.</p>

<p>The treatment facility seeks to "purify and treat wastewater in an energy-neutral or even positive way", said Peiying Hong, the environmental science and engineering academic who oversees the facility at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology.</p>

<p>The process, she said, relies on microorganisms that convert carbon into methane gas, which is collected and used to produce energy for the facility.</p>

<p>The filtered water from the process "can be used to grow micro algae to produce feed for livestock, or to irrigate plants and trees to combat desertification", she added.</p>

<h3><strong>Sand into soil</strong></h3>

<p>Recycled water could prove valuable to the largely desert country with extremely limited water resources.</p>

<p>As part of its so-called Middle East Green Initiative, Saudi Arabia aims to eventually plant 10 billion trees, according to the project's website, and rehabilitate more than 74 million hectares of land.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To achieve these ambitions, efficient management of water and soil resources is essential.</p>

<p>Himanshu Mishra, also an environmental science and engineering expert at KAUST, said his team have developed a product they believe is capable of transforming the kingdom's desert into fertile land.</p>

<p>"We are transforming sand into soil," the professor said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The carbon-enriched compost made from chicken manure -- an abundant and underused resource in Saudi Arabia -- is developed a step further than normal fertiliser.</p>

<p>Mishra explained his innovation "acts like a sponge to retain these nutrients and water, while promoting microbial biodiversity", which plants need to thrive.</p>

<p>The professor's experimental farm has been left teeming with vegetation as a result.</p>

<p>Mishra explained that by selling its carbonated topsoil, made in the kingdom from local waste, Saudi Arabia could become "an exporter of both the product and its technology".</p>

<h3><strong>Greenwashing?</strong></h3>

<p>Despite their potential, deploying such systems on a national or regional level requires financial support and political will.</p>

<p>"We really need venture funding and investment to demonstrate their effectiveness on a large scale," Hong said.</p>

<p>But John Robinson, an investor and partner at Mazarine Ventures, says raising funds for these types of start-ups remains "extremely hard", though some manage to attract private investors.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia's ambitions have not taken away from its fierce defence of oil, as it continues to be the world's biggest exporter of crude.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition to combating desertification, the kingdom is focusing on technologies such as carbon capture and hydrogen production as part of what it calls a "circular carbon economy".</p>

<p>But critics have labelled these efforts greenwashing, saying they aim to allow continued investment in fossil fuels.</p>

<p>In May 2024, the European Centre for Democracy and Human Rights (ECDHR) said the Saudi Green Initiative "conceals the country's ongoing reliance on fossil fuels and contempt for environmental justice behind lofty sustainability promises".</p>

<p>Riyadh justifies the policy as necessary for its energy security.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pat Gelsinger has stepped down as the CEO of Intel Corporation effective December 1, just under four years after taking the top job. Mr Gelsinger, 63, was reportedly given the option to voluntarily retire or be removed by the company's board. After careful consideration, he chose to retire.</p>

<p>In a post on LinkedIn, Mr Gelsinger wrote, “Leading Intel Corporation has been the honour of my lifetime. I am forever grateful for the many colleagues around the world who I have worked with as part of the Intel family and can look back with pride at all that we have accomplished together. Thank you all!”<br />
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="286" src="https://www.linkedin.com/embed/feed/update/urn:li:share:7269395411658792960" title="Embedded post" width="504"></iframe><br />
Pat Gelsinger described his departure from Intel as “bittersweet”, acknowledging the company had been central to his career for much of his life. “This company has been my life for the bulk of my working career,” Mr Gelsinger said in a <a href="https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1719/intel-announces-retirement-of-ceo-pat-gelsinger " rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">company statement</a>. “I can look back with pride at all that we have accomplished together.”<br />
<br />
He talked about the tough yet essential decisions made to position Intel for the evolving market and expressed deep gratitude for his “colleagues around the world”, recognising their collective efforts as part of the Intel family.<br />
<br />
Intel's board of directors named two senior leaders, David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus, as interim co-CEOs, while a search for a permanent replacement is underway. Mr Zinsner, Intel's executive vice president and CFO, and Holthaus, appointed CEO of Intel Products, will lead the company through this transitional period. Frank Yeary, Intel's independent board chair, will step in as interim executive chair.<br />
<br />
Mr Yeary praised Mr Gelsinger for his dedication to Intel. “Pat helped launch and revitalise process manufacturing by investing in state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing while working tirelessly to drive innovation throughout the company,” Mr Yeary said.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Pat Gelsinger's legacy at Intel spans several decades. He started his career at the company in 1979 and became Intel's first Chief Technology Officer before eventually returning to the company as CEO in 2021 during a critical time.<br />
<br />
He was forced out after the board lost confidence in his strategy to revitalise the company, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-02/intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger-retires-amid-chipmaker-s-turnaround-plan " rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a> reported. The clash reached its peak when Mr Gelsinger met with the board to discuss Intel's progress in regaining market share and competing with Nvidia. He was given the choice to retire or be removed.<br />
<br />
His resignation comes as the company navigates a rapidly changing semiconductor market. Throughout his tenure, he was known for his focus on innovation and his ability to rally the company around urgent strategic priorities. His leadership was seen as crucial to Intel's ongoing efforts to regain its competitive edge in the global chipmaking industry.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[By analyzing data from various Mars missions, the team has identified a subsurface zone, between 4.3 and 8.8 kilometres deep, where conditions could support microbial activity.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Could Mars, once a warm and wet world, still harbour life? A team of scientists led by Andrea Butturini believes so. Their research suggests that the ancient Martian plain of Acidalia Planitia may be a potential haven for microbial life, particularly methanogens, lurking deep beneath the surface, according to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2458263-life-on-mars-could-be-surviving-in-an-area-deep-underground/" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>New Scientist</em></a>.</p>

<p>By analyzing data from various Mars missions, the team has identified a subsurface zone, between 4.3 and 8.8 kilometres deep, where conditions could support microbial activity. This subsurface environment, shielded from harsh surface conditions, may retain remnants of ancient water and geothermal heat, crucial elements for life. While the idea of Martian microbes may seem far-fetched, this discovery sparks hope for the possibility of extraterrestrial life and opens new avenues for future exploration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Taking data from the multitude of orbiters and rovers that have visited Mars, the researchers found that Acidalia Planitia - a 3000-kilometre-wide plain in the northern hemisphere of Mars - seems to have the right conditions for methanogens, methane-producing bacteria, an estimated 4.3 to 8.8 kilometres beneath the surface.</p>

<p>"[It is] a promising target area for future missions in the search for extant life in Mars' subsurface," the researchers write.</p>

<p>To uncover evidence of life on Mars, researchers would need to drill miles beneath its surface- an endeavour requiring advanced crewed missions and technologies that are still years away from feasibility.</p>

<p>This study, however, marks a significant step forward in the search for extraterrestrial life. By pinpointing a location beneath the Martian surface where microbial life might exist, it sets the stage for future investigations that could resolve the long-standing debate over the presence of methane in Mars' atmosphere.</p>

<p>The researchers suggest that methanogens-methane-producing bacteria could thrive under Mars' Acidalia Planitia region. These extremophiles are known to endure harsh environments on Earth, such as high temperatures, radiation, and ultra-salty conditions. They are anaerobic, requiring neither oxygen nor sunlight, and can survive on minimal nutrients. On Earth, methanogens are found in swamps, marshes, decaying organic matter, and even the guts of herbivores.</p>

<p>While the European Space Agency's Rosalind Franklin rover, set to launch in 2028, will include a drill capable of penetrating seven feet into the Martian surface, this depth is insufficient to reach the potentially habitable zone identified by the researchers. The surface of Mars is far too cold and low-pressure for even extremophiles to survive, but below the surface, conditions improve.</p>

<p>The radioactive decay of elements like thorium generates heat and chemical energy, and water remnants from ancient oceans are buried underground. Together, these factors could create a habitable environment for bacteria, likely at depths of up to five miles.</p>

<p>Biogeochemist Butturini of the University of Barcelona and his team used Mars orbiter data to locate regions with high thorium concentrations that could sustain microbial life. They matched this with subsurface ice maps created by missions like China's Zhurong rover. Their analysis identified the southern Acidalia Planitia as the most promising target, a mid-latitude region with signs of groundwater activity and clay and carbonate deposits.</p>

<p>At this depth, temperatures are more favourable, ranging between 32 to 50 Degrees F, potentially allowing for liquid water mixed with Martian soil-an essential ingredient for bacterial life.</p>

<p>Although the findings, currently available on the preprint server arXiv, have yet to undergo peer review, they are drawing attention for providing a specific site to focus the search for Martian life.</p>

<p>"The subsurface of the southern Acidalia Planitia is a putative target region for hosting cold-adapted Methanosarcinaceae-like and/or Methanomicrobiaceae-like methanogens," the study notes. It highlights the region's abundance of radiogenic heat-producing elements and the likelihood of subsurface water.</p>

<p>If proven correct, this research could not only confirm the existence of alien life on Mars but also provide indirect evidence that methane in Mars' atmosphere may have a biological origin.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ISKCON Kolkata spokesperson Radharamn Das on Tuesday said he has urged its monks and followers from Bangladesh to avoid wearing saffron robes and 'tilak' in public, advising them to practice their faith discreetly amid safety concerns following targeted attacks against Hindu minorities in the neighbouring country.</p>

<p>This suggestion comes in the wake of escalating violence against the Hindu community in Bangladesh after the fall of the Sheikh Hasina government earlier this year, which has heightened anxieties among devotees and their families.</p>

<p>"The situation in Bangladesh is alarming. The monks and devotees, who have been calling us, we have told them to hide their identity as ISKCON followers or monks publicly. We have asked them to practice their faith discreetly inside homes or inside the temples. We have advised them to dress in a manner that does not draw attention," Radharamn Das, who is also ISKCON Kolkata vice-president, told PTI.</p>

<p>He emphasised that the measure was temporary and aimed solely at ensuring their safety.</p>

<p>"This is not any advisory or generic guideline but my personal suggestion to monks and devotees who have been calling us frantically over the last few days," he said.</p>

<p>"Many of our devotees and their families are facing threats and intimidation," Radharamn Das added, referring to incidents of vandalism of temples and attacks on religious gatherings.</p>

<p>Chinmay Krishna, who served as a spokesperson for Bangladesh Sammilita Sanatani Jagran Jote, was arrested at Dhaka's Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on Monday while en route to Chattogram to attend a rally.</p>

<p>He was denied bail and sent to jail on Tuesday by a court in the neighbouring country.</p>

<p>Historically, Hindus made up approximately 22 per cent of Bangladesh's population during the 1971 Liberation War.</p>

<p>The Hindu population, once a substantial demographic in Bangladesh, has experienced a significant decline in recent decades, with the minority community now comprising only around 8 per cent of the country's total population.</p>

<p>This drop is largely attributed to a combination of socio-political marginalisation, exodus and sporadic violence over the years.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Sombrero galaxy, or Messier 104 or M104, is roughly 30 million light-years from the Earth in the Virgo constellation.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new picture of the Sombrero galaxy, captured by the James Webb Space Telescope, revealed a perspective that appears different from the broad-brimmed Mexican hat after which it was named. The image, taken through the space observatory's Mid-Infrared Instrument, or MIRI, features the Sombrero galaxy's smooth inner disk instead of the glowing core, which usually shines in visible light, as seen in images taken through the Hubble Space Telescope, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/02/science/sombrero-galaxy-image-nasa-webb/index.html" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">CNN</a> reported.<br />
<br />
Webb Space Telescope's view makes the galaxy's “crown” invisible, changing its appearance to resemble a bull's-eye. In the background of the image, several distant galaxies can be seen.<br />
<br />
The Sombrero galaxy, also known as Messier 104 or M104, is situated about 30 million light-years from the Earth in the Virgo constellation. It was discovered in 1781 by French astronomer Pierre Méchain.<br />
<br />
The latest image highlights intricate details in Sombrero's outer ring, revealing how dust, a fundamental building block of astronomical objects, is distributed throughout the galaxy.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Earlier, observations from the retired Spitzer Space Telescope of NASA showed this outer ring as smooth and uniform. Webb's advanced imaging, on the contrary, shows a clumpy, textured structure for the first time.<br />
<br />
The researchers have also spotted carbon-containing molecules, like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, in the dust ring. This suggests its outer ring could be home to star-forming regions. However, it must be noted that this galaxy is quiet in terms of star formation compared to others, like Messier 82.<br />
<br />
Sombrero galaxy's rings produce less than one solar mass of stars in a year compared to the Milky Way's roughly two solar masses, <a href="https://scitechdaily.com/nasas-webb-telescope-captures-the-sombrero-galaxy-in-breathtaking-detail/" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">SciTechDaily</a> reported.<br />
<br />
The supermassive black hole at its centre is less active than the ones present in other galaxies. Still, the Sombrero galaxy is full of 2,000 globular clusters or groups of hundreds of thousands of old stars gravitationally held together.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistani politician Azma Bukhari is haunted by a counterfeit image of herself -- a sexualised deepfake video published to discredit her role as one of the nation's few female leaders.</p>

<p>"I was shattered when it came into my knowledge," said 48-year-old Bukhari, the information minister of Pakistan's most populous province of Punjab.</p>

<p>Deepfakes -- which manipulate genuine audio, photos or video of people into false likenesses -- are becoming increasingly convincing and easier to make as artificial intelligence (AI) enters the mainstream.</p>

<p>In Pakistan, where media literacy is poor, they are being weaponised to smear women in the public sphere with sexual innuendo deeply damaging to their reputations in a country with conservative mores.</p>

<p>Bukhari -- who regularly appears on TV -- recalls going quiet for days after she saw the video of her face superimposed on the sexualised body of an Indian actor in a clip quickly spreading on social media.</p>

<p>"It was very difficult, I was depressed," she told AFP in her home in the eastern city of Lahore.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"My daughter, she hugged me and said: 'Mama, you have to fight it out'."</p>

<p>After initially recoiling she is pressing her case at Lahore's High Court, attempting to hold those who spread the deepfake to account.</p>

<p>"When I go to the court, I have to remind people again and again that I have a fake video," she said.</p>

<h3><strong>'A very harmful weapon'</strong></h3>

<p>In Pakistan -- a country of 240 million people -- internet use has risen at staggering rates recently owing to cheap 4G mobile internet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Around 110 million Pakistanis were online this January, 24 million more than at the beginning of 2023, according to monitoring site DataReportal.</p>

<p>In this year's election, deepfakes were at the centre of digital debate.</p>

<p>Ex-prime minister Imran Khan was jailed but his team used an AI tool to generate speeches in his voice shared on social media, allowing him to campaign from behind bars.</p>

<p>Men in politics are typically criticised over corruption, their ideology and status. But deepfakes have a dark side uniquely suited to tearing down women.</p>

<p>"When they are accused, it almost always revolves around their sex lives, their personal lives, whether they're good mums, whether they're good wives," said US-based AI expert Henry Ajder.</p>

<p>"For that deepfakes are a very harmful weapon," he told AFP.</p>

<p>In patriarchal Pakistan the stakes are high.</p>

<p>Women's status is typically tied to their "honour", generally defined as modesty and chastity. Hundreds are killed every year -- often by their own families -- for supposedly besmirching it.</p>

<p>Bukhari describes the video targeting her as "pornographic".</p>

<p>But in a country where premarital sex and cohabitation are punishable offences, deepfakes can undermine reputations by planting innuendo with the suggestion of a hug or improper social mingling with men.</p>

<p>In October, AFP debunked a deepfake video of regional lawmaker Meena Majeed showing her hugging the male chief minister of Balochistan province.</p>

<p>A social media caption said: "Shamelessness has no limits. This is an insult to Baloch culture."</p>

<p>Bukhari says photos of her with her husband and son have also been manipulated to imply she appeared in public with boyfriends outside her marriage.</p>

<p>And doctored videos regularly circulate of Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif -- Bukhari's boss -- showing her dancing with opposition leaders.</p>

<p>Once targeted by deepfakes like these, women's "image is seen as immoral, and the honour of the entire family is lost", said Sadaf Khan of Pakistani non-profit Media Matters for Democracy.</p>

<p>"This can put them in danger," she told AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Fighting the fakes</strong></h3>

<p>Deepfakes are now prevalent across the world, but Pakistan does have legislation to combat their deployment in disinformation campaigns.</p>

<p>In 2016, a law was passed by Bukhari's party "to prevent online crimes" with "cyberstalking" provisions against sharing photos or videos without consent "in a manner that harms a person".</p>

<p>Bukhari believes it needs to be strengthened and backed up by investigators. "The capacity building of our cybercrime unit is very, very important," she said.</p>

<p>But digital rights activists have also criticised the government for wielding such broad legislation to quash dissent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Authorities have previously blocked YouTube and TikTok, and a ban on X -- formerly Twitter -- has been in place since after February elections when allegations of vote tampering spread on the site.</p>

<p>Pakistan-based digital rights activist Nighat Dad said blocking the sites serves only as "a quick solution for the government".</p>

<p>"It's violating other fundamental rights, which are connected to your freedom of expression, and access to information," she told AFP.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Seven protesters detained after Bangladesh mission breach in Tripura, 3 cops suspended]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Tripura government today suspended three police officers, withdrew a senior officer from his post and detained seven people after the security breach at the Bangladesh diplomatic mission in Agartala stepped up the tension between New Delhi and Dhaka.</p>

<p>About 50 people, who participated in a massive protest against the arrest of Hindu monk Chinmoy Krishna Das in Agartala yesterday, entered the premises of the Bangladesh Assistant High Commission. This drew a sharp response from the interim government in the neighbouring country. Dhaka alleged that local police were "not found to be active in containing the situation". It said the incident had left the mission staff with a "deep sense of insecurity" and called upon New Delhi to take "immediate action".</p>

<p>The Ministry of External Affairs responded that the incident in "deeply regrettable". "Diplomatic and consular properties should not be targeted under any circumstances. Government is taking action to step up security arrangements for the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi and their Deputy/Assistant High Commissions in the country," a statement said.</p>

<p>A top Tripura police officer has said the BJP government in the border state has ordered an inquiry into Monday's incident. Three sub-inspectors -- Dilu Jamatia, Debabrata Sinha, and Joynal Hossain -- have been suspended and Assistant Commandant Kanti Nath Ghosh has been withdrawn from his posting. The officer said the action against the four officers was taken on the grounds of negligence.</p>

<p>The number of cops at the Bangladesh mission in Agartala has been stepped up after yesterday's incident. Tripura Chief Minister Dr Manik Saha has slammed the incident and said while peaceful protests are allowed, such acts are absolutely unacceptable.</p>

<p>Relations between India and Bangladesh, which had started deteriorating after the Sheikh Hasina government toppled and she fled to India, have nosedived over the past couple of weeks amid reports of attacks on Hindu minorities in the neighbouring country. Following the detention of Hindu priest Chinmoy Krishna Das, several organisations have taken out protests in solidarity with the minorities in Bangladesh. The External Affairs Minister has urged the interim government in Bangladesh to protect minorities and the latter has stressed that it won't allow any communal activity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The staff had kept the pies overnight in the refrigerated van but found the vehicle vanished in the morning.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A British Michelin-starred chef is pleading to the thieves after they ran away with his van that contained 2,500 pies, worth Rs 26 lakh (£25,000), destined for the York Christmas Market. Tommy Banks, a veteran judge on the <em>BBC </em>show, Great British Menu who also owns two restaurants and a pub in North Yorkshire, took to Instagram on Monday (Dec 2) to inform that his van that contained steak and ale, turkey and butternut squash pies, as well as gravy and custard, had been stolen from Barker Business Park in Melmerby on Sunday night.</p>

<p>Mr Banks' staff had kept the pies overnight in the refrigerated van and were planning to make the delivery the next morning when they found that the vehicle had vanished.</p>

<p>"So @matthewalockwood went into @madeinoldstead this morning to pick up the van and it has been stolen. These guys had loaded up the van with stock for @tommyspieshop today and left plugged in overnight. I'm guessing the thieves didn't realise they were stealing 2,500 pies along with the van!" said Mr Banks.</p>

<p>The inventory stolen would have been enough to stock Tommy's Pie Shop for a week, Mr Banks told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gpl8r2e48o" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>BBC</em></a>. He urged the thieves to do the 'right thing' and return the pies, even if they wanted to not give up on the van.</p>

<p>"I know you're a criminal, but maybe just do something nice because it's Christmas and maybe we can feed a few thousand people with these pies that you've stolen, do the right thing," he said, adding: "The pies are all in boxes with my name on so not very easy to sell."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the North Yorkshire Police said it had been informed of the theft and started the probe. It requested anyone with any information to get in touch.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Syrians lived in terror for decades of what went on behind the concrete walls of Damascus's security compound. Now the Assad dynasty has been toppled, its dungeons and torture chambers are giving up their secrets.</p>

<p>Rebel fighters stand guard at the entrances to the forbidden city in the capital's Kafr Sousa district, where the feared security services had their headquarters alongside government offices.</p>

<p>The myriad of different agencies which kept tabs on the lives of ordinary Syrians each operated their own underground prisons and interrogation chambers inside the walled defence ministry compound.</p>

<p>Syrians lived in fear of being summoned for a round of questioning from which they might never return.</p>

<p>AFP found first responder Sleiman Kahwaji wandering around the complex this week trying to locate the building where he was questioned and then detained.</p>

<p>He said he was still at secondary school when he was arrested in 2014 on suspicion of "terrorism", a frequent allegation under the rule of now toppled president Bashar al-Assad, who brooked no dissent.</p>

<p><strong>'My dear mother'</strong></p>

<p>"I spent 55 days underground," he said. "There were 55 of us in that dungeon. Two died, one from diabetes."</p>

<p>Scribbled graffiti left by the prisoners are barely legible on the walls amid the darkness.</p>

<p>"My dear mother," one had scribbled, probably in his own blood.</p>

<p>The cells that were used for solitary confinement are so small there isn't even space to lie down.</p>

<p>As many as 80 prisoners per cell were crammed into the larger ones, forcing inmates to take turns to sleep, recalls another former detainee Thaer Mustafa, who was arrested for alleged desertion.</p>

<p>All remaining prisoners were freed on Sunday after their captors fled as the rebels swept into Damascus capping the lightning offensive they launched late last month.</p>

<p>A large crowd broke into the security zone and ransacked the sprawling offices on the upper floors of the complex.</p>

<p>Thousands of intelligence files lay abandoned, many of them scattered on the floor, detailing the activities of ordinary citizens subjected to draconian surveillance by security service agents.</p>

<p>One handwritten document lists more than 10,000 prisoners held on suspicion of membership of the Muslim Brotherhood.</p>

<p>The Sunni Islamist group was anathema to the Assad clan who are members of Syria's Alawite minority, followers of an offshoot of Shiite Islam.</p>

<p>Brotherhood membership became punishable by death since 1980 two years before Assad's father and predecessor Hafez ordered the army to crush its insurgency with an assault on the central city of Hama which killed between 10,000 and 40,000 people.</p>

<p>Alongside each prisoner's name and date of birth, the security services noted the details of their detention and interrogation, and whether and when they had died.</p>

<p>Another abandoned file details the detention of a Briton of Syrian origin, who was subjected to a lie detector test over allegations he was working for British intelligence.</p>

<p><strong>Paid informers&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Another, dated this January, details the investigation into a bomb attack on the Mazzeh neighbourhood of Damascus, in which an Iraqi was wounded.</p>

<p>Nothing was considered too trivial to escape the security services' attention. There are files recording the activities of ordinary citizens as well as journalists and religious leaders.</p>

<p>Not even government ministers were immune. On a list of members of Assad's government, a security service agent has carefully noted the confession of each minister -- Sunni or Alawite, Christian or Druze.</p>

<p>The security services operated vast networks of paid informers, who provided the tiniest details of people's daily lives.</p>

<p>Families have been arriving at the gates of the Damascus security zone since Saturday, desperately seeking word on the fate of their missing loved ones.</p>

<p>Many come after first visiting Saydnaya Prison, a vast detention complex on the outskirts of Damascus where many of those who survived interrogation at security headquarters were taken for long-term incarceration.</p>

<p>"We heard that there were secret dungeons. I'm looking for my son Obada Amini, who was arrested in 2013," said Khouloud Amini, 53, her husband and daughter by her side.</p>

<p>"He was in his fourth year at the engineering faculty, I went to Saydnaya but I didn't find him.</p>

<p>"I was told there were underground dungeons here. I hope that all Syrian prisoners are freed."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[According to the college, the essay had language that "could be interpreted as a call for more violent or destructive forms of protests at MIT". The MIT Dean of Student Life, David Warren Randall emailed this to the magazine's editors.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A pro-Palestine essay has cost Prahlad Iyengar his career at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).</p>

<p>He was pursuing a PhD from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, but his five-year National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship will be terminated now.</p>

<p>MIT has barred the Indian-origin student from entering the college premises over the essay, written in the college magazine last month, that the institute found calling for violence.</p>

<p>Written Revolution is a multidisciplinary student magazine, about the pro-Palestine movement, that published Iyengar's essay. It has also been banned.</p>

<p>The essay that Iyengar wrote is called 'On Pacifism'. As stated by The Commune Magazine, although not directly calling for violent resistance, the essay speaks that pacifist tactics might not be the best recourse for Palestine.</p>

<p>The essay features a logo of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a terrorist organisation according to the US State Department. However, Iyengar said that the charges of terrorism on him are only because of the photos in the essay which were not provided by him.</p>

<p>"The administration accuses me of supporting 'terrorism', because the edition in which my article appears includes images of posters from the Popular Front for the Liberation and of containing violent imagery in the publication," his statement said, which was shared by his lawyer Eric Lee on X.</p>

<p>According to the college, the essay had language that "could be interpreted as a call for more violent or destructive forms of protests at MIT". The MIT Dean of Student Life, David Warren Randall emailed this to the magazine's editors.</p>

<p>Iyengar has raised an issue of the lack of freedom of speech in American campuses. But this is not the first time he has been suspended.</p>

<p>He was suspended last year after the pro-Palestine demonstrations.</p>

<p>An "extraordinary action" is what he believes his suspension is.</p>

<p>"These extraordinary actions should concern everyone on camp," he says in the statement. "Expelling me and banning Written Revolution from campus as a result of this article would mark an unprecedented attack on the rights of the entire student body and faculty. Consider the precedent MIT has set."</p>

<p>The MIT Coalition Against Apartheid has started a protest against MIT's decision. "Prahlad is now appealing his case with the Chancellor to reduce the unjust sanctions against him. We have launched a campaign to put pressure on MIT's administration to stop criminalising students who stand on the right side of history. We call on all organisations and institutions of conscience to sign up and stand up to MIT's repression," said the coalition in a statement.</p>

I just really wanted to make games," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After graduating, the 26-year-old worked as a software engineer for the online car sales company TrueCar, according to his LinkedIn page. His most recent address was in Hawaii, NYPD officials said.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The deaths of a Thai singer and a Singaporean tourist following visits to massage parlours in Thailand have sparked warnings from the country's doctors about the potentially fatal risk such treatments can pose.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The deaths of a Thai singer and a Singaporean tourist following visits to massage parlours in Thailand have sparked warnings from the country's doctors about the potentially fatal risk such treatments can pose. According to <em>The Independent,</em> 20-year-old Thai singer Chayada Prao-hom died in hospital in northeastern Udon Thani city on Sunday. Her health reportedly deteriorated following three massage sessions since October. Similarly, a 52-year-old Singaporean tourist also died after receiving a 45-minute oil massage at a parlour in Phuket.</p>

<p>Ms Chayada had taken the massages to relieve shoulder pain, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/asia/southeast-asia/thailand-phuket-massage-parlour-deaths-warning-b2661195.html" rel="noindex,nofollow">outlet </a>reported. In the days and weeks before her death, she posted details about the three massage sessions that she said left her bedridden, with numbness spreading through her body. She reported her condition deteriorating further with each session.</p>

<p>In November, she said she had gone to a parlour for three sessions of "a neck twist" and another massage with a "heavy hand". She found herself in a paralytic state a fortnight later, unable to lift her right arm. "I want my story to be a lesson for those who like being massaged a lot. I must recover. I want to work already," Ms Chayada wrote.</p>

<p>The hospital said that the singer died from a blood infection and brain swelling. An investigation had been launched to determine whether her death was linked to the treatments or any underlying causes. The authorities confirmed that the parlour and all the masseuses were working with proper licences.</p>

<p>In a similar incident, Singaporean tourist Lee Mun Tuk died soon after receiving an oil massage at a parlour on Patong Beach, Phuket. Police said that the tourist had fallen asleep during the procedure and started showing symptoms of distress after some time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is not clear if massages were the reason for the deaths. However, the incidents have sparked warnings from experts against some techniques used by masseuses.</p>

<p>"An experienced masseuse would not twist the client's neck because it's known as a dangerous point," said Dr Chatpon Kongfeangfung, per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/health-environment/article/3289987/20-year-old-thai-singers-death-sparks-warnings-about-neck-twisting-massage-risks" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>South China Morning Post</em></a>. "I've warned people before, do not ever let the masseuse twist your neck because it can be fatal," the doctor added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Professor Dr Thiravat Hemachudha, advisor to the College of Oriental Medicine at Rangsit University also warned that twisting the neck or massaging the cervical spine could lead to paralysis. If done the wrong way, he said, they could "increase the risk of harm to the blood vessel walls that supply the brain, especially the back, tearing and causing brain tissue death, hemiplegia, paralysis".</p>

<p>"The danger will increase in tandem with the force of the twisting, flicking or circling one's head. Repeating these activities for a long time will not only create problems for the nerves but also the blood vessels at the neck," Dr Thiravat said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Disease X is a term coined by WHO to describe a hypothetical, unknown pathogen with epidemic or pandemic potential.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A mysterious and deadly illness, dubbed "Disease X," has been reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with over 400 cases recorded by the World Health Organization (WHO). The disease has claimed the lives of over 30 people, mostly children, since October, the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/09/world-news/mystery-deadly-disease-x-spreads-in-congo-as-who-struggles-to-trace-origin/">New York Post </a></em>reported.&nbsp;More than half of those who died were children younger than 5 years old who were severely malnourished, the health agency said.&nbsp;However, local officials estimate the death toll to be significantly higher, at 143 deaths.</p>

<p>Notably,&nbsp;Disease X is a term coined by WHO to describe a hypothetical, unknown pathogen with epidemic or pandemic potential. It represents any unidentified infectious disease that could spread rapidly and cause widespread harm.&nbsp;Common symptoms of Disease X, include fever, cough, fatigue, and a runny nose. Headache is also a prevalent symptom. In severe cases, symptoms escalate to difficulty breathing, anaemia, and signs of acute malnutrition.</p>

<p>Based on the symptoms, acute pneumonia, influenza, COVID-19, measles and malaria are being considered as possible causes.</p>

<p>The WHO has deployed a rapid response team to investigate the outbreak, but their efforts are being hindered by the remote location of the outbreak's centre in the Kwango province. Poor road conditions and heavy rain have made it difficult for the team to access the area, with officials estimating it will take at least two days to reach the location.</p>

<p>Further complicating the investigation is the fact that many of the severe cases of "Disease X" are also characterized by severe malnutrition, making it challenging to pinpoint the exact source of the illness.</p>

<p>"These challenges, coupled with limited diagnostics in the region, have delayed the identification of the underlying cause," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON546">the WHO said.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>"Teams are collecting samples for laboratory testing, providing a more detailed clinical characterization of the detected cases, investigating the transmission dynamics, and actively searching for additional cases, both within health facilities and at the community level," the organization said.</p>

<p>"Given the clinical presentation and symptoms reported, and several associated deaths, acute pneumonia, influenza, COVID-19, measles and malaria are being considered as potential causal factors with malnutrition as a contributing factor. Malaria is a common disease in this area, and it may be causing or contributing to the cases," the WHO said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention has warned that Disease X may be airborne. However, the exact nature of the disease and its transmission methods remain unclear.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Syrian rebels now in power in Damascus appointed Mohammad al-Bashir as head of a transitional government that will be in place until March 1, state media said Tuesday.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the rebels led by Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) seized the capital Damascus in a lightning offensive, toppling president Bashar al-Assad who fled the country.</p>

<p>"The general command has tasked us with running the transitional government until March 1," said a statement attributed to Bashir on state television's Telegram account, referring to him as "the new Syrian prime minister".</p>

<p>Before being tapped for the role, he had been head of the rebels' so-called Salvation Government in northwest Syria and previously held the role of its development minister.</p>

<p>Also Tuesday, a source within the political affairs department of the Salvation Government told AFP Bashir would head the transitional government.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Jordanian man has returned to his home country after spending 38 years in Syrian jails, an official said on Tuesday, after the fall of president Bashar al-Assad ended an agonising wait for his family.</p>

<p>The man, named as Osama Bashir Hassan al-Bataynah, was found in Syria "unconscious and suffering from memory loss", Jordanian Foreign Ministry Soufian al-Kodat told AFP.</p>

<p>Kodat said the man's relatives reported his disappearance in 1986, when he was just 18, and that he had been in jail ever since.</p>

<p>"He was transferred from Damascus to the Jaber border crossing (with Jordan) where he was handed over to border guards," added Kodat, saying the man had been reunited with his family on Tuesday morning.</p>

<p>The rebels who swept Assad from power on Sunday also opened the prisons and released thousands of detainees.</p>

<p>Civil society groups had long accused Assad of presiding over a brutal regime of arbitrary arrests, torture and murder in prisons.</p>

<p>Many foreigners were being held, including Suheil Hamawi from Lebanon who returned to his country on Monday after being locked up for 33 years.</p>

<p>The Arab Organization for Human Rights in Jordan said Tuesday there were still 236 Jordanians detained in Syria.</p>

<p>Amnesty International has documented thousands of killings at Saydnaya prison, whose name has become synonymous with the worst atrocities of Assad's rule, and dubbed it a "human slaughterhouse".</p>

<p>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights estimated in 2022 that more than 100,000 people had died in the jails since the start of an uprising in 2011 that led to the civil war.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Rajnath Singh and his top delegation of defence personnel continue their Russia visit, there are talks of a mega defence agreement between Moscow and New Delhi being in advanced stages. The deal - reportedly worth $4 billion will give a massive boost to India's air defence infrastructure.</p>

<p>The equipment being discussed by both sides is the advanced 'Voronezh' series radar which is manufactured by Russia's Almaz-Antey Corporation, which is a specialist organisation for manufacturing anti-aircraft missile systems and radars.</p>

<p>The Voronezh radar is a very-long-range early warning radar system with a range well over 8,000 kilometers. It is capable of identifying and tracking threats like ballistic missiles, fighter jets, and ICBMs. Should India acquire it, the advanced radar system will be able to detect any air threat from anywhere in China, South and Central Asia, and most of the Indian Ocean region.</p>

<p>The Voronezh radar can detect more than 500 objects simultaneously. While its overall range can go up to 10,000 kilometers, it's vertical range exceeds 8,000 km and horizon range is over 6,000 km. Moscow claims that the Voronezh radar system can even track stealth aircraft. Due to its massive vertical range, it can provide complete data about ICBMs and situational awareness of near-Earth objects in space.</p>

<p>According to a report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.rt.com/india/609068-india-russia-long-range-radars/" rel="No follow, no index" target="_blank">Russia Today</a>, talks between Moscow and New Delhi have been on for a while and last month, a team from Almaz-Antey even visited India to interact with possible offset partners who will be part of the project.</p>

<p>In another report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://sundayguardianlive.com/news/india-may-acquire-advanced-russian-radar-system" rel="No follow, no index" target="_blank">The Sunday Guardian</a>, there is a push under the 'Make in India' initiative for at least 60 per cent of the radar system to be manufactured locally, for which offset partners are being sought in India.</p>

<p>Should the deal be finalised, the advanced radar system will likely be set up in Karnataka's Chitradurga district, and the designated location for it has also reportedly been surveyed. Chitradurga is already home to some of India's most advanced and top secret defence and aerospace facilities.</p>

<p>The radar system, once acquired, will significantly improve India's threat-detection and surveillance capabilities in Asia and the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). It will also enhance India's air defence infrastructure to fulfil its needs amid ever-growing regional and global challenges.</p>

<p>On day 2 of his visit today, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and his Russian counterpart Andrey Belousov will co-chair a top-level meeting on military-technical cooperation between New Delhi and Moscow. India and Russia share a special, privileged, and strategic defence partnership.</p>

<p>Mr Singh will also take stock of the deliveries of the two remaining S-400 Triumph missile systems that New Delhi is yet to receive. India had signed a deal in 2018 for Russia to supply its advanced S-400 missile systems.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Doctors and healthcare professionals across the world have signed a petition calling for the immediate suspension of all COVID-19 mRNA products due to concerns that the vaccines may be contributing to an alarming rise in excess deaths.</p>

<p>"A growing body of evidence suggests that the widespread rollout of the novel Covid-19 mRNA vaccine products is contributing to an alarming rise in disability and excess deaths," reads the Hope Accord petition.</p>

<p>The petition, known as the HOPE Accord, has attracted signatures from several healthcare professionals and highlights the need for a comprehensive re-evaluation of the vaccines.</p>

<p>The vaccines use "gene-based technology" and were given emergency medical authorisation to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>"This new technology was granted emergency use authorisation to address a situation that no longer exists. Going forward, the burden of proof falls on those still advocating for these products to compellingly demonstrate that they aren't resulting in net harm. Until such evidence is presented, regulators should suspend their use as a matter of standard medical precaution," the petition mentions.</p>

<p>It demands full transparency from government bodies and the pharmaceutical industry, including access to previously undisclosed anonymised patient-level data from clinical trials and surveillance programs.</p>

<p>It also highlights the need to mitigate publication bias, where unfavourable results are often rejected or withheld due to fears of reputational damage.</p>

<p>Dr. Aseem Malhotra, a British Indian Consultant Cardiologist, has written an open letter to the General Medical Council (GMC) of the UK, stating that the vaccines cause greater harm than benefit.</p>

<p>"Serious harms from the vaccine have been confirmed from a combination of clinical, mechanistic, randomised controlled trials, observational, pharmacovigilance, and autopsy data. In these studies, the majority of deaths that occurred within two weeks of taking the vaccine died as a result of the mRNA product," he writes.</p>

<p>According to the petition, calls for independent investigations should be properly resourced to allow a comprehensive re-evaluation of all COVID-19 vaccine products.</p>

<p>"There must be a full exploration of mechanisms of harm to provide insight into their impact on the human body, both short and long term", the petition states.</p>

<p>It also urges for a comprehensive review of the actual clinical impact on illness and mortality, rather than relying on synthetic results based on modeled assumptions.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 23-year-old man in the United States has been arrested for allegedly murdering his father and attempting to kill his mother in Bartow, Florida. According to <em>The Independent,</em> Joseph Voigt on Monday admitted to shooting his mother, 58-year-old Susan Voigt, and killing his father, 63-year-old Marvin Voigt, over the weekend. Authorities said they arrived at the scene after Ms Susan called the cops and said she and her husband had been shot by their son who took off.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After reaching the scene, police found Marvin Voigt dead in the driveway from apparent gunshot wounds. Susan Voigt, inside the family's home, had sustained a "serious gunshot wound" but was given "life-saving measures" by a fire and emergency medical service team and is now in "critical condition, but stable" in an area hospital, police said, per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/crime/jospeh-voigt-florida-shooting-charges-b2661648.html" rel="noindex,nofollow">outlet</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 23-year-old fled the scene after the shooting and was later arrested in Orlando, officials said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the authorities, Joseph Voigt said that he shot his parents because his father was upset with him about "spending the majority of his time playing video games" and "riding his ass about making something himself and getting a job".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Everything we've heard about this couple was that they were really good people," Stephen Walker of the Bartow Police Department said. "It's sad, you know, to see something like this happen," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Thanks to the rapid response of the Bartow Police Department this violent and dangerous suspect was quickly apprehended," Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said in a statement. "My detectives will continue their thorough investigation into this crime to ensure Voigt will face the full consequences of his actions," the sheriff continued.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Joseph Voigt appeared in court in Orange County on Monday morning. He will be brought back to jail in Polk County, where he'll face murder and attempted murder charges.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.fox13news.com/news/bartow-man-kills-father-injures-mom-because-dad-wanted-him-stop-playing-video-games-get-job-pcso" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>Fox News</em></a>, his criminal history includes arrest for firing a weapon in a residential area and battery. He was released from jail on December 1.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"A wife has lost her husband and basically lost a son also, at the end of the day," Mr Walker said. "So, it's going to be a real tough, tough road for her. I feel really bad for her... We are deeply saddened by this tragic and senseless shooting," he added.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Award-winning US poet Nikki Giovanni, who was at the forefront of the Black Arts Movement, died aged 81 after a long battle with cancer, local media reported Tuesday.</p>

<p>Widely regarded as one of the most prolific African-American poets, Giovanni received numerous awards and a Grammy nomination for her work on civil rights, gender and race issues.</p>

<p>Giovanni, whose most famous poems included 'Knoxville, Tennessee' and 'Nikki-Rosa', died following her third cancer diagnosis, the media reported.</p>

<p>She "died peacefully on December 9, 2024, with her life-long partner, Virginia (Ginney) Fowler, by her side," her friend and fellow writer Renee Watson said in a statement to CNN.</p>

<p>"We will forever be grateful for the unconditional time she gave to us, to all her literary children across the writerly world," poet Kwame Alexander told US media.</p>

<p>The Black Arts Movement, which flourished between 1965 and 1974, saw a wave of Black culture and literature championed by writers including Maya Angelou, James Baldwin and Audre Lorde.</p>

<p>In her writing, Giovanni reflected on her childhood growing up in Tennessee and Ohio, pushed for Black and civil rights, and described her long struggle with lung cancer.</p>

<p>"As one of the cultural icons of the Black Arts and Civil Rights Movements, she became friends with Rosa Parks, Aretha Franklin, James Baldwin, Nina Simone, and Muhammad Ali, and inspired generations of students, artists, activists, musicians, scholars and human beings, young and old," Watson said in her statement.</p>

<p>Giovanni went on to teach creative writing and literature at Virginia Tech and received numerous awards including the NAACP Image Award, the Rosa Parks Award and the Langston Hughes Award for Distinguished Contributions to Arts and Letters.</p>

<p>In 2004, she received a Grammy Best Spoken Word Album nomination for 'The Nikki Giovanni Poetry Collection'.</p>

<p>In a brief biography on her website, Giovanni wrote: "I wanted to be a writer who dreams or maybe a dreamer who writes but I knew one book does not a writer make."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A former BBC journalist has been jailed for eight years for a string of child abuse offences, including paying money to watch live streams of children being sexually exploited in the Philippines. According to the BBC, 52-year-old Duncan Bartlett was sentenced at Wood Green Crown Court in London after pleading guilty to 35 offences in August. The police said Bartlett, who worked as a BBC journalist for 14 years until 2015, was first arrested in September 2021, after they received intelligence which linked him to accessing indecent images of children.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Metropolitan Police seized Bartlett's electronic devices which uncovered 6,000 indecent images, per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cje9xjywjdwo" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>BBC</em></a>. They also found evidence he made payments to people in the Philippines who would arrange live films of children being sexually exploited for Bartlett to watch. The cops said that some of the victims have been identified and put under safeguarding measures in the Philippines.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bartlett was the BBC's correspondent in Tokyo and presented "World Business Report" on the BBC World Service.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/bbc-journalist-duncan-bartlett-jailed-b2661577.html" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>The Independent</em></a>, the 52-year-old pleaded guilty to 11 counts of causing a girl under 13 to engage in sexual activity, nine counts of causing a girl 13-15 to engage in sexual activity, 10 counts of paying for the sexual services of a girl under 13, three charges of making indecent images of children, and two offences of encouraging the commission of either way offences.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Over a period of seven years, Bartlett made multiple payments to people in the Philippines asking that they arrange children to be sexually exploited for his own gratification. With close liaison work with our counterparts in the Philippines, we managed to identify and safeguard some of these children while several adults were arrested," said Detective Constable Emily Dawson.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Bartlett's behaviour was utterly abhorrent but thanks to the painstaking work of detectives, a case documenting his offending was put together - this left him with no option but to admit his guilt," she added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <em>BBC </em>reported that Bartlett continued working as a researcher and expert in China at London's SOAS University until after his guilty plea. He apparently did not tell his employer about his offending and the university did not discover the details of the case until yesterday, December 9. A spokeswoman for SOAS confirmed Bartlett was a research associate and contractor at the London University's China Institute between 1 January 2021 and 30 September 2024.</p>

<p>"Although not a permanent member of staff or in a student-facing role, he was paid as a contractor to produce a series of podcasts about China, producing his last edition in September 2024. Neither SOAS nor the SOAS China Institute were aware of any legal proceedings before we were contacted by the media about this case today," the spokesperson said.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The protoplanetary disk, designated as 114-426, is situated in the Orion Nebula, a vast star-forming region approximately 1,300 light-years away from Earth.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a groundbreaking finding, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has discovered frozen water in a distant protoplanetary disk, located outside our Solar System. This remarkable detection was made possible by the JWST's advanced Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam), which captured high-resolution images of the disk. The protoplanetary disk, designated as 114-426, is situated in the Orion Nebula, a vast star-forming region approximately 1,300 light-years away from Earth. The disk, which spans over 1,000 times the Earth-Sun distance, is thought to be a nursery for planet formation.</p>

<p>The JWST's <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2412.04356v1">NIRCam images </a>revealed the presence of frozen water in the form of ice grains, which coat the disk's dust particles. This detection was made at a wavelength of 3 micrometres, a range that is uniquely accessible to the JWST.</p>

<p>The protoplanetary disk's central band blocks the star's light, creating an eerie silhouette against the nebula's radiant backdrop. However, the disk's material scatters light, forming vibrant lobes that illuminate the surrounding space.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>The presence of water ice in such environments is a promising indicator of the potential for planet formation. Water is a critical ingredient for life as we know it, and its availability during the early stages of planetary formation suggests that habitable conditions might arise elsewhere in the universe.</p>

<p>The Edge-On Orion Silhouette Disk is particularly intriguing due to its unique edge-on orientation, which offers an unobstructed view of the disk's composition and structure. JWST's observations revealed not only the presence of water ice but also other volatile compounds, such as carbon dioxide and methane, which are essential for building organic molecules.</p>

<p>The discovery of frozen water in this distant protoplanetary disk has significant implications for our understanding of planet formation and the origins of water in our Solar System.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards said on Tuesday that the Islamic Republic had not been weakened following the fall of its ally Bashar al-Assad in Syria, Iranian media reported.</p>

<p>"We have not been weakened and Iran's power has not diminished," Hossein Salami was quoted as telling members of parliament in a closed session.</p>

<p>Iran and Russia had propped up Assad's rule since Syria's civil war erupted in 2011 with military support, men and airpower. Tehran deployed its Revolutionary Guards to Syria to keep its ally in power to maintain Tehran's "Axis of Resistance" to Israel and U.S. influence in the Middle East.</p>

<p>Assad's exit has eroded Tehran's ability to project power and sustain its network of militia groups across the region, particularly to its ally Hezbollah in Lebanon, which agreed a ceasefire with Israel last month.</p>

<p>"The overthrow of the Zionist regime (Israel) is not off the agenda," Salami said in the session which met to discuss the latest developments in Syria.</p>

<p>Salami said no Iranian forces remained in Syria.</p>

<p>Following Assad's fall from power, Iran's foreign ministry called for a national dialogue to form an inclusive government representing all segments of Syrian society. Iran's government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani on Tuesday called for "respect for Syria's territorial integrity", saying the Syrian people should decide their own fate.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[By 2030, this pollution could lead to 1,300 premature deaths annually in the US and public health costs of nearly $20 billion.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the exponential rise of AI in many professional sectors, there has been a boom in gadgets powered by AI. This revolution in technology will definitely make life easier with much advancement; however, there is a new environmental footprint as well. There are significant concerns related to increased air pollution through the emissions of power plants and diesel backup generators, which are a requirement for maintaining steady electricity supplies for the increasing network of data centres and computer processing centers. These facilities are critical for AI operations and contribute increasingly to the level of air pollution; hence, sustainable solutions to innovation need to be developed to maintain environmental responsibility.</p>

<p>As per a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2024/12/09/ais-deadly-air-pollution-toll"><em>release by the University of California</em></a>, this air pollution is expected to result in as many as 1,300 premature deaths a year by 2030 in the United States. Total public health costs from cancers, asthma, other diseases, and missed work and school days are approaching an estimated $20 billion a year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Such are the findings of a study by UC Riverside and Caltech scientists published online this week. Yet, these human and financial costs appear overlooked by the tech industry.</p>

<p>"If you look at those sustainability reports by tech companies, they only focus on carbon emissions, and some of them include water as well, but there's absolutely no mention of unhealthful air pollutants, and these pollutants are already creating a public health burden," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2024/12/09/ais-deadly-air-pollution-toll">said Shaolei Ren</a>, a UCR associate professor of electrical and computer engineering and a corresponding author of the study.</p>

<p>The authors, including Caltech professor and computer scientist Adam Wierman, recommend that standards and methods be adopted that require tech companies to report the air pollution caused by their power consumption and backup generators.</p>

<p>They further recommend that communities hit hardest by air pollution from data processing centre electricity production be properly compensated by the tech companies for the health burden.</p>

<p>The authors also found that air pollution stemming from AI disproportionately affects certain low-income communities, partly because of their proximity to power plants or backup generators at the data processing centers. Additionally, the pollution drifts across county and state lines, creating health impacts on communities far and wide, Ren said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The data centres pay local property taxes to the county where they operate," Ren said. "But this health impact is not just limited to a small community. Actually, it travels across the whole country, so those other places are not compensated at all."&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has shared an old video in which he predicted that the internet would “revolutionise traditional media”. Mr Musk's 1998 prophecy&nbsp;has come true; the internet has indeed transformed the way we consume media today.</p>

<p>In the reposted video from 26 years ago, the Tesla CEO responded to an interviewer's question about the future of the internet. “I think the internet is the superset of all media,” Mr Musk said. “It is the fuel and end all of the media. One will see print, broadcast, arguably, radio... essentially all media falling into the internet.”</p>

<p>He explained the internet's unique ability to facilitate interactive “two-way communication medium that is intelligent.” “It allows consumers to choose what they want to see, when they want to see it, whether that be radio, whether that be print, whether that be television, broadcast,” he added.</p>

<p>“I think it's going to revolutionise all traditional media,” he concluded.</p>

<p>He now revealed that many once thought his vision was “crazy,” for pointing out “this super obvious prediction.”</p>

<p>Elon Musk aims to provide high-speed internet globally through his <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/starlink-in-india-soon-elon-musk-takes-on-mukesh-ambanis-reliance-jio-7003416 ">SpaceX Starlink project</a>, which uses a network of satellites in low-Earth orbit. The service is designed to serve remote and underserved regions, offering unlimited data, no contracts, and low-latency connections. Starlink is user-friendly, with customers receiving a dish and modem that can be self-installed. Starlink is also reportedly seeking to enter the Indian market to provide satellite internet, challenging major players like Jio and Airtel.</p>

<p>Earlier, the SpaceX CEO predicted that artificial intelligence (AI) will eventually eliminate all jobs, but he doesn't view this as a negative development. Speaking remotely at the Viva Tech event in Paris, Mr Musk said, “Probably none of us will have a job,” in a future where work becomes “optional.”<br />
<br />
He explained that people could choose to work if they wanted to, describing jobs as something one could do “like a hobby.” He believes AI and robots will provide all the goods and services people need. Mr Musk also mentioned the need for a “universal high income” to make this vision a reality, though he clarified that this is different from universal basic income (UBI), a concept where the government provides money to everyone, regardless of their earnings.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Alphabet, engaged with his Tesla counterpart Elon Musk after the announcement of Google's latest quantum computing advancement, Willow. The conversation, which unfolded on X (formerly Twitter), quickly went viral, capturing the attention of tech enthusiasts and industry professionals.</p>

<p>On X, Mr Pichai introduced Willow, calling it a “state-of-the-art quantum computing chip with a breakthrough that can reduce errors exponentially.” He added, “In benchmark tests, Willow solved a standard computation in &lt;5 mins that would take a leading supercomputer over 10^25 years, far beyond the age of the universe(!).”</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Musk replied, “That will probably happen,” before steering the conversation into a broader discussion on cosmic philosophy, referencing the Kardashev scale, a method of measuring a civilisation's technological advancement based on energy consumption. He added, “Any self-respecting civilization should at least reach Kardashev Type II. In my opinion, we are currently only at &lt;5% of Type I. To get to ~30%, we would need to place solar panels in all desert or highly arid regions.”<br />
<br />
To this, the Google CEO said, “Indeed. We should scale solar so much more, amazing that we keep looking at alternatives when the most obvious path is staring at our eyes, literally!”</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>YouTuber Jimmy Donaldson, better known as MrBeast, has spent $14 million to construct a city for his upcoming game show, <em>Beast Games.</em> The highly-anticipated series will premiere on Prime Video on December 19 and promises a spectacle of massive proportions. The custom-built city, reportedly located in Toronto, has been designed to accommodate 1,000 contestants who will compete for a $5 million grand prize.</p>

<p>MrBeast, known for his extravagant stunts and giveaways, revealed on X that the city serves as both a living space and a competition venue. He shared his excitement writing, “We spent $14,000,000 building a city in a field for the contestants in <em>Beast Games.”</em></p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>In the pictures shared on MrBeast's X, we see the custom-built city for <em>Beast Games. </em>One image shows a sprawling locality with a garden, complete with umbrellas, lawn chairs, and tables set for four.</p>

<p>Another photo features the contestants' living quarters, centred around a glass box containing $5 million in cash placed on the lawn in front of a high-tech house. The house itself stands out with sleek architecture, illuminated lights, and a glowing signboard reading “<em>Beast Games.”</em></p>

<p>The compound is surrounded by water, giving it an island-like appeal. A long driveway lined with palm trees leads to the main building, while smaller cottages encircle the central structure. A dedicated cycle path adds to the city's modern charm. This self-contained setting sets the stage for what MrBeast promises to be “the most insane competition show you've ever seen.”</p>

<p>The production has already set over 40 Guinness World Records, including the largest cash prize and the most contestants in a game show. The show's trailer teases a range of jaw-dropping challenges, featuring monster trucks, Navy SEALs, daring stunts, and even a massive pirate ship as part of the set.</p>

<p>MrBeast previously described the project as “the largest game show in history,” with a teaser released on November 25. His team has also said to have donated items like mattresses, sleeping bags, and clothing used during the show to local organisations.</p>

<p>However, <em>Beast Games </em>has faced criticism and legal troubles. Reports surfaced alleging unsafe conditions during filming, including crew members being hospitalised due to falling set pieces and contestants experiencing "inhumane" working conditions, as per the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/style/mrbeast-reality-show-lawsuit.html " rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">NYT</a>.</p>

<p>Some participants claimed they were deprived of sufficient food, medication, and hygiene supplies, with delays spanning hours or even days. Several contestants also reported injuries sustained during the challenges, requiring medical attention. At least five contestants are planning to file a class-action lawsuit against MrBeast.</p>

<p>The YouTuber has dismissed some claims as “disinformation.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just over a year ago, China gave Bashar al-Assad and his wife a warm welcome during their six-day visit to the country, offering the former Syrian leader a rare break from years of international isolation since the start of a civil war in 2011.</p>

<p>As the couple attended the Asian Games, President Xi Jinping vowed to support Assad in "opposing external interference" and in Syria's rebuilding, while his wife Asma was feted in Chinese media.</p>

<p>But the abrupt end to the rule of the authoritarian leader so explicitly backed by Xi only last year has dealt a blow to China's diplomatic ambitions in the Middle East and exposed the limits of its strategy in the region, analysts say.</p>

<p>A coalition of rebels seized Syria's capital Damascus on Sunday after a lightning offensive that toppled&nbsp;Assad's&nbsp;regime and ended his family's 50-year dynasty.</p>

<p>"There's been a lot of an exaggerated sense of China's ability to shape political outcomes in the region," said Jonathan Fulton, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.</p>

<p>While the collapse of the Assad regime was seen reducing the influence in the Arab world of his main backers, Iran and Russia, it was also a blow for China's global ambitions, said Fulton.</p>

<p>"A lot of what (China has) been doing internationally has relied on support with those countries, and their inability to prop up their biggest partner in the Middle East says quite a lot about their ability to do much beyond the region."</p>

<h3><strong>TACKLING HOTSPOTS</strong></h3>

<p>After China brokered a deal between long-time rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran in 2023, Chinese media praised Beijing's rising profile in a neighbourhood long dominated by Washington.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wang Yi, China's top diplomat, said the country would play a constructive role in handling global "hotspot issues".</p>

<p>China also brokered a truce between Fatah, Hamas and other rival Palestinian factions earlier this year and has made repeated calls for a ceasefire in Gaza.</p>

<p>But despite bringing Middle Eastern leaders to Beijing and rounds of "shuttle diplomacy" by its Middle Eastern envoy, Zhai Jun, in the months since, Palestinians have not formed a unity government and the conflict in Gaza continues.</p>

<p>"Assad's&nbsp;sudden downfall is not a scenario Beijing wishes to see," said Fan Hongda, a Middle East scholar at Shanghai International Studies University. "China prefers a more stable and independent Middle East, as chaos or a pro-American orientation in the region does not align with China's interests."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The response by China's foreign ministry to&nbsp;Assad's&nbsp;fall has been muted, focusing on the safety of Chinese nationals and calling for a "political solution" to restore stability in Syria as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Ministry of foreign affairs spokesperson, Mao Ning, on Monday appeared to leave an opening for engagement with the future government: "China's friendly relations with Syria are for all Syrian people," she said.</p>

<p>Chinese experts and diplomats say Beijing will now bide its time before recognising a new government in Damascus.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It could use its expertise and financial muscle to support reconstruction, they say, but its commitments are likely to be limited because China has sought to minimise financial risks overseas in recent years.</p>

<p>Syria joined China's flagship Belt and Road Initiative in 2022, but there have been no significant investments by Chinese firms since, partly due to sanctions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>China is "not really able to fundamentally replace the West either as an economic partner, or diplomatic or military force in the region," said Bill Figueroa, assistant professor at the University of Groningen and an expert in China-Middle East relations.</p>

<p>"China in 2024 has way less money than China in 2013 - 2014, when the BRI was launched," Figueroa said. There is "an obvious reassessment going on in the direction of safer investments and reducing China's risks overall," he added.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After six decades of research, scientists have discovered the gene responsible for the orange fur seen in domestic cats. Two separate research teams found that the characteristic ginger, calico, and tortoiseshell colours in cats are due to a missing piece of DNA in a part of the cat's genome that doesn't make proteins. This breakthrough explains why some cats have their distinctive fiery fur.</p>

<p>"The sex-linked orange mutation in domestic cats causes variegated patches of reddish/yellow hair and is a defining signature of random X-inactivation in female tortoiseshell and calico cats. Unlike the situation for most coat colour genes, there is no apparent homolog for sex-linked orange in other mammals," the authors of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.21.624608v1"><em>the study</em></a> wrote.</p>

<p>"We show that the sex-linked orange is caused by a 5 kb deletion that leads to ectopic and melanocyte-specific expression of the Rho GTPase Activating Protein 36 (Arhgap36) gene. Single-cell RNA-seq studies from foetal cat skin reveal that red/yellow hair colour is caused by reduced expression of melanogenic genes that are normally activated by the melanocortin 1 receptor (Mc1r)-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-protein kinase A (PKA) pathway, but the Mc1r gene and its ability to stimulate cAMP accumulation are intact."</p>

<p>"Instead, we show that increased expression of Arhgap36 in melanocytes leads to reduced levels of the PKA catalytic subunit (PKAC); thus, sex-linked orange is genetically and biochemically downstream of Mc1r. Our findings solve a comparative genomic conundrum, provide in vivo evidence for the ability of Arhgap36 to inhibit PKA, and reveal a molecular explanation for a charismatic colour pattern with a rich genetic history."</p>

<p>"I am fully convinced this is the gene and am happy," Carolyn Brown, a University of British Columbia geneticist who was not involved in either study, told Science. "It's a question I've always wanted the answer to."</p>

<p>As per a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.science.org/content/article/gene-behind-orange-fur-cats-found-last"><em>release, </em></a>scientists have long been fascinated by tortoiseshell and calico cats: the offspring of a black cat and an orange cat. Multicoloured cats from such a cross are almost always female, suggesting the gene variant that makes fur orange or black is located on the X chromosome. The male offspring of such a cross are typically unicolor because they inherit just one parent's X chromosome: We can guess, for instance, that Garfield's mother is orange because he inherited his only X chromosome from her.</p>]]></content:encoded>

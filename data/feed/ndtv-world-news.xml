       <description><![CDATA[On December 7, Earth will align between the Sun and Jupiter, creating a rare astronomical event known as Jupiters opposition.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There will be a major astronomical event on December 7th when Earth will align itself between the Sun and Jupiter. Because of alignment, known as Jupiter's opposition-the gas giant will be visible all night long, providing skywatchers with a rare chance to see the biggest planet in our solar system.</p>

<p>On December 6, Jupiter will be at a distance of 611 million kilometres, or 380 million miles, from Earth at approximately 5 am IST. This proximity guarantees the planet will shine brightest, thus making it the best viewing opportunity for telescope enthusiasts to examine its atmospheric belts and Galilean moons.</p>

<p><strong>How to Spot Jupiter</strong></p>

<p>On the night of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/skywatching/whats-up-december-2024-skywatching-tips-from-nasa/"><em>December 7, </em></a>look east-northeast near the constellation Taurus as Jupiter rises at sunset and sets at sunrise. With a telescope, you can marvel at its intricate cloud bands and spot its four largest moons-Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.</p>

<p>This celestial alignment, where sunlight reflected from Jupiter takes approximately 34 minutes to reach Earth, promises a dazzling experience for stargazers across India. Be it an astronomy enthusiast or a curious observer, this event reminds us of the wonders of our solar system.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/11/08/whats-that-really-bright-star-in-the-sky-after-dark/"><em>Forbes, </em></a>Earth's faster orbit will momentarily put it between the sun and Jupiter. Consequently, we'll be able to see 100% of the disc of Jupiter, which will also be as close as it can ever be to Earth, at 380 million miles (612 million kilometres).</p>

<p>Since we're now just a few days away from Jupiter being in opposition, the planet is now becoming extremely bright. Although opposition is a specific date, a month on either side is the best time to look at the planet using even a small telescope or a pair of binoculars.</p>

<p><strong>What is 'full' Jupiter?</strong></p>

<p>Opposition means a full Jupiter because its sun-facing side is fully illuminated by the sun. Looking away from the sun into the outer solar system at night, we on Earth see Jupiter's sun-facing side. It's much like a full moon; 50% of the moon is always lit by the sun. Only our perspective of it changes, according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2024/11/08/whats-that-really-bright-star-in-the-sky-after-dark/"><em>Forbes.&nbsp;</em></a></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol was still clinging to power Thursday, with his party announcing they will oppose an opposition impeachment motion put forward after his stunning but brief imposition of martial law.</p>

<p>Yoon suspended civilian rule late Tuesday and deployed troops and helicopters to parliament only for lawmakers to vote down the measure and force him into a U-turn in a night of protests and drama.</p>

<p>Seoul's allies were alarmed -- Washington said it found out via television -- and on Wednesday, the opposition filed an impeachment motion saying Yoon "gravely violated the constitution and the law".</p>

<p>The opposition aims to bring the bill to a vote Saturday, Yonhap reported.</p>

<p>They hold a large majority in the 300-member legislature and need only a handful of defections from Yoon's People Power Party (PPP) to secure the two-thirds majority needed to pass.</p>

<p>But on Thursday, the PPP leader said that while he had asked Yoon to leave the party, he would block the impeachment motion.</p>

<p>Han Dong-hoon told reporters his party was "not trying to defend the president's unconstitutional martial law".</p>

<p>"All 108 lawmakers of the People Power Party will stay united to reject the president's impeachment," the party's floor leader Choo Kyung-ho said.</p>

<p>If the motion passes, Yoon will be suspended pending a verdict by the Constitutional Court. If the judges give the nod, Yoon will be impeached and new elections must happen within 60 days.</p>

<p><strong>Bad memories</strong></p>

<p>Yoon, who has lurched from crisis to crisis since taking office in 2022, has not been seen in public since his televised address in the early hours of Wednesday.</p>

<p>On Thursday, his office said that <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/south-korean-defence-minister-resigns-amid-row-over-martial-law-7174994">Defence Minister Kim Yong-hyun had resigned</a>, but other key allies including Interior Minister Lee Sang-min remain in office.</p>

<p><strong>READ </strong>|&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/south-koreas-yoon-names-new-defence-minister-after-botched-martial-law-7174858">Who Is South Korea's New Defence Minister After Botched Martial Law?</a></p>

<p>Yoon's martial law declaration was the first in more than four decades in South Korea and brought back painful memories of the country's turbulent past.</p>

<p>The move was to "safeguard a liberal South Korea from the threats posed by North Korea's communist forces and to eliminate anti-state elements plundering people's freedom and happiness," Yoon said.</p>

<p>A six-point decree from the army chief banned political activities and parties, "false propaganda", strikes and "gatherings that incite social unrest".</p>

<p>Security forces sealed the National Assembly, helicopters landed on the roof and almost 300 soldiers tried to lock down the building, seemingly to prevent lawmakers from entering.</p>

<p>But as parliamentary staffers blocked the soldiers with sofas and fire extinguishers, enough MPs -- some leaping over barriers -- got inside and voted down Yoon's move.</p>

<p>This brought cheers from the hundreds of protesters braving bitter temperatures outside, many waving national flags and chanting for Yoon to be arrested.</p>

<p><strong>'Unforgivable'</strong></p>

<p>Lawmakers formally presented the impeachment motion in the early hours of Thursday, saying Yoon's decision to impose martial law was intended to "evade imminent investigations... into alleged illegal acts involving himself and his family".</p>

<p>"This is an unforgivable crime -- one that cannot, should not, and will not be pardoned," MP Kim Seung-won said.</p>

<p>The main opposition Democratic Party has also filed a complaint of "insurrection" against the president, ministers and top military and police officials -- which can carry a penalty of life imprisonment or even death.</p>

<p>In a show of public anger, thousands of protesters converged around Yoon's office in Seoul late Wednesday after staging a rally in Gwanghwamun Square, demanding his resignation.</p>

<p><strong>'Robust and resilient'</strong></p>

<p>The United States has around 30,000 troops stationed in North Korea to help protect its ally against the nuclear-armed North.</p>

<p>US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Wednesday that Yoon's imposition of martial law "raised deep concern for us" while praising the National Assembly for operating "according to constitutional processes and procedures" to rescind it.</p>

<p>"South Korea's democracy is robust and resilient, and we're going to continue to speak out publicly and engage privately with South Korean counterparts to reinforce the importance of that continuing," Sullivan said.</p>

<p>China, a key ally of nuclear-armed North Korea, urged its citizens to exercise caution, while Russia -- increasingly close to Pyongyang -- called the situation "alarming".</p>

<p>Japan, whose historically prickly relations with Seoul have thawed under Yoon, said it was following the situation with "exceptional and serious concerns".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The British indie band Sports Team was robbed at gunpoint on Tuesday during the US leg of their tour near San Francisco, the group revealed on Instagram. In a statement, the six-member band said their tour van was ransacked while they stopped for breakfast at a Starbucks in Vallejo, California, around 8:45 a.m. local time. A thief stole stage equipment, laptops, passports, personal items, and other valuables. A passerby reportedly alerted the band to the break-in, and when members attempted to intervene, the suspect pulled out a gun.</p>

<p>"Somebody opened the door and was like: Does anybody have a white Sprinter van? Because you're being robbed right now," drummer Al Greenwood told the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy09gkr08lpo" rel="noindex,nofollow">BBC</a></em>.</p>

<p>"I really thought I was about to watch someone get shot because it took a while for our tour manager to realize," she added.</p>

<p>Footage captured from inside the Starbucks shows the suspect brandishing a firearm at the group's tour manager as she approached the van. The suspect is seen removing items from the vehicle while band members and bystanders sought cover inside.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Obviously, if someone pulls a gun, you run for cover," singer Alex Rice told the BBC. "But the thing that struck me about it was the resignation. The people around us weren't very panicked at all. It seemed like a very everyday occurrence."</p>

<p>The group told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://news.sky.com/story/havent-played-a-note-yet-uk-band-sports-team-robbed-at-gunpoint-on-day-one-of-us-tour-13266532" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>Sky News </em></a>that items including cameras, laptops, in-ear monitors and other personal items were taken. Thankfully, the instruments were safe because, as they explained, "the back of the van is fortified." However, frontman Alex Rice said three band members had their passports stolen.</p>

<p>The band contacted police, but claim officers declined to respond in person, instructing them to file an online report instead.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite the incident, Sports Team, known for achieving two top 10 albums in the UK, plans to continue their tour. They played in Sacramento on Tuesday evening and are scheduled to return to the area for another show on Saturday. Prior to this, their east coast performances had gone without incident.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday will seek ways out of France's political crisis, after Michel Barnier became the first prime minister to be ousted by parliament in over six decades.</p>

<p>Lawmakers voted on Wednesday to oust Barnier's government after just three months in office, approving a no-confidence motion proposed by the hard left but which crucially was backed by the far right headed by Marine Le Pen.</p>

<p>Barnier's record-quick ejection comes after snap parliamentary elections this summer, which resulted in a hung parliament with no party having an overall majority and the far right holding the key to the government's survival.</p>

<p>Macron now has the unenviable task of picking a viable successor with over two years of his presidential term left, with some -- though not all -- opponents calling on him to resign.</p>

<p>Barnier is due to present Macron his government's resignation on Thursday morning.</p>

<p>The president will then address the nation at 1900 GMT, the Elysee said.</p>

<p>The no-confidence motion, brought by the hard left in the National Assembly, came amid a standoff over next year's austerity budget, after the prime minister on Monday forced through a social security financing bill without a vote.</p>

<p>With the support of the far right, a majority of 331 MPs in the 577-member chamber voted to oust the government.</p>

<p>It was the first successful no-confidence vote since a defeat for Georges Pompidou's government in 1962, when Charles de Gaulle was president.</p>

<p><strong>'Calling on Macron to go'</strong></p>

<p>Macron flew back into Paris just ahead of the vote after wrapping up a three-day state visit to Saudi Arabia, an apparent world away from the domestic crisis.</p>

<p>He strolled earlier Wednesday through the desert sands of the Al-Ula oasis, marvelling at ancient landmarks. After landing in Paris, he headed directly to the Elysee Palace.</p>

<p>"We are now calling on Macron to go," Mathilde Panot, head of the parliamentary faction of the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) party, told reporters, urging "early presidential elections" to solve the deepening political crisis.</p>

<p>But taking care not to crow over the government's fall, Le Pen said in a television interview that her party -- once a new premier is appointed -- "would let them work" and help create a "budget that is acceptable for everyone".</p>

<p>Laurent Wauquiez, the head of right-wing deputies in parliament, said the far right and hard left bore the responsibility for a no-confidence vote that will "plunge the country into instability".</p>

<p>Candidates for the post of premier are few, but loyalist Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu and Macron's centrist ally Francois Bayrou are possible contenders.</p>

<p>On the left, Macron could turn to former Socialist premier and interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve, a contender in September.</p>

<p>Barnier was the fifth prime minister to serve under Macron since he came to power in 2017, with every premier serving a successively shorter period.</p>

<p>Given the turbulence, the new nominee now risks serving an even shorter term than Barnier, whose tenure was the shortest of any administration since the Fifth Republic began in 1958.</p>

<p>Macron is minded to appoint the new premier rapidly, several sources told AFP.</p>

<p>A source close to Macron said the president, who has taken time with appointments in the past, has "no choice" but to name the new premier within 24 hours.</p>

<p><strong>'His failure'</strong></p>

<p>Macron has rejected calls to resign.</p>

<p>With markets nervous and France bracing for public-sector strikes against the threat of cutbacks, action that will shut schools and hit air and rail traffic, there is a growing sense of crisis.</p>

<p>The unions have called for civil servants, including teachers and air-traffic controllers, to strike on Thursday over separate cost-cutting measures.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Macron is due to host a major international event Saturday, with the reopening of the Notre-Dame cathedral after the 2019 fire, with guests including Donald Trump on his first foreign trip since he was elected to be the next US president.</p>

<p>"His failure," was left-wing daily Liberation's front-page headline, with a picture of Macron, whose term runs until 2027.</p>

<p>In an editorial, Le Monde said Le Pen's move risked upsetting her own supporters, such as retirees and business leaders, by toppling the government.</p>

<p>"In the space of a few minutes, she shattered the strategy of normalisation she had consistently pursued," the daily said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Harry Potter sword replicas sold at a theme park in Japan have been recalled for being too authentic, potentially violating the anti-weapons law, Warner Bros. Studios Japan and media have said.</p>

<p>Subject to the recall is an "authentic recreation" of the Godric Gryffindor Sword -- named after one of the four founders of the Hogwarts wizardry school.</p>

<p>The pointed, silver sword is 34 inches (85 centimetres) long and comes affixed to a wood display plaque, according to a company statement that said there had been a "distribution issue" with the 30,000 yen ($200) replicas.</p>

<p>But Japanese media reported that investigators considered the toy sharp-edged enough to constitute a possible violation of the country's sword and firearms control laws.</p>

<p>The replicas were being sold at "The Making of Harry Potter", an immersive Tokyo studio park steeped in the world of the epic magic saga.</p>

<p>"We apologise for the inconvenience," Warner Bros. Studios Japan said in its statement.</p>

<p>Violent crime is rare in Japan, which has strict gun control laws.</p>

<p>But there are occasional stabbings and even shootings, including the assassination of former prime minister Shinzo Abe in 2022.</p>

<p>Harry Potter fans who had to relinquish the sword took to social media to air their heartache.</p>

<p>The farewell was "frustrating" and "very sad", one fan wrote on social media platform X, adding: "My fellow true Gryffindor students out there who agreed to the voluntary recall, I feel you."</p>

<p>"I just handed over to police the Gryffindor sword which I once vowed to myself I will cherish for the rest of my life", another wrote on X.</p>

<p>"I believe they will take good care of it until it is disposed of".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin rose above $100,000 for the first time on Thursday as the election of Republican Donald Trump as president of the United States spurred expectations that his administration will create a friendly regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>Bitcoin has more than doubled in value this year and is up about 45% in the four weeks since Trump's sweeping election victory, which also saw a slew of pro-crypto lawmakers being elected to Congress.</p>

<p>"We're witnessing a paradigm shift. After four years of political purgatory, bitcoin and the entire digital asset ecosystem are on the brink of entering the financial mainstream," said Mike Novogratz, founder and CEO of U.S. crypto firm Galaxy Digital.</p>

<p>"This momentum is fueled by institutional adoption, advancements in tokenization and payments, and a clearer regulatory path."</p>

<p>More than 16 years after its creation, bitcoin appears on the cusp of mainstream acceptance, despite naysayers and a history of controversies.</p>

<p>"Bitcoin crossing $100,000 is more than just a milestone; it's a testament to shifting tides in finance, technology, and geopolitics," said Justin D'Anethan, a Hong Kong-based independent crypto analyst.</p>

<p>"The figure not that long ago dismissed as fantasy, stands as a reality."</p>

<p>Trump embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States the "crypto capital of the planet" and to accumulate a national stockpile of bitcoin.</p>

<p>Crypto investors see an end to increased scrutiny under U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, who said last week he would step down in January when Trump takes office.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Trump said he would nominate Paul Atkins to run the Securities and Exchange Commission. Atkins, a former SEC commissioner, has been involved in crypto policy as co-chair of the Token Alliance, which works to "develop best practices for digital asset issuances and trading platforms," and the Chamber of Digital Commerce.</p>

<p>A slew of crypto companies including Ripple, Kraken and Circle are jostling for a seat on Trump's promised crypto advisory council, seeking a say in his planned overhaul of U.S. policy, according to several digital asset industry executives.</p>

<p>Trump's businesses may also have a stake in the sector. He unveiled a new crypto business, World Liberty Financial, in September. Although details about the business have been scarce, investors have taken his personal interest in the sector as a bullish signal.</p>

<p>Trump's social media company is in advanced talks to buy crypto trading firm Bakkt, the Financial Times reported last week, citing two people with knowledge of the talks.</p>

<p>Trump Media and Technology Group, which operates Truth Social, is close to an all-stock acquisition of Bakkt, according to the FT report.</p>

<p>Billionaire Elon Musk, a major Trump ally, is also a proponent of cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>Bitcoin's rebound from a slide below $16,000 in late 2022 has been rapid, boosted by the approval of U.S.-listed bitcoin exchange-traded funds in January this year.</p>

<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission had long attempted to block ETFs from investing in bitcoin, citing investor protection concerns, but the products have allowed more investors, including institutional investors, to gain exposure to bitcoin.</p>

<p>More than $4 billion has streamed into U.S.-listed bitcoin exchange-traded funds since the election.</p>

<p>"We were trading basically sideways for about seven months, then immediately after November 5, U.S. investors resumed buying hand-over-fist," said Joe McCann, CEO and founder of Asymmetric, a Miami digital assets hedge fund.</p>

<p>There was a strong debut for options on BlackRock's ETF in November with call options - bets on the price going up - substantially more popular than puts. McCann calculated the put to call ratio at about 22 to one.</p>

<p>Crypto-related stocks have soared along with the bitcoin price, with shares in bitcoin miner MARA Holdings up around 65% in November.</p>

<p>Yet the rise is not without critics.</p>

<p>Two years ago, the industry was wracked by scandal with the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange and the jailing of its founder Sam Bankman-Fried.</p>

<p>The cryptocurrency industry also has been criticized for its massive energy usage, while crypto crime remains a concern, too.</p>

<p>Market participants are keeping a close eye on what happens now that bitcoin has broken above $100,000, with investors and speculators possibly looking to pocket some of their recent gains.</p>

<p>"But once we flush out those sell orders, this could go higher still, and very rapidly," said Steven McClurg, founder of Canary Capital, a digital assets investment firm. He said he expects bitcoin's price to hit $120,000 by Christmas.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump has named Adam Boehler as his administration's lead hostage negotiator at a time when the United States is seeking to secure the release of prisoners trapped in Gaza and other parts around the world. A healthcare executive, Mr Boehle would be America's special presidential envoy for hostage affairs.</p>

<p>He will succeed Roger Carstens, who held the role since 2020 after Mr Trump appointed him as special presidential envoy for hostage affairs during his first term as President. He remained on the job for the duration of the Biden administration and is credited for bringing home several dozen Americans held hostage or wrongfully detained in countries including Russia. Some of the notable prisoner exchanges during his time in office include WNBA star Brittney Griner and Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich.</p>

<h2><strong>About Adam Boehler</strong></h2>

<p>Adam Boehler, founder and CEO of healthcare investment firm Rubicon Founders, served as the first CEO of the International Development Finance Corporation, a new federal agency created during Mr Trump's first administration ending in 2021.</p>

<p>Announcing his appointment, the incoming Presidnet said Mr Boehler was a lead negotiator for him on his team that worked on the Abraham Accords in 2020, a series of normalization and broader recognition agreements between Israel and Arab nations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"He has negotiated with some of the toughest people in the World, including the Taliban, but Adam knows that NO ONE is tougher than the United States of America, at least when President Trump is its Leader. Adam will work tirelessly to bring our Great American Citizens HOME," Mr Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.</p>

<p>In college, Mr Boehler reportedly shared a room with the president-elect's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, briefly, who was the lead negotiator on the Abraham Accords.</p>

<p>Mr Boehler's appointment came two days after the President-elect warned those holding hostages that there would be "all hell to pay" if the prisoners were not released by the time he took over office on January 20. Hamas continues to hold around 100 hostages, living and dead, in Gaza. The hostage includes seven Americans.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Boehler has been a vocal critic of the Biden administration for its approach to the hostage issue in Gaza. In a radio interview last week, he said that "the next step for Israel, and for the United States, is to make sure that we get the hostages back." He also called for the elimination of Iran's nuclear facilities as well.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/stmd/prizes-challenges-crowdsourcing-program/center-of-excellence-for-collaborative-innovation-coeci/south-pole-safety-designing-the-nasa-lunar-rescue-system/" rel="noindex,nofollow">NASA </a>invites innovators to develop a life-saving Lunar Rescue System to save astronauts stranded on the Moon. The space agency offers up to $20,000 for the most effective design to safely transport a fully suited astronaut across the Moon's rugged terrain. This initiative is part of NASA's Artemis missions, which face challenges like extreme temperatures, uneven surfaces, and bulky spacesuits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you have a groundbreaking idea, now's your chance to make an impact and win big. Submissions for the South Pole Safety Challenge: Lunar Rescue System are open until January 23, 2025, via the HeroX portal. With a total prize pool of $45,000, the best proposal will help address critical concerns as NASA gears up for the Artemis mission, scheduled for September 2026.</p>

<p>NASA is preparing for the possibility of an astronaut becoming incapacitated on the Moon due to injury, medical emergencies, or mission-related accidents. In such scenarios, crewmates will need a reliable method to transport them back to the lunar lander.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The unforgiving lunar environment poses unique challenges that demand innovative solutions," said Sarah Duglas from NASA, as reported by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/32083351/nasa-moon-south-pole-safety-challenge-lunar-rescue-system/" rel="noindex,nofollow"><em>The Sun</em></a>. Experts highlight that while the mission site was chosen partly for its water-ice reserves, the Moon's surface remains a significant hurdle. Covered with sharp rocks, deep craters, and steep slopes, it is difficult to navigate even under optimal conditions.</p>

<p>The competition calls for a design capable of moving a fully suited astronaut over two kilometres, up a 20-degree incline, without using a rover. While the Moon's lower gravity reduces the astronaut's weight, it's still too much for manual carrying, making a technological solution essential.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is your chance to help shape the future of lunar exploration and astronaut safety. "The solution must perform effectively in the Moon's extreme South Pole environment and operate independently of a lunar rover," NASA explained.</p>

<h3><strong>Here's how to apply</strong></h3>

<p>Interested candidates can apply or submit their applications via the HeroX portal, where the organisation usually posts its public challenge. Entries are open until January 25. NASA's experts and engineers will evaluate the submitted plan. Criteria such as the weight, ease, and impact on the astronaut's new Axiom Extravehicular Mobility Suit will be considered. Visit the official website for more information.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A pediatrician has raised alarms about "Granny's Purse Syndrome," a hidden danger during family holiday gatherings.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An emergency department doctor has warned parents about a lesser-known but potentially fatal risk to kids as families prepare for the holiday season. Known as "Granny's Purse Syndrome," this risk arises from the items in grandmothers' purses that may unintentionally endanger children.</p>

<p>During family get-togethers, the paediatrician emphasised the value of parental attention in a newly published<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.tiktok.com/notfound"> TikTok video.</a> She clarified that many grandparents carry common items in their purses, such as tiny objects, prescriptions, or even stray coins, which can provide serious choking or poisoning hazards to inquisitive young children.</p>

<p>With the holidays often involving frequent visits and larger family gatherings, she urged parents to be proactive in ensuring that such items are kept out of reach of children. The awareness comes at a crucial time, as emergency rooms often see a spike in accidental ingestions and related injuries during the festive season.</p>

<p>Parents are encouraged to educate grandparents about the risks and take simple precautions, like securing purses or placing them in inaccessible areas, to safeguard their children during the celebrations.</p>

<p>"If you are spending time with your family for the holidays, it's important to know about something called 'granny syndrome' or 'granny's purse syndrome,'" she said.</p>

<p>"This is when young kids get into their grandparents' medications that are not secured properly-for many reasons. One of them is that grandparents are not used to having kids around.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The wife of the slain CEO of the largest US health insurance company has said that he had received death threats as police scrambled to find the man who brazenly shot him in mid-Manhattan.</p>

<p>The Wednesday morning shooting in front of a Hilton hotel as the city teemed with tourists visiting for the lighting of the iconic Rockefeller Centre Christmas tree nearby in the evening triggered shockwaves.</p>

<p>Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch tried to reassure the visitors, saying the killing was "a premeditated, preplanned, targeted attack" and "does not appear to be a random act of violence".</p>

<p>"Millions of people will be enjoying the tree lighting tonight, among other holiday events, and the NYPD will be out there with them, keeping them safe," she added.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/united-healthcare-ceo-brian-thompson-shot-dead-in-new-york-gunman-at-large-7172850">Brian&nbsp;Thompson's</a> wife Paulette Thompson told NBC News that he had told her "there were some people that had been threatening him".</p>

<p>She said that she did not know the details but it could have been motivated by a "lack of coverage" in the company's insurance programmes.</p>

<p>Thompson led UnitedHealthcare (UHC), the largest US health insurance company with an annual revenue of $281 billion and more than 140,000 employees, many stationed in India for backoffice, technology and strategy jobs.</p>

<p>The company provides private health insurance mostly through employers as well as offering plans under the government programmes for senior citizens and the poor.</p>

<p>Police described the shooter as a light-skinned man clad in a light brown or cream-coloured jacket, wearing a black facemask and carrying a grey backpack.</p>

<p>Tisch said that "it appears the suspect was lying in wait for several minutes" and shot Thompson as he walked to the hotel for his company's investment conference.</p>

<p>He was hit in the leg and chest as the gunman began firing from behind. After the gun, a .9 mm weapon, jams, he is seen on security videos quickly clearing it and resuming firing.</p>

<p>Police Department Chief Joseph Kenny said, "It does appear he is proficient in the use of firearms, as he was able to clear the malfunction pretty quickly."</p>

<p>The shooter is seen on videos calmly crossing the avenue, hopping on a for-hire electric bike available around the city, and riding away.</p>

<p>He was later spotted at Central Park before the trail went cold.</p>

<p>Police are working on clues from the bike rental to try to locate him.</p>

<p>In the video, Thompson turns around after being shot towards the shooter before falling to the ground.</p>

<p>Ambulance workers, who arrived within minutes with police, tried to resuscitate him before driving him to a nearby hospital where he was declared dead.</p>

<p>Thompson, 50, became the CEO of UHC after working his way up during his 20-year career with the company.</p>

<p>"Our hearts go out to Brian's family and all who were close to him," his company said in a statement.</p>

<p>Federal officials and lawmakers have criticised the company for allegedly denying coverage to customers or payments for health services rendered making policy-holders responsible for payments.</p>

<p>This has created controversies and animosity among some insured by it.</p>

<p>Several people who posted on social media X said unpleasant things about Thompson.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Scientists in New Zealand are conducting the first-ever dissection of a complete spade-toothed whale, one of the rarest whale species globally.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists in New Zealand are dissecting an entire spade-toothed whale, one of the rarest whale species in the world, for the first time, according to <em>The Guardian</em>. When the five-meter male whale came ashore in Otago, South Island, in July, it excited cetacean scientists.</p>

<p>The elusive beaked whale is known as a spade-toothed whale because of its teeth, which resemble spades. Since the 1800s, only seven specimens have been recorded, six of which were found in New Zealand. The only sources of information available to scientists about the species up to now have been bone and tissue samples taken from dispersed remains discovered over many years.</p>

<p>The groundbreaking examination began at the Invermay AgResearch Centre in Mosgiel, near Dunedin, on Monday. The event brought together local and international scientists, along with Maori representatives, to study the rare specimen. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Anton van Helden, a global expert on spade-toothed whales and science adviser at the Department of Conservation, described the atmosphere as one of "reverence" for the animal. This unique opportunity is expected to shed light on the biology and behavior of a species shrouded in mystery. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The dissection marks a pivotal moment for marine biology, offering insights into the anatomy and life of a whale species that has largely remained an enigma.</p>

<p>"We're working around a dead animal, but it's telling us about how it [lived], and also that's unpacking all of the life stories of the people involved around it," he told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/03/spade-tooth-rare-whale-new-zealand-scientists-dissect"><em>The Guardian.</em></a></p>

<p>Van Helden, the lead author on a paper that gave the species its name, said the opportunity to examine the whale is "an incredible moment".</p>

<p>"Beaked whales are the most enigmatic group of large mammals on the planet, they are deep divers that are rarely seen at sea."</p>

<p>"This one is the rarest of the rare, only the seventh specimen known from anywhere in the world, and the first opportunity we have had to undertake a dissection like this," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump nominated veteran Washington attorney Paul Atkins to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a move cheered by the cryptocurrency industry.</p>

<p>Atkins, an SEC commissioner from 2002 to 2008, founded risk consultancy firm Patomak Global Partners in 2009, whose clients include companies in the banking, trading and cryptocurrency industries.</p>

<p>An announcement from the Trump transition noted that Atkins had been co-chairman of the Digital Chamber of Commerce, which promotes the use of digital assets, since 2017.</p>

<p>"Paul is a proven leader for common sense regulations," Trump said in a statement that emphasized Atkins' committment to "robust, innovative" capital markets.</p>

<p>"He also recognizes that digital assets and other innovations are crucial to Making America Greater than Ever Before," Trump added.</p>

<p>In a separate statement, Trump picked former senator Kelly Loeffler to head the Small Business Administration.</p>

<p>"Kelly will bring her experience in business and Washington to reduce red tape, and unleash opportunity for our Small Businesses to grow, innovate, and thrive," he said, adding that she would also co-chair his inauguration committee.</p>

<p>During the presidential campaign, Trump drew heavy financial support from cryptocurrency backers, some of whom are also close to the Republican's mega-donor, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk.</p>

<p>The digital assets industry has been eager for a change at the SEC, with outgoing chair Gary Gensler having taken a hostile posture on the sector.</p>

<p>Gensler has referred to the cryptocurrency world as "the wild west" and launched lawsuits against major trading platforms including Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken, along with various smaller startups.</p>

<p>The SEC chair also backed controversial measures to require publicly traded companies to measure their exposure to climate change.</p>

<p>Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association, cheered the nomination, calling Atkins an "excellent" choice.</p>

<p>"The past four years under Chair Gensler was a non-stop anti-crypto crusade, leading to an innovation stalemate and incalculable job, talent and economic losses," she said on X, the former Twitter.</p>

<p>But Senator Elizabeth Warren, incoming top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, expressed concern about his appointment, saying Atkins protested fines against major corporations despite their wrongdoing during the last financial crisis.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Amnesty International on Thursday accused Israel of "committing genocide" against Palestinians in Gaza since the start of the war last year, saying a new report was a "wake-up call" for the international community.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amnesty International on Thursday accused Israel of "committing genocide" against Palestinians in Gaza since the start of the war last year, saying a new report was a "wake-up call" for the international community.</p>

<p>The London-based rights organisation said its findings were based on "dehumanizing and genocidal statements by Israeli government and military officials", satellite images documenting devastation, fieldwork and ground reports from Gazans.</p>

<p>"Month after month, Israel has treated Palestinians in Gaza as a subhuman group unworthy of human rights and dignity, demonstrating its intent to physically destroy them," Amnesty chief Agnes Callamard said in a statement.</p>

<p>"Our damning findings must serve as a wake-up call to the international community: this is genocide. It must stop now," she added.</p>

<p>The Palestinian group Hamas launched an unprecedented attack inside southern Israel on October 7, 2023, triggering a deadly Israeli military offensive as Israeli officials vowed to crush the militants.</p>

<p>Israel has repeatedly and forcefully denied allegations of genocide, accusing Hamas of using the Palestinian people as human shields.</p>

<p>"There is absolutely no doubt that Israel has military objectives. But the existence of military objectives does not negate the possibility of a genocidal intent," Callamard told AFP at a press conference in The Hague.</p>

<p>The 300-page report points to incidents where there "was no Hamas presence or any other military objectives".</p>

<p>It cites 15 air strikes in Gaza between October 7, 2023 and April 20, which killed 334 civilians including 141 children, for which the group found "no evidence that any of these strikes were directed at a military objective".</p>

<p>In addition to tens of thousands of deaths and physical and psychological trauma, the report also points to the conditions on the ground, where it said Palestinians are subjected to "malnutrition, hunger and diseases" and exposed to a "slow, calculated death".</p>

<p>"States that transfer arms to Israel violate their obligations to prevent genocide under the convention and are at risk of becoming complicit", Callamard added during the press conference.</p>

<p>Since the start of the war, at least 44,532 people have been killed in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, deemed reliable by the UN.</p>

<p>Amnesty International has also announced that it will publish a report on the crimes committed by Hamas during the October 7 attack, which resulted in the deaths of 1,208 people on the Israeli side, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures, which includes hostages killed in captivity.</p>

<p>Hamas also seized 251 hostages during the attack, some of whom were already dead. Of those, 97 are still held in Gaza, including 35 the Israeli army says are dead.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A landmark defence pact between North Korea and Russia, signed by its leaders in June, has gone into effect after the two sides exchanged ratification documents, North Korea's official KCNA news agency said Thursday.</p>

<p>The formalization of the treaty comes as the United States and South Korea have accused the nuclear-armed North of sending more than 10,000 soldiers to help Russia fight Ukraine.</p>

<p>Experts say North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is keen to acquire advanced technology from Moscow and battle experience for his troops in return.</p>

<p>Kim and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed the strategic partnership deal during the Kremlin chief's visit to Pyongyang.</p>

<p>It obligates both states to provide military assistance "without delay" in the case of an attack on the other, and to jointly oppose Western sanctions.</p>

<p>It came into effect from Wednesday, when the ratification documents were exchanged in Moscow by the countries' vice foreign ministers Kim Jong Gyu and Andrei Rudenko, KCNA reported.</p>

<p>Lawmakers in Moscow last month voted unanimously for the deal and it was later signed by Putin. Pyongyang said it was ratified by a decree from Kim.</p>

<p>The treaty will serve "as a strong driving force accelerating the establishment of an independent and just multi-polarized world order without domination, subjugation and hegemony," KCNA said.</p>

<p>Analysts have suggested Pyongyang could be using Ukraine as a means of realigning its foreign policy.</p>

<p>By sending soldiers, North Korea is positioning itself within the Russian war economy as a supplier of weapons, military support and labour — potentially even bypassing traditional ally, neighbour and main trading partner China, they say.</p>

<p>North Korea and Russia have strengthened their military ties since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p>

<p>Both countries are under rafts of UN sanctions -- the former for its nuclear weapons programme and the latter for the Ukraine conflict.</p>

<p>Kim said last week during a visit to Pyongyang by Russian Defence Minister Andrei Belousov that his government, army and people would "invariably support the policy of the Russian Federation to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity".</p>

<p>Putin hailed the deal in June as a "breakthrough document".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South&nbsp;Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has accepted the resignation of Defence Minister Kim Yong-hyun and nominated the ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Choi Byung-hyuk, as new defence minister, the presidential office said on Thursday.</p>

<p>Kim, who offered his resignation on Wednesday, was seen as a central figure in Yoon's declaration of martial law on Tuesday. A senior military official and filings to impeach Yoon by opposition members said Kim made the recommendation to Yoon.</p>

<p>Yoon's chief of staff, Chung Jin-suk, called Choi "a person of principle who carries out his duties with dedication and adheres to regulations."</p>

<p>The nomination is the first official move by Yoon after he announced the withdrawal of the martial law declaration in the early hours of Wednesday, amid a storm of political turmoil and diplomatic fallout.</p>

<p>Parliament introduced a motion early on Thursday to impeach him over the botched attempt to impose martial law, but his party vowed to oppose the move, throwing the process into doubt.</p>

<p>The main opposition Democratic Party has called Yoon's martial law attempt a treasonous act, and its lawmakers could lead a vote for the bill as early as Friday.</p>

<p>U.S. officials said they were caught completely off guard by Yoon's martial law declaration, which Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said was "badly misjudged."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States will "speak out" to South Korea to safeguard democracy after President Yoon Suk Yeol's short-lived imposition of martial law, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Wednesday.</p>

<p>"South Korea's democracy is robust and resilient, and we're going to continue to speak out publicly and engage privately with South Korean counterparts to reinforce the importance of that continuing," Sullivan said at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.</p>

<p>He said that Yoon's imposition of martial law "raised deep concern for us" and he praised the National Assembly for operating "according to constitutional processes and procedures" to rescind it.</p>

<p>"What we want to see is just the proper functioning of the democratic institutions of the ROK," he said, referring to the South by its official name, the Republic of Korea.</p>

<p>Sullivan said that President Joe Biden's administration first learned of Yoon's declaration of martial law via television, repeating that the United States was not consulted by its close ally.</p>

<p>His remarks follow a posting from the National Security Council that praised South Korea's "democratic resilience."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Around 700 Bangladeshi prison inmates were still on the run after mass jailbreaks over the summer during the student-led revolution that ousted autocratic ex-prime minister Sheikh Hasina, authorities said Wednesday.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina fled in August to India, where she remains, as her government collapsed at the peak of a popular revolt.</p>

<p>In the weeks before her departure, revolts or sieges by protesters at five prisons around the Muslim-majority nation saw roughly 2,200 inmates break out of their cells.</p>

<p>Prisons chief Syed Mohammad Motaher Hossain told reporters that around 1,500 of that number had since been captured, with the remainder still at large.</p>

<p>Hossain said that at least 70 fugitives were either "terrorists" or "death row convicts".</p>

<p>Hundreds of people marched on a jail in the city of Narsingdi east of the capital Dhaka on July 19, setting the facility on fire and setting hundreds of inmates free.</p>

<p>Four more prisons were also attacked in the following weeks including a high security facility at Kashimpur, home to some of the country's most notorious criminals.</p>

<p>Police spokesman Imam Hossain Sagar said efforts to track the remaining escapees were ongoing.</p>

<p>"We have instructed all the police stations to stay alert and arrest the escaped prisoners," he said.</p>

<p>Sagar added that police were also closely monitoring several "top terrorists" granted bail by courts following Hasina's ouster.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French lawmakers on Wednesday voted to oust the government of Prime Minister Michel Barnier after just three months in office, a historic move which plunged the country further into political chaos.</p>

<p>For the first time in over sixty years, the National Assembly lower house toppled the incumbent government, approving a no-confidence motion that had been proposed by the hard left but which crucially was backed by the far-right headed by Marine Le Pen.</p>

<p>Barnier's rapid ejection from office comes after snap parliamentary elections this summer which resulted in a hung parliament with no party having an overall majority and the far-right holding the key to the government's survival.</p>

<p>President Emmanuel Macron now has the unenviable choice of picking a viable successor with over two years of his presidential term left.</p>

<p>The National Assembly debated a motion brought by the hard left in a standoff over next year's austerity budget, after the prime minister on Monday forced through a social security financing bill without a vote.</p>

<p>With the support of the far-right, a majority of 331 MPs in the 577-member chamber voted to oust the government.</p>

<p>Speaker Yael Braun-Pivet confirmed Barnier would now have to "submit his resignation" to Macron and declared the session closed.</p>

<p>Macron flew back into Paris just ahead of the vote after wrapping up his three-day state visit to Saudi Arabia, an apparent world away from the domestic crisis.</p>

<p>He strolled earlier Wednesday through the desert sands of the Al-Ula oasis, an iconic tourist project of the kingdom, marvelling at ancient landmarks. After landing, he headed direct to the Elysee Palace.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Macron accused Le Pen's far-right of "unbearable cynicism" in backing the motion.</p>

<p>No new elections can be called within a year of last summer's vote, narrowing Macron's options.</p>

<p>Laurent Wauquiez, the head of right-wing deputies in parliament, said the far-right and hard-left bore the responsibility for a no-confidence vote that will "plunge the country into instability".</p>

<p><strong>'His failure'</strong></p>

<p>Some have suggested Macron himself should resign to break the impasse.</p>

<p>But Macron rejected those calls, saying such a scenario amounted to "political fiction".</p>

<p>"It's frankly not up to scratch to say these things," Macron said during his trip to Saudi.</p>

<p>Eric Coquerel, a hard-left MP, said the motion against Barnier sounded the "death knell of Emmanuel Macron's mandate".</p>

<p>With markets nervous and France bracing for public-sector strikes over the threat of cutbacks that will shut schools and hit air and rail traffic, there is a growing sense of crisis.</p>

<p>The unions have called for civil servants, including teachers and air traffic controllers, to strike on Thursday over separate cost-cutting measures proposed by their respective ministries this autumn.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Macron is due to host a major international event Saturday with the reopening of the Notre-Dame cathedral after the 2019 fire, with guests including Donald Trump on his first foreign trip since he was elected to be the next US president.</p>

<p>"His failure," was left-wing daily Liberation's front-page headline, with a picture of Macron, whose term runs until 2027.</p>

<p><strong>'Shattered strategy'</strong></p>

<p>But in an editorial, Le Monde said Le Pen's move risked upsetting her own supporters, such as retirees and business leaders, by toppling the government.</p>

<p>"In the space of a few minutes, she shattered the strategy of normalisation she had consistently pursued," the daily said.</p>

<p>Some observers have suggested that Le Pen, 56, is seeking to bring down Macron before his term ends by ousting Barnier.</p>

<p>Le Pen is embroiled in a high-profile embezzlement trial. If found guilty in March, she could be blocked from participating in France's next presidential election.</p>

<p>But if Macron stepped down soon, an election would have to be called within a month, potentially ahead of the verdict in her trial.</p>

<p>Candidates for the post of premier are few and far between, but loyalist Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu and Macron's centrist ally Francois Bayrou are possible contenders.</p>

<p>On the left, Macron could turn to former Socialist premier and interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve, a contender in September.</p>

<p>Macron is minded to appoint the new premier rapidly, several sources told AFP.</p>

<p>It was the first successful no-confidence vote since a defeat for Georges Pompidou's government in 1962, when Charles de Gaulle was president. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The lifespan of Barnier's government is also the shortest of any administration since the Fifth Republic began in 1958.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sheikh Hasina ousted, all eyes in Bangladesh are on the main opposition party - the Bangladesh National party or BNP, whose top leader -- former Prime minister Begum Khaleda Zia â€“ has been released from house arrest.</p>

<p>Her son Tareue Rehman is returning to Bangladesh. Another top BNP leader who is expected to return is Salahuddin Ahmed, who has been living in India since 2015.</p>

<p>Ahmed has served a one-year jail term for illegally entering India, but even after being released has chosen to stay on. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The leader, who has been camping out in Shillong, has claimed that Khaleda Zia will need advanced medical treatment.</p>

<p>"BNP wants all charges against her to be dropped. She would need advanced treatment and has to go abroad for it," Salahuddin Ahmed said.Bangladesh President Khaleda Zia has already received her her renewed passport.</p>

<p>"People of Bangladesh strongly believe that Sheikh Hasina left after being forced. Others were not lucky enough to survive. Luckily I am still alive. I have been ready to return since the first day," Salahuddin said.</p>

<p>Salahuddin, who landed in Shillong in 2015, faced trial for illegal entry. He was&nbsp; acquitted in 2018 and has since been free to go.</p>

<p>The process, however, was delayed following an appeal by the authorities against his release. On February 28, a court in Shillong upheld the 2018 order of acquittal.</p>

<p>The BNP leader has claimed that Begum Khaleda Zia needs advanced medical treatment abroad thus BNP would demand all charges against her be dropped. The BNP will also call for a neutral general election.</p>

<p>"What happened to Hasina was her fate as she resorted to misrule for three consecutive terms with flawed elections and there was absence of rule of law. It was complete tyranny. The situation prevailing in Bangladesh is something like the mass revolution led by students," Salahuddin said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[On Friday, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three consecutive life terms in prison.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Ohio father read from the Bible, told his children he loved them, and made a cryptic call to his own father-saying his eldest boy would be "the hardest one"-before brutally murdering his three young sons at their family home, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/crime/chad-doerman-ohio-dad-murder-bible-b2591995.html"><em>Independent </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Chad Doerman, 33, shot and killed his sons Clayton, 7, Hunter, 4, and Chase, 3, in Monroe Township, about 75 miles west of Columbus, on June 15, 2023. On Friday, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three consecutive life terms in prison.</p>

<p>Disturbing new details have emerged about Doerman's actions leading up to the murders and the final hours of the three young boys' lives.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-man-lined-up-and-shot-3-sons-police-say-attack-planned-over-several-months-4129120">Also Read|&nbsp;US Man Lined Up And Shot 3 Sons, Police Say Attack Planned Over Several Months</a></p>

<p>In a press briefing on Monday, Clermont County Prosecuting Attorney Mark Tekulve revealed that on the day of the shooting spree, Doerman had lunch with his wife Laura and told her, "This will be my last good meal."</p>

<p>Despite this ominous statement, Laura did not feel the need to "do something to protect the family," and Doerman spent the afternoon doing yard work and playing with the children.</p>

<p>Around 3:30 to 3:45 p.m., Doerman began reading the Bible to Hunter, Tekulve said. "He was walking around the house with the Bible, mumbling 'Chad knows what's right. Chad knows what's right,'" he said.</p>

<p>Just before 4 p.m., Doerman asked his family to join him for a nap in the master bedroom. His wife and three sons entered the room with him while his 12-year-old stepdaughter watched television in another room.</p>

<p>When Doerman opened the gun safe, his wife grew alarmed and told him, "You're scaring me."</p>

<p>What followed were events so harrowing that they brought experienced officers to tears, Tekulve told reporters in a separate press briefing on Friday.</p>

<p>Doerman told his family he loved them and called his sons the "best boys ever." Then he jumped up from the bed, grabbed a .22 rifle from the safe, and his family initially worried for his safety rather than their own, fearing he would kill himself.</p>

<p>"Laura is screaming, the boys are screaming, Laura is frightened that he's about to kill himself," said Tekulve. "They're all trying to discourage him, telling him that they love him and begging him not to kill himself."</p>

<p>According to a press release from the Clermont County Sheriff's Office, the mother of the boys was also shot in the hand. She was sent to University Hospital in Cincinnati for non-life-threatening injuries after being discovered outside the house. The prosecutors added that she was trying to take the gun away from Mr Doerman and was shot during the same. She was sent to a hospital to be treated for her injuries. However, the age and the extent of the daughter's injuries are still unknown.</p>

<p>After the incident, the father was found sitting on a porch outside his residence and admitted to lining the boys up in the yard and firing at them during a subsequent interview with the authorities. He said that he had been planning the killings for several months.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The interim government in Bangladesh led by Nobel-laureate Muhammad Yunus will take oath tomorrow, the nation's army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman said today. General Waker told reporters the interim government is likely to take oath at 8 pm.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li>The army chief said the advisory council to be led by Mr Yunus may have 15 members. Bangladesh President Mohammed Shahabuddin on Tuesday appointed Mr Yunus, 84, to head the interim government after the violent ouster of former pro-India Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.</li>
	<li>Mr Yunus will lead Bangladesh through a "democratic process" when he arrives in the country to helm the interim government, General Waker said.</li>
	<li>"He is very eager to do this," the General said in a televised address to the nation. "I am certain that he will be able to take us through a beautiful democratic process and that we will benefit from this," he said.</li>
	<li>Mr Yunus also said today he was looking forward to helping the country overcome its current turbulence. "I'm looking forward to going back home, see what's happening and how we can organise ourselves to get out of the trouble we are in," he told reporters before boarding a flight at Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport bound for Dubai, where he will take a connecting plane for Dhaka.</li>
	<li>The Nobel-winning microfinance pioneer has asked for calm after weeks of violence in which at least 455 people were killed. "If we take the path of violence everything will be destroyed," he added.</li>
	<li>The appointment came quickly after student leaders called on Mr Yunus -- credited with lifting millions out of poverty in Bangladesh -- to lead. The decision was made in a meeting with President Mohammed Shahabuddin, the heads of the army, navy and air force, and student leaders.</li>
	<li>Mr Yunus will have the title of chief adviser, according to Nahid Islam, one of the leaders of Students Against Discrimination who participated in the meeting.</li>
	<li>A Bangladesh court today acquitted Mr Yunus of a labour conviction on appeal, his lawyer Khaja Tanvir Ahmed told news agency AFP. Mr Yunus had travelled abroad earlier this year after he was sentenced to six months in jail for the labour charge -- but was immediately bailed pending appeal. The case was criticised as politically motivated by rights watchdogs including Amnesty International.</li>
	<li>Ms Hasina, 76, who had been in power since 2009, resigned on Monday as hundreds of thousands of people flooded the streets of Dhaka demanding she stand down. Monday's events were the culmination of more than a month of unrest, which began as protests against a plan for quotas in government jobs but morphed into an anti-Hasina movement.</li>
	<li>Ms Hasina, who was accused of rigging January elections and widespread human rights abuses, deployed security forces to quash the protests. Hundreds of people were killed in the crackdown, but the military turned against Ms Hasina on the weekend and she was forced to flee in a helicopter to neighbouring India.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With much of Gaza reduced to rubble by 10 months of war, counting the dead has become a challenge for the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, as the death count nears 40,000.</p>

<p>Israel has repeatedly questioned the credibility of the daily figures put out by the ministry and US President Joe Biden did so too in the early stages of the war.</p>

<p>But several United Nations agencies that operate in Gaza have said the figures are credible and they are frequently cited by international organisations.</p>

<p><strong>Data collection</strong></p>

<p>Two AFP correspondents witnessed health facilities enter deaths in the ministry's database.</p>

<p>Gaza health officials first identify the bodies of the dead, by the visual recognition of a relative or friend, or by the recovery of personal items.</p>

<p>The dead person's information is then entered in the health ministry's digital database, usually including name, gender, birth date and ID number.</p>

<p>When bodies cannot be identified because they are unrecognisable or when no one claims them, staff record the death under a number, alongside all the information they were able to gather.</p>

<p>Any distinguishing marks that may help with later identification, whether personal items or a birthmark, are collected and photographed.</p>

<p><strong>Central registry</strong></p>

<p>Gaza's health ministry has issued several statements setting out its procedures for compiling the death count.</p>

<p>In public hospitals under the direct supervision of the territory's Hamas government, the "personal information and identity number" of every Palestinian killed during the war are entered in the hospital's database as soon as they are pronounced dead.</p>

<p>The data is then sent to the health ministry's central registry on a daily basis.</p>

<p>For those who die in private hospitals and clinics, their information is taken down on a form that must be sent to the ministry within 24 hours to be added to the central registry, a ministry statement said.</p>

<p>The ministry's "information centre" then verifies the data entries to "ensure they do not contain any duplicates or mistakes", before saving them in the database, the statement added.</p>

<p>Gaza residents are also encouraged by Palestinian authorities to report any deaths in their families on a designated government website. The data is used for the ministry's verifications.</p>

<p>The ministry is staffed with civil servants that answer to the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority as well as to the Hamas-led government in Gaza.</p>

<p><strong>'High correlation'</strong></p>

<p>An investigation conducted by Airwars, an NGO focused on the impact of war on civilians, analysed the data entries for 3,000 of the dead and found "a high correlation" between the ministry's data and what Palestinian civilians reported online, with 75 percent of publicly reported names also appearing on the ministry's list.</p>

<p>The study found that the ministry's figures had become "less accurate" as the war dragged on, a development it attributed to the heavy damage to health infrastructure resulting from the war.</p>

<p>For instance, at southern Gaza's Nasser Hospital, one of the few still at least partly functioning, only 50 out of 400 computers still work, its director Atef al-Hout told AFP.</p>

<p>Israeli authorities frequently criticise the ministry's figures for failing to distinguish between combatants and civilians. But neither the army nor Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu deny the scale of the overall count.</p>

<p>The press office of Gaza's Hamas government estimates that nearly 70 percent of the roughly 40,000 dead are women (about 11,000) or children (at least 16,300).</p>

<p>Several UN agencies, including the agency in charge of Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), have said the ministry's figures are credible.</p>

<p>"In the past -- the five, six cycles of conflict in the Gaza Strip -- these figures were considered as credible and no one ever really challenged these figures," the agency's chief Philippe Lazzarini said in October.</p>

<p>A study by British medical review The Lancet estimated that 186,000 deaths can be attributed to the war in Gaza, directly or indirectly as a result of the humanitarian crisis it has triggered.</p>

<p>The war in Gaza was triggered by the October 7 attack by Hamas, which resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rescue teams were Wednesday working to free people trapped after part of a hotel collapsed in western Germany, killing two and injuring several others, authorities said.</p>

<p>A floor in the hotel in Kroev, a town some 110 kilometres (68 miles) west of Frankfurt, collapsed for unknown reasons around 11:00 pm (2100 GMT) on Tuesday, police said in a statement.</p>

<p>A woman and a man were killed in the accident, police spokesman Joerg Teusch told journalists on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Of the 14 people inside at the time, five managed to get out.</p>

<p>Emergency services rescued one man, a child and two women on Wednesday morning.</p>

<p>"We were able to make contact with the seven people buried and four of them were rescued with minor injuries, so it's a miracle," Teusch said.</p>

<p>Three people remain trapped under the rubble, he said, and are "probably seriously injured".</p>

<p>The rescue operation was difficult "as the building could only be entered... with the utmost caution", police said.</p>

<p>Thirty-one residents from the local neighbourhood were evacuated and some 250 search-and-rescue staff were working at the site.</p>

<p>Dutch media reported that a Dutch family of three was among those caught up in the incident.</p>

<p>The mother and child had been pulled out alive but the father was still trapped, Dutch national news agency ANP said.</p>

<p>The family were reportedly from Urk, a small fishing town in the north of the Netherlands.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Ex Bangladesh PM Khaleda Zia, released from prison after Sheikh Hasina ouster, says "brave children made impossible possible"]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former Bangladesh Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia congratulated the people today from her hospital bed, saying the country has been "liberated" through the efforts of "our valiant children". Released from prison after Sheikh Hasina resigned from Prime Minister post and skipped the country, Khaleda Zia also thanked the people "who prayed for my health and freedom".</p>

<p>"This victory has brought us to a new beginning.&nbsp; We have to build a new country, a prosperous Bangladesh, out of the long-standing wreckage of democracy and piled up corruption. The students, the youth, are our future. We will bring to life the dreams for which they gave their lifeblood," she said in a video message posted on social media. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"I would like to express my sincere thanks to our brave children who fought to the death to make the impossible possible. Pay respect to hundreds of martyrs," she added.</p>

<p>The release of Khaleda Zia, a two-time Prime Minister who heads the&nbsp; heads the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, was ordered by President Mohammed Shahabuddin hours after Sheikh Hasina's ouster.</p>

<p>Ms Zia was convicted for corruption in 2018 and jailed for 17 years. It left her ineligible to contest elections later that year. Because of ill health, she had been in hospital for most of this period.</p>

<p>The ouster of Sheikh Hasina has not stemmed the tide of violence that has been ravaging the neighbouring country over the past month. Twenty bodies of Awami League leaders have been found across Bangladesh since Sheikh Hasina left Dhaka on Monday.</p>

<p>Nobel laureate and the country's microfinance pioneer Muhammad Yunus, who will head the army-backed interim government, has called for calm.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina -- the daughter of Bangladesh's founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman -- had stepped down from the top post and and left the country after a 45-minute ultimatum from the army. She is currently in India.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Foreign Minister S Jaishankar said yesterday that the government is giving her time to "recover" before discussing her next plans.</p>

<p>"At a very short notice, she requested approval to come for the moment to India. We simultaneously received a request for flight clearance from the Bangladesh authorities," Mr Jaishankar had told the Lok Sabha.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have agreed to roll over cash-strapped Pakistan's $12 billion debt for one year, as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is likely to approve its $7 billion bailout package later this month.</p>

<p>After a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance yesterday, Pakistan Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb told reporters that there was no delay in the IMF Executive Board meeting, which is going to take place by the end of this month to approve the $7 billion Extended Fund Facility, the Express Tribune reported today.</p>

<p>The Executive Board is scheduled to meet on August 28 to approve the $7 billion package, the report said, quoting government officials.</p>

<p>The development marks an end to the uncertainty over the timing of the Executive Board meeting, which was contingent upon the rollover of debts by Pakistan's three traditional creditors, it said.</p>

<p>Aurangzeb said the $12 billion cash deposits by China, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates would be rolled over for one year, like last time. Earlier, he had said that the IMF had asked for the rollover for three to five years before the Executive Board meeting.</p>

<p>However, he clarified that the requirement was to secure the rollover for one year, but the government was trying to have these rollovers for three to five years. He added that the three bilateral creditors had agreed to roll the loans over on the existing terms and conditions.</p>

<p>The IMF announced a staff-level agreement for USD 7 billion last month, subject to the approval of the Executive Board and securing financing commitments from the bilateral and multilateral creditors.</p>

<p>The finance minister said there was no point in asking for an increase in the interest rates on these loans when the country's foreign exchange reserves had strengthened compared to a year ago. The IMF, he added, had identified only a USD 3-5 billion financing gap over the three-year programme period, which was quite manageable.</p>

<p>"Pakistan has also received an offer from a foreign commercial bank but we are waiting for the IMF Board approval to ask the lender to cut the offered interest rates," said Aurangzeb. The offer had come from a non-Gulf and non-Chinese commercial bank, he added, without disclosing the name.</p>

<p>A finance ministry official said that Standard Chartered Bank had offered a less than USD 400 million loan but it was asking for a double-digit interest rate that the government could not afford to pay. Aurangzeb said the government would wait for the IMF Board's approval to get the commercial bank to cut its offered interest rates.</p>

<p>The finance minister said two important developments had taken place in the last few days, which showed that Pakistan was well on its way to achieving macroeconomic stability. He described the Fitch rating agency's decision to improve Pakistan's credit rating by one notch and the central bank's decision to cut the interest rates by 1% as "very critical elements for achieving macroeconomic stability".</p>

<p>When asked as to why Standard and Poor's had not improved Pakistan's CCC+ rating, the minister stated that raising a CCC+ rating to a B negative one would have been a big jump.</p>

<p>He hoped that the three rating agencies would improve Pakistan's standing to B negative by the end of this year, a grade where it can venture into the international capital markets to float sovereign bonds at relatively lower rates than offered at the current CCC+ ratings.</p>

<p>The three international credit rating agencies have given below investment grade to Pakistani bonds due to their weak economic position and huge external financing requirements. However, Fitch last week improved the rating by one notch -- from CCC to CCC+ -- which was still below the investment grade.</p>

<p>The finance minister said the government was trying to issue the Panda bond in the Chinese markets and had engaged a Chinese financial adviser firm to complete the transaction either by the end of this calendar year or in early 2025.</p>

<p>Aurangzeb said the government was also contemplating hiring another Chinese financial adviser to secure the energy debt rollover. He said that Pakistan had requested up to a five-year extension in the energy debt, but it would take time before any agreement was reached.</p>

<p>He said that even the conversion of the Chinese power plants from imported to local coal would take at least two to three years.</p>

<p>The finance minister also said that to cut expenditures, the government had undertaken the privatisation programme and an exercise was ongoing to close ministries or merge them. "It is about time to right-size the federal government," Aurangzeb said.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A helicopter crashed in central Nepal on Wednesday, killing all five people aboard including the pilot and four Chinese tourists.</p>

<p>Nepal has a woeful track record on aviation safety and the Himalayan republic has seen a spate of deadly light plane and helicopter crashes over the decades.</p>

<p>The Air Dynasty chopper was heading to Syabrubesi, a starting point for many trekking routes popular with tourists, from the capital Kathmandu.</p>

<p>It lost contact about three minutes after taking off, a press release from the Civil Aviation Authority said, and crashed in Nuwakot district north of the capital.</p>

<p>Another helicopter was dispatched immediately to the accident site for rescue, it said.</p>

<p>"All five people aboard including the pilot are dead," police spokesman Dan Bahadur Karki told AFP.</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption">The helicopter lost contact about three minutes after taking off, authorities said</p>
</div>

<p>Nuwakot district officer Ram Krishna Adhikari said five dead bodies have been retrieved from the accident site.</p>

<p>"It has crashed in a jungle area on the slope of a hill. We do not know the cause yet or how it happened," he said from the crash site.</p>

<p>Adhikari said that police and army personnel were dispatched after locals had alerted him about the crash and a fire at the site.</p>

<p>Nepal's air industry has boomed in recent years, carrying goods and people between hard-to-reach areas as well as foreign trekkers and climbers.</p>

<p>But it has been plagued by poor safety due to insufficient training and maintenance, issues compounded by mountainous Nepal's treacherous geography.</p>

<p>The Himalayan republic has some of the world's most remote and tricky runways, flanked by snow-capped peaks with approaches that pose a challenge even for accomplished pilots.</p>

<p>The European Union has banned all Nepali carriers from its airspace over safety concerns.</p>

<p>Wednesday's incident comes two weeks after a plane crash in Kathmandu killed all 18 aboard except the pilot.</p>

<p>Six people, including five members of a Mexican family, were killed when a helicopter crashed soon after take-off in the Everest region in 2023.</p>

<p>Nepal's tourism minister Rabindra Adhikari was among seven killed in a helicopter crash in 2019.</p>

<p>The country's last major incident involving a commercial flight was in January 2023 when a Yeti Airlines service crashed while landing at Pokhara, killing all 72 aboard.</p>

<p>That was Nepal's deadliest since 1992 when all 167 people aboard a Pakistan International Airlines plane were killed when it crashed on approach to Kathmandu airport.</p>

<p>A Thai Airways aircraft crashed near the same airport earlier that year, killing 113 people.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh's Muhammad Yunus, who is set to lead an interim government after the premier was ousted, called for calm and urged people to use the opportunity to build a better nation.</p>

<p>"I fervently appeal to everybody to stay calm. Please refrain from all kinds of violence," the Nobel-winning microfinance pioneer said in a statement, a day ahead of his expected return to the country from Europe.</p>

<p>"Be calm and get ready to build the country. If we take the path of violence everything will be destroyed."</p>

<p>The 84-year-old will lead a caretaker government after mass protests forced longtime prime minister Sheikh Hasina to flee, the presidency has said.</p>

<p>"This is our beautiful country with lots of exciting possibilities," he added.</p>

<p>"We must protect and make it a wonderful country for us and for our future generations."</p>

<p>Hasina fled by helicopter on Monday after more than a month of student-led protests, which started as a campaign against civil service job quotas but escalated into demands the leader quit.</p>

<p>"I congratulate the brave students who took the lead in making our Second Victory Day possible, and to the people for giving your total support to them," Yunus added.</p>

<p>"Let us make the best use of our new victory. Let us not let this slip away because of our mistakes."</p>

<p>He has said he wants to hold elections "within a few months".</p>

<p>In January, he and three colleagues from one of the companies he founded were sentenced to jail terms of six months -- but immediately bailed pending appeal -- by a Dhaka labour court, which found they had illegally failed to create a workers' welfare fund.</p>

<p>All four had denied the charges and, with courts accused of rubber-stamping decisions by Hasina's government, the case was criticised as politically motivated by watchdogs including Amnesty International.</p>

<p>Yunus later travelled abroad -- but is due to fly from Europe to arrive in Dhaka early Thursday afternoon.</p>

<p>Key political leader Tarique Rahman, acting president of the former opposition Bangladesh National Party, spoke via video broadcast to a giant rally of supporters in Dhaka.</p>

<p>Rahman, who went into exile in London during Hasina's rule, urged for elections to be swiftly held.</p>

<p>"The vote should be held as quickly as possible," Rahman said, also urging calm.</p>

<p>Since Hasina fled, police reported mobs launching revenge attacks on her allies.</p>

<p>"Don't take laws into your hands", he told BNP supporters.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A video has captured the moment&nbsp;a curious pet dog unintentionally caused a house fire after chewing on a portable lithium-ion battery power bank.&nbsp;&nbsp;The incident that happened in May was captured on a home security camera and was released by the Tulsa Fire Department.</p>

<p>The footage&nbsp;shows two dogs and a cat hanging out in the home's living room.&nbsp;Suddenly, one dog's attention turns to a lithium-ion battery pack, and it begins to chew on the device. Within seconds, the battery explodes, sending sparks flying and quickly engulfing the room in flames.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fortunately, all pets escaped the burning home through a dog door, and the family was also safely evacuated. The fire department raced to the scene and doused the flames before they could cause irreparable damage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to Tulsa Fire Department public information officer Andy Little, "The outcome could have been much worse if there had been no means of escape or if the family was asleep at the time."</p>

<p>After the incident, The Tulsa Fire Department issued a safety warning to pet owners about the dangers of lithium-ion batteries and the importance of storing them out of reach of children and pets.</p>

<p>"Lithium-ion batteries are known for storing a significant amount of energy in a compact space. However, when this energy is released uncontrollably, it can generate heat, produce flammable and toxic gases, and even lead to explosions,'' the fire department said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Fire departments all over the country are seeing fires related to these batteries and we want the public to learn about usage, safe storage and proper disposal of these potentially dangerous batteries," the department added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To prevent such incidents, it is crucial to follow manufacturer guidelines when using lithium-ion batteries, use approved chargers, and store them safely.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine lobbed missiles and drones at Russia's southwest region of Kursk overnight, the local governor said Wednesday, a day after pro-Kyiv forces crossed across the border with tanks and armoured vehicles.</p>

<p>"Two Ukrainian missiles were shot down by air defence systems in the Kursk region", regional governor Alexei Smirnov wrote on Telegram social media channel, adding that three drones were also destroyed.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Moscow's defence ministry said it had rushed its troops and aviation units to the border in Kursk after a morning raid by Ukrainian units -- the latest such attack in the conflict.</p>

<p>The incursion was carried out by some 300 troops, 11 tanks and more than 20 armoured vehicles, Russian authorities said.</p>

<p>Five people were killed throughout the day and some 28 wounded, Smirnov and local health authorities said.</p>

<p>Kursk sits just across from Ukraine's northeastern Sumy region.</p>

<p>Ukrainian drones also targeted residential buildings in the border regions of Voronezh and Belgorod, with damage but no casualties reported, local officials said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Combatants from Ukraine have made several brief incursions into Russia since the beginning of the conflict in February 2022, including by units of Russians fighting in support of Kyiv -- the Russian Volunteer Corps and the Freedom of Russia Legion.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India has evacuated all non-essential staff and their families from its embassy and consulates in Bangladesh, sources have confirmed. The move comes after massive protests over job quotas forced Sheikh Hasina to quit as Bangladesh's prime minister and flee.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The High Commission continues to operate with a skeletal staff, while those who returned to India did so on a voluntary basis, sources said.</p>

<p>Despite the turmoil, principal officers, including the High Commissioner of India to Dhaka, remain at their posts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to sources, the evacuation occurred via commercial flights and the High Commission remains functional, with dedicated personnel maintaining essential operations amid unrest in the region. In addition to the High Commission in the capital, India has assistant high commissions or consulates in several other cities, including Chittagong, Rajshahi, Khulna and Sylhet.</p>

<p>The protests against the country's quota system for families of freedom fighters slowly turned anti-government, with demonstrators demanding Sheikh Hasina resign as Bangladesh's Prime Minister. Nearly 300 people were killed after authorities used force to disperse the crowd and quell the protests that spread across the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina, who had been in power since 2009, resigned and fled the country after protestors stormed the Prime Minister's residence on Monday.</p>

<p>Hasina's plane landed at an airbase near Delhi on Monday evening. National Security Adviser Ajit Doval met with the former prime minister, who is expected to leave for the UK, where she may seek political asylum.</p>

<p>Bangladesh's army chief, General Waker-Uz-Zaman, announced Hasina's resignation in a broadcast on state television, stating that the military would form an interim government. The Bangladesh military has taken over the responsibility of guarding Dhaka's diplomatic neighbourhood, previously overseen by police. They are now responsible for securing the residences of ambassadors and foreign missions in the Gulshan and Baridhara zones.</p>

<p>Earlier on Wednesday, a special Air India flight, operated with an A321 Neo aircraft, took off from Delhi without any passengers and <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/air-indias-special-flight-to-bangladesh-dhaka-brings-back-205-people-to-delhi-6281258Â ">returned with 199 adults and six infants</a> from Dhaka.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Air India will commence its scheduled operations to Dhaka, with two daily flights from Delhi. Other airlines, including Vistara and IndiGo, will also operate their services to Dhaka as per schedule.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Indian government has not issued any official statement on the evacuation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The visuals from Bangladesh are disturbing, and the anger on the streets is palpable. They are reminiscent of scenes from Colombo just two years ago when the Presidential Palace was ransacked following then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa's flight from Sri Lanka.</p>

<p>According to an <em>NDTV </em>report, "On Monday, protesters set fire to a temporary shed at the residence of Bangladesh's Prime Minister (now former). They also looted and vandalised Sheikh Hasina's official residence in Dhaka, smashed a statue of her father, Mujibur Rahman, with hammers, and set her party's offices ablaze as they celebrated her departure as Prime Minister."</p>

<p>Such visuals have been widely circulated and analysed by commentators in the last two days. I will refrain from commenting on whether Bangladesh is falling into the hands of radical Islamic groups or whether there was foreign involvement in the regime change on Monday.</p>

<p>My focus here is different. I want to explore the range of emotions that an average Indian has towards a country that has largely been a good neighbour. Alongside the term '<em>ghuspaithiye</em>' (which gained notoriety with the influx of immigrants right after 1947 of migrants from then-undivided Pakistan) and the range of emotions it evokes, there is a mix of empathy, pain, shared legacy, and a common love for Rabindra Sangeet-all experienced in varying degrees and at different times.</p>

<h2><strong>The '<em>Ghuspaithiye</em>' Sentiment</strong></h2>

<p>For people living in parts of Assam, Tripura, and the bordering districts of West Bengal and Bihar, the mass migration from then-East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) between 1948 and 1965 significantly impacted local demographics. The influx surged following the disturbances surrounding Bangladesh's birth in 1971. According to reliable estimates, there are nearly two crore Bangladeshis in India, with half of them settled in Assam and West Bengal alone.</p>

<p>Since then, the term '<em>ghuspaithiye</em>', or 'illegal immigrant', has become ingrained in the Indian psyche, especially in the context of Bangladesh. The attitude towards these immigrants has often been one of contempt, primarily driven by class bias. They are perceived as poor, persecuted, and a drain on scarce resources. Yet, they are not hated, likely due to another powerful sentiment towards Bangladeshis: empathy.</p>

<h2><strong>We Played A Role In Their Liberation</strong></h2>

<p>This sense of empathy arises from India's active role in Bangladesh's liberation from Pakistan after a bloody struggle. The partition of Pakistan was also seen by many Indians as a vindication of the belief that creating a nation-state based on religion was a flawed concept-a belief that had led to the partition of India in 1947. This sentiment has persisted, and occasional anti-India protests in Bangladesh are considered minor deviations from an otherwise well-behaved neighbour and are therefore mostly overlooked.</p>

<h2><strong>Pain Across the Border</strong></h2>

<p>Growing up in the 1980s and 1990s, my generation was frequently exposed to news about nature's fury in Bangladesh and its devastating toll. Reports from the November 1970 cyclone, one of the deadliest on record, indicated that nearly 5,00,000 lives were lost in then-East Pakistan. Another cyclone in 1985 killed 11,000 people, and one in 1991 claimed nearly 1,50,000 lives.<br />
These reports of widespread destruction frequently made us sad, and there was a sense of shared pain. Combined with empathy, this constituted a significant portion of the positive feeling we held towards Bangladesh.</p>

<h2><strong>They, Too, Love Their Rabindra Sangeet</strong></h2>

<p>A strong Bengali identity played a crucial role in East Pakistan's transition to Bangladesh. Following liberation, Rabindranath Tagore's Amar Sonar Bangla, penned in 1905, became the new country's national anthem. Rabindra Sangeet is as popular in West Bengal as it is across the border in Bangladesh. The beautiful Padma River that separates the two geographies has done nothing to diminish this shared legacy.</p>

<p>Since ties between India and Bangladesh have remained warm throughout Bangladesh's journey, the feelings and emotions described above have persisted. Hence the feeling of loss now as we see the widespread vandalism taking place on the streets of Bangladesh.</p>

<p>As the Indian government considers its stance and options amidst the current turmoil in Bangladesh, it must remain mindful of the shared legacy and common sentiments held by people across the border. It should, therefore, strive to ensure that Bangladesh remains a good neighbour for years to come. Not a tall ask given the long history of bonhomie between the two countries.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With Tom Cruise widely predicted to engage in a death-defying stunt on the roof of the Stade de France, Sunday's Paris Olympics closing ceremony promises a memorable passing of the five rings flag to Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Two weeks after the unprecedented complexity of the opening ceremony along the River Seine, there are big expectations for the show to wrap up the Games.</p>

<p>The closing ceremony will be a much shorter affair and will take place -- in more traditional fashion -- at France's national stadium.</p>

<p>Artistic director Thomas Jolly has revealed it will combine "wonder" with "dystopia", suggesting some darker elements than the joyful and impertinent tone of the opening ceremony that drew a record audience of more than a billion worldwide.</p>

<p>Offering a sneak peak to journalists recently, Jolly said he saw the Games as a "fragile monument" and wanted to imagine what would happen if they "disappeared and someone was rebuilding them in a distant future".</p>

<p>One sequence features "travellers from another space-time who arrive on Earth and discover vestiges from the history of the Olympics", with acrobats restoring the famous five rings of the Games.</p>

<p>It will reportedly feature more than 100 dancers, circus artists and other performers, with the promise of aerial displays, giant sets and spectacular lighting.</p>

<h3><strong>Destination Hollywood&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The opening ceremony featured some huge stars including <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/entertainment/paris-olympics-2024-lady-gaga-celine-dion-add-sparkle-to-opening-ceremony-6199213" target="_blank">Lady Gaga, Celine Dion</a> and Aya Nakamura, but some big celebrities are also expected Sunday.</p>

<p>Cruise has been at several Olympic events and the most daredevil of Hollywood stars would be a natural connection between Paris and the 2028 Los Angeles Games.</p>

<p>US media have reported that Cruise has been preparing a spectacular stunt to pick up the Olympic flag and transfer it to LA, with video sequences already filmed on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>There have been no shortage of Hollywood stars in attendance for the Games who might also play a role, including Snoop Dogg, Eva Mendes, Ryan Gosling and Sharon Stone.</p>

<p>There are unconfirmed rumours that Beyonce -- a fervent supporter of the US team on social media -- may perform.</p>

<p>Two of France's biggest musical exports -- Air and Phoenix -- are already lined up to play, according to Le Parisien newspaper.</p>

<p>Organisers will be anxious to avoid a repeat of the controversy sparked by the opening ceremony, which featured drag queens in a sequence that some Christians and conservatives thought mocked the Biblical story of The Last Supper.</p>

<p>Organisers insisted it was a reference to Greek gods&gt; But Jolly and other members of the team have since been victims of social media harassment, triggering police investigations and condemnation from French President Emmanuel Macron.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Cities are increasingly growing upward instead of outward, with Asian cities leading the way. Previously, cities expanded by occupying more territory.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A city usually starts as a small town and grows in area after new buildings are made and boundaries are extended. However, in recent times, taller buildings are seen as one of the elements of any modern city. Now, a new study has revealed that cities are soaring upward at a greater rate than they are spreading out. This new finding can reshape how we use our resources and the environment.</p>

<p>The satellite study, published in the journal<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44284-024-00100-1"><em> Nature Cities,</em></a> was conducted by a team of Earth scientists, environmental engineers and geomaticists. The team studied two types of satellite data by measuring the footprint and height of buildings or more than 1,500 cities globally from the 1990s to the 2010s. One kind displayed a city's footprint, making it possible to calculate its size in two dimensions. The second kind, which used microwaves, made it possible to estimate city expansion in three dimensions and took skyscraper construction into account for upward growth.</p>

<p>According to the study, cities are increasingly growing upward instead of outward, with Asian cities leading the way. Previously, cities expanded by occupying more territory.</p>

<p>David Wilson, a professor of geography at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said that the study is "extremely interesting" and the change from horizontal to vertical growth in urban areas has both pros and cons.</p>

<p>"This trend is very positive for promoting sustainability and resource management. Less blocks, neighbourhoods, and communities will require the hand of government to reach out and expend scarce resources for policing, fire protection, and provision of housing services," he told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.newsweek.com/cities-growth-urban-taller-skyscrapers-wider-population-1933969#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20researchers%2C%20this,land%20prices%20and%20economic%20development."><em>Newsweek</em></a>.</p>

<p>He added, "At the same time, the prognosis for fostering equity in the city is grim. Dramatic increases in vertical development, especially in mega-cities, often signal the realities of downtown gentrification kicking into hyperdrive, a notorious process for displacing and further isolating the poor and the stigmatized."</p>

<p>According to the study, larger cities with a population of more than 10 million people are at the forefront of the vertical transition.</p>

<p>In recent decades, China's urban growth has experienced a remarkable transformation. Wide outward growth was the initial hallmark, but more recently, taller structures are displacing shorter ones as vertical development has taken hold. Nonetheless, Europe's urban growth patterns have not changed much, with outward growth continuing to predominate and vertical development growing at a very slow rate.</p>

<p>Fast upward growth was rare in the 1990s but considerably more typical by the 2010s. Rapid outward development, on the other hand, declined throughout this time.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ByteDance has expanded its offering of a software that can generate videos based on text prompts, joining a growing number of Chinese tech firms entering an emerging market also targeted by ChatGPT creator OpenAI.</p>

<p>Since Microsoft-backed OpenAI unveiled in February its text-to-video model Sora, which is not open for public use yet, Chinese companies have rapidly developed similar tools, with several launching models accessible to users.</p>

<p>Jimeng AI, developed by ByteDance-owned Faceu Technology, is now available on the Apple App Store for Chinese users, Reuters' checks showed on Tuesday, following its release on Android on July 31.</p>

<p>The launch of a text-to-video model by the parent of short video app firm TikTok follows a series of similar model releases in recent months in China.</p>

<p>Kuaishou, one of China's largest video apps, opened its Kling AI text-to-video model to a global audience late last month. Its beta version is accessible worldwide, requiring only an email address for registration.</p>

<p>Chinese AI startup Zhipu AI also introduced its video-generating model Ying last month, and days after its launch another startup, Shengshu, officially launched its Vidu app.</p>

<p>Faceu Technology operates under ByteDance's Jianying business, which is best known for its video editing app CapCut.</p>

<p>Jimeng AI offers subscriptions at 69 yuan ($9.65) monthly, 79 yuan for a single month, or 659 yuan annually. Each plan allows users to create about 2,050 images or 168 AI videos per month.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh's former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina son has expressed concern over the attacks on his mother's party leaders and minorities in the country amid massive political turmoil.</p>

<p>Twenty bodies of Awami League leaders have been found across Bangladesh after Sheikh Hasina left the nation, following violent protests by students over giving job quota to freedom fighters' children.</p>

<p>"All our MPs and ministers homes have been burnt. I will ask for the Indian government's help in ensuring their safety," Sajeeb Wazed Joy told NDTV in an exclusive conversation.</p>

<p>"This is not a political movement. If this is a political movement why are they killing people," he said.</p>

<p>Right groups and community leaders have claimed that scores of Hindu temples, business establishments and temples in Bangladesh have been vandalised by violent mobs after the fall of Sheikh Hasina government.</p>

<p>"When Jamaat-e-Islami was in power last time, there were attacks on minorities regularly. Those have resumed. Burning, looting, killing people. Vandalising temples and parliament. The images you are seeing is not of democratic protesters, these are images of violent mob," Mr Joy said.</p>

<p>On being asked, what the future of Bangladesh looks like, Sajeeb Wazed Joy said Bangladesh runs the risk of becoming like Syria.&nbsp;"I wanted to say Pakistan, but It looks more like Bangladesh is becoming like Syria."</p>

<p>"They (people of Bangladesh) have made their future. They will have to live with it. It's going to be bleak, economic growth is going to stop, militancy will continue," he said.</p>

<p>Bangladesh's Nobel-winning microfinance pioneer Muhammad Yunus has been named the head of the military-backed interim government after the ouster of Sheikh Hasina.</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina - the daughter of Bangladesh's founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman - was given a 45-minute ultimatum to step down as the Prime Minister on Monday, it is learnt.</p>

<p>Ms Hasina left state capital Dhaka in a military aircraft for India after resigning. Foreign Minister S Jaishankar yesterday said the government is giving time to Sheikh Hasina to "recover" and let them know about her next move. "At very short notice, she requested approval to come for the moment to India. We simultaneously received a request for flight clearance from the Bangladesh authorities," he said.</p>

<p>Sources had earlier said wanted to go to London to claim sanctuary, but her son Sajeeb Wazed has dismissed the speculation.</p>

<p>Asked about multiple reports about UK's "silence" her request for asylum and revocation of her visa by the US, Mr Joy said, "The reports about her requesting asylum are incorrect. She has not requested asylum anywhere. So the question of UK or US not responding yet is not true".</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Elon Musk's X Corp. filed a lawsuit accusing an industry group of violating antitrust laws for an advertising boycott that cost the social media company billions of dollars.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk's X Corp. filed a lawsuit accusing an industry group of violating antitrust laws for an advertising boycott that cost the social media company billions of dollars.</p>

<p>The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in federal court in Texas, claims the Global Alliance for Responsible Media coordinated the boycott by advertisers in 2022 under the guise of concern about whether X, formerly known as Twitter, would adhere to certain "brand safety" standards for content on the platform after Musk acquired it for $44 billion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"To put it simply, people are hurt when the marketplace of ideas is undermined and some viewpoints are not funded over others as part of an illegal boycott," X Chief Executive Officer Linda Yaccarino said in a post on the platform. "This behavior is a stain on a great industry, and cannot be allowed to continue."</p>

<p>Outcry over unchecked antisemitic content and commentary on X - some of it endorsed by Musk - sparked many big advertisers including Apple Inc. and Walt Disney Co. to pull ads from the platform. And Musk has opposed government efforts to control toxic posts on social media.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The lawsuit by X comes as House Republicans and conservative media outlets have ramped up scrutiny of GARM, which counts among its more than 100 members advertisers including Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and Unilever Plc.</p>

<p>GOP lawmakers have accused the group of violating antitrust laws, and the lawsuit cites a July report from the House Judiciary Committee accusing GARM of depriving conservative media outlets of ad revenue from its members.<br />
GARM didn't immediately return a request for comment.</p>

<p>In its 2022 annual report, the industry group said it had helped establish common definitions, metrics and tools to aid brands and their advertising partners in ensuring their ads don't appear alongside content they may find problematic.</p>

<p>In its lawsuit, X claimed the group's actions represent a "naked restraint of trade."&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Collective action among competing advertisers to dictate brand safety standards to be applied by social media platforms shortcuts the competitive process and allows the collective views of a group of advertisers with market power to override the interest of consumers," X said in its complaint.</p>

<p>Musk, the world's richest person, is a self-proclaimed champion of free speech on his social media platform and has pursued other legal challenges connected to allegations of lax moderation of toxic posts, though with mixed success.</p>

<p>Rumble, a video-sharing platform, said it would file a lawsuit of its own against GARM and the World Federation of Advertisers in Texas federal court that raises the same allegations as X.</p>

<p>The case is X v. World Federation of Advertisers, 7:24-cv-00114, US District Court, Northern District of Texas (Wichita Falls).</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NASA on Tuesday postponed the departure of astronauts bound for the International Space Station on a SpaceX flight due to ongoing issues with Boeing's Starliner spacecraft.</p>

<p>The Starliner, which brought two NASA astronauts aboard the ISS in early June, has been docked for the past two months due to anomalies detected in its propulsion system during its flight, with the mission's return date increasingly uncertain.</p>

<p>The SpaceX flight was supposed to carry out the next group of four ISS crew members, dubbed Crew-9, in mid-August, to relieve the current foursome known as "Crew-8" currently aboard the space station.</p>

<p>Given the stranding of the two additional astronauts, however, NASA has had to devise a plan to find another way to bring them back to Earth.</p>

<p>The Crew-9 flight, now scheduled to lift off by September 24 at the earliest, could bring back the two stranded astronauts and only two Crew-8 members, giving Boeing more time to fix issues with its spacecraft.</p>

<p>"This adjustment allows more time...to finalize return planning for the agency's Boeing Crew Flight Test currently docked to the orbiting laboratory," the US space agency said in a blog post.</p>

<p>The Starliner, which also had helium leaks detected during its voyage, could also return unmanned if safety issues are not resolved.</p>

<p>"NASA and Boeing continue to evaluate the spacecraft's readiness, and no decisions have been made regarding Starliner's return," the post continued.</p>

<p>NASA was planning a press conference on Wednesday to provide updates on both Crew-9 and the Starliner spacecraft.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>"Don't stain dreams"</p>

<p>This was the message by Joler Gaan, a Bangladeshi folk band, after a violent mob attacked its singer Rahul Ananda's home in Dhaka's Dhanmondi Monday. While Rahul Ananda and his family members managed to escape unharmed, a huge number of musical instruments -- 3000 by some estimates -- were reduced to ash as rioters set fire to the house.</p>

<p>The incident of arson comes amid a spate of mob violence in Bangladesh after Sheikh Hasina resigned as Prime Minister and fled the country. With the Awami League government toppled and the new interim dispensation backed by the Army yet to take charge, mob violence is being reported in several areas of the country.</p>

<p>Hindu organisations have said homes, businesses and temples of the minority community have been targeted. Top leaders, including senior BNP leader and former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia's son Tarique Rahman, have appealed for peace.</p>

<p>In its Facebook post, Joler Gaan has said Rahul Ananda's home was not just his residence, but a space where numerous songs were composed. "It was Joler Gaan's official studio. Musical discussions, recording, mixing, editing, everything happened there," the group has said in a post in Bengali.</p>

<p>The gates of Rahul Ananda's home, the post said, were always open so that anyone could meet him. It is worth noting that French President Emmanuel Macron visited the musician's home during his Bangladesh trip last year. And this, too, found a mention in the social media post after the attack.</p>

<p>"Do the instruments belong to just Joler Gaan? No. This is an attempt for all young musicians who believe that we can make our own instruments. It is because of these instruments that people of this country can proudly say these sounds are only heard in Bangladesh. It is this glimpse of a dream that draws another musician from far-off France," the post reads.</p>

<p>It said Rahul Ananda and his family members managed to escape in time and are safe. "But all instruments of our band, documents, Rahul da's furniture have turned to ash. Maybe this chilling memory will stay with his 13-year-old son, Lalit for life. A home built bit by bit burning in the fire of some people's rage and revenge!"</p>

<p>The group said they would again build their collection of instruments from scratch. "But how do we put off this fire of revenge? Why can't we win everything over with love? We welcome the dream for the future, but our celebration must not break someone else's dream."</p>]]></content:encoded>

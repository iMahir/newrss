       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Conspiracy theories about the assassination attempt on Donald Trump received tens of millions of views on X, researchers said Tuesday, highlighting the potential for extreme falsehoods to go viral on the Elon Musk-owned platform.</p>

<p>The social media site, formerly named Twitter, was flooded with unsubstantiated claims soon after the shooting Saturday at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, which left one spectator dead and a bloodied Trump injured in the ear.</p>

<p>Those included unfounded assertions that the assassination attempt had been "staged" or an "inside job," while fingers were pointed at imaginary culprits such as Jews and the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad.</p>

<p>The conspiracy theories were viewed over 215 million times on X, the watchdog Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) said after analyzing a sample of 100 popular posts.</p>

<p>A majority of the posts did not carry a "Community Note," a crowd-sourced moderation tool that Musk has promoted as the way for users to add context to the tweets, CCDH added.</p>

<p>In the first 24 hours alone, unsubstantiated narratives around the incident amassed more than 100 million views on X, according to the nonprofit research group Institute for Strategic Dialogue.</p>

<p>X did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Internet hoaxers also falsely identified several people as the shooter -- including Italian sports journalist Marco Violi, anti-Trump protester Maxwell Yearick and comedian Sam Hyde, AFP's fact-checkers reported.</p>

<p>Federal investigators have identified the shooter, who was killed on the scene, as Thomas Matthew Crooks of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, several social media users voiced confusion as they scrambled to obtain accurate information in what appeared to be a sea of false or misleading posts, which rapidly gained traction.</p>

<p>The trend illustrates the ability of falsehoods to mutate into viral political discourse on tech platforms including X, which now offer fewer guardrails as they scale back content moderation.</p>

<p>Researchers say some clout-chasing accounts on the platform have a financial motive to post sensational falsehoods, as X's ad revenue-sharing program incentivizes extreme content designed to boost engagement.</p>

<p>"In the marketplace of disinformation -- which is effectively what a lot of social media platforms have now been reduced to, a marketplace for lies -- extreme content is your currency," said Imran Ahmed, chief executive and founder of CCDH.</p>

<p>"The algorithms take the most outlandish content and amplify it exponentially until the entire digital world is flooded with conspiracism, disinformation and hate."</p>

<p>Researchers have warned about a possible firehose of disinformation in the run up to the November election, which will take place in a deeply polarized political climate in the United States.</p>

<p>"Already, at an early stage in the US electoral cycle, we can see flashing warning signs that social media in the weeks and months ahead will be increasingly chaotic and rife with disinformation," Ahmed said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just days after a failed assassination bid against former US President Donald Trump, an armed man wearing a ski mask was arrested in the area where the Republican National Convention is being held, reports said.</p>

<p>The man was carrying a concealed AK-47 pistol in his tactical backpack, the Fox News reported. Officials also found a full magazine of ammunition inside the bag.</p>

<p>Prominent Republican politicians and officials are gathered at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee for the Republican convention this week.</p>

<p>"United States Capitol Police initially observed the suspect looking suspicious, wearing a ski mask and a large tactical backpack in the street," the CNN reported quoting Milwaukee Police Department.</p>

<p>In a separate incident, a man was shot dead by cops after a knife fight near the Republican event.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This comes days after a 20-year-old man was gunned down for trying to assassinate the 78-year-old former president at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Trump survived with a nicked ear during his rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday after Thomas Matthew Crooks opened fire at him. The attack left him with a bloodied face as the former president said the bullet pierced his "upper part of right ear".</p>

<p>Donald Trump won formal nomination Monday as the Republican presidential candidate and picked 39-year-old Ohio Senator J.D. Vance as his running mate.</p>

<p>While Trump is increasingly confident of a shock return to the White House -- despite multiple legal problems and two impeachments during his first term -- President Joe Biden is reeling from weak polls and Democratic concerns over his health.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;Indian Americans and former presidential candidates Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy will address the Republican National Convention here.</p>

<p>Haley, the former governor of South Carolina and former US Ambassador to the United Nations, was a presidential candidate in the Republican primary and was the last one to suspend her campaign.</p>

<p>Millionaire entrepreneur-turned-politician Ramaswamy has seen a meteoric rise in the Republican party. He is now considered as one of the close confidant of the former president Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee.</p>

<p>This would be the first time that Ramaswamy would be speaking at the Republican National Convention, while Haley has addressed the RNC multiple times including in 2016, 2020.</p>

<p>Sources familiar with the RNC said that Ramaswamy is scheduled to speak first on Tuesday night in the 7:30-8:00 pm local time slot in the list of two other speakers. Haley has been placed third in the list of four speakers in the next slot of 8-8.30 pm local time.</p>

<p>The evening would conclude with remarks by Senator Marco Rubio and Lara Trump, the co-chair of the Republican National Committee.</p>

<p>Donald Trump is expected to make another appearance Tuesday night before and is expected to stay in the last one hour of the RNC events.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democratic Party Senator Bob Menendez, who headed the powerful US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has been convicted of acting as a "foreign agent" for Egypt, and of a slew of corruption charges.</p>

<p>After a trial that featured 13 gold bars and stacks of $480,000 in currency notes found in the New Jersey senator's home and a Mercedes Benz gifted to his wife, a jury gave the verdict on Tuesday at a federal court in New York.</p>

<p>Prosecutors said that Menendez had met with Egyptian intelligence officials and had tried to speed up millions of dollars of military aid to that country.</p>

<p>The conviction capped the 70-year-old senator's political career of 50 years, which saw the son of Cuban immigrants rise to leadership positions in the Senate where he has served for 18 years.</p>

<p>Chuck Schumer, the leader of the majority Democratic Party in the Senate demanded his immediate resignation, before his term ends on the last day of December.</p>

<p>Menendez is planning to run for re-election as an independent.</p>

<p>Protesting his innocence while leaving the courthouse, he said, "I've never been anything but a patriot of my country and for my country."</p>

<p>An appointee of President Joe Biden, the prosecutor, Damian Williams, said, "Now that the jury has convicted Bob Menendez, his years of selling his office to the highest bidder have finally come to an end."</p>

<p>Menendez was convicted on 16 charges that included wire fraud (using telecommunications for fraudulent activities), bribery, and extortion.</p>

<p>Two businessmen were also convicted of bribing him.</p>

<p>His second wife, Nadine Menendez, was charged in connection with the case but her trial has been delayed because she is undergoing treatment for cancer.</p>

<p>During Menendez's trial, lawyers tried to shift blame to his wife asserting that the gold bars found at their home were in her bedroom and were hers and that she had money problems that she hid from the senator while trying to amass assets.</p>

<p>But the prosecution countered that there were communications between them showing that he was in on the schemes.</p>

<p>In one melodramatic moment during the trial, Menendez's sister Caridad Gonzalez testified that as Cuban refugees it was tradition in the family to keep cash in their homes because of the insecurity they had faced.</p>

<p>One of the strange stories to emerge at the trial involved a businessman who bribed Menendez for getting a monopoly to certify as halal US beef exports to Egypt after the senator intervened on his behalf.</p>

<p>Menendez was also charged with using his power to try to get New Jersey prosecutors to scuttle an insurance fraud case against two businessmen, one of whom had admitted guilt on a bribery charge and said that he gave the Mercedes Benz to the senator's wife.</p>

<p>In another corruption case involving a member of Congress, Democratic Party Representative Henry Cuellar and his wife have been charged by the Justice Department in Texas with bribery and money laundering involving a Mexican bank and an Azerbaijan-controlled oil and gas company.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin has ordered an investigation after six foreign nationals were found dead at a hotel in downtown Bangkok.</p>

<p>Police have dismissed earlier reports that they were killed following a shooting.</p>

<p>Metropolitan Police Bureau Commissioner Thiti Saengsawang said the bodies of three men and three women were found in a single hotel room on Tuesday and the cause of the deaths has not been confirmed, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>

<p>He said initial investigations suggest that the incident may have been linked to poisoning, as suspicious substances were discovered in the hotel room and no signs of struggle were found at the scene.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Thavisin has ordered the investigation into the incident to "prevent any impact on the public".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India is a "strategic" ally, and the United States is looking forward to continuing to develop that partnership, the Pentagon has said.</p>

<p>Pentagon Press Secretary Pat Ryder made the remarks at a press conference in Washington on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"India is a strategic partner, and we look forward to continuing to develop that partnership," he told reporters in response to a question.</p>

<p>Responding to a question on Ukraine-Russia conflict, Ryder said, "When it comes to Ukraine and Russia's illegal occupation and invasion of Ukraine. Ultimately, at the end of the day, it's up to Ukraine to decide when they are ready to negotiate for peace." "Right now, our focus continues to be on working with Ukraine to provide them with what they need to defend their country and defend their sovereignty and take back territory. But at the end of the day, there's no decision about Ukraine without Ukraine," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Joe Biden promised Black voters on Tuesday that he was "all in" to seek reelection on Nov. 5 and assailed Donald Trump's record as president, in his first political speech since his Republican rival's attempted assassination.</p>

<p>Biden was greeted by chants of "four more years" as he spoke to the NAACP's annual convention in Las Vegas, a major gathering of Black voters.</p>

<p>Biden said he was grateful that Trump was not seriously hurt at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday but roundly criticized him on a variety of fronts including his handling of the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>"Let me say it again because Trump is lying like hell about it - Black unemployment hit a record low under the Biden-Harris administration," Biden said.</p>

<p>He scolded Trump for initially contending that former President Barack Obama was not an American citizen and for his reference to "Black jobs" at the Trump-Biden debate on June 27.</p>

<p>"I am all in," said Biden.</p>

<p>The attempt on Trump's life on Saturday prompted the Biden campaign to pull its television ads, call off verbal attacks on the former president and focus instead on a message of unity.</p>

<p>"Our politics got too heated," said Biden.</p>

<p>The campaign's strategy previously was to focus on tough criticism of Trump as a threat to U.S. democracy and to highlight his failure to admit his 2020 election loss and his felony convictions.</p>

<p>Now, it is trying to calibrate a less pugilistic message that still strikes a stark comparison between the two candidates.</p>

<p>The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the oldest and largest U.S. civil rights organization, represents a key constituency for the Democratic Party. While Black voters turned out heavily for Biden in 2020, polls have shown waning support for him from the constituency in this election.</p>

<p>"People are concerned about the price of gas, price of bread, but they're also concerned with their growing knowledge around Project 2025," Derrick Johnson, the NAACP president, told Reuters on Monday, referring to a set of conservative policy proposals that have become a lighting rod for Trump critics.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Biden used the formal setting of the White House Oval Office to ask Americans to lower the political temperature, recommit themselves to resolving their differences peacefully. He said the Nov. 5 presidential election will be a "time of testing."</p>

<p>In an interview with NBC News, Biden said on Monday it was a mistake for him to use the term "bullseye" in reference to Trump during a recent donor campaign call.</p>

<p>The president postponed a trip to Texas on Monday, where he was expected to speak on the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act at the Lyndon B. Johnson presidential library.</p>

<p>White House officials hope the Trump assassination attempt will ease pressure on Biden to step aside as his Democratic Party's candidate in response to concerns about his mental acuity and stamina to govern for another four-year term.</p>

<p>At the end of his remarks in Las Vegas, Biden addressed the criticism that he is too old for the job.</p>

<p>"Hopefully today I've demonstrated a little bit of wisdom. Here's what I do know. I know how to tell the truth. I know right from wrong. I know how to do this job. And I know the good Lord hasn't brought us this far to leave us now. We have more work to do," he said.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Biden is scheduled to speak to Latino leaders at the UnidosUS Annual Conference also in Las Vegas.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Trump and Republicans are gathered in Milwaukee for the party's nominating convention that kicked off Monday with the selection of U.S. Senator J.D. Vance as Trump's running mate.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Six people including four Pakistanis were killed and nearly 30 wounded in a shooting near a Shiite mosque in the Omani capital Muscat, officials said Tuesday, a rare attack in the country that was claimed by Islamic State.</p>

<p>Monday's mosque attack came as Shiites this week mark Ashura, an annual day of mourning that commemorates the seventh-century death in battle of Imam Hussein, regarded by the branch as the rightful successor to the Prophet Mohammed.</p>

<p>"The Royal Oman Police have responded to a shooting incident that occurred in the vicinity of a mosque in the Al-Wadi Al-Kabir area" of the capital, a police statement said.</p>

<p>The three gunmen behind the attack were killed and police officers have "concluded the procedures for dealing with the shooting," it added.</p>

<p>The force gave a toll of six killed, including a police officer. It said 28 people "from various nationalities" were wounded, including rescuers and paramedics.</p>

<p>The Islamic State jihadist group claimed the attack, saying three of its fighters were behind the shootings that targeted "Shiites practising their annual rituals" on the occasion of the holy mourning period of Ashura.</p>

<p>The group's propaganda channel Aamaq said on its Telegram channels that IS fighters "opened fire with machine guns on Shiite" worshippers, before clashing with Omani security forces.</p>

<p>The foreign ministry in Islamabad said at least "four Pakistanis were martyred as a result of gunshots in the dastardly terrorist attack on the Ali bin Abi Talib mosque."</p>

<p>Another 30 Pakistanis were wounded, it added.</p>

<p>One Indian was killed and another was wounded, India's embassy in Oman said on social media platform X.</p>

<p>Footage verified by AFP shows people fleeing the Imam Ali Mosque, its minaret visible, as gunshots ring out.</p>

<p>A voice can be heard saying "oh God" and repeating "oh Hussein".</p>

<p>Speaking to AFP, Pakistan's ambassador to Oman Imran Ali said the Shiite mosque was mostly frequented by south Asian expatriates. Oman is home to at least 400,000 Pakistanis, he said.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Terrorist attack' -</strong></p>

<p>Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said he was "deeply saddened by the terrorist attack".</p>

<p>In a statement on X, he said: "Pakistan stands in solidarity with the Sultanate of Oman and offers full assistance in the investigation."</p>

<p>Iran's foreign ministry spokesman, Nasser Kanani, condemned the shooting as a "divisive" act.</p>

<p>Pakistan's ambassador said the attack started with gunfire from a building adjacent to the mosque as hundreds of people gathered for prayers.</p>

<p>The worshippers were held "hostage" by militants before "they were later freed by Omani forces", Ali told AFP.</p>

<p>He said there was little information on the perpetrators or their possible motive.</p>

<p>"Everyone is being tight-lipped about this," he said, adding that the attack created a "difficult situation".</p>

<p>Earlier on Tuesday, Ali toured hospitals that were treating the wounded.</p>

<p>In a video message on X, he urged Pakistanis in Oman to cooperate with the authorities and avoid the area around the mosque.</p>

<p>"Our officers are on standby for emergency blood donations in the embassy," he said, adding that a hotline has been set up to assist the wounded and their relatives.</p>

<p>The American embassy in Muscat issued a security alert following the shooting and cancelled all visa appointments for Tuesday.</p>

<p>"US citizens should remain vigilant, monitor local news and heed directions of local authorities," it posted on X.</p>

<p><strong>- Investigations underway -</strong></p>

<p>Police said "all necessary security measures and procedures have been taken to handle the situation" following the attack.</p>

<p>"The authorities are continuing to gather evidence and conduct investigations to uncover the circumstances surrounding the incident," police added on X.</p>

<p>The area remained cordoned off on Tuesday, with journalists unable to access the mosque, an AFP photographer reported.</p>

<p>Oman has a population of more than four million, of whom upwards of 40 percent are expat workers, mostly from south Asia, according to government figures.</p>

<p>Shiites make up a small minority of Oman's overwhelmingly Muslim population. Most Omanis follow the Sunni or Ibadi branches of the faith.</p>

<p>Several attacks on Shiite mosques have roiled the Gulf in recent years, but this was the first in Oman.</p>

<p>A 2015 suicide attack on a Shiite mosque in Kuwait killed at least 27 worshippers and wounded more than 200. It was claimed by the Sunni extremist Islamic State group.</p>

<p>The same year, Saudi Arabia saw two attacks on Shiite mosques in the space of a week, with at least 25 people killed. The attacks were again claimed by IS, which regards Shiites as heretics.</p>

<p>In 2005, a former teacher opened fire inside a government building in Muscat, killing two people and wounding several others, before shooting himself.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A bus plummeted into a ravine in southern Peru Tuesday, killing at least 26 people, according to police in the Andean country plagued by deadly road accidents.</p>

<p>Another 14 people were injured in the early-morning crash, highway safety official Jhonny Valderrama told AFP, updating an earlier toll of 21 dead and 20 wounded.</p>

<p>The bus with more than 40 occupants was headed from Lima to the Andean region of Ayacucho when it veered off a cliff about 200 meters (656 feet) high.</p>

<p>Injured people, including the two co-drivers of the bus, were taken to hospitals as rescue teams worked to recover bodies from the wreckage in a hard-to-reach area.</p>

<p>Next-of-kin waited desperate for news outside the Mariscal Hospital in Ayacucho, where some of the injured were taken.</p>

<p>"We don't know if my brother is in the hospital or dead. All the roads are full of holes, the government does not do any maintenance," one of them, Juan Ayquipa, told RPP radio.</p>

<p>Accidents are frequent on Peru's often winding, mountainous roads due to speeding, poor road upkeep, a lack of traffic signs and lax enforcement of driving rules.</p>

<p>Last year, the country of 34 million people registered more than 3,100 deaths from more than 87,000 traffic accidents.</p>

<p>Seventeen people died in a similar bus crash on the same road in May.</p>

<p>"I would like to express my sincere condolences to the families who lost their loved ones," Transport Minister Raul Perez told reporters.</p>

<p>The cause of the latest accident has not been established.</p>

<p>Seventy percent of road accidents in Peru are due to human factors such as driver incompetence or fatigue, according to official data.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Secret Service increased security for Donald Trump weeks ago after authorities learned of an Iranian plot to kill him, although it was not linked to the recent attempt on his life, US media reported Tuesday.</p>

<p>CNN reported that US authorities received intelligence from a "human source" on a plan by Tehran targeting the former president, causing protection to be boosted for Trump. Other US outlets also reported the plot.</p>

<p>But it was not connected to the shooting at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in which gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks opened fire at Trump, leaving the Republican wounded and killing a rally attendee, they said.</p>

<p>The US National Security Council said it had been "tracking Iranian threats against former Trump administration officials for years" as Tehran sought revenge for the 2020 killing of Revolutionary Guards commander Qasem Soleimani.</p>

<p>"We consider this a national and homeland security matter of the highest priority," spokeswoman Adrienne Watson said in a statement.</p>

<p>The investigation into the Trump shooting on Saturday "has not identified ties between the shooter and any accomplice or co-conspirator, foreign or domestic," she added.</p>

<p>Watson referred questions on "additional measures that have been implemented in recent weeks" to the Secret Service and Department of Homeland Security.</p>

<p>Top Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said they and other agencies were "constantly receiving new potential threat information and taking action to adjust resources as needed."</p>

<p>"We cannot comment on any specific threat stream other than to say that the Secret Service takes threats seriously and responds accordingly," Guglielmi added in a statement.</p>

<p>There was no immediate reaction from the Department of Homeland Security.</p>

<p>The report comes as the Secret Service faces intense scrutiny over the Butler shooting, with questions over how a gunman was able to open fire at Trump from an exposed rooftop some 150 meters (500 feet) away.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden has ordered an independent review of the agency's handling of the incident.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk on Tuesday said he will move the headquarters of SpaceX and X to Texas after a California law blocked schools from forcing teachers to notify parents about changes to a student's gender identity.</p>

<p>"This is the final straw," Musk said on X.</p>

<p>"Because of this law and the many others that preceded it, attacking both families and companies, SpaceX will now move its HQ from Hawthorne, California, to Starbase, Texas."</p>

<p>The multi-billionaire also said that he is transferring X from its art-deco headquarters in San Francisco to Austin, a threat he has made before but never saw to completion.</p>

<p>Musk has already moved Tesla's headquarters from Palo Alto in Silicon Valley to Austin, Texas.</p>

<p>"I did make it clear to Governor Newsom about a year ago that laws of this nature would force families and companies to leave California to protect their children," Musk wrote.</p>

<p>Musk has expressed deep disdain about the use of preferred pronouns, often mocking the practice on social media and dismissing it as part of a "woke" agenda that was dangerous for society.</p>

<p>Governor Gavin Newsom on Monday signed the bill after a contentious legislative process that pitted a handful of school boards fighting for parental rights against LGBTQ activists concerned about the welfare of vulnerable students.</p>

<p>The law reversed decisions in conservative school districts that ordered teachers to notify parents if a student changed their name or pronouns or requested to use facilities or participate in programs that didn't match their official gender.</p>

<p>Newsom, who is seen as a potential alternative to President Joe Biden as candidate for the White House, has often exchanged fire with conservatives over gender issues at state schools.</p>

<p>Last year, he signed a law that sets fines for school districts that ban textbooks portraying LGBTQ people and other marginalized groups.</p>

<p>The latest law came after Newsom fought bitterly with a conservative school board over its opposition to the study of gay rights figure Harvey Milk, a San Francisco public official who was assassinated.</p>

<p>Musk has previously sparred with Newsom, who is a former San Francisco mayor, during the deadliest stages of the COVID-19 pandemic when he challenged the decisions of city and state health officials.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Americans fear their country is spiraling out of control following an assassination attempt on Donald Trump, with worries growing that the Nov. 5 election could spark more political violence, a Reuters/Ipsos poll that closed on Tuesday found.</p>

<p>The two-day poll found Republican presidential candidate Trump opening a marginal lead among registered voters - 43% to 41% - over Democratic U.S. President Joe Biden, an advantage that was within the poll's 3 percentage point margin of error, suggesting the attempt on Trump's life had not sparked a major shift in voter sentiment.</p>

<p>But 80% of voters - including similar shares of Democrats and Republicans - said they agreed with a statement that "the country is spiraling out of the control."&nbsp; The poll, which was conducted online, surveyed 1,202 U.S. adults nationwide, including 992 registered voters.</p>

<p>Trump narrowly avoided death on Saturday when a would-be assassin's bullet grazed his ear as he spoke at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. Blood trickled across his face and he defiantly pumped his fist in the air, mouthing the words "Fight! Fight! Fight!" as he was rushed offstage. A rally attendee was slain and two others seriously injured.</p>

<p>The shooting brought back memories of turbulent political periods such as the 1960s, when Democratic President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, followed by the killing of Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy in 1968.</p>

<p>Some 84% of voters in the poll said they were concerned that extremists will commit acts of violence after the election, an increase from the results of a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted in May that showed 74% of voters having that fear.</p>

<p>Fears of political violence became more prominent in America after thousands of Trump supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in a bid to overturn Trump's election loss to Biden. Four people died on the day of the attack, and one Capitol Police officer who fought against the rioters died the next day.</p>

<p>While Americans said they feared violence, few condoned it. Just 5% of respondents said it was acceptable for someone in their political party to commit violence to achieve a political goal, down from 12% in a Reuters/Ipsos poll from June 2023.</p>

<p>The attempt on Trump's life has dominated media headlines and fueled discussion among some of his conservative Christian supporters that he was protected by God.</p>

<p>In the Reuters/Ipsos poll, 65% of registered Republicans said Trump was "favored by divine providence or God's will." Eleven percent of Democrats agreed.</p>

<p>The United States stands out among rich nations for its embrace of religion, with evangelical Christians largely aligned with the Republican Party in recent decades. Some 77% of Americans surveyed in 2022 said they believed in God, compared to 56% of Canadians and 39% of British respondents, according to a poll by the Gallup International Association.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US has voiced "concern" over the Pakistan government's move to ban jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan's party and emphasised that Washington would continue to "monitor these decisions and further decisions by the courts".</p>

<p>In its latest attempt to suppress jailed former Prime Minister Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif-led federal government on Monday announced that it has decided to ban the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf and seek Article 6 proceedings against Imran Khan, 71, and ex-president Arif Alvi, 78, among others.</p>

<p>The government led by the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party also said Imran Khan's party illegally received foreign funds, involved in riots as well as "anti-state" activities.</p>

<p>US Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller during the daily briefing on Monday said: "Our understanding is that this is the beginning of what will be a complex political process." "Certainly banning a political concern is something -- or a political party is something that would be of great concern to us," Matthew Miller told reporters in Washington in response to questions.</p>

<p>Matthew Miller said the US supported "the peaceful upholding of constitutional and democratic principles, including respect for human rights and freedom of expression".</p>

<p>He said the US supported democratic processes such as the rule of law and equal justice under the law, adding that Washington would continue to "monitor these decisions and further decisions by the courts".</p>

<p>Matthew Miller also discussed political violence, given the recent attempt to assassinate Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, and said the US abhors "political violence in any country, including Pakistan, and have spoken out against it and condemned it".</p>

<p>Matthew Miller was responding to a question comparing the recent assassination bid on Trump with a similar attack on incarcerated former Prime Minister Imran Khan in November 2022.</p>

<p>"We support the rule of law in Pakistan and every country in the world, and we want to see respect for democratic principles and people's fundamental human rights and democratic rights upheld," he added.</p>

<p>The move to ban Imran Khan's party appeared to be the government's attempt to prevent the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf from becoming the single largest party in the national assembly as the announcement was made on the heels of relief given to the party by the Supreme Court in the reserved seats case as well as to the party chief in the Iddat case.</p>

<p>The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf last week got a major boost via the Supreme Court ruling declaring them eligible for reserved seats, depriving the ruling coalition of a two-thirds majority in the National Assembly.</p>

<p>The move drew a strong reaction from the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf which in return has also demanded invoking Article 6 of the Constitution against those who undertook the unconstitutional steps even though there is a Constitution in the country.</p>

<p>Besides the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, leaders from other parties including the Pakistan Peoples Party, Awami National Party, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam, and Jamaat-i-Islami have criticised the decision.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jurors found a powerful US senator guilty on all counts of corruption Tuesday after gold bars and hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash were found at his home, prosecutors said, sparking calls for his resignation.</p>

<p>Robert Menendez, a 70-year-old Democrat from New Jersey, was charged with extortion, obstruction of justice and accepting bribes to perform favors for businessmen with connections to Egypt and Qatar and will be sentenced on October 29.</p>

<p>"The total combined charges carry a maximum potential sentence of 222... years in prison," a spokesman for the Southern District of New York prosecutor's office said in a statement.</p>

<p>The counts on which Menendez was convicted by the jury after less than three days of deliberations included conspiracy to commit bribery, acting as a foreign agent while a public official, and obstruction of justice.</p>

<p>Menendez, who said in June he would run as an independent in November's election, is a career politician and led the influential Senate Foreign Relations Committee until the charges were filed. He remains a sitting senator.</p>

<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a fellow Democrat, called on Menendez to step down.</p>

<p><strong>Senator 'for sale'</strong></p>

<p>"In light of this guilty verdict, Senator Menendez must now do what is right for his constituents, the Senate, and our country, and resign," Schumer said.</p>

<p>Menendez shook his head from side to side as the verdict was read out, CNN reported.</p>

<p>Prosecutors have alleged Menendez put his power as a top US senator "up for sale."</p>

<p>In a raid on his New Jersey home, FBI agents were said to have found nearly $500,000 in cash hidden around the house, as well as gold bars worth around $150,000 and a luxury Mercedes-Benz convertible.</p>

<p>His wife Nadine Menendez, to whom defense lawyers are seeking to shift the blame, has also been charged but will be tried separately as she is receiving treatment for breast cancer.</p>

<p>He was convicted alongside two of the businessmen he allegedly helped -- Egyptian-American Wael Hana and Fred Daibes, a real estate developer.</p>

<p>A third businessman, insurance broker Jose Uribe, pleaded guilty to bribery charges in March and assisted investigators.</p>

<p>Menendez is said to have interfered in the nomination of New Jersey's prosecutor in a bid to ensure that proceedings were dropped against Daibes and Uribe.</p>

<p>He is also accused of accepting bribes to use his power and influence to enrich his co-conspirators and benefit the government of Egypt, including by helping Hana protect his monopoly on US exports of halal food products to the country.</p>

<p>Hana and Daibes face 85 years and 100 years imprisonment respectively, prosecutors said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A federal appeals court on Tuesday ruled a Minnesota law requiring a person to be at least 21 years old before obtaining a permit to carry a handgun in public for self-defense is unconstitutional.</p>

<p>The St. Louis-based 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with gun rights groups in finding the state's ban violated the rights of 18- to 20-year-olds under the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment to keep and bear arms.</p>

<p>U.S. Circuit Judge Duane Benton, writing for a panel of three judges all appointed by Republican presidents, held that under recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings that have expanded gun rights, the state's 2003 law could not be deemed valid.</p>

<p>"Importantly, the Second Amendment's plain text does not have an age limit," he wrote.</p>

<p>The panel upheld a lower-court judge's ruling last year in favor of the Second Amendment Foundation, the Firearms Policy Coalition and the Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus, gun rights groups which had sued alongside some of their members.</p>

<p>Gun rights groups have filed similar lawsuits challenging age-based restrictions on carrying firearms in other states, including in Georgia, Illinois and Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Benton cited a landmark 2022 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court's conservative majority called New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association v. Bruen that changed the landscape of firearms regulation.</p>

<p>That ruling established a new test for assessing firearms laws, saying restrictions must be "consistent with this nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation."</p>

<p>In June, the Supreme Court in an 8-1 decision in United States v. Rahimi clarified that standard when it upheld a federal ban on people under domestic violence restraining orders from having guns, saying a modern firearms restriction did not need a "historical twin" law.</p>

<p>Citing that decision, Benton said a regulation disarming people who pose a credible threat to others' physical safety could be upheld, but Minnesota had not established why 18- to 20-year-olds posed particular risks that justified its law.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, a Democrat whose office defended the law, did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Joe Biden hits the campaign trail Tuesday for the first time since the assassination attempt against Donald Trump, seeking a balance between criticizing his rival while heeding his own calls to cool down American politics.</p>

<p>As Trump rides a wave of support at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Democrat Biden -- who is trying to salvage his reelection bid -- is in Las Vegas to reach out to a key constituency of Black voters at the NAACP advocacy group.</p>

<p>The 81-year-old president will also record an interview with Black broadcaster BET, the latest in a series of one-on-ones as he works to ease concerns over his age and mental acuity following his dismal debate performance against Trump last month.</p>

<p>Amid calls for Americans to "lower the temperature" of politics in the wake of the attempt on Trump's life, Biden canceled a campaign trip to Texas on Monday but continued with his Nevada visit.</p>

<p>Biden narrowly won Nevada in his 2020 election victory over Trump.</p>

<p>The trip comes as Democrats push ahead with plans to rush through Biden's own nomination ahead of the party's conference in August, despite calls to postpone it while the party remains torn over his candidacy.</p>

<p>While the attempt on Trump's life has briefly silenced the drumbeat of Democrats who called on Biden to step aside, tensions are still bubbling beneath the surface as the president trails in the polls.</p>

<p>Biden's campaign insisted the virtual roll-call was necessary before the August 19 convention as Republican-led Ohio had moved its filing date to August 7, otherwise Biden risked not appearing on the ballot.</p>

<p><strong>'Play games'</strong></p>

<p>"There have been virtual roll calls in previous presidential elections" Democratic deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks told a press conference on the sidelines of the Republican gathering in Milwaukee.</p>

<p>"Ohio Republicans decided to play games... it is our obligation as a campaign to make sure that President Biden is on the ballot."</p>

<p>The move is however only likely to fuel questions about whether Biden can win a second term after a faltering showing at the debate where he mangled his words and lost his train of thought.</p>

<p>Biden, who says he "screwed up" due to jet lag and illness, forcefully defended his fitness for the job in a second major US network interview on Monday night.</p>

<p>"I'm old," Biden told NBC. "But I'm only three years older than Trump, number one. And number two, my mental acuity has been pretty damn good."</p>

<p>Biden also defended his rhetoric about Trump after Republicans accused him of stocking divisions ahead of the shooting in which the former president's ear was hit.</p>

<p>FBI investigators are still probing 20-year-old gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks' motivation for the attack on a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. A bystander was killed and Crooks was shot dead.</p>

<p>Biden admitted it was a "mistake" to tell donors in a call last week that it was "time to put Trump in the bullseye" of his election campaign.</p>

<p>But Biden doubled down on what he said was the need to "talk about the threat to democracy" posed by former president Trump.</p>

<p>Trump was impeached and faces criminal charges over the deadly January 6, 2021 assault on the US Capitol by supporters seeking to overturn his election loss to Biden.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed Tuesday to step up pressure on Hamas in war-torn Gaza, after the United States criticised the high civilian death count in recent attacks.</p>

<p>Netanyahu, in remarks during a state commemorative event, defended Israel's approach during the more than nine-month war, saying "Hamas is under pressure".</p>

<p>"They are under increasing pressure because we are hurting them, eliminating their top commanders and thousands of terrorists.</p>

<p>"They are under pressure because we are remaining firm in our demands, despite all the pressure," he added, in an apparent reference to a chorus of international concern over the death count in the war since Hamas's October 7 attacks.</p>

<p>"This is exactly the time to increase the pressure even more, to bring home all the hostages -- the living and the dead -- and to achieve all the war objectives," Netanyahu said.</p>

<p>His comments come as Israel has stepped up attacks on the besieged Palestinian territory, with Gazan rescuers saying three air strikes in one hour killed more than 40 people on Tuesday.</p>

<p>At the weekend, more than 90 people were killed in a huge Israeli bombing raid on a safe zone, an operation Netanyahu said was targeting the Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif and one of his deputies.</p>

<p>Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told the ceremony that Israel's military pressure "forces the leaders of the terrorist organisation still alive to only take care of their own survival.</p>

<p>"Without the capacity to command, control and lead, the Hamas organisation becomes a group of terrorist gangs without a direction or a future," Gallant said.</p>

<p>The Hamas October 7 attacks on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.</p>

<p>The operatives also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom are still in Gaza including 42 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's military offensive has killed at least 38,713 people, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the health ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

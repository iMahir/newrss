       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran launched a wave of missiles into Israel last evening to avenge the killing of top Hezbollah and Hamas leaders as the war in Middle East threatens to snowball into a larger regional conflict. Israelis scrambled for bomb shelters as sirens sounded across the nation and orange streaks lit up the night sky, showed visuals. Israel said they had intercepted most of the missiles and vowed to make Iran "pay" for the attack. Amid claims and counterclaims by Iran and Israel, it is hard to figure out how successful Tuesday's attacks were and whether Israel will launch an immediate retaliation.</p>

<p>Here are 5 points of what Israel and Iran said about Tuesday's attacks.</p>

<div class="CetSht_cn">
<ol class="CetSht_ol">
	<li class="CetSht_li">There were reports yesterday of up to 400 missiles being fired at Israel from Iran. But Iran confirmed this morning it had fired 200 missiles while&nbsp;Israel gave a count of 180. Sirens were sounded across the country and&nbsp;most of the missiles were intercepted by Israeli air defences or allied air forces before they reached their territory.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">State media footage showed Iranian missiles being launched at Israel. The missiles targeted "three military bases" around Tel Aviv and other bases, The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said, adding that 90% of those "hit their targets". Israel denied this claim and said only 20 missiles landed while the rest were intercepted.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Iran has claimed to have hit the headquarters of Mossad, Israel's premier intelligence agency. Israel, however, has denied it and said some missiles landed on an empty ground. A video showing a massive crater near the Mossad headquarters has emerged on the social media - probably due to a missile strike.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Iran said yesterday they used hypersonic Fattah missiles to target military facilities in Israel, which were successful. This claim was opposed by Israel as they claimed to have intercepted most of the missiles. Israel said the attacks resulted in only two injuries.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Iran warned it would carry out "crushing attacks" against Israel if it retaliates to the Iranian missile attack. But Israel termed the missile attack as the "biggest mistake by Iran" and vowed retaliation at a time and place of its choosing. "This attack will have consequences. We have plans, and we will operate at the place and time we decide," said IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari.</li>

       <description><![CDATA[Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) launched its second missile attack against Israel in less than six months, targeting military bases on Tuesday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) launched its second missile attack against Israel in less than six months, targeting military bases on Tuesday. Dubbed Operation True Promise II, this attack differed from Iran's earlier strike in April, showcasing a higher degree of technological sophistication and strategic ambition.</p>

<p>Iran deployed hypersonic missiles for the first time in this operation, marking a technological advancement over the older drones and ballistic missiles used in April's Operation True Promise. The IRGC claimed that 90 per cent of its missiles successfully hit their targets, despite Israel's advanced defence systems.</p>

<p>Unlike April's attack, which primarily targeted isolated military sites, this assault appeared to target more densely populated urban centres near Tel Aviv. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian framed the missile strikes as a proportional response to Israeli "aggression," warning Israel not to provoke further escalation.</p>

<p><strong>Key Differences Between April And October Attacks:</strong></p>

<p>Iran used hypersonic missiles for the first time in Operation True Promise II, marking a shift from the older technology drones and ballistic missiles used in the April attack. This latest attack involved a broader array of advanced weaponry.</p>

<p>In April, Iran targeted military bases in remote areas, while this time, urban centres near Tel Aviv were in the crosshairs. Iran claimed a 90 per cent success rate in hitting its targets in this latest attack, despite Israel's sophisticated defence systems, compared to the high interception rate of missiles in April.</p>

<p>One Palestinian man died after being hit by debris from an Iranian missile in West Bank. Despite no casualties reported on Israel's side, the proximity of the attack to populated areas signals that Israel's next response may be far more comprehensive and severe.</p>

<p>With Israeli citizens under direct threat, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to take a stronger stance than after the April attack, potentially heightening the conflict with Iran. Resistance groups across the Middle East praised Iran's operation, raising the potential for further involvement from Hezbollah, Hamas, and other allied factions in the region.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[In a recent speech, Donald Trump used the language of intelligence, or intellectual impairment, as a weapon against Kamala Harris. And he used similar language about Vice presidential candidate Tim Walz in a TV appearance.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="theconversation-article-title">In <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/09/28/trump-harris-attacks-mentally-impaired-criticism/">a recent speech</a>, Donald Trump used the language of intelligence, or intellectual impairment, as a weapon against Kamala Harris. And he used <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/01/us/walz-vance-vp-debate/d5878199-2d8d-5282-9922-47316fd56f9f?smid=url-share">similar language about Vice presidential candidate Tim Walz</a> in a TV appearance.</p>

<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>In a rally on Sept. 29, 2024, in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, <a href="https://www.wpr.org/news/trump-harris-mentally-disabled-wisconsin-speech-immigration">Trump told supporters</a> that “Joe Biden became mentally impaired. Kamala was born that way. She was born that way. And if you think about it, only a mentally disabled person could have allowed this to happen to our country.” He <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/donald-trump-calls-kamala-harris-mentally-impaired-erie-pennsylvania-rally/">made similar comments</a> at a rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, over the same weekend.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.aapd.com/ableist-trump-comments-september-24/">Disability rights advocates</a> were quick to point out that Trump's language is what is called “ableist,” meaning that it assumes people with disabilities are somehow less valuable than those without.</p>

<p>In an attempt to fire back, “Saturday Night Live” Weekend Update host Colin Jost <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2tOpMV6T0I">quipped </a>“I cannot</p>

<p>Special education classrooms are disproportionately filled with students of colour, <a href="https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED610548.pdf">most often diagnosed with behavioral disabilities</a>. These students often end up in the <a href="https://inclusivity.consulting/2017/12/08/school-prison-pipeline-intersection-race-disability/">school-to-prison pipeline</a>. These classrooms show how something as “simple” as an IQ test – something as innocuous as a label – can end up sentencing the country's children to lives of segregation and social oppression.</p>

<h3><strong>Not just Trump's words</strong></h3>

<p>Temperatures are running high during this presidential election. Yet Trump's words about Harris, while extraordinarily coarse and ugly for a presidential candidate, are often found among disparaging descriptions used by both sides. These phrases are part of a culture that uses measures of intelligence as a way to measure the worth of a human being.</p>

<p>Words are powerful: They can either, like the literature I teach, broaden perspectives of the world, or they can serve to reinforce limiting ideologies that perpetuate oppression.</p>

<p>Terms such as “low IQ,” “idiot” and “mentally impaired” have a traumatic history, one that many cognitively disabled, lower-class and minority people continue to live with today. I believe politicians and their constituents should understand the destructive history of these terms – and think twice before using words like these as an easy means to attack one another.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance has refused to acknowledge that Donald Trump lost the 2020 elections.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance has refused to acknowledge that Donald Trump lost the 2020 elections, as he evaded a direct reply on whether the former president would seek to challenge this year's election results even if these were certified in every state.</p>

<p>Senator Vance of Ohio came face to face with his Democratic rival Minnesota Governor Tim Walz on Tuesday in the only vice presidential debate of this election cycle.</p>

<p>The debate comes just over a month before the crucial US presidential elections when the country will choose between Democratic Presidential nominee Kamala Harris and Republican candidate Trump as the next leader.</p>

<p>In reference to the January 6, 2021 insurrection, Vance did not give a clear answer when asked if Trump would again challenge election results this year even if every governor certifies the results.</p>

<p>"Look, what President Trump has said is that there were problems in 2020, and my own belief is that we should fight about those issues, debate those issues peacefully in the public square. And that's all I've said, and that's all that Donald Trump has said," Vance said.</p>

<p>He added that Trump asked the protesters on January 6 to "protest peacefully", and the former president "left the White House" on January 20 when Joe Biden became president. "...now, of course, unfortunately, we have all of the negative policies that have come from the Harris-Biden administration," he said.</p>

<p>Trump has denied wrongdoing regarding the attack on the US Capitol in January 2021 in an attempt to overturn the 2020 election won by Biden, a Democrat. The Republican presidential candidate has repeatedly claimed that he won the 2020 elections.</p>

<p>During the debate, the Democratic vice presidential candidate Walz also questioned Vance about Trump losing the 2020 election, NBC News reported.</p>

<p>"Did he (Trump) lose the 2020 election?" Walz asked.</p>

<p>"Tim, I'm focused on the future," Vance was quoted as saying in the report.</p>

<p>Calling it a "non-answer", Walz said, "I'm pretty shocked by this. He lost the election. This is not a debate, it's not anything anywhere other than in Donald Trump's world." In the debate hosted by CBS News here, the two vice presidential candidates also sparred over issues ranging from immigration, gun policy, climate change, abortion and the economy.</p>

<p>Calling censorship a "threat" to democracy in the US, Vance alleged that Harris has engaged in it at an "industrial scale".</p>

<p>"She did it during Covid. She's done it over a number of other issues, and that, to me, is a much bigger threat to democracy than what Donald Trump said when he said the protesters should peacefully protest on January the sixth," he said.</p>

<p>On immigration, Walz referred to false claims by Vance about Haitian immigrants eating the pets of residents in Springfield, Ohio.</p>

<p>"There are consequences for this," Walz said. To this, Vance replied, "The people I care most about in Springfield are the American citizens." &nbsp;Vance added that because of an influx of migrants, "you've got schools that are overwhelmed, you've got hospitals that are overwhelmed, you've got housing that is totally unaffordable." On the issue of abortion, Walz was asked by the moderators to respond to an assertion from Trump that he supports abortion in the ninth month. "In Minnesota, what we did was restore Roe v. Wade," Walz said. "We made sure that we put women in charge of their health care." "The states will decide what's right for Texas might not be right for Washington. That's not how this works," Walz was quoted as saying by CNN.</p>

<p>"This is basic human rights. We have seen maternal mortality skyrocket in Texas (since its restrictions went into effect), outpacing many accounts in the world," he added.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Vance said Republicans need to "do so much better of a job at earning the American people's trust back on this issue, where they, frankly, just don't trust us."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[JD Vance is a politician, an author and a Marine veteran who has been serving as junior senator from Ohio.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Senator JD Vance and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz are readying for the big electoral battle in the United States that will choose the next Vice President of the country. One of them will be part of the long list of political leaders who have been the integral part of a President's administration. Democrat Walz and Republican Vance are reinforcing their running mates' messages to voters, just weeks before the November 5 election. While Mr Vance is Vice Presidential pick of Donald Trump, Mr Walz has been chosen by Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Here's a look at the life and political career of 2024 US election Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance:</p>

<p>Mr Vance is a politician, an author and a Marine veteran who has been serving as junior senator from Ohio. According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/J-D-Vance">Encyclopaedia Britannica</a>, he was born James Donald Bowman in Middletown, in the Rust Belt region of Ohio to Don and Bev Bowman who had Scottish ancestry.</p>

<p>James' parents divorced when he was young and his mother changed his middle name to David. He eventually took his mother's middle name Vance as his surname.</p>

<p>Mr Vance was raised mostly by his maternal grandparents as his mother struggle with drug and alcohol abuse disorders.</p>

<h3><strong>His military background</strong></h3>

<p>It has happened for the first time since 1996 that both political parties in the US have picked a veteran as Vice President nominee. Mr Vance enlisted in the United States Marine Corps after graduating from Middletown High School in 2003. He spent four years in USMC, including six-month deployment to Iraq.</p>

<p>After his military service, Mr Vance attended the Ohio State University where he received a bachelor's degree in political science and philosophy in 2009. He later studied in Yale University, earning a law degree in 2013.</p>

<h3><strong>National fame</strong></h3>

<p>Mr Vance gained national recognition with his memoir '<em>Hillbilly Elegy</em>', which was published in 2016. It became a bestseller and was later adapted into a Netflix movie. The book tells Mr Vance's personal story against the backdrop of his struggles.</p>

<p>The book carries an excerpt about how the Marine Corps taught Mr Vance adulthood. "The day I graduated from boot camp was the proudest of my life," he wrote in the book, as per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/30/nx-s1-5134005/vance-walz-veteran-election-2024-vice-president"><em>NPR</em></a>.</p>

<p>Mr Trump also wrote about the book on his Truth Social platform while announcing Mr Vance's name as his running mate. "JD's book, 'Hillbilly Elegy,' became a Major Best Seller and Movie, as it championed the hardworking men and women of our Country," said Mr Trump.</p>

<h3><strong>JD Vance's family</strong></h3>

<p>While studying at Yale, Mr Vance met Usha Chilukuri and they got married in 2014. Her parents moved to the US in the late 1970s and now teach engineering and molecular biology in San Diego.</p>

<p>While Usha Vance studied at Yale and Cambridge, her father and grandfather both taught or studied at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), India's premier engineering college. Her younger sister is a mechanical engineer with a semiconductor company in San Diego and an aunt a medical professional in the southern Indian city of Chennai.</p>

<p>In his memoir '<em>Hillbilly Elegy</em>', Mr Vance calls his wife a "supersmart daughter of Indian immigrants". The couple have three children.</p>

<h3><strong>JD Vance was once critical of Trump</strong></h3>

<p>In the lead-up to the 2016 US presidential election, Mr Vance was a bitter critic of Donald Trump. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y5g2k2yp3o">The <em>BBC</em></a> carried his two quotes about Mr Trump - "My god, what an idiot" and "I find him reprehensible" - that resurfaced in July. He had also compared Mr Trump to Hitler, as per a report in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/10/01/jd-vance-trump-americas-hitler-republican-vice-president/"><em>The Telegraph</em></a>.</p>

<p>But when Mr Trump narrowed his search and announced Mr Vance as his running mate in July this year, the Ohio native became one of his most ardent defenders.</p>

<p>By the time Mr Vance ran for Senate in 2022, his demonstrations of loyalty, which included downplaying the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol by Mr Trump's supporters, were sufficient to score the former president's coveted endorsement. Mr Trump's support helped put him over the top in a competitive primary.</p>

<h3><strong>Relationship with Donald Trump</strong></h3>

<p>Before Mr Vance developed a relationship with the former president, he grew close with Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, according to news agency Reuters. He attracted the attention of Mr Trump's son by opposing aid to Ukraine during the Ohio Senate primary in 2022.</p>

<p>In February 2023, Mr Trump and Mr Vance visited East Palestine, Ohio, the site of a toxic train derailment, a trip that raised Mr Vance's national profile.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, Mr Vance has helped convince wealthy donors to open their wallets to Mr Trump, Reuters said quoting people with knowledge of the Republican leader's fundraising operations. Mr Vance helped put together a Bay Area fundraiser in June hosted by venture capitalists David Sacks and Chamath Palihapitiya.</p>

<p>Vance's scepticism of corporate America, support for tariffs, weariness of foreign entanglements and his youth make him a leading voice of a new Republican Party that is more focused on the working class than big business in the eyes of supporters.</p>

<h3><strong>How the Vice President is elected in the US?</strong></h3>

<p>The Vice President is the second-highest office in the executive branch of the US government, after the President. According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/our-government/the-executive-branch/">White House</a>, the Vice President is elected along with the President by the Electoral College. Each elector casts one vote for President and another for Vice President. Before the ratification of the 12th Amendment in 1804, electors only voted for President, and the person who received the second greatest number of votes became Vice President.</p>

<p>The primary responsibility of the Vice President of the United States is to be ready at a moment's notice to assume the Presidency if the President is unable to perform his or her duties. This can be because of the President's death, resignation, or temporary incapacitation, or if the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet judge that the President is no longer able to discharge the duties of the presidency.</p>

<p>The Vice President also serves as the President of the United States Senate, where he or she casts the deciding vote in the case of a tie.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's Iron Dome air defence system has intercepted thousands of rockets since it went into operation in 2011, providing the country with crucial cover during times of conflict.</p>

<p>It has been heavily relied upon to protect military and civilian sites from frequent barrages of rockets fired from Gaza and Lebanon in the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas.</p>

<p>Israel's air defences were in operation on Tuesday night when Iran fired missiles at Israel in what it said was a response to Israel's killing of Tehran-backed militant leaders.</p>

<p>Israel's military chief Herzi Halevi said Tuesday that the Iranian barrage had been blunted partly by "a very strong aerial defence array".</p>

<p>The system had also intercepted more than 200 drones and missiles launched by Iran on April 13.</p>

<p>Israel initially developed the Iron Dome alone after the 2006 Lebanon War and was later joined by the United States, which has provided its defence know-how and billions of dollars in financial support for the program.</p>

<p>The system has an interception rate of around 90 per cent, according to Israeli defence firm Rafael, which helped design it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here's how it works:</p>

<h3><strong>Three-part system</strong></h3>

<p>The Iron Dome is one part of Israel's multi-tiered missile defence systems and is designed to intercept short-range rockets at a distance of up to 70 kilometres (43 miles).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each Iron Dome battery is made up of three main sections: a radar detection system, a computer to calculate the incoming rocket's trajectory, and a launcher that fires interceptors if the rocket is deemed likely to hit a built-up or strategic area.</p>

<p>It sits alongside other missile defence systems like the Arrow, which counters ballistic missiles, and David's Sling, for medium-range rocket or missile attacks.</p>

<h3><strong>How much does it cost?</strong></h3>

<p>Each Iron Dome interceptor costs $40,000 to $50,000 to produce, according to the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The think tank estimated that a complete system, including the radar, computer and three to four launchers -- each containing up to 20 interceptors -- costs around $100 million to produce.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Israel has 10 such systems in operation, according to Raytheon, which helps manufacture the Iron Dome. Other estimates have put the figure slightly higher.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Bipartisan US support</strong></h3>

<p>The Iron Dome is one of the strategic pillars of the US-Israeli alliance that has been followed by successive Democratic and Republican administrations.</p>

<p>In August 2019 the US Army signed a contract to purchase two Iron Dome batteries to enhance its own short-range missile defence capabilities.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on Tuesday that India is "very much" concerned at the possibility of broadening of the conflict in the Middle East.</p>

<p>Speaking at the conversation at the Carnegie Endowment in the US, he called Hamas' attack on Israel a "terrorist attack," and added that Israel had a need to respond and added that India believes that any response by any country has to take into account international humanitarian law.</p>

<p>Asked about the escalating violence in the Middle East and India's approach towards Israel's policy and wider conflict possibilities, Mr Jaishankar said, " If one looks at the current situation, I think it would be right to start off with October 7th. We regard October 7th as a terrorist attack. We understand that Israel had a need to respond, but we also believe that any response by any country has to take into account international humanitarian law, that it must be careful about any damage or any implications for civilian populations. And that given what has happened in Gaza, it is important to have some kind of international humanitarian effort out there."</p>

<p>"And we are very much concerned at the possibility of a broadening of the conflict, not just what happened in Lebanon, but also, you know, I referred earlier to the Houthis and the Red Sea, and, you know, to some extent, everything that happens between Iran and Israel. So again, it's one thing to be concerned. I'm sure you can say that for a lot of countries. If as part of that concern, we can end up doing something about it, you know, then don't underestimate the importance of communication in difficult times. If there are things to be said and passed on and passed back, I think those are all contributions that we can make and we do," he added.</p>

<p>Notably, India has backed a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict. PM Narendra Modi was one of the first global leaders to condemn the terror attack on Israel by Hamas on October 7.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, India has repeatedly expressed concerns over the deteriorating situation in Gaza.</p>

<p>In October last year, Israel launched a counter-offensive against Hamas after hundreds of Hamas terrorists burst into Israeli borders, killing over 1200 people and taking over 250 hostages, out of which 100 continue to be in captivity.</p>

<p>The war has spiralled into the region lately, with Houthi rebels in Yemen also targeting Israel and other countries in the Red Sea. Israel has also continued striking Hezbollah in Lebanon. As the conflict heads towards escalation, all major countries have called for a ceasefire and hostage deal, while also stressing for a two-state solution as a means to achieve durable and sustainable peace in the region.</p>

<p>In a major escalation in the raging conflict in the Middle East, Iran on Tuesday launched a missile attack on Israel on Tuesday. In a statement, the IDF said all Israeli civilians are in bomb shelters as rockets from Iran are fired at Israel.</p>

<p>Hezbollah is upset that the IDF exposed their plans to massacre Israelis, so they decided to target innocent civilians by firing a barrage of rockets, the IDF further said.</p>

<p>102 missiles have been launched towards Israel, according to the Jerusalem Post. Sirens continue to sound across Israel amid the attack, the Times of Israel reported. According to the IDF, around 10 million civilians are the targets of Iranian projectiles. Iran's state media has also confirmed the Iranian attack towards Israel.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Australian man has been charged with distributing the encrypted messaging app known as "Ghost", allegedly used by criminals across the globe to arrange drug deals and violence, police said Wednesday.</p>

<p>The Ghost app was marketed to underworld figures as "unhackable" and used by hundreds of suspected criminals from Europe, the Middle East, Australia and Asia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was allegedly designed by a 32-year-old Australian computer whiz living with his parents in suburban Sydney.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Australian Federal Police said Wednesday they had arrested a 47-year-old man "alleged to be a distributor" of the app.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Encrypted phones were pre-loaded with Ghost before the man stashed them at "dead drops", or pre-arranged hiding places for collection, police said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Global policing authorities managed to infiltrate the network, watching as criminals discussed illicit drug trafficking, money laundering, homicides and serious violence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Police swooped in September, arresting criminals from Italy, Ireland, Sweden, Canada and Australia -- including Jay Je Yoon Jung, the alleged "mastermind".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ghost, a kind of WhatsApp for criminals, was created nine years ago and could only be accessed via modified smartphones that sold for about US $1,590.</p>

<p>French police traced the creator's location to Australia and joined forces with local police to target the platform.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Several thousand people worldwide used Ghost and around 1,000 messages were exchanged on it every day, according to Europol.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There were 376 phones with the Ghost app installed in Australia alone.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran fired a salvo of ballistic missiles at Israel on Tuesday in retaliation for Israel's campaign against Tehran's Hezbollah allies in Lebanon, drawing on an array of weapons that has long worried the West.</p>

<p>The attack came five months after a strike in April that was the first ever direct Iranian strike on Israel.</p>

<p>Ballistic missiles are an important part of the arsenal at Tehran's disposal. According to the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Iran is armed with the largest number of ballistic missiles in the region.</p>

<p>Here are some details:</p>

<p>The semi-official Iranian news outlet ISNA published a graphic in April showing nine Iranian missiles it said could reach Israel. These included the 'Sejil', capable of flying at more than 17,000 km (10,500 miles) per hour and with a range of 2,500 km (1,550 miles), the 'Kheibar' with a range of 2,000 km (1,240 miles), and the 'Haj Qasem', which has a range of 1,400 km (870 miles), ISNA said.</p>

<p>The Arms Control Association, a Washington-based non-governmental organization, says Iran's ballistic missiles include 'Shahab-1', with an estimated range of 300 km (190 miles); the 'Zolfaghar', with 700 km (435 miles); 'Shahab-3', with 800-1,000 km (500 to 620 miles); 'Emad-1', a missile under development with a range up to 2,000 km (1,240 miles) and 'Sejil', under development, with 1,500-2,500 km (930 to 1,550 miles).</p>

<p>Fabian Hinz, a Berlin-based expert on Iran's missile arsenal with the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said that based on the locations of videos of launches posted on social media and the ranges to Israel, he assessed that Iran fired a combination of solid- and liquid-fueled missiles.</p>

<p>The former category of missile, which is more advanced, is fired from angled mobile launchers and the latter from vertical launchers, he said.</p>

<p>He said three solid-propellent missiles fired on Tuesday could be the 'Haj Qasem', 'Kheibar Shekan' and 'Fattah 1'. Liquid propellant missiles reported as being launched from Isfahan might potentially be the 'Emad', 'Badr' and 'Khorramshahr', he said.</p>

<p>Iran says its ballistic missiles are an important deterrent and retaliatory force against the U.S., Israel and other potential regional targets. It denies seeking nuclear weapons. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>According to a 2023 report by Behnam Ben Taleblu, a Senior Fellow at the U.S.-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies, Iran continues to develop underground missile depots complete with transport and firing systems, and subterranean missile production and storage centers. In June 2020, Iran fired its first ever ballistic missile from underground, it said.</p>

<p>"Years of reverse-engineering missiles and producing various missile classes have also taught Iran about stretching airframes and building them with lighter composite materials to increase missile range," the report said.</p>

<p>In June 2023, Iran presented what officials described as its first domestically made hypersonic ballistic missile, the official IRNA news agency reported. Hypersonic missiles can fly at least five times faster than the speed of sound and on a complex trajectory, which makes them difficult to intercept.</p>

<p>The Arms Control Association says Iran's missile programme is largely based on North Korean and Russian designs and has benefited from Chinese assistance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Iran also has cruise missiles such as Kh-55, an air-launched nuclear-capable weapon with a range up to 3,000 km (1,860 miles), and the advanced anti-ship missile the Khalid Farzh, with about 300 km (186 miles), capable of carrying a 1,000-kg (1.1-ton) warhead.</p>

<p><strong>Regional Attacks</strong></p>

<p>Iran's Revolutionary Guards used missiles in January 2024 when they said they attacked the spy headquarters of Israel in Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan region, and said they fired at Islamic State militants in Syria. Iran also announced firing missiles at two bases of a Baluchi militant group in neighbouring Pakistan. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia and the U.S. have said they believe Iran was behind a drone and missile attack on Saudi Arabia's prized oil facilities in 2019. Tehran denied the allegation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2020, Iran launched missile attacks on U.S.-led forces in Iraq, including the al-Asad air base, in retaliation for a U.S. drone strike on an Iranian commander.</p>

<p><strong>Backing For Yemen's Houthis</strong></p>

<p>The United States accuses Iran of arming the Houthis of Yemen, who have been firing on Red Sea shipping and Israel itself during the Gaza war, in a campaign they say is aimed at supporting the Palestinians. Tehran denies arming the Houthis.</p>

<p>On Sept. 24, Reuters reported Iran had brokered secret talks between Russia and the Houthis to transfer anti-ship missiles to the armed group, citing Western and regional sources.</p>

<p>In 2022, the Houthis said they fired ballistic missiles and drones at the United Arab Emirates. This included a missile attack targeting a base hosting the U.S. military in the UAE, which was thwarted by U.S.-built Patriot interceptor missiles.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Support For Hezbollah</strong></p>

<p>Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah group has said it has the ability within Lebanon to convert thousands of rockets into precision missiles and to produce drones. Last year, the late Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said the group was able to transform standard rockets into precision missiles with the cooperation of Iranian experts.</p>

<p><strong>Syria</strong></p>

<p>Iran has transferred indigenous precision-guided missiles to Syria to support President Bashar al-Assad's fight against rebels, according to Israeli and Western intelligence officials.</p>

<p>It has moved some production capacity to underground compounds in Syria, where Assad's military and other pro-Tehran forces have learned to build their own missiles, those sources say.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The much-anticipated annular solar eclipse is set to grace the skies on October 2. The eclipse will begin at 9:13 pm IST on October 2 and conclude at 3:17 pm IST the next day. During this time, the Moon will appear smaller than the Sun, creating a brilliant <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/ring-of-fire-solar-eclipse-2024-check-timing-visibility-in-india-and-other-details-6671693 ">“ring of fire”</a> effect – a halo of sunlight visible around the darkened centre.</p>

<p><strong>How fast the eclipse will travel</strong></p>

<p>During the upcoming annular solar eclipse, the speed of the Moon's shadow across Earth will vary significantly depending on location. In some areas, it will travel faster than 10 million kmph, while in others, it will slow to about 2,057 kmph, roughly the speed of a fighter jet, reported <a href="https://www.space.com/how-fast-will-the-annular-solar-eclipse-october-2-travel ">Space.com</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Path of the eclipse</strong></p>

<p>The Moon's shadow will move from northwest to southeast, and due to Earth's curvature and the Moon's changing distance and orbital speed, the shadow's velocity will fluctuate dramatically across different regions. The eclipse will start with an eclipsed sunrise, peak at midday and end with an eclipsed sunset.</p>

<p><strong>Where the eclipse will touch and leave Earth</strong></p>

<p>The Moon's shadow will first strike south of Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean, moving at 8.55 million kmph. When it leaves Earth near the island of South Georgia, it will travel at 10 million km/h. However, these extreme speeds occur as the shadow touches and leaves Earth, rendering them less meaningful.</p>

<p><strong>Where can you view the eclipse?</strong></p>

<p>The shadow's speed will be slower when the eclipse is visible at the horizon, around 8,258 kmph at sunrise and 14,312 kmph at sunset. The slowest speed of 2,057 kmph will be observed in the Pacific Ocean northwest of Easter Island, where the ‘ring of fire' will last for 7 minutes and 25 seconds. This slower speed is due to the Moon's shadow being nearly perpendicular to Earth at local midday – the longest duration of the eclipse.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's missile offensive against Israel was a "terrible mistake" and Tel Aviv has its greatest opportunity in 50 years to change the face of the Middle East, former Israel Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has said.&nbsp;In a post on X after Tehran fired 108 ballistic missiles targeting Israel last night, the former Prime Minister said Israel must act now and destroy Iran's nuclear programme and energy facilities.</p>

<p>"Israel has now its greatest opportunity in 50 years, to change the face of the Middle East. The leadership of Iran, which used to be good at chess, made a terrible mistake this evening. We must act *now* to destroy Iran's nuclear program, its central energy facilities, and to fatally cripple this terrorist regime," Mr Bennett wrote.</p>

<p>A former commando in Israel's elite Sayeret Matkal unit, Mr Bennett leads the New Right party and served as Prime Minister from June 2021 to June 2022. He succeeded Benjamin Netanyahu after he was ousted as Prime Minister in 2021.</p>

<p>Mr Bennett described Iran as the head of the octopus of terror. "To strike the head of the octopus of terror, that, in its cowardice, sent its tentacles (Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, etc.) to murder us, while the Ayatollahs sat safely in their palaces in Tehran. The octopus's tentacles are temporarily paralysed - now comes the head. We must remove this terrible threat to our children's future," he said in the post. "We can grant the Iranian people an opportunity to rise up and shake off the regime that tyrannizes its women and daughters," the former Prime Minister added.</p>

<p>Iran's missile offensive against Israel followed the killing of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Israeli military operations. While Tel Aviv's advanced defence systems intercepted many of the missiles launched by Tehran, many others landed. There have been no casualties in Israel though.</p>

<p>The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said the attack was "in accordance with the United Nations Charter" and followed "a period of restraint" following an "attack on the sovereignty" of Iran -- a reference to the killing of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in late July. The IRGC said the missiles targeted "three military bases" around Tel Aviv as well as air and radar bases.</p>

<p>Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Iran made a "big mistake" and warned that it "will pay for it".</p>

<p>In his post on X, Mr Bennett said, "We have the justification. We have the tools. Now that Hezbollah and Hamas are paralyzed, Iran stands exposed. Over this last terrible year, Iranian tentacles murdered our families. Raped our daughters. Kidnapped our children. Ransacked our towns. Burned our fields. Fired on our ships. Terrorized children in Kiryat Shmona, Kfar Aza, and Sderot. Emptied out whole regions of our land. Humiliated us."</p>

<p>"Now is the moment. A Nation of Lions has united and proven its strength over the last year. It has yearned for a change, for action, for so very long. There are times when history knocks at our door, and we must open it. This opportunity must not be missed," the former Prime Minister added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Playing a monotonous sound stimulates the activity of a fungus that promotes plant growth, a study suggested on Wednesday, raising the potential that playing music could be good for crops and gardens.</p>

<p>Whether or not blasting Mozart could help plants grow has long been a matter of scientific debate. The US TV show "MythBusters" even tested it out, finding that plants exposed to death metal and classical music grew a little better than those left in silence, but deeming the results inconclusive.</p>

<p>However, with the plant world facing a raft of human-driven challenges -- including erosion, deforestation, pollution and a burgeoning extinction crisis -- the future of the world's biodiversity and crops are increasingly feared to be under threat.</p>

<p>According to a new study in the journal Biology Letters, "the role of acoustic stimulation in fostering ecosystem recovery and sustainable food systems remains under-explored".</p>

<p>Based on previous work that exposed E. coli bacteria to sound waves, the team of Australian researchers set out to assess the effect sound has on the growth rate and spore production of the fungus Trichoderma harzianum.</p>

<p>This fungus is often used in organic farming for its ability to protect plants from pathogens, improve nutrients in the soil and promote growth.</p>

<p>The researchers built little sound booths to house Petri dishes full of fungi.</p>

<p>Instead of pop bangers, they were played "Tinnitus Flosser Masker at 8 kHz". This was the audio from one of many white noise videos on YouTube which are intended to relieve tinnitus or help babies fall asleep.</p>

<p>"Think of the sound of an old-school radio in between channels," lead study author Jake Robinson of Flinders University told AFP.</p>

<p>"We chose this monotone for controlled, experimental reasons, but it might be that a more diverse or natural soundscape is better," he said.</p>

<p>"This needs further research."</p>

<h3><strong>Sound garden&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The petri dishes were played with this sound at a level of 80 decibels for half an hour a day.</p>

<p>After five days, the growth and spore production were higher in the fungi that were played the sound, compared to those that sat in silence.</p>

<p>While far from definitive, the researchers suggested some potential reasons this could happen.</p>

<p>The acoustic wave could be converted into a fungi-stimulating electrical charge under what is known as the piezoelectric effect.</p>

<p>Another theory involves tiny receptors on the membranes of the fungi called mechanoreceptors.</p>

<p>These are comparable to the thousands of mechanoreceptors on human skin that play a role in our sense of touch -- which involves reacting to pressure or vibration.</p>

<p>"It might be that sound waves stimulate these mechanoreceptors in the fungi, which then trigger a cascade of biochemical events that lead to genes being switched on or off -- for instance, the kind of genes responsible for growth," Robinson said.</p>

<p>"Our preliminary research suggests the fungi respond to the sound, but we don't know yet if this benefits the plants. So, this is the next step," he added.</p>

<p>"Can we influence soil or plant microbial communities as a whole? Can we speed up the soil restoration process by stimulating the earth with natural soundscapes? What impact might this have on the soil fauna?" he asked.</p>

<p>"There are many important questions to keep us busy."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, said on Tuesday that Iran was a "dangerous" and "destabilizing" force in the Middle East and Washington was committed to Israel's security.</p>

<h2><strong>Why It's Important</strong></h2>

<p>The comments from Harris, who faces Republican former President Donald Trump in the November 5 US election, came hours after Iran fired ballistic missiles at Israel in retaliation for Israel's military campaign in Lebanon, drawing vows of a sharp response from Israel and the US.</p>

<p>No injuries were reported in Israel and Washington called Iran's attack ineffective.</p>

<h2><strong>Key Quotes</strong></h2>

<p>"I'm clear-eyed Iran is a destabilizing, dangerous force in the Middle East," Harris said. "I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself against Iran and Iran-backed terrorist militias."</p>

<p>"I fully support President (Joe) Biden's order for the U.S. military to shoot down Iranian missiles targeting Israel," Harris said. "Initial indications are that Israel, with our assistance, was able to defeat this attack."</p>

<p>Harris added that Washington will work with its allies to disrupt what she called Iran's "aggressive behavior."</p>

<h2><strong>Context</strong></h2>

<p>Israel has escalated its military campaign in Lebanon in recent days, killing hundreds and displacing more than a million due to operations that Israel says are targeting Lebanese Iran-backed Hezbollah operatives.</p>

<p>Israel's military campaign in Lebanon is in addition to its war in Gaza that followed a deadly October 7 attack on Israel by Palestinian Hamas operatives. Israeli's military assault on Gaza has killed tens of thousands according to Palestinian health authorities, displaced nearly everyone there, caused a hunger crisis and prompted genocide allegations that Israel denies.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran on Tuesday fired 200 missiles, including hypersonic weapons, at Israel as tensions in the Middle East reach breaking point. Israel has vowed that Iran <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-iran-lebanon-hezbollah-after-irans-missile-attack-on-israel-us-severe-consequences-warning-6696958">will "pay" for the attack</a>. But relations between the two countries were not always sour. Unthinkable as it may sound, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/iran-missile-strike-israel-video-massive-crater-near-mossad-hq-after-irans-big-missile-offensive-6697549#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll">Israel and Iran</a> had collaborated, with help from the United States, to fight a common enemy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the 1960s, both Israel and Iran found a mutual adversary in Iraq. While <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-as-israel-begins-ground-invasion-of-lebanon-lessons-from-1982-2006-wars-6690081">Israel</a> was locked in a broader struggle against hostile Arab regimes, Iran, under the Shah, viewed Iraq's leadership as a direct threat to its security and regional ambitions. This laid the groundwork for one of the most secretive partnerships of the era, involving the Mossad - Israel's intelligence agency - and SAVAK - Iran's secret police - both of which played key roles in bolstering Kurdish insurgents against the central Iraqi regime. These Kurdish groups, seen as the Achilles' heel of Iraq's Arab nationalist leadership, were crucial to undermining the Iraqi government from within.</p>

<p>The cooperation between Israel and Iran reached new heights with the formation of a trilateral intelligence alliance code-named Trident, which also included Turkey. Beginning in 1958, Trident saw these three non-Arab powers exchange critical intelligence and engage in joint counterintelligence operations. As the relationship matured, Israel and Iran became even closer, forming deep military and intelligence ties that extended well into the Shah's reign.</p>

<h2><strong>The Shah's Ambitions And Israel's Influence</strong></h2>

<p>The Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, was driven not only by shared geopolitical interests but by a belief in Israel's influence in Washington. The Shah saw Israel as a potential means for enhancing relations with the United States, especially after the Kennedy administration voiced concerns about his authoritarian rule.</p>

<p>The burgeoning Israeli-Iranian relationship became a key feature of Iran's strategy to align itself with the West, resulting in the establishment of a permanent Israeli delegation in Tehran by the mid-1960s, which functioned as a de facto embassy.</p>

</div>

<p>However, the relationship was not without complications. The Shah, aware of the widespread anti-Israeli sentiment across the Arab world, carefully managed the public face of Iran's relationship with Israel. While he became more critical of Israel after the 1967 Six-Day War, his strategic interests continued to outweigh ideological or diplomatic positions.</p>

<h2><strong>Cooperation In The Shadows</strong></h2>

<p>The 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran drastically changed the country's political landscape, transforming it into an anti-Israel Islamic Republic. Yet, even after Ayatollah Khomeini's rise to power, the new regime found itself quietly collaborating with Israel, driven once again by common enemies. As the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988) dragged on, both countries recognised the advantage of working together against Saddam Hussein's Iraq.</p>

<p>Israel, too, saw an opportunity in aiding Iran. In particular, it viewed Saddam Hussein's Iraq as a more immediate and dangerous threat to its security, given Baghdad's ambitions for regional dominance and its pursuit of nuclear capabilities. Iraq's formidable military, supplied by both the United States and the Soviet Union, posed a risk, and Israel's shipment of arms to Iran - particularly after Prime Minister Menachem Begin approved the sale of military equipment in 1980 - was a calculated decision to undermine Iraq's strength.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="sraeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin (L) chats to Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat at his home where the ministers discussed events in Iran in 1979." id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/bkf3719g_menachem-begin-anwar-al-sadat-getty_625x300_02_October_24.jpg" title="sraeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin (L) chats to Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat at his home where the ministers discussed events in Iran in 1979." /></div>

<p>These covert arms deals were conducted despite US policy that barred military support for Iran until the release of American hostages held in Tehran. In exchange for Israeli military aid, Khomeini's regime allowed a significant number of Iranian Jews to emigrate to Israel or the United States, a concession that underscored the pragmatic nature of the relationship.</p>

<h2><strong>The Iran-Contra Affair</strong></h2>

<p>By the mid-1980s, Iran's need for military support reached a critical point. The Iran-Iraq War had drained the country's resources, and its economy was teetering on the brink of collapse. It was against this backdrop that the Iran-Contra affair unfolded - a secretive, high-stakes operation involving arms sales facilitated by Israel, with the backing of senior Ronald Reagan administration officials, to secure the release of American hostages held by Iran-sponsored Hezbollah in Lebanon.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Algerias President Houri Boumedienne, (center), is flanked by Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlevi of Iran, (left), and Iraqs Saddam Hussein, (right) in 1975." id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/g0a54tko_iran-shah-saddam-hussain-getty-_625x300_02_October_24.jpg" title="Algerias President Houri Boumedienne, (center), is flanked by Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlevi of Iran, (left), and Iraqs Saddam Hussein, (right) in 1975." /></div>

</div>

<p>For Israel, these arms deals were lucrative and strategically valuable, further enhancing its role as a clandestine ally of Iran in its war against Iraq. Iran, desperate for arms and resources, was willing to engage with both Israel and the United States, even as it continued to publicly vilify Israel.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>The Secret Missile Project: Operation Flower</strong></h2>

<p>The Israeli-Iranian partnership extended beyond conventional arms deals. One of the most ambitious projects was Operation Flower, a secret multibillion-dollar initiative that began in 1977 under the Shah's regime. The project involved the modification of surface-to-surface missiles, potentially capable of being fitted with nuclear warheads, for sale to Iran. However, the nuclear aspect of the project was not pursued.</p>

<p>As part of the deal, Iran made a substantial down payment in 1978 by sending $260 million worth of oil to Israel, a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/01/world/documents-detail-israeli-missile-deal-with-the-shah.html" name="no outbound">New York Times report</a> from 1986 claimed. Work on the missile program continued until the Islamic Revolution in 1979, after which Khomeini's regime abruptly halted the collaboration.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Spare Tyres For F-4 Fighter Jets</strong></h2>

<p>Israel covertly supplied Iran with 250 spare tyres for American-made F-4 fighter jets in October 1980, as Iran waged war against Iraq, according to a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/22/world/israel-is-said-to-have-sold-iran-f-4-tires.html" name="no outbound">New York Times report</a> from 1981.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After Saddam Hussein's invasion of Iran in September 1980, Israel found itself in an unusual position. The Israeli sale of 250 retreaded tires, valued at around $300,000, was a secretive transaction aimed at bolstering Iran's air force. The F-4 Phantom jets, a key component of Iran's military, had been grounded due to wear and tear. With no immediate access to parts due to the embargo placed by the US on Iran, Israel stepped in to fill the gap. According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/22/world/isreael-aide-traces-us-iran-dealings.html" name="no outbound">New York Times</a>, retreaded tyres were produced in Israel and then covertly transported to France, where they were flown to Iran on chartered planes.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="The Shah of Iran, in St. Louis to discuss buying F-4 Phantom jets built by McDonnel Douglas aircraft company." id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/ndgove7o_iran-shah-f4-jets-getty-_625x300_02_October_24.jpg" title="The Shah of Iran, in St. Louis to discuss buying F-4 Phantom jets built by McDonnel Douglas aircraft company." /></div>

</div>

<p>The transaction occurred during a delicate period for US-Iran relations, with 52 American diplomats still held hostage in Tehran. The Jimmy Carter administration, keen to secure their release, urged Israel to suspend further military deals with Iran until the hostages were freed. According to officials involved, Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin agreed to American pressure and paused all military dealings, despite Israeli strategic interests in preventing an Iraqi victory in the war.</p>

<p>Beyond regional power politics, Israel had a more personal concern: the fate of the Jewish population in Iran. At the time, approximately 60,000 Jews lived in Iran, and there were growing fears in Israel that they could become targets of repression or persecution under the new regime. Maintaining some form of back-channel communication with Iran was seen as a way to protect these Jewish communities.</p>

<h2><strong>Hostility And Rivalry&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>By the 1990s, the era of cooperation between Israel and Iran had all but evaporated. The geopolitical factors that had once united them -Arab socialism, Soviet influence, and the threat of Iraq - had disappeared, leaving little incentive for continued collaboration. Iran, now firmly under the control of its revolutionary government, embraced an anti-Israel ideology, supporting groups like Hezbollah and Hamas in their conflicts with the Jewish state.</p>

<p>By the early 2000s, the election of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, whose Holocaust denial and aggressive rhetoric against Israel stoked tensions further, cemented Iran as Israel's most prominent adversary in the region. As Israel fought wars with Hezbollah in 2006 and Hamas in 2008, Iranian support for these non-state actors - collectively termed the '<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-hamas-palestine-gaza-explained-axis-of-resistance-and-irans-proxy-network-across-middle-east-4534061">Axis Of Resistance</a>' - became a central concern in Israel's strategic calculations.</p>

<h2><strong>2024 And Threat Of All-Out War</strong></h2>

<p>Ties between Iran and Israel are now non-existent. The two Middle Eastern countries are now on the brink of all-out war, evidenced by Israel's multi-frontal conflict against Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Houthis in Yemen. All three of these armed militant groups are part of Iran's 'Axis Of Resistance'.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US vice-presidential debates traditionally have little effect on the White House race, but with Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris neck-and-neck, the stakes were higher than usual in New York on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Trump's running mate JD Vance and Harris's VP pick Tim Walz both scored points in what is expected to be their only <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-elections-2024-us-veep-candidates-take-on-middle-east-crisis-in-pre-election-debate-6696960">showdown</a>, although the primary goal was always to avoid harming their running mates' chances.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here are five takeaways from the debate.</p>

<h3><strong>New faces</strong></h3>

<p>Walz, who was virtually unknown on the national stage before the summer, had set expectations low -- comparing Vance's academic record as a "Yale law guy" and is own humble status as a "public school teacher."&nbsp;</p>

<p>He had a shaky start but improved as he relaxed into the conversation. Famously affable, Walz tried to weave in the occasional folksy anecdote but he often came across as defensive, dropping his trademark Midwestern charm.</p>

<p>Vance, who is known for his rhetorical prowess, was under pressure to make up for Trump's dismal debate performance last month, when he was soundly beaten by Harris.</p>

<p>Trump had missed chances to attack Harris on immigration and inflation -- failing to frame her as an incumbent -- but Vance was able to score points where his boss failed.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/tim-walz-jd-vance-shake-hands-before-us-vice-presidential-debate-starts-6696928">Both candidates</a> tackled policy specifics -- the Middle East, climate change, the economy or the fentanyl crisis -- which made for a more wonkish debate than the Trump-Harris showdown.</p>

<h3><strong>Awkward&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Walz was forced to explain claims that he was in Hong Kong for a teaching position in 1989 during the deadly Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests.</p>

<p>"I got there that summer and misspoke on this," the governor said calling himself a "knucklehead" who "will get caught up in the rhetoric."</p>

<p>Vance, who labelled Trump as "unfit for our nation's highest office" before becoming a supporter and once said Trump "could be America's Hitler" -- was challenged on his remarks.</p>

<p>He said he had been deceived by false stories in the media and was wrong.</p>

<h3><strong>A proxy battle&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The real contest was between Harris and Trump, with their two stand-ins focusing their sharpest attacks on the top-of-the-ticket contest.</p>

<p>The Minnesota governor went after Trump for ignoring the advice of scientists and economists.</p>

<p>"If you're going to be president, you don't have all the answers. Donald Trump believes he does," he said.</p>

<p>He attacked Trump for bragging about avoiding taxes, and for urging Republicans to vote against a tough bipartisan border security bill.</p>

<p>Vance tore into Harris on <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/why-the-vance-walz-debate-boils-down-to-contrasting-versions-of-masculinity-6683266">immigration</a> and accused her of driving up prices, particularly housing costs, by allowing millions of migrants into the country.</p>

<h3><strong>Fact checks, mic cuts&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Debate fact-checking has made for an unusual controversy during this election cycle.</p>

<p>CBS said it would decline to debunk whoppers live on air but instead directed viewers to a blog offering real-time fact-checking.</p>

<p>There were a couple of on-air fact-checks of Vance -- including one on man-made climate change and another on the legal status of some migrants.</p>

<p>This infuriated Vance, who began pushing back. The candidates' mics were both muted briefly as they launched into a rare heated back-and-forth.</p>

<h3><strong>A gentler tone&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>But, without the bombastic ex-president, proceedings largely resembled election debates that used to take place before the Trump era: policy-focused, lacking personal attacks and cloaked in apparent civility.</p>

<p>There was even a tender, human moment when Walz related a shocking story about his 17-year-old son Gus witnessing a shooting in a community centre.</p>

<p>Vance made a point of turning to Walz to sympathize with him.</p>

<p>The candidates brought up their families on more than one occasion, with Vance talking about his "three beautiful little kids."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Walz and Vance shook hands at the start, and again end of the debate as their wives joined them on stage.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the 180-odd ballistic missiles Iran fired last night landed near the Tel Aviv headquarters of Israeli intelligence service Mossad. A video that has emerged on social media shows a massive crater near the Mossad headquarters after Tehran's missile offensive.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-lebanon-war-hezbollah-10-1-24-intl-hnk/index.html">CNN geolocated the video</a> and found it was shot from a high-rise apartment building in Herzliya, less than 3 kilometers from Mossad headquarters.</p>

<p>The video shows the huge crater in what appears to be a parking lot. The missile strike threw up dust and several vehicles parked nearby were covered in soil. This crater is a few hundred metres away from a cinema complex.</p>

<p>Air raid sirens rang through Israeli cities and about 10 million rushed to take refuge in bomb shelters last when after Iran launched a barrage of missiles.</p>

<p>The Israel Defense Forces have said most of the missiles were intercepted by the country's advanced defence systems Iron Dome and Arrow. But some penetrated the shield, leading to minor damage.</p>

<p>The missile offensive was in retaliation to the killing of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Israeli military strikes.</p>

<p>Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Iran made a "big mistake" and warned that it "will pay for it".</p>

<p>Guy Nir, spokesperson for the Israeli embassy in India, told NDTV that Tehran would get an appropriate response. "If he (Iran leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei) plans to initiate a full-scale war with Israel, it will be a mistake for them (Iran). Israel's response is going to be strategic and pin-pointed, and not a full-scale war. I don't think any side wants that."</p>

<p>Iran's Ambassador to India Iraj Elahi has warned that Tehran will strike Israel again if it doesn't de-escalate tensions. "If the Hitler of our time (Netanyahu) stops his brutality and hostility, his country won't have to face the consequences," Mr Elahi told NDTV.</p>

<p>Israel's all-weather ally US has warned Iran, saying that the missile strike marked a "significant escalation". National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan pledged that the US would stand by Israel and support any retaliatory measures.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Texas man was put to death by lethal injection on Tuesday evening for the murders of teenage twin sisters, prison officials said, the sixth death row inmate to be executed in the United States in the past 12 days.</p>

<p>Before he was put to death in the state penitentiary in the city of Huntsville, Garcia White, 61, apologized to his victims' family. He was pronounced dead at 6:56 pm local time.</p>

<p>A former high school football star, White was convicted in 1996 of stabbing Annette and Bernette Edwards to death in December 1989.</p>

<p>According to court and prison records, White killed the mother, Bonita Edwards, of the 16-year-old girls following an argument at their Houston home and then murdered the two sisters.</p>

<p>White was not tried for the death of Bonita Edwards or for two other murders he confessed to committing, one in 1989 and another in 1995.</p>

<p>White's lawyers had filed a last-minute request for a stay of execution with the US Supreme Court, arguing that he was intellectually disabled and therefore not eligible for the death penalty.</p>

<p>"I would like to apologize for all the wrong I have done, and for pain I've caused to the Edwards family," White said before the execution, the Texas Department of Criminal Justice said in a statement. "I regret, I apologize, and I pray that you can find peace."</p>

<p>Texas has carried out four executions this year at the state penitentiary in Huntsville and another inmate, Robert Roberson, 57, is scheduled to be put to death on October 17, despite questions about his guilt.</p>

<p>Lawmakers in Texas, medical experts and the best-selling novelist John Grisham are among those seeking to halt the execution of Roberson, who was convicted of the 2002 death of his two-year-old daughter Nikki.</p>

<p>Roberson, who is autistic, took the girl to a hospital with severe head trauma and the child died the next day.</p>

<p>Roberson's lawyers and advocates have argued that the diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome, made at the hospital where the child died, was erroneous.</p>

<p>In a letter to Texas officials, 34 doctors said the cause of death was in fact severe pneumonia, aggravated by the little girl being prescribed the wrong medication.</p>

<p>Roberson's autism, which was not diagnosed until 2018, was misconstrued at the time as showing indifference to the death of the toddler and this perception weighed heavily in his conviction, according to his lawyers.</p>

<p>Four executions were carried out in the United States last week and one the week before, bringing the total this year to 18.</p>

<p>The death penalty has been abolished in 23 of the 50 US states, while six others -- Arizona, California, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Tennessee -- have moratoriums in place.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Brazilian judge on Tuesday ordered the unblocking of the bank accounts of Elon Musk's X in the country after the social media platform agreed to pay more than $5 million in fines. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The ruling by Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes paves the way for the suspension of X to be lifted in Brazil, where it has been off-limits to users since August 31 in a standoff over disinformation between the judge and Musk.</p>

<p>Moraes ordered X shut down in Latin America's biggest country after Musk refused to remove dozens of right-wing accounts and then failed to name a new legal representative in the country as ordered. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In his latest decision, the judge ordered Brazil's central bank to unblock X's bank accounts so it can receive transfers and "immediately make payment of the fines indicated."&nbsp;</p>

<p>X had informed the court it would pay fines to the tune of some $5.2 million, according to the ruling.&nbsp;</p>

<p>High-profile judge Moraes has been engaged in a long feud with Tesla and SpaceX owner Musk as part of his drive to crack down on disinformation in Brazil. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The clash between the Brazilian court and the billionaire has morphed into a high-stakes tussle testing the limits of both freedom of expression and corporate responsibility in South America's largest country.&nbsp;</p>

<p>X had more than 22 million users in Brazil before the ban, which was put into place on August 31. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The company has in the last week started complying with the Brazilian court's conditions to get reactivated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Musk has repeatedly hit out at Moraes in social media posts, calling him an "evil dictator" and dubbing him "Voldemort" after the villain from the "Harry Potter" series. &nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump are hurtling toward their November election showdown, one of the closest contests in modern American history.</p>

<p>And in the handful of critical states framing the 2024 race, there is little daylight between the rivals with barely a month before Election Day on November 5.</p>

<p>Under the US Constitution, America's founding fathers established that each of the 50 states would hold its own vote for president.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then, under the complex Electoral College system, each state has a certain number of "electors," based on population. Most states have a winner-take-all system that awards all electors to whoever wins the popular vote.</p>

<p>With candidates needing 270 of the 538 electors to win, elections tend to be decided in the hotly contested "swing states" with a history of alternating between Republican and Democratic candidates.</p>

<p>This year, there are seven such battlegrounds, and virtually everyone is a toss-up. Here is a look:</p>

<h3><strong>Pennsylvania (19 Electoral College votes)</strong></h3>

<p>Pennsylvania was once reliably Democratic, but these days, they don't come much tighter than the Keystone State.</p>

<p>Republican Trump won the most populous battleground, with 13 million residents, by 0.7 percentage points in 2016. Joe Biden claimed it by 1.2 percentage points in 2020.</p>

<p>Known for its "Rust Belt" cities like Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania has been blighted for decades by the steady decline of its industrial manufacturing base.</p>

<p>Trump and Harris have campaigned repeatedly in the eastern state. Trump, who survived an assassination attempt at a July rally there, is courting the rural white population and warning that migrants are overwhelming small towns.</p>

<p>Harris is touting recent infrastructure wins, and in Pittsburgh, she outlined plans to invest $100 billion in manufacturing, a key issue for state residents.</p>

<h3><strong>Georgia (16)</strong></h3>

<p>This southeastern state was an election flashpoint at the end of Trump's first term, and the controversy simmers.</p>

<p>Prosecutors in Georgia indicted Trump in an election interference case after he called state officials urging them to "find" enough votes to overturn Biden's narrow 2020 victory.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But in a boost for Trump, the case is paused until after the election.</p>

<p>Biden was the first Democrat to win the Peach State since 1992. Demographic changes are likely to benefit Harris, who has courted minority voters across Georgia.</p>

<h3><strong>North Carolina (16)&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The southeastern state has voted Democratic only once since 1980, but Harris believes it's back in play.</p>

<p>The population, now over 10 million, is expanding and growing more diverse, benefiting Democrats.</p>

<p>Complicating matters for Trump, a scandal involving the state's Republican gubernatorial candidate has infuriated party officials who worry it could sink Trump in a close race.</p>

<p>As in neighbouring Georgia, one wild card is how the devastation from storm Helene, which recently laid waste to towns in western North Carolina, might impact the vote.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Michigan (15)</strong></h3>

<p>Trump flipped Michigan, a former Democratic stronghold, on his way to defeating Hillary Clinton in 2016.</p>

<p>Biden returned it to the blue column in 2020, buoyed by unionized workers and a large Black community.</p>

<p>But this time, Harris risks losing the support of a 200,000-strong Arab-American community that has denounced Biden's -- and by extension her -- handling of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.</p>

<h3><strong>Arizona (11)</strong></h3>

<p>The Grand Canyon state was among 2020's tightest races, with Biden triumphing by just 10,457 votes.</p>

<p>Trump hopes frustrations over the Biden-Harris administration's immigration policy will swing Arizona, which shares a border with Mexico, back in his favour.</p>

<p>Harris visited Arizona's border last week vowing to crack down on migration and work on reviving last year's bipartisan border bill, which she said Trump "tanked" for political purposes.</p>

<p>Of the battlegrounds, Arizona is showing the largest poll advantage: Trump up by two percentage points.</p>

<h3><strong>Wisconsin (10)</strong></h3>

<p>Clinton lost Wisconsin after giving the state a wide berth during the 2016 campaign.</p>

<p>As with Midwestern neighbour Michigan, it was a different story when Trump's opponent was Biden, who turned a 23,000-vote deficit into a winning margin of 21,000 for Democrats.</p>

<p>Trump considers it winnable, and his party held its summer national convention there.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While Trump led early against Biden, Harris has a tiny polling edge.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The two candidates for US president offer starkly different visions of the world, with November's election carrying the potential to dramatically change policy toward Ukraine and other partners.</p>

<p>Vice President Kamala Harris largely offers continuity with President Joe Biden, though she has sought more nuance on the Middle East in particular, while a return of Donald Trump would likely mean a sharp rupture from current US foreign policy.</p>

<h3><strong>Ukraine&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Few issues divide the two candidates as much as Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump has scoffed at the billions of dollars in US aid to Ukraine, saying that Russia, which invaded its smaller neighbour in February 2022, is destined to win.</p>

<p>The Republican has in the past voiced admiration for Russian strongman Vladimir Putin, comments seized upon by Harris, who in their September debate said, "If Donald Trump were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now."</p>

<p>Harris has promised to keep up support for Ukraine, while Trump's aides have suggested leveraging US assistance to force Ukraine into territorial concessions to end the war quickly.</p>

<p>Trump has also mocked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as the "greatest salesman" in a jab at his lobbying for US military aid, although the two recently had a cordial meeting.</p>

<h3><strong>Middle East</strong></h3>

<p>Harris and Trump are both solidly pro-Israel but they diverge on how far to pressure the US ally as war spreads in the Middle East.</p>

<p>Harris, like Biden, has made clear she will keep arming Israel, distancing herself from calls from the left of their Democratic Party for an arms embargo for the sake of sparing civilians.</p>

<p>But Harris has also called for Palestinian "self-determination" and said she will "not be silent" on the suffering in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>Trump's Republican base is staunchly pro-Israel and he has repeatedly attacked Biden's record as a failure, including on Tuesday as Iran fired missiles in response to Israel's killings of top Hezbollah militants and Iranian commanders in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Trump as president took a series of landmark actions on Israel's behalf, including moving the US embassy to flash point Jerusalem and giving Arab nations incentives to recognize Israel.</p>

<p>But he also has a complicated history with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whom he criticized for joining other world leaders in recognizing that Biden won the 2020 US election -- an outcome that Trump refused to accept despite overwhelming evidence.</p>

<h3><strong>China and Taiwan&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Policymakers of both US political parties have spoken of China as the top long-term challenger, though they differ on rhetoric and approach.</p>

<p>Trump has relentlessly attacked China in his stump speeches and has vowed to impose massive tariffs on Chinese goods, hoping to boost manufacturing at home. But despite his public statements, he has also indicated he is open to deal-making with President Xi Jinping.</p>

<p>Biden has in some ways gone further than Trump, including by imposing a sweeping ban on high-tech chip exports.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Harris has highlighted Trump's reluctance while he was in office to take similar measures, charging that he "basically sold us out," with China's military benefiting from US technology.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in Taiwan, the self-ruling democracy claimed by Beijing, Trump has caused jitters by suggesting that it pay for its defence, likening the United States to an insurance company.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Harris, as vice president, has pledged to maintain the status quo, stating that "we support Taiwan's self-defence, consistent with our longstanding policy."</p>

<h3><strong>US allies&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>In a sharp break from previous presidents of both parties, Trump has questioned the utility of NATO, the collective defence alliance formed at the start of the Cold War.</p>

<p>Trump even said in February he would encourage the Russians to do "whatever the hell they want" to NATO allies that do not pay more on defence.</p>

<p>Harris has frequently pointed to Trump's remarks as she promises, like Biden, to work with allies and stand by NATO.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump in his first term showed he was ready to break with international agreements he does not like, including the Iran nuclear deal.</p>

<p>He would also be expected to champion tough US pressure against leftist leaders in Latin America, particularly Cuba and Venezuela, although neither Biden nor Harris has deviated sharply from his approach.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

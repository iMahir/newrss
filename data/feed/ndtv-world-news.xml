       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a bizarre incident near the Thailand-Myanmar border, a Chinese man was trapped in an abandoned well for three days. Villagers had heard strange cries coming from a nearby forest, but mistook them for ghostly sounds, according to Thai media reports. It wasn't until police dispatched rescue personnel to the forest that they heard a voice responding to their calls. The crew located the source of the voice and found 22-year-old Liu Chuanyi at the bottom of a 12-metre-deep well, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/asia/china/thailand-chinese-tourist-abandoned-well-rescue-b2658630.html">Independent</a></em> reported.&nbsp;The rescue operation lasted 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr Chuanyi was found in a weakened state and had sustained serious injuries, including a fractured wrist, cerebral concussion, and bruises, after being trapped without food or water for three days and nights. He was rescued and taken to the hospital for medical attention.</p>

<p>According to Mr Chuanyi, he strategically shouted for help once every hour, conserving his energy during his three-day ordeal. Meanwhile, nearby villagers reported hearing strange cries, which they attributed to paranormal activity. As a result, they avoided venturing outside after dark and didn't investigate the noise further.</p>

<p>Authorities believe that Mr. Liu accidentally fell into the well while attempting to navigate his way out of the forest. The circumstances surrounding Mr Liu's presence at the Thailand-Myanmar border remain a mystery, and authorities have reached out to the immigration department to investigate how he ended up in the area. In the meantime, local authorities are taking proactive measures to prevent similar incidents by sealing the well with a cover, ensuring the area is safer for everyone.</p>

<p>The incident has sparked widespread attention on Chinese social media, with many users sharing and discussing the harrowing story.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One user wrote, "A Chinese man shouting for help in the middle of nowhere? Of course, the locals can't understand the language and might think it was a wizard uttering spells."</p>

<p>Another commented, "Kudos to his strength and stamina. Struggling for three days and nights but still yelling; this guy is truly impressive."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[France is facing a critical moment as lawmakers vote on a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Michel Barnier's government. This vote is likely to have significant implications for the country's political and economic stability.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol class="CetSht_ol">
	<li class="CetSht_li"><big><strong>No-Confidence Vote:</strong></big> French Prime Minister Michel Barnier faces a critical no-confidence vote on Wednesday, just three months after his appointment.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li"><big><strong>Reason For The Vote:</strong></big> Barnier's budget bill sought to slow down France's deficit through tax rises and spending cuts. The budget remained unacceptable to the opposition but he used a special procedure - Article 49.3 to push it. "I don't think French people will forgive us for choosing party interests over the future of the country," he told MPs while clarifying the reasons for his decisions.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li"><big><strong>Chances Of Survival:</strong></big> Despite Barnier's optimism, opposition parties on the left and right are expected to unite and remove him from office. When asked if there was a chance his government could survive the vote, Barnier replied, "I want this and it is possible. I think it is possible that there is this reflex of responsibility where beyond political differences, divergences, the normal contradictions in a democracy we tell ourselves that there is a higher interest."</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li"><big><strong>Political Instability:</strong></big> France has been experiencing political uncertainty since summer elections produced a divided parliament, and Barnier's ousting could increase pressure on President Emmanuel Macron.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li"><big><strong>Consequences:</strong></big> If Barnier loses the vote, he will remain caretaker prime minister until Macron announces a new government, a process that could take weeks. However, Barnier stressed how important it is to maintain government continuity especially considering France's current economic challenges.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li"><strong><big>Historic Significance:</big></strong> Barnier is expected to become the shortest-lived prime minister in France's Fifth Republic and it would be the first successful no-confidence vote since Georges Pompidou's government in 1962 when Charles de Gaulle was the president.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li"><big><strong>Macron's Next Move:</strong></big> Macron has reportedly begun considering his pick for the next prime minister, but the process could take weeks. Besides that, he has no plans to resign and has made clear that he would "honour [the trust of the French people]... until the very last second of my term to serve the country."</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li"><big><strong>Impact on the French Economy:</strong></big> Political instability could impact the French economy in many ways now since the European Union pressures France to reduce its debt. If he is voted out of office, there will be no budget for 2025 and emergency measures will be taken to keep the country solvent.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealth's insurance unit, was fatally shot in the chest on Wednesday morning outside the Hilton hotel in midtown Manhattan, the NY Post and Bloomberg reported, citing police sources.</p>

<p>UnitedHealth did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company canceled the remainder of an investor event in Manhattan that had just kicked off.</p>

<p>"We're dealing with a very serious medical situation with one of our team members, and as a result, I'm afraid we're going to have to bring to a close the event today," UnitedHealth CEO Andrew Witty said.</p>

<p>The NYPD deputy commissioner's office said a man was shot in front of the Hilton, located at 1335 6th Avenue in the Midtown North Precinct. He was brought to Mount Sinai West Hospital less than a mile away in critical condition, and was later pronounced dead, the NYPD said.</p>

<p>Investigators told CNN that the gunman was waiting in the area for some time before Thompson's arrival. Reuters has not independently verified that information.</p>

<p>There are no arrests at this time, and the investigation is active and ongoing. The identification of the victim is pending proper family notification, the department said.</p>

<p>Brian Thompson was named UnitedHealthcare CEO in April 2021, and started at the company in 2004, working in several departments, according to the company's web site.</p>

<p>UnitedHealthcare is a unit of UnitedHealth Group.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[According to The New Yorker, Hegseth in an inebriated condition, chanted "Kill All Muslims! Kill All Muslims!" at a Veterans group event in 2015.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President-elect Donald Trump is reportedly considering replacing Pete Hegseth with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for the Pentagon's head, reports the Wall Street Journal, amid reports and doubts about his current nominee's personal life.</p>

<p>His views on certain issues may raise concerns. For instance, Hegseth opposes women serving in combat roles, arguing it lowers military standards and effectiveness. "Women shouldn't be in combat at all. They're life-givers, not life-takers. I know a lot of wonderful soldiers, female soldiers, who have served, who are great. But they shouldn't be in my infantry battalion," he told Ben Shapiro, a conservative political commentator in an interview.</p>

<p>He supports troops accused or convicted of war crimes and has advocated for their pardon. He also wants to fire senior officers who support "woke policies".</p>

<p>There has been increasing disquiet and scrutiny surrounding Hegseth's sexual assault allegations and drunken public behavior among senators.</p>

<p>Regardless, Hegseth posted this on X.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I'm doing this for the warfighters, not the warmongers.<br />
<br />
The Left is afraid of disrupters and change agents. They are afraid of <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@realDonaldTrump</a>—and me. So they smear w/ fake, anonymous sources &amp; BS stories. They don't want truth.<br />
<br />
Our warriors never back down, &amp; neither will I. <a href="https://t.co/nDQ5aUlv7i">pic.twitter.com/nDQ5aUlv7i</a></p>
— Pete Hegseth (@PeteHegseth) <a href="https://twitter.com/PeteHegseth/status/1864289115149127942?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>Not only this but a general sense of misconduct allegations have also been floating for the former Fox News anchor.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/pete-hegseths-secret-history" rel="noindex,nofollow">The New Yorker</a>, Hegseth in an inebriated condition, chanted "Kill All Muslims! Kill All Muslims!" at a Veterans group event in 2015.</p>

<p>However, his attorney Tim Parlatore said, "We're not going to comment on outlandish claims laundered through The New Yorker by a petty and jealous disgruntled former associate of Mr. Hegseth's. Get back to us when you try your first attempt at actual journalism", in response to the allegations by The New Yorker.</p>

<p>In addition to his alleged Islamophobic comments, he has also been shadowed by a secret financial settlement to a woman who accused him of rape in 2017, although he dismissed the claims citing the incident as consensual.</p>

<p>Two veteran non-profit groups - Veterans for Freedom and Concerned Veterans for America have further accused him of multiple allegations including financial mismanagement, sexual impropriety and personal misconduct. He was forced to step down from the organisation because of these concerns.</p>

<p>Hegseth's former colleague at Fox News said, "He had a kind of what-happens-in-Vegas-stays-in-Vegas kind of attitude, while his wife and kids were in Minnesota. He was a huge drinker. I can't say if he had a problem, but he was very handsy with women, too. I've certainly seen him drunk."</p>

<p>With the allegations surfacing with the whistleblower report, Senate Republicans are not comfortable supporting his bid as the leader of the Pentagon.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Volodymyr Zelensky called on Tuesday for major reinforcement of sectors in eastern Ukraine of the 1,000-km (600-mile) front line, where Russian forces have made consistent gains in recent months.</p>

<p>Zelensky issued his appeal as Russia's Defence Ministry said its troops had captured two new front-line villages -- one in Donetsk region, the main focus of the 33-month-old war, the other further south in Zaporizhzhia region.</p>

<p>The president was speaking in his nightly video address after a discussion with Ukraine's top commander, Oleksandr Syrskyi. He said much depended on Ukraine's Western allies providing vital weaponry in a timely manner.</p>

<p>"The Donetsk directions require significant reinforcement. This particularly involves the supply of weapons from our partners," Zelenskiy said.</p>

<p>"It's a direct relationship: The greater our army's firepower and technological capabilities, the more we can destroy Russia's offensive potential and protect the lives of our soldiers."</p>

<p>The key, he said, was to boost Ukraine's long-range capabilities, partly by boosting domestic weapons production.</p>

<p>The United States, the biggest supplier of military aid to Ukraine, announced its latest military aid package on Monday, valued at some $725 million. But Ukraine is concerned about the continued flow of weapons under President-elect Donald Trump, who has pledged to put a quick end to the war.</p>

<p>Analysts and war bloggers say that Russian forces in the east are advancing at the fastest rate since the early days of the February 2022 invasion.</p>

<p>Russia's Defence Ministry said its forces had captured the village of Romanivka, south of the embattled town of Kurakhove in Donetsk region. It also said Moscow's forces took control of Novodarivka, just over the border in Zaporizhzhia region.</p>

<p>The Ukrainian military's general staff said Russian forces had launched 38 attacks near Kurakhove, but made no mention of Romanivka. It said nothing about Novodarivka falling into Russian hands, but mentioned the village as one of the areas coming under Russian attack.</p>

<p>Zelenskiy, in a post on his Telegram account, quoted commander Syrskyi as saying conditions were difficult around Kurakhove and Pokrovsk, another target of Russian advances farther north.</p>

<p>But he also spoke of "quite good" results in defending Zaporizhzhia region.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Hypertrichosis, commonly referred to as "Werewolf Syndrome," is a rare condition characterized by excessive hair growth in unusual areas of the body.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A recent report from the Navarra Pharmacovigilance Center in Spain has revealed a shocking trend among infants. Eleven cases of hypertrichosis, also known as "werewolf syndrome," have been detected in babies across Spain since last year, the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/03/world-news/infants-develop-werewolf-syndrome-after-parents-take-hair-loss-drug-report/">New York Post</a></em> reported.&nbsp;The investigation found that caregivers of the infants had used a popular over-the-counter hair-loss treatment containing 5% topical minoxidil. It is believed that the minoxidil was transferred to the babies through skin contact or accidental ingestion. Minoxidil is a medication approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that can be sold without a prescription to adults experiencing age-related hair loss.</p>

<p>Notably, Hypertrichosis, commonly referred to as "Werewolf Syndrome," is a rare condition characterized by excessive hair growth in unusual areas of the body. This condition causes fine hair, measuring up to 5cm in length, to grow on the face, arms, and other parts of the body. Currently, there is no cure for hypertrichosis. Individuals affected by this condition must rely on regular hair removal methods, such as shaving and waxing, to manage their symptoms.</p>

<p>A notable case in 2023 brought attention to "werewolf syndrome" after a breastfeeding infant developed excessive hair growth across their body over two months. An investigation by health officials revealed that the father was using a topical 5% minoxidil solution to treat androgenic alopecia.</p>

<p>Upon discontinuing the minoxidil treatment, the child's symptoms completely reversed. Similarly, in all reported cases in Spain, the babies' excessive hair growth subsided once their caregivers stopped using minoxidil solutions.</p>

<p>In a separate case, a two-year-old girl in Malaysia was diagnosed with a rare congenital form of hypertrichosis. The girl's condition was distinct from the cases linked to environmental exposure to minoxidil.</p>

<p>Health experts have cautioned that minoxidil can be hazardous to infants' health and may lead to the development of hypertrichosis. The European Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee has also highlighted the risks associated with minoxidil exposure in infants.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Relations between India and Bangladesh have continued to plummet ever since then-Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina stepped down in August following weeks of protests led by student groups. When Nobel laureate and microfinance pioneer Muhammad Yunus was selected as the interim chief advisor of Bangladesh, the world had pinned high hopes on the country, which had been ravaged by months of bloody violence.</p>

<p>Contrary to expectations, communal forces have been given a free hand in Bangladesh, with minorities being killed, their houses, places of worship, and businesses attacked and destroyed. Bangladesh's interim government, instead of cracking down on extremists, has chosen to punish the minorities.</p>

<p>According to a report by the Bangladesh branch of the Berlin-based human rights group Transparency International, minorities have been targeted in more than 2,000 incidents of violence since Hasina was forced to flee the country.</p>

<p>The matter has reached the United Nations, and its human rights officials have expressed concern over the violations in the country.</p>

<p>India has expressed deep concern over the developments, as a diplomatic row between the two South Asian neighbours escalates.</p>

<h2><strong>Immediate Triggers</strong></h2>

<p>Arrests of monks and journalists, the desecration of the Indian flag at a university campus, and tough statements by advisers in the Yunus administration are further damaging bilateral relations.<br />
The situation worsened recently after Bangladeshi authorities arrested Hindu monk Chinmoy Krishna Das, an ISKCON monk in Bangladesh, who had been leading protests, on charges of sedition.<br />
On 30 November, a prominent Hindu journalist named Munni Saha was arrested by the police in Dhaka. After much outrage and on grounds of illness, she was released on bail.</p>

<p>Over the last few days, social media has been abuzz with pictures and videos allegedly showing children and adults in Bangladesh stamping on India's flag drawn on roads in educational institutions and public places. While this has naturally drawn criticism from enraged Indians, it has also raised questions. Why are people in Bangladesh showing their resentment towards India? Is it because we sympathise with the Awami League's Sheikh Hasina? Or is it the anger against Hindus? Or both?<br />
“Post 5 August, there is an anti-Awami League and anti-India premise. Forces which have historically been against the creation of Bangladesh, against India and its involvement in Bangladesh, and against the Awami League are active in Bangladesh politics today,” says Sanjay Bhardwaj, Professor of South Asian Studies at the School of International Studies, JNU.</p>

<p>Minorities – Hindus, Buddhists, Christians, indigenous groups, etc. – in Bangladesh have never been safe; however, the ousting of the Hasina government has made them more vulnerable in the country.</p>

<p>Added to this, Yunus' caretaker government has been placating Islamic fundamentalist outfits since coming to power. Yunus inducted the deputy chief of the ultra-Islamist outfit Hefazat-e-Islam, AFM Khalid Hossain, as his adviser for religious affairs in the interim government.</p>

<p>“We are in a terrible situation since the fundamentalists have taken over power. Bangladesh is like Afghanistan and Syria now,” says a senior journalist from Bangladesh, on condition of anonymity, as his accreditation was cancelled and his website blocked since 7 August. The authorities have slapped a murder case against him.</p>

<p>“In my country nowadays, you cannot say anything against the government. Speaking in support of the Awami League is treated as fascism. Supporting India is treated as terrorism,” says the senior journalist. In fact, Yunus has dismissed the recent violence against the country's Hindu minorities as "exaggerated propaganda" with political motives aimed at destabilising the nation.</p>

<p>“Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI) calls the shots in Bangladesh. JeI believes in the ideology or idea of Pakistan and wants to pursue their politics based on Islamic nationalism,” says Bhardwaj. “So, time and again, they have been Islamising Bangladesh and its polity since the split of 1971, against the ethos and values of India. They want to bring Bangladesh out of India's dependency culturally, socially, economically, and of course, politically,” he adds.</p>

<p>The Yunus regime has taken a series of anti-India decisions since taking over. The Dhaka High Court's recent decision to acquit BNP's acting chairperson Tarique Rahman, former minister Lutfozzaman Babar, and others in a 2004 grenade attack will also further damage Bangladesh's ties with India.<br />
Rahman and Babar had collaborated to encourage anti-India insurgent groups from the northeast to operate from Bangladesh's soil.</p>

<p>On the economic front, Indo-Bangladesh trade had shifted from the traditional cotton and jute industries to infrastructure in recent years. Large-scale power plants in India, which exclusively supply power to Bangladesh, have been drawn into unnecessary review by the current establishment, much against the spirit of international trade.</p>

<p>The vandalism of Hindu temples, the arrest of Hindu monks, and journalists on sedition charges are violations of international human rights law, and India is perfectly correct in airing its concerns about the violation of minority rights in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>The Western media, which is usually vocal about democratic regimes overthrown through anarchy, have been silent on Bangladesh, despite their well-known stance towards countries leaning towards radical Islam. Just yesterday, in the UK Parliament, British MPs Barry Gardiner and Priti Patel raised concerns over violence against Hindus in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>US President-elect Donald Trump's recent criticism of the ‘barbaric attack' on Hindus gives hope of a shift in US foreign policy, which may be on the horizon.</p>

<p>The Biden administration has been silent on the ongoing human rights violations in Bangladesh. Historically, India and the US have been on opposite sides since Bangladesh's liberation from Pakistan in 1971. The US has worked over the years to undermine the Awami League rule under PM Hasina.<br />
“US Democrats, for their own reasons, don't like the Awami League, and they have also been working with the radicals. Now, Trump has strongly indicated concern about minority issues in Bangladesh,” says Bhardwaj.</p>

<p>“I'm still sceptical about how much personally he will intervene in this issue because the Pentagon and the deep state of America ultimately decide their policy towards Bangladesh,” he adds.<br />
It is quite obvious that, with damaging India-Bangladesh bilateral relations, there has been simultaneous cosying up between Bangladesh and Pakistan.</p>

<p>Pakistan announced a new visa policy allowing citizens of Bangladesh to travel to Pakistan without paying a visa fee. On the sidelines of the UN General Assembly summit in New York in September, there was a meeting between Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Yunus on the need to ‘revitalise bilateral cooperation'. In October, Yunus' interim government scrapped the mandatory physical inspection of imports from Pakistan – a worry for India, as it could lead to the illegal supply of arms to militants in the northeast.</p>

<p>Also, in November, a cargo ship from Karachi docked at Chittagong port, marking the first-ever direct maritime contact between Pakistan and Bangladesh. This was described by the Pakistan High Commission in Dhaka as “a major step in bilateral trade.”</p>

<p>The situation in Bangladesh is volatile, and India will have to keep a close watch and react according to the unfolding, complicated crisis.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An old video of a paraglider making an abrupt landing during an event in Pakistan has surfaced online and left social media users chuckling. The clip, shared on X by the popular account 'Ghar Ke Kalesh', captures the paraglider landing on the chief guest of the event. According to the <em>Khaleej Times</em>, the incident took place in 2023 at a celebration of Gilgit-Baltistan's 76th Independence Day. The event featured the paraglider making a dramatic entrance, followed by a trail of red and blue smoke.</p>

<p>In the video, the paraglider misestimated his landing time and speed. Instead of landing on the field, he ended up landing straight in the first row, where the chief guest was sitting. The people standing around the chief guest moved away quickly and no one seemed to be injured. The paraglider, on the other hand, was seen trapped in the damaged parachute after landing.&nbsp;</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Ms Wilson's Instagram post sparked widespread outrage and support from fellow celebrities and the public.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Malaysian actor Zahnita Wilson has made shocking allegations of enduring two decades of domestic abuse at the hands of her husband, Abdul Zackery Ghouse. Ms Wilson, 41, shared her harrowing experience in an Instagram story, which included a photo of her with a black eye. "I didn't want to do this, but I am forced to. This is why I left my old house and why I sometimes wear sunglasses," she wrote in another post.</p>

<p>According to Ms Wilson, the abuse occurred when she questioned her husband about his fidelity. She claimed to have filed multiple police reports over the years, but no action was taken against her husband.</p>

<p>Ms Wilson's Instagram post sparked widespread outrage and support from fellow celebrities and the public. Actress Sarimah Ibrahim commented, "You don't and never deserve this ever."</p>

<p>Following Ms Wilson's post, police arrested her husband under the Domestic Violence Act and booked him for criminal intimidation. Kuantan police chief assistant commissioner Wan Mohd Zahari Wan Busu confirmed the arrest, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/asia/southeast-asia/malaysian-zahnita-wilson-husband-domestic-abuse-instagram-b2657791.html" rel="nofollow, noindex">Independent</a></em> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pahang police chief Datuk Seri Yahaya Othman revealed that the incident that led to Ms Wilson's black eye was triggered by her decision to leave and live separately, which angered her husband and led to the altercation.</p>

<p>"The victim filed a police report on 27 November and her husband was arrested yesterday after reporting to the Kuantan district police headquarters. Today, the suspect was brought to court for a remand application," he said.</p>

<p>The actor, who is also a model, expressed frustration that her previous pleas for help had been ignored. "I've filed police reports for the beatings I endured all these while but no action has been taken. Instead, it backfired on me," she was quoted as saying by the outlet.</p>

<p>The case has drawn widespread attention and renewed calls for stronger protections and justice for victims of domestic abuse in Malaysia. In the past, Malaysia's police force has faced criticism for its handling of domestic abuse cases, with a documented history of inadequate responses. In some instances, authorities have been accused of downplaying the severity of domestic abuse incidents.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/lifestyle-culture/article/3289124/support-pours-malaysian-actress-zahnita-wilson-over-alleged-abuse">South China Morning Post,</a></em> the number of domestic violence cases surged during the pandemic, with a reported 42 per cent increase in 2021 compared to the previous year, totalling 7,468 cases. The alarming trend continued, with 2,794 cases recorded nationwide from 2021 to 2023, according to Women, Family, and Community Development Minister Nancy Shukri.&nbsp;</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The lawmakers of South Korea's opposition coalition on Wednesday moved a motion in the Asian country's Parliament to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol after his shocking imposition of martial law that brought thousands of protesters to the streets.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>
<ol class="CetSht_ol">
	<li class="CetSht_li">The opposition parties in South Korea, whose lawmakers tussled with security forces to vote down the controversial martial law, filed a motion on Wednesday to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol. "We've submitted an impeachment motion prepared urgently," said Kim Yong-min of the opposition Democratic Party (DP).</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Lawmakers are yet to decide when the impeachment motion will be put to a vote, but it could come as soon as Friday. South Korea's opposition controls the National Assembly. The opposition has threatened to impeach President Yoon if he does not resign voluntarily, following his ill-fated move to impose martial law. In case Mr Yoon quits or is removed from office then, the South Korean constitution mandates that Prime Minister Han Duck-soo steps in to perform presidential duties.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Earlier the DP in a statement said it would file charges of "insurrection," against Yoon, his defence and interior ministers and "key military and police figures involved, such as the martial law commander and the police chief." The National Assembly can impeach the president if more than two-thirds of lawmakers vote for it. A trial is then held by the constitutional court, which can confirm it with a vote by six of the nine justices.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The opposition in South Korea holds a large majority in the 300-member parliament and needs only a handful of defections from the president's party to secure the two-thirds majority needed to pass the motion. Earlier, even the leader of Yoon's own ruling party, which controls 108 seats in the 300-member legislature, described the attempt to bring the martial law as "tragic" while calling for those involved to be held accountable.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">South Korean stocks sank on Wednesday while the currency won dipping multi-year lows only to rebound later after the shocking announcement on Tuesday night. The hours of martial rule in the country sent shivers through the trading floor in Seoul, with investors keeping a close eye on developments in the country.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The Kospi index ended down more than one per cent, having shed as much as 2.3 per cent at the open, as traders fretted over the impact of Yoon declaring the Asian country's first martial law in more than four decades. Analysts pointed out that the upheaval comes as authorities steeled for the second US presidency of Donald Trump who has vowed to reignite his hardball trade policy.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The South Korean finance ministry and central bank looked to provide stability and reassure markets by promising to pour in money if needed to prop up volatile financial markets. "As announced together with the government, it has been decided to temporarily supply sufficient liquidity until the financial and foreign exchange markets stabilise," the Bank of Korea said. It added that "the range of securities eligible for (repo) transactions and the target institutions will be expanded". Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, who also holds the economy portfolio, said financial authorities will keep international partners informed about developments.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">South Koreans continued with their lives on Wednesday, with people going to offices, businesses and schools as usual. There were scarcely any visible signs in the capital Seoul that six hours of surprise martial law and high political drama overnight had spilled into everyday life. The city of 9 million started the day normally with the usual morning rush hour in trains and on the streets. "At first, I was scared and very confused. I kept thinking, 'What is going on? Is this something that could actually happen in this era?' I couldn't sleep until the martial law was lifted because I was so frightened," Seoul resident Gang He-Soo, 50, told Reuters.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">President Yoon declared martial law in a live TV address at around 10:30 pm (13:30 GMT) on Tuesday, only to reverse the decree after lawmakers defied police and special forces condoning the National Assembly to vote, forcing him to lift the order. The president's office said the declaration of martial law was done at night to "minimize damage to the national economy and people's lives". South Korean soldiers, equipped with rifles, body armour and night-vision equipment, were seen entering the parliament building in Seoul through smashed windows, while helicopters hovered in the night sky above the building.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Soon after the news broke of the martial law broke, thousands of protesters stepped out on the streets, asking for the decree's reversal and removal of the President. Flag-waving protesters kept vigil outside parliament braving freezing temperatures through the night in defiance of Mr Yoon's martial law order. Several senior aides working for Mr Yoon also offered Wednesday to resign en masse over the martial law declaration.</li>

       <description><![CDATA[Aliya Fakhri, who was arrested for allegedly killing her ex-boyfriend and his friend, was a "good person", her friends said as they expressed disbelief over the brutal crime.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Actor Nargis Fakhri's sister Aliya Fakhri's arrest for allegedly killing her ex-boyfriend and his friend has left her friends in shock.</p>

<p>Expressing disbelief over the killings, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/who-is-aliya-fakhri-actor-nargis-fakhris-sister-arrested-for-killing-ex-boyfriend-7160117">Aliya</a>'s friends described her as a "good person". According to them, the alleged murder may have been an act of "jealousy".</p>

<p>Sade Jean-Baptiste and Jewels Boatwright (name changed) told NDTV that Aliya, who they call 'Athena' (per her stage name) used to work as a stripper.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"She was a good person...passionate. But she lost it that night. This feels like a crime of jealousy," they said, adding that they "loved her".</p>

<p>Aliya Fakhri was arrested on Tuesday for allegedly setting a two-storey garage on fire in Queens, New York, when her former boyfriend Edward Jacobs (35), and his friend, Anastasia Ettienne (33), were asleep.</p>

<p>According to the Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz, Aliya Fakhri arrived at the garage early morning on November 2 and yelled "you are all going to die today" at Jacobs, who lived upstairs. A witness came out hearing her voice and found that the building had been set on fire. Ettienne, who was alerted of the fire, went back upstairs to save Jacobs. But neither of them made it out of the burning building as they died from smoke inhalation and thermal injuries, officials said.</p>

<p>According to Aliya's friends, her former boyfriend, Jacobs, used to live in the garage and worked as a plumber. He leaves behind four children.</p>

<p>Jacobs and Aliya were a part of the same friends' group, they told NDTV, adding that the two were seeing each other "on and off" but it was a "turbulent" relationship.</p>

<p>The victims, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/nargis-fakhris-sister-aliya-fakhri-arrested-for-double-murder-in-queens-new-york-7159276">Jacobs</a> and Etienne lived in the same rented house in Queens, along with Jewels and several other people.</p>

<p>At the time of the incident, all the other people had managed to escape.</p>

<p>Presently, the New York police are not allowing Jewels to live in the house as it is a crime scene, he said.</p>

<p>Aliya's friends told NDTV that she spoke "affectionately" about her elder sister and rockstar-fame actor Nargis Fakhri.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, sources have claimed that Nargis has not been in touch with Aliya <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/nargis-fakhri-not-in-touch-with-murder-accused-sister-for-20-years-sources-7164273">for more than 20 years</a>.</p>

<p>NDTV also reached out to Nargis and Aliya's mother Marie Fakhri in Queens but found her apartment locked.</p>

<p>A neighbour said: "I saw her last two days ago...She is a very friendly, beautiful woman."</p>

<p>Marie has reportedly denied charges against her daughter saying, "I don't think she would be killing someone. She was a person who was caring for everybody. She tried to help everybody."</p>

<p>Aliya, who has been charged with four counts of murder in the first degree, four counts of murder in the second degree, and accused of arson by a grand jury, is scheduled to appear before a court on December 9.</p>

<p>If convicted of a top charge, she can face a maximum of life in prison, the Queens District Attorney said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Koreans went to offices, businesses and schools as usual on Wednesday with scarcely any visible signs in the capital Seoul that six hours of surprise martial law and high political drama overnight had spilled into everyday life.</p>

<p>The city of 9 million started the day normally with the usual morning rush hour in trains and on the streets after President Yoon Suk Yeol lifted his abortive attempt at banning political activities and censoring news media just before dawn.</p>

<p>But many were in shock at such a sudden turn of events, which pushed stocks down and South Korea's currency to multi-year lows during a time of already faltering economic growth.</p>

<p>There have been more than a dozen instances of martial law being declared in South Korea since it became a republic in 1948, but the last time was more than four decades ago when Gen. Chun Doo-hwan staged a coup and ruled from 1980 to 1988.</p>

<p>Seoul resident Gang He-Soo, 50, said she woke from sleep by chance and saw the news.</p>

<p>"At first, I was scared and very confused. I kept thinking, 'What is going on? Is this something that could actually happen in this era?' I couldn't sleep until the martial law was lifted because I was so frightened," Gang said, walking in Seoul's main commercial and tourist district Gwanghwamun.</p>

<p>Yoon declared martial law in a live TV address at around 10:30 pm (1330 GMT) on Tuesday, only to reverse course after parliament defied police and special forces cordons around the National Assembly to vote, forcing him to lift the declaration.</p>

<p>The president's office said the declaration of martial law was done at night to "minimize damage to the national economy and people's lives".</p>

<p>South Korean soldiers, equipped with rifles, body armour and night-vision equipment, were seen entering the parliament building in Seoul through smashed windows.</p>

<p>Helicopters hovered in the night sky above the building.</p>

<p>"It was an experience that I've only seen in movies, and I realised how much more serious it is than I had imagined," said 39-year-old Seoul resident Kim Byeong-In, who said he was concerned about the impact on the economy.</p>

<p>"I'm deeply disturbed by this kind of situation, and I'm very concerned about the future of the country," Kim said.</p>

<p>Many people said they stayed up late following the news, which stations continued to report despite Yoon declaring that media subject to martial law.</p>

<p>Just after the news broke, the usually quiet passengers on a Seoul subway train started talking to each other. A man read a news story out to a companion, a Reuters witness said.</p>

<h2><strong>PROTESTS, PANIC BUYING</strong></h2>

<p>Thousands of people streamed to the riverside National Assembly late on Tuesday and into Wednesday calling for Yoon's order to be blocked and then his arrest and resignation.</p>

<p>Almost two-thirds of parliament's 300 members scrambled to the National Assembly at night for a vote to reject the martial law.</p>

<p>A major South Korean convenience store chain, which declined to be identified to avoid association with the current political situation, said sales of canned goods from its stores jumped 337% between 11:00 pm and midnight on Tuesday, compared to the same period a week earlier.</p>

<p>Sales of instant noodle packets jumped 254% and bottled water jumped 141%, a spokesperson told Reuters.</p>

<p>Some companies overnight advised employees to work from home, but business outlets were open and the morning rush hour was as normal.</p>

<p>South Korea's largest union coalition, the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, said on Wednesday that tens of thousands of its members would strike until Yoon resigns, and will hold a rally in the evening in downtown Seoul.</p>

<p>Several other protests were expected on Wednesday.</p>

<p>"I only knew that martial law had been declared for some reason, but it ended without anything significant, making the reason seem meaningless. It just felt a bit strange to me," said Seoul resident Park Jun-Yeop.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NASA astronaut Sunita Williams, aboard the International Space Station (ISS), is leading an innovative agricultural experiment.&nbsp;She is growing "Outredgeous" romaine lettuce in microgravity, a study that promises significant benefits for space missions and Earth-based agriculture.</p>

<p>The experiment, known as Plant Habitat-07, is designed to explore how varying levels of water availability influence plant growth in space.</p>

<p>Its primary objectives are optimising plant cultivation techniques for deep-space missions and developing sustainable farming solutions for water-scarce regions on Earth.</p>

<p>This study involves analysing growth rates, nutritional content, and the overall health of lettuce grown in microgravity. By addressing these parameters, the research aims to support NASA's goal of establishing self-sustaining life-support systems for space exploration.</p>

<p>As the lead scientist, Ms Williams has set up the experiment by collecting baseline water samples from the Advanced Plant Habitat's distribution reservoir and installing the Plant Habitat-07 science carrier, which serves as the cultivation chamber for the lettuce.</p>

<p>The implications of this lettuce experiment extend beyond space exploration. For space missions, the research helps reduce reliance on costly resupply missions, ensures astronauts have access to fresh food, and boosts their psychological well-being by allowing them to grow and eat fresh produce. On Earth, the findings could inform water-efficient farming practices in drought-prone areas, improve crop yields with fewer resources, and promote sustainable food production worldwide.</p>

<p>NASA's plant experiments in space have evolved over time, and the Advanced Plant Habitat aboard the ISS provides an advanced platform for these studies. Ms Williams' work builds on past successes, helpful for future innovations that can benefit both space exploration and Earth-based agriculture.</p>

<p>Apart from her agricultural work, Ms Williams contributes to various health studies aboard the ISS. Recently, she supported fellow astronaut Tyler Hague with vascular health monitoring, showcasing the diverse responsibilities astronauts manage during long missions.</p>

<p>The data gathered from this experiment will contribute to NASA's mission of creating self-sustaining habitats for future long-term space missions. It will also provide valuable insights that can help address global food security challenges.</p>

<p>Ms Williams' ongoing mission began on June 5 alongside astronaut Butch Wilmore on Boeing's Starliner spacecraft. She is engaged in routine maintenance tasks and scientific experiments aboard the ISS. Originally planned for an eight-day stay, the mission was extended due to technical issues with the spacecraft's service module.</p>

<p>She will now remain on the ISS until February 2025 and return to Earth aboard the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft. She has taken command of the ISS for the second time in her career.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>France's government on Wednesday faces no-confidence votes that could spell the end of the short-lived administration of Prime Minister Michel Barnier, plunging the country into uncharted waters of political chaos.</p>

<p>The toppling of the Barnier government after just three months in office would present President Emmanuel Macron with the unenviable choice of picking a viable successor.</p>

<p>The National Assembly is due to debate two motions brought by the hard-left and far-right in a standoff with Barnier over next year's budget, which saw the premier force through a social security financing bill without a vote.</p>

<p>The far-right National Rally (RN) of three-time presidential candidate Marine Le Pen is expected to vote for the motion put forwards by the left, giving it enough numbers to pass.</p>

<p>Asked on French television if there was a chance his government could survive Wednesday's vote, Barnier replied: "I want this and it is possible...I think it is possible that there is this reflex of responsibility where -- beyond political differences, divergences, the normal contradictions in a democracy -- we tell ourselves that there is a higher interest."</p>

<p>But most analysts believe the government is doomed with the far-right teaming up with the left in an unholy alliance.</p>

<p><strong>'Political fiction'</strong></p>

<p>The turmoil follows a snap election called by Macron in the summer which aimed, without success, to halt the march of the far right, and left no party or faction in parliament with a majority.</p>

<p>Barnier took office with the far right under Le Pen holding a sword of Damocles over his head thanks to its ability to topple the administration at any point of its choosing.</p>

<p>No new elections can be called within a year of the previous legislative polls, narrowing Macron's options.</p>

<p>Some have suggested the president, who is wrapping up a state visit to Saudi Arabia, should resign to break the political impasse.</p>

<p>But Macron rejected those calls, saying such a scenario amounted to "political fiction".</p>

<p>"It's frankly not up to scratch to say these things," Macron told reporters on the sidelines of the Saudi Arabia visit.</p>

<p>"I was elected twice by the French people. I am extremely proud of this and I will honour this trust with all the energy that is mine until the last second to be useful to the country," added Macron, who is due to serve until 2027.</p>

<p>Several prominent opposition figures and even some voices closer to the presidential faction have suggested resignation could be Macron's only viable option.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>'Uncertainty just before Christmas'</strong></p>

<p>The head of the Socialist party, Olivier Faure, called on Macron to make his intentions clear should the Barnier government fall.</p>

<p>"Rather than dropping little remarks during a visit to Saudi Arabia, Emmanuel Macron now needs to speak to the French people," Faure told Le Monde daily in remarks published on Wednesday. "How can he leave the French people in this uncertainty just before Christmas?"</p>

<p>Macron, meanwhile, accused Le Pen's RN of "unbearable cynicism" in backing the no confidence motion.</p>

<p>"We must not scare people with these things," he said.</p>

<p>Macron appeared to hold out some hope that the government will survive, saying he could "not believe" that the motion would pass.</p>

<p>Candidates for the hot seat as premier are few and far between, with loyalist Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu and Macron's centrist ally Francois Bayrou possible contenders.</p>

<p>If the government falls, it would be the first successful no-confidence vote since a defeat for Georges Pompidou's government in 1962, when Charles de Gaulle was president.</p>

<p>The lifespan of Barnier's government would also be the shortest of any administration of France's Fifth Republic, which began in 1958.</p>

<p>Some observers have suggested that Le Pen, 56, is seeking to bring down Macron before his term ends by ousting Barnier.</p>

<p>Le Pen is embroiled in a high-profile embezzlement trial. If found guilty in March, she could be blocked from participating in France's next presidential election.</p>

<p>She has insisted, however, that the standoff is entirely about a budget that she said would make the French poorer.</p>

<p>By following the "catastrophic continuity of Emmanuel Macron", the prime minister "could only fail", she wrote on social media.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Truong My Lan, a 68-year-old real estate tycoon, was convicted in April 2024 for using hundreds of ghost companies to control Saigon Commercial Bank and embezzle billions.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/property-tycoon-faces-death-penalty-over-biggest-fraud-in-vietnam-5417298">Truong My Lan</a>, a 68-year-old influential Vietnamese property magnate, has lost the appeal against her death sentence for orchestrating the world's largest bank fraud. The 68-year-old has been battling to avoid execution. Vietnam law stipulated repaying 75 per cent&nbsp;of the stolen amount could reduce her sentence to life imprisonment. Despite her recent plea for leniency, Lan is racing against time to repay $9 billion, three-quarters of the $12 billion she was found to have embezzled.</p>

<p><strong>Where it all began for Truong My Lan</strong></p>

<p>Truong My Lan's journey from a market vendor to one of Vietnam's most powerful figures began in Ho Chi Minh City, where she sold cosmetics with her mother, as per <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd753r47815o" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">the BBC</a>. Capitalising on the economic reforms of 1986, she expanded her business, amassing a substantial property portfolio that included hotels and restaurants by the 1990s. By the time she became the chairwoman of Van Thinh Phat Group, her real estate empire was vast, and she had significant influence in the sector.</p>

<p><strong>The fraud</strong></p>

<p>Truong My Lan's fraudulent activities were exposed following her arrest in October 2022. Prosecutors revealed she secretly controlled Saigon Commercial Bank (SCB), the country's fifth-largest lender. Between 2012 and 2022, Lan used numerous shell companies and third parties to orchestrate a vast financial scheme involving fake loan applications. This scheme allowed her to siphon off an estimated $12.5 billion. Prosecutors estimated that the total damages from the fraud could have reached US$27 billion, which, in 2022, represented nearly 3% of Vietnam's GDP. This fraud left thousands of ordinary citizens without their life savings, tied up in the bank and their real estate ventures.</p>

<p>To mask the fraud, Lan and her co-conspirators, including former bank executives and government officials, allegedly paid bribes of $5.2 million to state officials — an amount that was the largest recorded bribe in Vietnam's history.<br />
<br />
<strong>The trial</strong></p>

<p>The trial involved 85 defendants, including Lan's husband, a Hong Kong businessman, and her niece. The authorities had to secure 105 boxes of evidence, weighing over six tonnes, and installed security cameras to safeguard the information. In April 2024, Lan was sentenced to death for embezzlement, bribery, and breaches of banking regulations.</p>

<p><strong>The road ahead</strong></p>

<p>Truong My Lan's legal team has been working to raise the $9 billion needed to avoid execution, as she continues to sell assets and seek loans from friends. Despite these efforts, liquidating her holdings, which include luxury real estate and stakes in various ventures, has proven challenging. Her lawyers argue that her death sentence hinders her ability to negotiate the best prices for her assets and claim she would have better prospects if her sentence were reduced to life imprisonment.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The National Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA) has confirmed that its engineers have successfully restored contact with Voyager 1. The dwindling power supply in the spacecraft caused a blackout for several weeks, but it's operating normally now, the agency said.</p>

<p>The issue first came up in October 2024 when Voyager 1 automatically switched from the primary X-band radio transmitter to a much weaker S-band radio transmitter to communicate with its mission team back on Earth, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/03/science/voyager-1-radio-transmitter-power-supply/index.html" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">CNN</a> reported.</p>

<p>Voyager 1, called the farthest spacecraft from Earth, is at present exploring uncharted territory nearly 15.4 billion miles (24.9 billion km) away.</p>

<p>The transmitter swap was made autonomously after it was determined that Voyager I had little power left as the mission team sent a command to turn on one of the heaters onboard.</p>

<p>However, this unexpected swap prevented NASA engineers from getting information about the status of the spacecraft along with the scientific data collected by its instruments for nearly a month.</p>

<p>Later, once the team was able to resolve the issue, they switched the spacecraft back to its X-band radio transmitter and started receiving its daily stream of data in mid-November.</p>

<p>Kareem Badaruddin, Voyager mission manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said the probes were "never really designed to be operated like this and the team is learning new things day by day".</p>

<p>"Thankfully they were able to recover from this issue and learned some things," the official added.</p>

<p>This was only one of the many challenges the mission team faced in recent years as Voyager 1, as well as its twin probe Voyager 2, continued to explore more regions in space more than 47 years after the lift-off.</p>

<p>Launched weeks apart in 1977, the two of them have long outlasted their original missions. For now, they are in interstellar space and are the only spacecraft to operate beyond the heliosphere, the bubble of magnetic fields and particles of the Sun extending beyond the orbit of Pluto.</p>

<p>These spacecraft have been powered by the heat from decaying plutonium, which is converted into electricity. The probes lose around four watts of power every year, NASA said, adding this is just equivalent to a small, energy-efficient light bulb.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Emmanuel Macron called on French lawmakers to set aside their personal ambition and reject a vote that would topple the government and throw the country into political turmoil.</p>

<p>Far-right leader Marine Le Pen and her National Rally party have vowed to support a no-confidence motion on Wednesday submitted by a left-wing coalition, a motion that will pass if backed by both groups.</p>

<p>The National Rally became the largest single party in the lower house of parliament in a June snap election, transforming Le Pen into Paris's most influential power broker. But Macron expressed confidence that politicians would step back from the brink.</p>

<p>"The only question that politicians today need to ask themselves is how they can be useful to the country and to the French people," Macron told reporters on Tuesday during a trip to Saudi Arabia. "Not how they can be useful to their own ambitions or their own interests."</p>

<p>The president said in Riyadh that for Le Pen's party to support the no-confidence motion "would be a vote of unbearable cynicism," adding that "I can't believe that they'd vote for the" motion.</p>

<p>Lawmakers in Paris will begin debating the motions at 4 p.m. in Paris Wednesday, with the voting to start shortly thereafter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Prime Minister Michel Barnier also spoke of the potential that the no-confidence motion wouldn't pass.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I think it's possible there will be a reflex of responsibility," Barnier said on French TV Tuesday. "I think that the country's higher interest, the common good, the national interest, mean something."</p>

<p>The political difficulties began after Macron called snap elections after getting trounced in European elections. That left the lower house split into three fiercely opposed blocs: a diminished center supporting the president, a leftist alliance and a strengthened far right led by Le Pen. With no coalition possible, Macron appointed Barnier prime minister in September with a core mission to get France's messy finances in order.</p>

<p>Barnier used a constitutional mechanism on Monday to force through an unpopular budget bill, leading the National Rally and the leftist coalition to call for votes of no confidence. Le Pen moved forward with the motion even after Barnier submitted to nearly all of the National Rally's demands to change the budget legislation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the government were to collapse on Wednesday, it would underscore the power acquired by Le Pen since Macron called the surprise election in June. It would also mark the shortest tenure for a premier since France's Fifth Republic was founded in 1958.</p>

<p>The political chaos has driven bond investors to punish France's sovereign debt relative to its peers, pushing borrowing costs at one point last week to match Greece's and leading Barnier to warn of a "storm" in financial markets if he is dismissed from power.</p>

<p>Investors have fretted for months over France's political difficulties, just as the government has been trying to push measures that will reduce its unwieldy deficit. The budget bill initially presented by Barnier's government contained &amp;#8364;60 billion ($63.1 billion) of tax increases and spending cuts that aimed for a sharp adjustment in the deficit to 5% of economic output in 2025 from an estimated 6.1% this year.</p>

<p>A government collapse so close to the end of the year would take France into unchartered territory. The outgoing administration, acting in a caretaker capacity, could use emergency laws to collect taxes and guarantee a minimal level of spending, but the economic and financial impact is hard to predict.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The current finance minister, Antoine Armand, warned earlier Tuesday that stopgap legislation would raise taxes for millions of households and block planned spending increases for some priorities, including security and farming.</p>

<p><strong>What Happens If the Government Falls?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Barnier would tender the resignation of the government</li>
	<li>His outgoing cabinet would remain in place with limited powers to manage current affairs</li>
	<li>The French president is solely responsible for appointing a new premier, but there is no constitutional time limit for his decision</li>
	<li>It took Macron nearly two months to select Barnier with no obvious candidate capable of commanding a majority in a hung parliament</li>
	<li>The caretaker government will likely rely on untested emergency legislation to collect taxes and deliver minimal spending it considers vital</li>
	<li>Once named, a new prime minister would have to propose a cabinet to be appointed by the president</li>
	<li>The new government would need to propose a 2025 budget to parliament</li>
	<li>A new legislative election is not possible until July</li>
</ul>

<p>But Macron expressed confidence that politicians voting on Wednesday would step back from the brink.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The only question that politicians today need to ask themselves is how they can be useful to the country and to the French people," Macron said in Riyadh. "Not how they can be useful to their own ambitions or their own interests."</p>

<p>If the government is voted down, ministers remain in place with a caretaker status to manage current affairs, potentially including emergency legislation to avoid a shutdown. It would then be up to Macron to appoint a new prime minister, although there is no constitutional deadline for his decision.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The president, meantime, said he wouldn't resign until his full term had ended. While the left has called on Macron to step down, he can't be forced out of his job. The next presidential election is set for 2027 and Le Pen remains the frontrunner, according to polls.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I've been elected twice by the French people, and I'm extremely proud of that," Macron said. "I'll honor that trust with all my energy, right up to the last second, to be useful to the country."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ace American investor and financial commentator Jim Rogers has revealed that he has not seen US billionaire George Soros -- with whom he founded Quantum Fund long back -- in about 50 years and does not talk to him anymore.</p>

<p>In 1970, Rogers joined New York-based investment bank Arnhold and S Bleichroeder, where he worked with Soros. In 1973, Soros and Rogers left and founded the Quantum Fund, which was one of the first truly global funds.</p>

<p>Rogers told IANS during an interaction that he had not seen Soros in nearly 50 years.</p>

<p>On a question, if he is still in touch with Hungarian-American billionaire businessman and philanthropist Soros, who has generated several controversies -- including trying hard to destabilise the Indian economy while funding Democrats millions of dollars in the recent US presidential election -- Rogers flatly denied speaking or seeing him in decades.</p>

<p>"I don't have any thoughts (on Soros). I haven't seen Soros in nearly 50 years," he said.</p>

<p>Singapore-based Rogers is now the chairman of Beeland Interests Inc. and the creator of the Rogers International Commodities Index (RICI).</p>

<p>From 1973 to 1980, the Quantum Fund portfolio gained a whopping 4,200 per cent while the S&amp;P advanced about 47 per cent.</p>

<p>In later years, the Fund lost billions of dollars in its global investments and in July 2011, the Quantum Fund announced it would be turning the fund into a family investment group.</p>

<p>The Quantum Group of Funds is now reportedly managing Soros' family money as well as working with retail investors.</p>

<p>According to Rogers, the Quantum Fund saga was "decades ago".</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about Mr. Soros. I don't see him. I don't talk to him. I don't know what he's doing," 82-year-old Rogers told IANS.</p>

<p>Soros and his billion-dollar network have tried hard in the past to destabilise India while launching several attacks on wealth creators in the country but to no avail.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Namibia has elected its first female President, with Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah declared the winner of last week's disputed elections. Defying predictions of a runoff election, Ms Nandi-Ndaitwah, the current Vice President of the Southern African country, won with 57 per cent of the vote. With this, Namibia's ruling South West Africa People's Organisation (SWAPO) party extended its 34-year hold on power.</p>

<p>“The Namibian nation has voted for peace and stability,” the 72-year-old leader said after the final results were announced late on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The November 27 election was a test of SWAPO's grip on power, with the main opposition Independent Patriots for Change (IPC) attracting some support from younger generations, which are more concerned by unemployment and inequality than loyalty to liberation-era parties.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>About Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah</strong></h2>

<p>Ms Nandi-Ndaitwah, a SWAPO stalwart known by her initials NNN, will be among the few women leaders on the continent. The conservative daughter of an Anglican pastor, she became vice president in February this year.</p>

<p>Recognisable by her gold-framed glasses, NN joined SWAPO in the 1960s when it was fighting for independence and has served in numerous senior roles including foreign minister in the democratic era.</p>

<p>Among her election promises, NNN said she intends to "create jobs by attracting investments using economic diplomacy."</p>

<p>She received roughly 57 per cent of valid votes in the presidential race, according to a breakdown given by the Electoral Commission of Namibia. 50 per cent votes are needed to secure a victory.</p>

<h2><strong>Disputed Election</strong></h2>

<p>The November 27 presidential election was marred by technical difficulties and ballot paper shortages, leading to a delay in results as voting was extended in some places till November 30. This led to long queues, with some voters giving up on the first day of voting after waiting for up to 12 hours, according to a report by AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The IPC called it a deliberate attempt to frustrate voters and it would not accept the results. Its presidential candidate Panduleni Itula, 67, said last week there were a "multitude of irregularities".</p>

<p>The IPC candidate received 25.5 per cent votes in the November 27 polls, the election authority said, even as the main opposition said it does not recognise the results.</p>

<p>The "IPC shall not recognise the outcome of that election", he said on Saturday, the last day of the extended vote. The party would "fight... to nullify the elections through the processes that are established within our electoral process", Me Itula said.</p>

<p>Itula last week called on his party's supporters to be calm but also "stand firm to ensure that we shall not be robbed neither denied our democratic right to choose our leaders."</p>

<p>Reacting to the announcement of the SWAPO victory, IPC spokesperson Imms Nashinge said the party maintained this position.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>SWAPO's Undisputed Rule</strong></h2>

<p>SWAPO has ruled the mineral-rich southern African country since independence from apartheid South Africa in 1990. The party also had a clean sweep of the concurrent national assembly election, securing 51 of the 96 elected seats. The IPC won 20 seats and will be the official opposition. Namibians voted separately for the National Assembly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, SWAPO's tally was down from its 63 seats in the previous assembly. The presidential election was seen as a key test for the ruling party after other liberation-era movements in the region have lost favour with young voters including with the Botswana Democratic Party which was ousted from power in that country last month after almost six decades.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Political analysts had said that SWAPO victory was uncertain due to growing frustration with high levels of unemployment and inequality, but that the party retained strong roots in rural areas and loyalty among older voters due to the national liberation struggle.</p>

<p>Namibia is a major uranium and diamond exporter but analysts say not many of its nearly three million people have benefited from that wealth in terms of improved infrastructure and job opportunities. Unemployment among 15- to 34-year-olds is estimated at 46 per cent, according to the latest official figures from 2018, which is almost triple the national average.</p>

<p>But, Ms Nandi-Ndaitwah had managed to unite different factions within SWAPO, Analyst Rakkel Andreas told Reuters, adding that her reputation had not been tarnished by corruption allegations, unlike other party members.</p>

<p>"She is a stateswoman. She has been in some form of leadership since we gained independence...She understands the system," Andreas said.&nbsp;</p>

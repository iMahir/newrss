       <description><![CDATA[Chinese hackers have targeted phones used by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and his running mate J.D. Vance, US media reported Friday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chinese hackers have targeted phones used by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and his running mate J.D. Vance, US media reported Friday.</p>

<p>The New York Times, quoting people familiar with the matter, said the hacking attempt appeared to be part of a wide-ranging intelligence collection effort by Chinese hackers.</p>

<p>The newspaper said it involved the infiltration of Verizon phone systems and investigators were seeking to determine whether any communications data was taken.</p>

<p>A person familiar with the matter said the campaign of Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and her running mate Tim Walz was also targeted.</p>

<p>Rich Young, a spokesman for Verizon, told AFP: "We are aware that a highly sophisticated nation-state actor has reportedly targeted several US telecommunications providers to gather intelligence."</p>

<p>The Times said the Trump campaign was informed this week that the former president and Vance were among a number of people inside and outside government whose phone numbers had been targeted.</p>

<p>Western cybersecurity experts believe the hacking was carried out by a Chinese group known as "Salt Typhoon," the newspaper said.</p>

<p>The Washington Post said the hacking campaign is believed to have compromised the phones of two staffers on the Trump-Vance campaign.</p>

<p>The FBI declined to comment on the reports that Trump's and Vance's phones had been targeted.</p>

<p>But the FBI and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) said in a joint statement that the "US government is investigating the unauthorized access to commercial telecommunications infrastructure by actors affiliated with the People's Republic of China."</p>

<p>"After the FBI identified specific malicious activity targeting the sector, the FBI and (CISA) immediately notified affected companies, rendered technical assistance, and rapidly shared information to assist other potential victims," they said.</p>

<p>"Agencies across the US Government are collaborating to aggressively mitigate this threat and are coordinating with our industry partners to strengthen cyber defenses across the commercial communications sector," they added.</p>

<p>The United States charged three Iranians last month with involvement in a hacking effort targeting the Trump campaign.</p>

<p>In 2016, a hack of Democratic National Committee emails -- blamed on Russians -- exposed internal party communications, including about candidate Hillary Clinton.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[President Joe Biden formally apologized on Friday for the U.S. government's role in running abusive Native American boarding schools for more than 150 years, and was heckled at the event over his support for Israel's war in Gaza.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;President Joe Biden formally apologized on Friday for the U.S. government's role in running abusive Native American boarding schools for more than 150 years, and was heckled at the event over his support for Israel's war in Gaza.</p>

<p>"This to me is one of the most consequential things I've ever had an opportunity to do in my whole career," Biden said in his apology at an outdoor football and track field in Laveen Village, Arizona, near Phoenix.</p>

<p>"It's a sin on our soul. ... I formally apologize."</p>

<p>Several hundred people attended, many of them in traditional tribal dress. They cheered as Biden apologized for the generational trauma faced by the Native American community due to the boarding schools across the country.</p>

<p>Biden faced a brief interruption when a pro-Palestinian protester shouted: "How can you apologize for a genocide while committing a genocide in Palestine?"</p>

<p>The president replied, "There is a lot of innocent people being killed and it has to stop."</p>

<p>U.S. support for Israel's wars in Gaza and Lebanon after the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel has led to months of demonstrations across the United States. Rights advocates have demanded an arms embargo against Israel as tens of thousands of civilians have been killed in the region, and Palestinians in the Gaza Strip have grappled with hunger and disease.</p>

<p>Israel and Washington deny genocide allegations brought against Israel at the World Court in relation to Gaza, and Washington has maintained its support for its ally.</p>

<p>Friday's trip marked Biden's first time visiting Indian Country while in office and is part of his effort to cement his legacy in his final months in the White House.</p>

<p>Arizona is also one of the seven battleground states in a tight race for the Nov. 5 U.S. election in which Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris faces Republican former President Donald Trump.</p>

<p>U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, the first Native American to be a cabinet secretary, had launched an investigation to recognize the troubled legacy of federal Native American boarding school policies.</p>

<p>An Interior Department investigative report released in July found that at least 973 children died in these schools. Haaland's family members were among the children forced into the boarding schools.</p>

<p>From 1819 through the 1970s, the United States implemented policies establishing and supporting hundreds of American Indian boarding schools across the U.S. Their purpose was to culturally assimilate Native Americans by forcibly removing them from their families, communities, religions and cultural beliefs.</p>

<p>Like the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Canada have in recent years reviewed past abuse toward Indigenous communities, including children in schools.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli army said Friday that a strike that killed three journalists in south Lebanon was "under review", maintaining that it had targeted Hezbollah militants.</p>

<p>"Earlier today, following intelligence information, the IDF (army) struck a Hezbollah military structure in Hasbaya in southern Lebanon," the military said in a statement to AFP.</p>

<p>"The strike was carried out while the terrorists were located inside the structure," it added.</p>

<p>"Several hours after the strike, reports were received that journalists had been hit during the strike. The incident is under review."</p>

<p>Lebanese television channel Al Mayadeen said a cameraman and broadcast engineer were killed in the strike in Hasbaya, which according to the Pro-Iran network targeted a journalists' residence.</p>

<p>Another TV outlet, Al-Manar, run by Hezbollah, said one of its video journalists was also killed.</p>

<p>After the strike, a car bearing a "press" marking was crushed under debris.</p>

<p>Lebanon's Prime Minister Najib Mikati accused Israel of intentionally targeting the journalists in what he called a "war crime" that "aims to terrorise the media to cover up crimes and destruction".</p>

<p>Israel expanded its focus to Lebanon last month, after nearly a year of war in Gaza sparked by Hamas's attack, launching a massive bombing campaign targeting mainly Hezbollah strongholds across the country and sending in ground troops on September 30.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Recalled Indian High Commissioner to Canada Sanjay Kumar Verma on Friday shared a terrifying moment when Khalistani 'goons' came very close to bodily harm him and attacked him with a 'sharp object' - most likely a 'kirpan' - in Alberta.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recalled Indian High Commissioner to Canada Sanjay Kumar Verma on Friday shared a terrifying moment when Khalistani 'goons' came very close to bodily harm him and attacked him with a 'sharp object' - most likely a 'kirpan' - in Alberta that could potentially harm him.</p>

<p>In a podcast with ANI, Sanjay Verma shared his experience of threats and intimidation from the Khalistanis.</p>

<p>Sanjay Verma said, "All these attempts to harm me bodily, that was in the presence of Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and the local police and the local police on the ground took immediate action, pushed him away because there was a sharp weapon and the RCMP then whisked me from the side door to the venue."</p>

<p>"It was in Alberta. I am not an expert on Canadian law about open carrying so I will not be able to say that. But most likely they would have said that it was 'kirpan' which is a small blade whereas they had swords in their hand. They could come very, very close to me," said Mr Verma.</p>

<p>When asked if the incident was reported, Sanjay Verma said, "It was all reported and we were told that investigations are on."</p>

<p>Speaking of intimidation from the Khalistanis, Sanjay Verma said that the intimidation came through banned organisations associated with the Khalistani extremists.</p>

<p>"Some came through emails during the so-called protests, which I call hooliganism when they gathered in front of the two consulates or the High Commission. They would shout slogans to intimidate us. Whenever we were attending public events, again, they would shout slogans to intimidate us," he said.</p>

<p>Sharing an incident, Sanjay Verma said, "In one instance, close to Diwali, they created 10 heads for me, called me Ravan. And then my effigy was burnt as Ravan. Is that not hate speech? Then they created another poster of mine. And they riddled it with bullets. Is that not hate speech? Then what is it?"</p>

<p>"I reported this to the foreign ministry. The response was that we forwarded it to the relevant authorities, which is correct. We also do the same. But the report never came back. Okay. So we presume that nothing happened. So we presume that it went into a black box. Not to come out," he stated.</p>

<p>When asked if he, at any point, felt threatened physically,&nbsp;Sanjay Verma replied, "Threatened, yes. But did I become threatened? No. In most of my public events, there will be these hooligans outside shouting slogans against India, but also against me. Some of them are very burly-looking tall guys who would also gesture to physically harm me, but just the gestures, except for a few incidents. And so they tried."</p>

<p>"They came close to me. They tried to intimidate me through such, slogans shouting, and abusing me verbally. That was reported," he stated.</p>

<p>Speaking about his security, Sanjay Verma said, "I had Canadian security, both federal and local."</p>

<p>Asked about whether he, at any time, doubted their ability to protect him, he replied, "No, that I won't say. They were very professional, well-trained, and very respectful. So as far as the police officers who were protecting us and now protecting my colleagues there, very, very professional, never had an iota of doubt on their professionalism."</p>

<p>He added, "But unfortunately, the statement which we saw in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police press briefing, where even the investigation has not been concluded, that was a sad thing to see."</p>

<p>Mr Verma said that he was there to serve India's national interest and was committed to doing so.</p>

<p>"So diplomacy for most of us would be, you know, being nice, nice cities. But then the final objective of diplomacy happens to be to safeguard your national interest. National interest could be improving relationships. National interest could be raising awareness against these Khalistani goons. All these are national interests," he said.</p>

<p>"So we work for the national interests. It so happened that my national interest was a bit different than the national interest of most other ambassadors in other countries," said Sanjay Verma.</p>

<p>Mr Verma was recalled from Canada after the country said he was a person of interest in the case of the murder of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. He denied all charges.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ties between India and Canada soured after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau alleged in the Canadian Parliament last year that he had "credible allegations" of India's hand in the killing of Nijjar.<br />
India has denied all the allegations, calling them "absurd" and "motivated" and has accused Canada of giving space to extremist and anti-India elements in their country.</p>

<p>Nijjar, who was designated a terrorist by India's National Investigation Agency in 2020, was shot and killed outside a Gurdwara in Surrey in June last year.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Ship management firm Synergy Marine and Grace Ocean, owner of the ship with 22 Indian crew members that collided with a US bridge in March, have reached an "agreement" with the US government on cost payment, while rejecting liability for the incident]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ship management firm Synergy Marine and Grace Ocean, owner of the Singapore-flagged cargo ship with 22 Indian crew members that collided with a US bridge in March, have reached an "agreement" with the US government on cost payment, while rejecting liability for the incident.</p>

<p>Container ship 'DALI', with an all-Indian crew of 22 members onboard, had collided with one of the pillars of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore in March this year. The crew had issued a mayday call before the collision that led to the collapse of bridge, prompting authorities to limit traffic movement.</p>

<p>"We confirm that Grace Ocean and Synergy have reached an agreement with the United States regarding the payment of those costs, which are fully insured," Synergy Marine Group said in a statement on Friday.</p>

<p>"The settlement strictly covers costs related to clearing the channel, which we would have been responsible for in any case, and is not indicative of any liability, which we expressly reject for the incident that led to the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge," it stated.</p>

<p>According to the statement, Grace Ocean and Synergy are prepared to vigorously defend themselves in the limitation of liability proceedings pending before the Federal Court in Baltimore and to establish that they were not responsible for the incident.</p>

<p>Synergy Marine Group also said "no punitive damages have been imposed as part of the settlement".</p>

<p>"In accordance with the settlement, the United States has dismissed its claim," it said.</p>

<p>In the incident, the cargo ship outbound from Baltimore to Colombo, rammed into one of the pillars of the bridge, while under pilotage with two pilots onboard. Shortly after the collision, the bridge collapsed, crashing on the cargo ship.</p>

<p>Following the disembarkation of crew members from the vessel, Synergy Marine and Grace Ocean have put measures in place to support their well-being, the company said and added the 11 crew members who disembarked in Baltimore and Norfolk in June 2024 are accommodated in serviced apartments in Baltimore.</p>

<p>One crew member was granted approval by the US government to return to India for a family ceremony. The US government further granted an extension to this crew member, who is expected to return to the US in mid-November, to further assist with the ongoing investigation, Synergy Marine said.</p>

<p>Besides, two other crew members who were granted approvals by the US government to return to India for family reasons have joined their colleagues in the US, the company said.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Days after India announced that a patrolling arrangement had been reached with China, NDTV has accessed the first satellite images of disengagement taking place on the ground in Depsang and Demchok in Eastern Ladakh.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The agreement was announced on Monday and a satellite image from the Depsang plains taken on October 11 shows four vehicles and two tents.</p>

<p>Another image taken on Friday shows that the tents have been removed and the vehicles are moving away. The land on which the tents stood has also been restored.</p>

<p>The high-resolution images have been provided by Maxar.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">

</div>

<p>The images from Depsang are from near the 'Y Junction' from where Indian soldiers were prevented from travelling east to India's patrolling points. The patrolling points, or PPs, mark the extent of the Line of Actual Control that India claims in these areas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a similar satellite image from Demchok from October 9, semi-permanent Chinese structures can be seen.</p>

</div>

<p>The same structures are missing in an image from the disputed site on Friday.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/india-china-to-complete-disengagement-process-by-end-of-this-month-sources-6871293">Army sources had said</a> earlier in the day that the process of disengagement would be completed in the two contentious areas by Tuesday, October 29, &nbsp;and the troops would return to the positions that existed before the stand-off between the two countries began in 2020. The process includes the dismantling of structures and restoring the land on which they stood to their original condition.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sources said both India and China will continue to have surveillance options in Depsang and Demchok, and troops will inform the other side before stepping out on patrol "to avoid any miscommunication".</p>

<p>The stand-off began in May 2020 and a clash took place in Ladakh's Galwan the next month in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed in action and the Chinese side also suffered losses, with the exact number remaining unconfirmed.</p>

<p>A troop buildup followed on both sides and military-level talks began taking place to resolve the stand-off. In September 2022, Indian and Chinese troops withdrew from the contentious Gogra-Hot Springs area in Ladakh and returned to the pre-April-2020 position.</p>

<p><strong>'Peace And Stability'</strong></p>

<p>After <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/india-china-agree-on-patrolling-agreement-along-lac-leads-to-disengagement-6838489">the announcement</a> by Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri on Monday, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/we-will-be-able-to-go-back-to-2020-patrolling-s-jaishankar-on-lac-border-row-6839082">confirmed it</a> at the NDTV World Summit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We reached an agreement on patrolling, and we have gone back to the 2020 position. With that, we can say the disengagement with China has been completed. Details will come out in due course," Mr Jaishankar said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"There are areas which, for various reasons after 2020, they blocked us, we blocked them. We have now reached an understanding which will allow patrolling as we had been doing till 2020," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi then met Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in Russia - their first bilateral since 2019 - on Wednesday and they <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/pm-modi-xi-jinping-bilateral-summit-brics-summit-russia-india-china-patrolling-agreement-pm-modi-xi-welcome-complete-disengagement-between-soldiers-al-6857182">welcomed the agreement</a>.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Russia-Ukraine conflict was discussed in "considerable detail" during a meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Friday, with New Delhi reiterating that it is "not neutral" in this conflict and remains on the "side of peace", Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said.</p>

<p>The meeting between the two leaders took place days after PM Modi attended the BRICS Summit in Russia's Kazan and in his address at the forum renewed his call for dialogue and diplomacy as being the only way forward to resolve conflicts, in an unambiguous message to press for the resolution of the Russia-Ukraine war through peaceful negotiations.</p>

<p>Mr Misri, during a media briefing, was asked how much the Russia-Ukraine conflict and West Asia conflict figured in the Modi-Scholz talks.</p>

<p>"Yes, I can confirm that both issues did come up, and they did come up in considerable details. Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) shared with the Chancellor his impressions of his meetings and interactions in the recent months, with the leaders of both Russia and Ukraine, and peace efforts that we are making in pursuing conversation on all sides," he said.</p>

<p>"Some of the ideas that different actors have been talking about, and how India remains on the side of peace. We are not neutral in this conflict, we are on the side of peace. And, we stand ready to assist any initiative towards peace, benefiting or leveraging the ability that we have of being able to engage with all sides in this conflict," the foreign secretary added.</p>

<p>India supports dialogue and diplomacy and not war, PM Modi had said at the BRICS Summit.</p>

<p>In July, PM Modi had visited Russia, marking his first visit since the Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>In August he undertook a visit to Ukraine at the invitation of Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p>

<p>In his meeting with Chancellor Scholz on Friday, PM Modi echoed his words spoken during his historic visit to Kyiv under the shadow of the prolonged conflict.</p>

<p>"We (India) are not neutral. From the very beginning, we have taken sides. And we have chosen the side of peace. We have come from the land of Buddha where there is no place for war," PM Modi had said in his opening remarks during the talks.</p>

<p>"We have come from the land of Mahatma Gandhi who had given a message of peace to the entire world," he had said.</p>

<p>Mr Misri said on the conflict in West Asia, "both sides expressed concern" over the developments there, expressed hope that "already serious conflict" which has caused a lot of damage and casualties and destruction, "doesn't expand further and doesn't bring more actors into its ambit, and that parties concerned can find path back through dialogue and diplomacy, an reach an agreement on the issues".</p>

<p>PM Modi on Friday said the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and West Asia are a matter of concern and India is ready to make every possible contribution for restoration of peace.</p>

<p>His remarks came after talks with Chancellor Scholz, who called upon India to contribute to find a political solution to the conflict in Ukraine that has been raging for a long time.<br />

<p>He said that his $70,000 salary was insufficient to support him in Los Angeles and that his comments about the department head and the institution had put him on leave.</p>

<p>"UCLA has placed me on administrative leave; they've taken all of my courses that I am teaching this fall away from me without my permission," McKeown said in a TikTok post on October 19.</p>

<p>"Chair Stuart Brown has retaliated against me for making my story public about how I wasn't paid enough to afford to work at UCLA," McKeown said.</p>

<p>"It's because Brown has not approved an accommodation that I received from my doctor saying that I should be allowed to teach online indefinitely," the lecturer said. "His offer was that I have to immediately teach in person starting (October 21), of which I am unable to because I was made homeless as a result of low pay."</p>

<p>McKeown, who started working at the California university in September 2023, first went public with his financial and housing problems in September.</p>

<p>"I was paid so poorly last year and currently that I was forced to move all my belongings into a public storage unit, and I can no longer live in my one-bedroom apartment in Westwood," McKeown said in the TikTok viewed over 1.6 million times.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan's former prime minister Nawaz Sharif left for London on Friday for medical treatments, according to his party.</p>

<p>The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo's visit to the UK comes a year after he returned to Pakistan from London following a four-year-old self-imposed exile.</p>

<p>The 74-year-old three-time former premier reached the Lahore Airport from his Jati Umra residence under high security and left for London via Dubai on a foreign airline, according to the PML-N.</p>

<p>"He will stay in Dubai for one day and continue his journey to London. He may also go to the United States later," the party said.</p>

<p>Nawaz&nbsp;Sharif will spend time with his sons in London and undergo medical treatment, it said. According to Samaa TV, he is also expected to hold important meetings there.</p>

<p>His daughter, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, will also likely travel to London in the first week of next month.</p>

<p>Nawaz returned to the country in October 2023 after a four-year self-imposed exile in the UK.</p>

<p>He was tipped to be the prime minister of Pakistan for the fourth consecutive time after the February 2024 general election, but the powerful military establishment put its weight behind his younger brother, Shehbaz Sharif, who has a better equation with it.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nvidia dethroned Apple as the world's most valuable company on Friday, following a record-setting rally in the stock powered by an insatiable demand for its new supercomputing AI chips.</p>

<p>Nvidia's stock market value briefly touched $3.53 trillion, while that of Apple was $3.52 trillion, according to data from LSEG.</p>

<p>In June, Nvidia briefly became the world's most valuable company, before it was overtaken by Microsoft and Apple. The tech trio's market capitalizations have been neck-and-neck for several months. Microsoft's market value stood at $3.20 trillion.</p>

<p>Nvidia's stock has risen about 18% so far in October, with a string of gains coming after OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, announced a funding round of $6.6 billion. Nvidia provides chips used to train so-called foundation models such as OpenAI's GPT-4.</p>

<p>"More companies are now embracing artificial intelligence in their everyday tasks and demand remains strong for Nvidia chips," said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.</p>

<p>"It is certainly in a sweet spot and so long as we avoid a big economic downturn in the United States, there is a feeling that companies will continue to invest heavily in AI capabilities, creating a healthy tailwind for Nvidia."</p>

<p>Nvidia's shares hit a record high on Tuesday, building on a rally from last week when TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, posted a forecast-beating 54% jump in quarterly profit driven by soaring demand for chips used in AI.</p>

<p>The next big test will be when Nvidia reports third-quarter results in November. Nvidia in August forecast third-quarter revenue of $32.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, compared with the current average analyst expectation of $32.90 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.</p>

<p>Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore said in a note dated Oct. 10 that he remains "very bullish" about the company longer term, but the recent rally "raises the bar for earnings somewhat".</p>

<p>After a meeting with Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang, Moore noted the ramp up in production of its next-generation Blackwell chips appeared to be "quite strong" and are booked out for 12 months. The stock came under pressure in August after Nvidia confirmed reports that the production of Blackwell chips was delayed until the fourth quarter.</p>

<p>Shares of Nvidia, Apple and Microsoft have an outsized influence on the richly valued technology sector as well as the broader U.S. stock market, with the trio accounting for about a fifth of the S&amp;P 500 index's weightage.</p>

<p>Frenzy around the prospects of AI, expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will considerably bring down interest rates, and most recently, an upbeat start to the earnings season, have pushed the benchmark S&amp;P 500 to an all-time high last week.</p>

<p>Nvidia's massive gains have helped boost the stock's appeal for option traders and the company's options are among the most traded on any given day in recent months, according to data from options analytics provider Trade Alert.</p>

<p>The stock has surged nearly 190% so far this year as a boom in generative AI prompted the company to issue a series of blowout forecasts.</p>

<p>"The question is whether the revenue stream will last for a long time and will be driven by the emotion of investors rather than by any ability to prove or disprove the thesis that AI is overdone," said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.</p>

<p>"I think Nvidia knows that near term, their numbers are likely to be quite remarkable."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alphabet's self-driving unit, Waymo, said on Friday it had closed a $5.6 billion funding round led by the Google parent, as it looks to expand its autonomous ride-hailing service.</p>

<p>Automakers and technology companies are investing in autonomous ride-hailing services to capitalize on the technology to drive commercial success, even as it faces widespread skepticism and tight regulatory scrutiny.</p>

<p>The investment round also saw participation from existing investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Fidelity, Perry Creek, Silver Lake, Tiger Global, and T. Rowe Price, Waymo said.</p>

<p>"With this latest investment, we will continue to welcome more riders into our Waymo One ride-hailing service in San Francisco, Phoenix, and Los Angeles, and in Austin and Atlanta through our expanded partnership with Uber," the company said.</p>

<p>Alphabet had planned a $5 billion investment in Waymo over a multi-year period, finance chief Ruth Porat said in July.</p>

<p>Waymo, which offers paid rides in autonomous vehicles in the Bay Area and Los Angeles, as well as in Phoenix, Arizona, spent years logging millions of miles of testing before it received its first permit in 2022 from the California Public Utilities Commission, which regulates ride-hailing services.</p>

<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Wednesday that the electric vehicle maker will roll out driverless ride-hailing services to the public in California and Texas next year.</p>

<p>General Motors' Cruise is testing cars with human safety drivers after an accident last year led it to pull all vehicles from the road. Meanwhile, Amazon's Zoox is expanding testing for its vehicles built without steering wheels and pedals.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Vladimir Putin said on Friday that it was Russia's business whether or not it decided to use North Korean troops and said that if Ukraine wanted to join NATO then Moscow could do what it wanted to ensure its own security.</p>

<p>The United States said on Wednesday that it had seen evidence that North Korea has sent 3,000 troops to Russia for possible deployment in Ukraine, a move that the West is casting as a significant escalation of the Ukraine war.</p>

<p>Ukraine's military intelligence service said that the first North Korean units trained in Russia had been deployed in the Kursk region, a Russian border area where Ukrainian forces took a chunk of Russian land in August.</p>

<p>"When we have to decide something, we will decide... but it is our sovereign decision whether we will apply it, whether we will not, whether we need it," Putin told Russian state television. "This is our business."</p>

<p>Putin said that the West repeatedly said that it was up to Ukraine how it ensured its security - "with or without NATO."</p>

<p>"The sooner they realise the futility of such an approach in relations with Russia, the better it will be for everyone, and perhaps, above all, for themselves," Putin said.</p>

<p>Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un signed a comprehensive strategic partnership agreement during Putin's visit to Pyongyang in June.</p>

<p>Article 4 of the agreement says: "If one of the Parties is subjected to an armed attack by any state or several states and thus finds itself in a state of war, the other party will immediately provide military and other assistance with all means at its disposal."</p>

<p>Putin on Thursday did not deny U.S. claims that North Korea had sent troops to Russia but said on Thursday it is up to Moscow how to run its mutual defence clause with Pyongyang and accused the West of escalating the Ukraine war.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fearing China will deploy hypersonic weapons to sink ships in the Pacific, the U.S. Navy is moving forward with a plan to arm some of its vessels with Patriot interceptor missiles, two senior defense officials said.</p>

<p>One industry official said putting the highly agile Patriot Advanced Capability-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (PAC-3 MSE) interceptors, used primarily in the U.S. by the Army, aboard Navy ships anticipates advances in Chinese missile technology, including the use of highly maneuverable hypersonic weapons.</p>

<p>Integrating the Lockheed Martin-made missiles with ships' air defenses comes amid simmering tension in the Indo-Pacific region as China rapidly modernizes its military, and in the wake of successful missile defense efforts in Ukraine and the Middle East.</p>

<p>How many PAC-3 interceptors the Navy will need is uncertain, but overall demand is "through the roof," said Tom Karako, a missile defense expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.</p>

<p>He said there was strong interest from foreign governments adding that the U.S. Army wants to more than double production in coming years.</p>

<p>The U.S. has tapped Japan, a key ally, as a location for joint production of Patriot missiles, and Lockheed Martin wants to establish a new production line for the missiles' seekers in Florida, industry sources have told Reuters.</p>

<p>That plant would complement Boeing's seeker manufacturing efforts, and Lockheed Martin is pitching the benefits of additional production to the U.S. Army, which must sign off on it.</p>

<p>The PAC-3 has already shot down maneuvering hypersonic missiles in Ukraine. The Navy thinks it could add another high-probability layer to its anti-missile systems, which have not been battle-tested against such weapons.</p>

<p>The Navy told Reuters, "More testing is required in the development roadmap that will include launching PAC-3 MSE from a ship and validating communication with the SPY-1 radar," the main sensor in the Aegis missile system.</p>

<p>That follows efforts by the U.S. military that have already yielded new weapons and new strategies in the Indo-Pacific aimed at deterring Beijing from a conflict, or winning one if it occurs.</p>

<p>Beijing's most sophisticated anti-ship ballistic missile, the DF-27, which uses a hypersonic glide vehicle to maneuver to its target, was tested in 2023. The Pentagon's China military report that year said the weapon was "in development".</p>

<p>The PAC-3 is shorter-ranged than the Navy's SM-6 missiles and cannot reach into space.</p>

<p>But steering rockets near the nose make it more agile, and destruction of the threat is more likely because of its "hit to kill" concept, in which the interceptor strikes the target rather than explode near it, said a missile defense program director with direct knowledge of the Aegis system.</p>

<p>Facing advanced Chinese weapons, including hypersonic glide vehicle warheads, those qualities "supplement the existing missiles on a U.S. ship very well" by being able to more easily hit high-speed, maneuvering ballistic missiles and destroy them, said the program director.</p>

<p>Like the industry and defense officials, he declined to be identified as he was not authorized to speak to the media.</p>

<h2><strong>GROWING THREAT</strong></h2>

<p>A PAC-3 interceptor from a Patriot missile system, primarily used by the U.S. Army and allied nations for land-based air defense, was tested in May on a "virtual Aegis ship" using a Mk. 70 vertical launcher, but has not been deployed on naval vessels.</p>

<p>In the last year, however, it has intercepted numerous ballistic threats and aircraft in the Middle East and Ukraine, including Russia's advanced Khinzal missiles, making it an attractive addition to Navy magazines, the defense officials and people familiar with the matter said.</p>

<p>The PAC-3 round is also much smaller than an SM-6 or SM-3, weighing about 300 kg (660 lbs), compared with 1,500 kg for the SM-6, and is about 9 cm (3.5 inches) smaller in diameter.</p>

<p>Cost per missile varies by the customer and the deal, but both are roughly $4 million each, according to estimates.</p>

<p>China has already developed a formidable arsenal of anti-ship ballistic missiles, including the DF-21D "carrier killer," and anti-ship warheads for its DF-26 intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM).</p>

<p>Its DF-27, which the Pentagon says could reach as far as 8,000 km (5,000 miles), appears to use an aerodynamic warhead that can maneuver to evade defences or more easily hit a moving target, said Tim Wright of the missile defense initiative team at the International Institute of Strategic Studies.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[This striking "poop statue" installation serves as a symbolic critique of the January 6 Capitol riot, depicting a large, soft-serve turd placed on former House Speaker Nancy Pelosis desk]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the last 10 years, powerful symbols have frequently been used around the world to express popular outrage and protests. One of the more unusual memorials, nevertheless, has just surfaced in front of the US Capitol, which houses the US Congress and is the centre of the federal government.</p>

<p>This unusual sculpture, a massive 'poop statue' that represents the events of the Capitol attack on January 6, has drawn a lot of attention and served as a contentious and enduring reminder of the event's importance in American history.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/25/us-news/poop-statue-overlooking-capitol-creating-quite-the-stink/"><em>The New York Post, </em></a>it depicts a large, soft-served turd sitting atop former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's desk in an apparent dig at former President Donald Trump and the rioters who stormed the seat of Congress on Jan. 6, 2021.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/first-january-6-rioter-to-breach-us-capitol-jailed-for-more-than-4-years-6433249"><strong>Also Read | First January 6 Rioter To Breach US Capitol Jailed For More Than 4 Years</strong></a></p>

<p>"This memorial honours the brave men and women who broke into the United States Capitol on January 6th, 2021 to loot, urinate, and defecate throughout those hallowed halls in order to overturn an election," a plaque on the base of the statue reads.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/10/24/dc-poop-statue-jan-6-insurrection-national-mall/"><em>The Washington Post,</em></a> the National Park Service granted the permit request to Civic Crafted LLC. Julia Jimenez-Pyzik, the person who requested the permit, did not reply to text or phone messages seeking comment. The installation will remain on the Mall through October 30, according to the permit.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Maurizio Cattelan's artwork "Comedian," a banana duct-taped to a wall, returns to the spotlight as it heads to auction, with Sotheby's estimating it will fetch between $1 million and $1.5 million.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The controversial piece of art "Comedian," which is known for having a banana duct taped to a wall, is expected to fetch more than Rs 10 crore at its upcoming auction, according to <em>CNN.</em> The artwork, which was created by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan, caused a stir in the art world in 2019 when it sold for $120,000, igniting discussions about the value and significance of art.</p>

<p>According to Sotheby's auction house, this viral piece of art, one of three original editions, is anticipated to fetch between $1 million and $1.5 million.It will go on sale at Sotheby's Now and Contemporary Evening Auction in New York on November 20.</p>

<p>For their money, the winning bidder will receive a roll of duct tape and one banana, as well as a certificate of authenticity and official instructions for installing the work. Sotheby's confirmed to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/25/style/banana-artwork-maurizio-cattelan-comedian-auction/index.html"><em>CNN</em></a> that neither the tape nor, thankfully, the banana are the originals.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/offbeat/performance-artist-eats-120-000-piece-of-art-a-banana-taped-to-wall-2145208"><strong>Also Read | Performance Artist Eats $120,000 Piece Of Art - A Banana Taped To Wall</strong></a></p>

<p>Despite being written off as a gimmick at first, "Comedian" has managed to enthral viewers and collectors, demonstrating that contemporary art's tendency to push boundaries frequently makes it a distinctive investment.</p>

<p>"The most influential and radical artworks of the last century have had the power to fundamentally shift perceptions around the nature of art itself," David Galperin, Sotheby's head of contemporary art for the Americas, told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/10/25/solitary-banana-duct-taped-a-wall-sell-1-000-000-21865527/?ito=article.app.share.top.whatsapp"><em>The Metro.</em></a></p>

<p>"In this spirit, Comedian is a defiant work of pure genius. Balancing profound critical thought and subversive wit, this is a defining work for the artist and for our generation. With a single brilliant gesture, Cattelan rocked the foundations of the art world and brought art to the centre of mainstream popular culture," he said.</p>

<p>"If, at its core, Comedian questions the very notion of the value of art, then putting the work at auction this November will be the ultimate realisation of its essential conceptual idea-the public will finally have a say in deciding its true value. Whatever your take on it, you won't want to miss the sensation of the season."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The case of Ariha Shah, a three-year-old Indian girl who has been in foster care in Germany, was raised during a meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and visiting German Chancellor Olaf Scholz here on Friday, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said.</p>

<p>At a media briefing, the foreign secretary also said the chancellor has assured the Prime Minister that he is "very closely following" the issue.</p>

<p>The girl has been in foster care in Germany for more than 36 months following allegations of minor physical abuse.</p>

<p>Her parents, Bhavesh and Dhara Shah, are residents of Mira Bhayander in Maharashtra's Thane district.</p>

<p>"The case has been followed very, very closely by us.... Our embassy in Berlin has taken it up. When the external affairs minister was in Germany a few weeks ago, he had raised it very strongly with his counterpart," Mr Misri said.</p>

<p>"Yes, I can confirm that it was raised during the meeting today as well. We have at all levels impressed upon the German side that an Indian child growing up in an environment that is not hers -- cultural, religious, linguistic environment -- is somewhat unnatural and that this situation needs to be addressed," he added.</p>

<p>The foreign secretary said Scholz assured PM Modi that "he is very closely following this issue and continues to pay close attention to it" ,adding, "I am sure that both sides will remain in touch on this issue through various channels." German Ambassador to India Philipp Ackermann had said on Wednesday that German authorities are in "very close contact" with the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) and the relevant youth authorities in connection with the case of Ariha Shah.</p>

<p>Ackermann said this in response to a query during a press interaction held at his residence here on what Germany was willing to do to bring the girl back and whether her issue will be raised at the "highest level".&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said this is the right time to join India's growth story, as German Chancellor Olaf Scholz met the Prime Minister in the national capital with a business delegation.</p>

<p>Addressing the 18th Asia-Pacific Conference of German Business 2024, PM Modi said the time is ripe for foreign investors to participate in India's growth story, and join the 'Make in India' initiative and 'Make for the World'.</p>

<p>"This is the right time to join India's growth story as the country is becoming a global trade and manufacturing hub," PM Modi said, adding that the country stands on strong pillars of democracy, demography, demand, and data.</p>

<p>Germany has expressed that India's skilled manpower is amazing as the European nation has decided to increase visas for the skilled Indian workforce from 20,000 to 90,000.</p>

<p>Chancellor Scholz arrived in Delhi late on Thursday as part of his three-day official visit to India.</p>

<p>The German Chancellor said he wanted to deepen defence ties with India and bring the two countries' militaries closer.</p>

<p>"Our overall message is clear, we need more co-operation, not less. At our inter-governmental consultations with India, we also want to deepen cooperation in defence and agree to bring our militaries together," he said.</p>

<p>The German Chancellor will travel to Goa on Saturday, where the German naval frigate 'Baden-Wuerttemberg' and combat support ship 'Frankfurt am Main' are making a scheduled port call as part of Germany's Indo-Pacific deployment.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, Union Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal emphasised understanding and respecting mutual sensitivities to fast-track India-EU free trade agreement (FTA) talks.</p>

<p>Addressing the Asia-Pacific Conference of German Business, the minister stated that "extraneous" issues like labour and climate change should be discussed at international forums.</p>

<p>"A trade deal could be concluded swiftly if sensitivities were respected on both sides," Goyal told the Asia-Pacific conference of German business in the Indian capital, attended by German Economy Minister Robert Habeck.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Shoplifting in England and Wales hit record levels last year, with nearly 1,300 incidents reported daily, a 29% rise from the previous year, reaching a total of 469,788 offences.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With almost 1,300 shoplifting incidences reported per day last year, shoplifting has reached a record level in England and Wales, signalling a worrying rise in retail crime, according to <em>The Metro</em>. According to police data, 469,788 shoplifting crimes were reported in the year ending June 2024. Compared to the 365,173 cases reported the year before, this indicates a 29% rise.</p>

<p>These numbers are the highest since current records began in March 2003, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), highlighting a steady increase in shoplifting instances that has intensified recently. Retailers refer to the rise as an "epidemic," saying that the industry lost 1.8 billion pounds (Rs 18347.4) last year due to more aggressive methods and bolder thefts that frequently involved the use of weapons, according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/10/24/shoplifting-offences-surge-all-time-high-1-300-every-day-21860208/"><em>The Metro</em></a>.</p>

<p>Major shop chains are now more concerned as a result of the increase in crime. In response, the government has promised to combat minor stealing and explore new laws that would make assaulting store employees a distinct crime.</p>

<p>"As these new figures show, we are seeing far too many prolific offenders persistently steal large volumes of products in UK shops every day, and if they are stealing to fund addictions, the situation often becomes volatile and dangerous.," Matt Hood, managing director of Co-op Food, told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/10/24/shoplifting-offences-surge-all-time-high-1-300-every-day-21860208/"><em>The Metro.</em></a></p>

<p>"Crime is an occupation for some-it is not petty crime, and it is not victimless. At Co-op, we have invested over 200 million pounds in preventative measures in our shops and believe the collaborative approach between the retail industry, the police, and the government will start to instigate a change, sending out a clear message to all those who commit brazen and often violent acts of retail theft that time is now up on their criminal ways."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian and Chinese troops will complete disengagement - in the Depsang and Demchok areas of Ladakh - and fall back to pre-April 2020 positions by Tuesday, Army sources said this afternoon.</p>

<p>Troops from both sides will fall back to pre-April 2020 positions and all temporary infrastructure - sheds or tents - will be removed, while ground commanders will continue to hold regular meetings.</p>

<p>Sources said each side will also continue to have surveillance options in the Depsang and Demchok areas, and will inform the other prior to stepping out on patrol "to avoid any miscommunication".</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/india-china-agree-on-patrolling-agreement-along-lac-leads-to-disengagement-6838489" target="_blank">India and China reached a patrolling agreement last week</a> - for these regions only - that will, hopefully, put an end to over four years of military and diplomatic tension arising from the Line of Actual Control.</p>

<p>That tension was fuelled by a series of military skirmishes in the Pangong Lake area in May 2020 and included the clash in Ladakh's Galwan in June, in which 20 Indian soldiers died for their country.</p>

<p><strong>NDTV Explains |&nbsp;</strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/explained-india-china-border-patrol-agreement-and-why-it-is-important-6844560" target="_blank">India-China Border Patrol Deal: What Is It, Why Is It Important</a></p>

<p>In the weeks and months following the Galwan violence both countries ramped up military presence along the LAC, the de facto international border; in August last year it was reported that Delhi had airlifted <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/air-force-airlifted-68-000-soldiers-to-eastern-ladakh-following-galwan-clash-4294934" target="_blank">nearly 70,000 soldiers, over 90 tanks, and hundreds of infantry combat vehicles</a>, as well as deploying Sukhoi and Jaguar fighter jets in eastern Ladakh, for rapid deployment in the region.</p>

<p>Beijing had similarly deployed soldiers "in considerable numbers all across Eastern Ladakh and the Northern Front, right up to (India's) Eastern Command", the Army had said earlier.</p>

<p>On the disengagement and de-escalation process, Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi said this week that the Indian military is "trying to restore trust" in its Chinese counterpart.</p>

<p>"This (rebuilding of trust) will happen once we are able to see each other, and convince and reassure each other, that we are not creeping into buffer zones that have been created," the General said.</p>

<p>The patrolling agreement was announced - hours before Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Russia for the BRICS summit where he would hold a bilateral with China's Xi Jinping.</p>

<p><strong>READ |&nbsp;</strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/pm-modi-xi-jinping-bilateral-summit-brics-summit-russia-india-china-patrolling-agreement-pm-modi-xi-welcome-complete-disengagement-between-soldiers-al-6857182" target="_blank">PM Modi, Xi Welcome "Complete Disengagement" Along LAC</a></p>

<p>Speaking after it was confirmed, Mr Modi&nbsp;told the Chinese leader, "It should be our priority to ensure there is peace and stability along our border", and stressed the need for "mutual trust, mutual respect".</p>

<p>Earlier External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar told NDTV the agreement was the result of "patient and persevering diplomacy". Speaking at NDTV's World Summit, he said, "I think it <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/we-will-be-able-to-go-back-to-2020-patrolling-s-jaishankar-on-lac-border-row-6839082" target="_blank">creates a basis for peace and tranquillity along the border</a>, which was there before 2020..."</p>

<p>De-escalation is still a concern in other areas, including the Gogra-Hot Springs area in Ladakh, after Indian and Chinese forces backed down in September last year. However, intel indicates China continues to hold large swathes of Indian territory to the north, in the Depsang plains area.</p>

<p>Depsang is seen as critical for India since it provides access to the airstrip at Daulat Beg Oldie and prevents Chinese troops from threatening vital logistics centres in the area. Demchok, meanwhile is divided in two by the LAC; India controls the western part, which is claimed by China.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The killing of Hezbollah's powerful leader Hassan Nasrallah a month ago has marked a fundamental shift for the Iran-backed Lebanese movement and revived calls for it to surrender its vast weapons arsenal.</p>

<p>"The death of Nasrallah marked the end of an era," said analyst Sam Heller of the US-based think tank Century Foundation.</p>

<p>After decades at the helm, Nasrallah's death "will necessarily mark a shift for the organisation", Heller added.</p>

<p>Nasrallah's influence extended far beyond his loyal Shiite Muslim support base in Lebanon.</p>

<p>He was a key pillar in Iran's "axis of resistance" against the United States and Israel, which includes other armed groups in the Middle East as well as Syria.</p>

<p>Israel dealt Hezbollah a seismic blow when it assassinated Nasrallah on September 27 in a huge air strike on Beirut's southern suburbs that has thrust the movement into a new age.</p>

<p>Hezbollah was already mired in a year of cross-border exchanges of fire with Israel, which it began in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas after the October 7, 2023 attack.</p>

<p>Last month, Israel ramped up strikes on Hezbollah strongholds and sent in ground forces while killing one member of the group's top leadership after another.</p>

<p>Nasrallah, who had led the group since 1992, spearheaded operations against Israel for decades, and gained cult status among his supporters during the 2006 war.</p>

<p>According to Heller, "he was the foremost decision-maker in the organisation as it rose to prominence in Lebanon and regionally."</p>

<p>The group's governing Shura Council has yet to appoint a successor.</p>

<p>Hashem Safieddine, a cleric tipped for the post, was killed by Israel just days after Nasrallah.</p>

<p><strong>Home turf</strong></p>

<p>Hezbollah is now run by a group of leaders, according to its deputy head Naim Qassem.</p>

<p>Lebanese officials, including Prime Minister Najib Mikati, have said that their contact with the group has been cut off for weeks.</p>

<p>Nabih Berri, Lebanon's parliament speaker who heads the Hezbollah-allied Amal Movement, is tasked with speaking on the group's behalf, Qassem said in a recent speech.</p>

<p>Berri is believed to be pushing for a ceasefire, according to local media reports.</p>

<p>Hezbollah had long linked a ceasefire in Lebanon to an end to fighting in Gaza, a position it has yet to formally reverse.</p>

<p>Even with the group appearing on the back foot, its fighters continue to fire dozens of rockets daily into Israel, some reaching major cities like Haifa and Tel Aviv.</p>

<p>This week, Hezbollah claimed a drone strike on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's home in the coastal town of Caesarea.</p>

<p>The group says Israeli forces have not been able to take full control of any village in Lebanon, weeks into a ground invasion.</p>

<p>Israeli forces operating in Lebanon "face very fierce resistance and are forced to retreat under heavy blows", said a source close to Hezbollah.</p>

<p>"The maximum depth the Israelis have reached is estimated at about two kilometres (1.2 miles)," said the source, requesting anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.</p>

<p>Hezbollah, he said, has the advantage because it is fighting on its own terrain, knowing which "trees and rocks" to hide behind.</p>

<p><strong>'Disarm'</strong></p>

<p>Hezbollah is widely believed to be better armed than Lebanon's national military, and remains the only group that did not surrender its weapons after the 1975-1990 civil war.</p>

<p>After years of dominating political life in Lebanon, Hezbollah is facing new calls from its critics within the country to change.</p>

<p>Lebanese computer engineer Elie Jabbour told AFP he believes the only way forward is for Hezbollah to give up its weapons.</p>

<p>"The war cannot end before Hezbollah is disarmed," he said.</p>

<p>"When that happens, it can join state institutions as a political party only," said the 27-year-old.</p>

<p>A ceasefire in Lebanon has been tied to the implementation of a UN resolution that ended the last Israel-Hezbollah war in 2006.</p>

<p>UN Security Council Resolution 1701 states that only the Lebanese army and UN peacekeepers should deploy in areas south of the Litani River -- an area Hezbollah has long operated in.</p>

<p>But Lebanon is grappling with a prolonged crisis, leaving the country rudderless until a president is elected after a two-year void.</p>

<p>Many in Lebanon blame Hezbollah for blocking the vote.</p>

<p>Samir Geagea, leader of the Lebanese Forces party and a longtime Hezbollah opponent, said any new president must not "leave any group or weapon outside the framework of the state".</p>

<p>Prime Minister Najib Mikati said on Thursday that only the state should carry weapons.</p>

<p>But in a country long wracked by division, attempts to "marginalise Hezbollah politically will... invite a violent response" from the group, Heller said.</p>

<p>It "will end in intra-Lebanese conflict," he added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

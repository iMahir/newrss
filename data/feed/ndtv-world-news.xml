       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has reacted to a video showing a terrifying accident involving his company's Model Y car. The footage, shared on X, captured the electric SUV rolling over several times before landing. Miraculously, all passengers survived without serious injuries.&nbsp;<br />

The billionaire reposted the video, writing, “Safety is our primary design goal.”</p>

<p>Mr Musk's reaction came after a recent crash in Orange County, California, where a Tesla driver was reportedly speeding and crashed, causing the vehicle to flip into oncoming traffic, reported KTLA News.</p>

<p>Three people, including the Tesla driver, were hospitalised; their conditions were not immediately available.</p>

<p>Witnesses said the Tesla driver was driving at an estimated over 100 miles per hour. The crash involved six vehicles, with two overturning and trapping people inside. First responders extricated the victims, including the Tesla driver, and rushed them to the hospital.</p>

<p>An eye witness, who was waiting at a red light, recalled the car approaching at "over 100 miles" per hour.</p>

<p>"She smacked the cars right next to me. I don't know how she missed me," the witness said, stressing that the Tesla driver caused the crash.</p>

<p>A worker heard the tyres screech and saw the crash unfold. Recounting the "scary" experience, he said, "Cars are flipping over right outside the window, and it takes you a little bit out of reality."</p>

<p>Police are investigating the cause of the crash, saying it was possible that alcohol or drugs could also be involved.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The US has reaffirmed its commitment to partnering with the Maldives to promote a free, open, and secure Indo-Pacific region, a senior state department official has said, amidst the archipelagic nation in the Indian Ocean moving closer to China.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US has reaffirmed its commitment to partnering with the Maldives to promote a free, open, secure, and prosperous Indo-Pacific region, a senior state department official has said, amidst the archipelagic nation in the Indian Ocean moving closer to China.</p>

<p>This message was conveyed when US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with visiting Maldivian Foreign Minister Moosa Zameer on Tuesday in Washington, DC.</p>

<p>Secretary Blinken reaffirmed the US commitment to partnering with Maldives to promote a free, open, secure, and prosperous Indo-Pacific region, state department spokesperson Matthew Miller said.</p>

<p>Ever since Maldivian leader Mohamed Muizzu, known for his pro-China leanings, assumed charge as President in November last year, the Maldives has stepped up ties with Beijing and inked several bilateral agreements, including a defence cooperation deal.</p>

<p>Blinken's reference to the Indo-Pacific is also significant since China is vehemently opposed to the US and other countries getting involved in a region where Beijing has major maritime territorial disputes with countries such as the Philippines and Vietnam.</p>

<p>Blinken highlighted the US donation of eight patrol boats to the Maldives and, working with Congress, the planned provision of $2 million in hydrographic support to help the country mitigate the impact of rising sea levels, Miller said in a statement.</p>

<p>Blinken and Zameer discussed additional opportunities to enhance cooperation on addressing the climate crisis, economic growth, maritime security, and other bilateral priorities, it said.</p>

<p>In Male, the foreign ministry said Zameer and Blinken discussed matters in the area of defence and security cooperation, commitment to economic growth and adapting to climate change among other issues and expressed their commitment to regional stability and maritime security.</p>

<p>"Met with Maldivian Foreign Minister @MoosaZameer to enhance the US-Maldives partnership and cooperation on climate, economic growth, and maritime security," posted Blinken on his X handle with the photos of the meeting.</p>

<p>Almost echoing the sentiment, Zameer posted on his X handle, "I am delighted to meet with the Honourable @SecBlinken, Secretary of State of the US, today. I reaffirmed our commitment to further strengthen the partnership between the Maldives and US in tackling climate change, promoting democracy and cooperation in maritime security."</p>

<p>A statement from the Maldives Foreign Ministry said that the Maldives and the United States reaffirmed their commitment to explore new avenues "to strengthen the partnership" and acknowledged the importance of upholding a rules-based international order and expressed their commitment to regional stability, maritime security and promoting peace.</p>

<p>"Secretary Blinken congratulated the Maldives on the successful Presidential and Parliamentary elections and acknowledged the Maldives' leadership in the international fora towards combating climate change and promoting environmental sustainability," the statement said.</p>

<p>News portal Sun.mv said that earlier on Tuesday, Zameer met with Samantha Power, the Administrator of the US Agency for International Development (USAID).</p>

<p>"The two deliberated on various themes related to economical advancements and protecting the environment in addition to consolidating Maldivian associations with the agency's assistance," Edition.mv said.</p>

<p>Zameer had left for Washington on Sunday night, in a visit that the Foreign Ministry said seeks to "further strengthen the Maldives - US partnership and reaffirm commitment to multilateralism," Sun.mv said.</p>

<p>Zameer will also travel to New York, where he will meet with the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the UN Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs, Li Junhua, media reports said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Steven van de Velde was sentenced in March 2016 to four years in prison after admitting to three counts of rape against a child he met on Facebook]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Dutch beach volleyball player, who raped a 12-year-old British girl, has qualified for next month's Paris Olympics despite being told by a judge that his dream of representing the Netherlands was "shattered."</p>

<p>Steven van de Velde was sentenced in March 2016 to four years in prison after admitting to three counts of rape against a child he met on Facebook. In August 2014, at the age of 19, he flew from the Netherlands to the UK to meet his victim, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/volleyball/2024/06/25/volleyball-steven-van-der-velde-raped-british-12-olympics/"><em>Telegraph </em></a>reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Judge Francis Sheridan told him, "Prior to coming to this country you were training as a potential Olympian. Your hopes of representing your country now lie as a shattered dream."</p>

<p>However, Van de Velde, who was released after serving only 12 months in a Dutch prison, has since been permitted to rehabilitate his Olympic career. This month, he secured his spot in the national pair for the Paris Games alongside Matthew Immers.</p>

<p>Upon sentencing at Aylesbury Crown Court after being extradited from his homeland, his defense lawyer, Linda Strudwick, commented on the verdict: "The headlines say it all: 'A sex monster.' It's plainly a career end for him."</p>

<p>It has proven otherwise, as Van de Velde, now 29, has successfully rebuilt his beach volleyball career to the extent that he and Immer are now ranked as the 11th team in the world heading to Paris next month.</p>

<p>Van de Velde's resurgence poses a significant ethical dilemma for the International Olympic Committee. Each Paris Olympian is required to sign an Athletes' Rights and Responsibilities Declaration, which includes a mandate to "act as a role model."</p>

<p>Having travelled from Amsterdam to Milton Keynes to engage in sexual activity with a 12-year-old girl, a fact acknowledged in strong terms by the judge in 2016, Van de Velde had previously communicated with the victim on social media before arranging the visit, during which he took her virginity while her mother was away.</p>

<p>"Your actions have wrecked your life and you could, had you never come to England and committed these offences, have been a leader in your sport," Judge Sheridan said. "A young, naive, foolish child had formed the view that you loved her. In reality, you only knew her on the internet, had never met her before and were fully aware of the age difference."</p>

<p>Upon his release in 2017, having served only a quarter of his sentence, Van de Velde, who had cried in court upon learning about the girl's subsequent self-harm and overdose, stated: "I want to correct all the nonsense that has been written about me while I was imprisoned. I deliberately didn't read any of it, but I understand it was quite severe, branding me as a sex monster, as a paedophile. That I am not, really not.</p>

<p>"Everyone is entitled to their opinion about me, but it's only fair if they also hear my side of the story."</p>

<p>These remarks elicited a scathing response from the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, which stated: "Van de Velde's lack of remorse and self-pity is astonishing, and we can only imagine how distressed his victim must feel upon seeing his comments.</p>

<p>"Grooming can leave a child feeling ashamed or even guilty, because they believe they have somehow willingly participated when, in reality, an adult has preyed upon them for sexual exploitation."</p>

<p>The Dutch Olympic committee has not yet commented on Van de Velde's qualification for Paris. According to The Australian, the country's volleyball federation has yet to finalize its athlete selections. The IOC has been contacted for a response.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[A shaven-headed Evan Gershkovich went on trial behind closed doors on Wednesday in a Russian court where the US journalist is facing accusations of espionage.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A shaven-headed Evan Gershkovich went on trial behind closed doors on Wednesday in a Russian court where the US journalist is facing accusations of espionage.</p>

<p>Prosecutors say the Wall Street Journal reporter gathered secret information on the orders of the US Central Intelligence Agency about a company that manufactures tanks for Russia's war in Ukraine. If convicted, he faces a sentence of up to 20 years.</p>

<p>Gershkovich, his newspaper and the US government all reject the allegations and say that he was just doing his job as a reporter accredited by Russia's Foreign Ministry to work there.</p>

<p>"His case is not about evidence, procedural norms, or the rule of law. It is about the Kremlin using American citizens to achieve its political objectives," the US embassy in Moscow said in a statement, calling for Gershkovich's immediate release.</p>

<p>After several hours of closed proceedings, the court said the next session would take place on Aug. 13 - an indication the case will drag on for months. The reason for the long interval was not clear.</p>

<p>Journalists were briefly allowed to film the 32-year-old Gershkovich before the start of the trial, from which the media are barred. Wearing an open-necked shirt and standing in a glass box, he smiled faintly and nodded at colleagues he recognised.</p>

<p>Prosecutor Mikael Ozdoyev later summarised the charges for reporters.</p>

<p>"The investigation established and documented that... Gershkovich, on instructions from the CIA, in September 2023, in the Sverdlovsk region, collected secret information about the activities of a defence enterprise regarding the production and repair of military equipment," Ozdoyev said.</p>

<p>"Gershkovich carried out the illegal actions while observing painstaking conspiratorial measures," he added.</p>

<p>Ozdoyev later told reporters he had misspoken, and the alleged offence was actually in March 2023 - the month of the reporter's arrest.</p>

<h2><strong>Closed Hearing</strong></h2>

<p>Closed trials are standard procedure in Russia for cases of alleged treason or espionage involving classified state material, which typically can last several months.</p>

<p>The Kremlin says the case, and the arrangements for it, are a matter for the court, but has stated - without publishing evidence - that Gershkovich was caught "red-handed".</p>

<p>Against the background of the Ukraine war, Gershkovich and other Americans detained in Russia have been caught up in the gravest crisis between Moscow and Washington for more than 60 years.</p>

<p>President Vladimir Putin has said Russia is open to the idea of a prisoner exchange involving Gershkovich and that contacts with the United States have taken place, but they must remain secret.</p>

<p>The US has accused Russia of conducting "hostage diplomacy". It has designated Gershkovich and another jailed American, Paul Whelan, as "wrongfully detained" and says it is committed to bringing them home.</p>

<p>The US embassy statement said Russian authorities had failed to provide evidence supporting the charges against Gershkovich or to explain why his work as a journalist constituted a crime.</p>

<p>The trial is taking place in the city of Yekaterinburg, where officers of the FSB security service arrested Gershkovich on March 29, 2023, while he was eating in a steakhouse. Since then he has spent nearly 16 months in Moscow's Lefortovo prison.</p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal has declined to comment on the purpose of his reporting trip to Russia's Urals region or on the specific allegation by prosecutors that Gershkovich was trying to gather information on Uralvagonzavod, a supplier of tanks for Russia's war in Ukraine.</p>

<p>"He was there as an accredited journalist, doing his job," Wall Street Journal publisher Almar Latour told Reuters in a phone interview before the trial.</p>

<p>Many Western news organisations pulled staff out of Russia after Putin sent his army into Ukraine in February 2022. Russia then passed laws that set long prison terms for "discrediting" the armed forces or spreading "fake news" about them.</p>

<p>Gershkovich was one of a small number of Western reporters, also including journalists from Reuters, who continued to report from inside Russia.</p>

<p>Another journalist, Russian-American Alsu Kurmasheva, was arrested last year and is awaiting trial on charges of violating Russia's "foreign agent" law and spreading false information about the armed forces, which she denies.</p>

<p>Earlier this month a French researcher, Laurent Vinatier, was arrested and accused of failing to register as a foreign agent while gathering information about Russia's military.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Assange landed on a chilly Canberra evening in a private jet hours after being freed by a court in the US Pacific territory of Northern Mariana Islands.</p>

<p>He admitted to one count of revealing US defence secrets in exchange for being sentenced by the US judge to time already served in London's Belmarsh prison -- five years and two months.</p>

<p>The agreement allowed him to walk free and return home to Australia.</p>

<p>"He just arrived in Australia after being in a high-security prison for over five years and a long 72-hour flight, or something like that -- it's premature," Stella Assange said.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australia's Prime Minister said Wednesday a string of recent non-disclosed missions to the United States helped to forge the plea deal that freed Julian Assange.</p>

<p>The 52-year-old WikiLeaks founder landed in Canberra hours earlier, after earning his liberty by pleading guilty to a single count of conspiracy to obtain and disseminate US national defence information.</p>

<p>He was sentenced by a court in the US Pacific territory of Northern Mariana Islands to time already served in London's high-security Belmarsh prison -- five years and two months -- and allowed to walk free.</p>

<p>The US Department of Justice had to make a "range of decisions" for the plea deal to proceed, Anthony Albanese told a news conference in Canberra, stressing that the US department was independent and "not subject to political influence".</p>

<p>A "whole range of people" had visited the United States as the deal was worked out, the Australian leader told reporters.</p>

<p>"I am surprised that some of it was missed by the people in this room -- some of the visits -- but it's not up to me to indicate that," Albanese said.</p>

<p>He advised journalists to "go back and look at some diaries and who has travelled to the United States in recent months".</p>

<p>Albanese said he had exchanged "directly" with Assange's lawyers during the negotiations.</p>

<p>Australia's high commissioner to the United Kingdom, Stephen Smith, also acted as a conduit for communication, visiting Assange in Belmarsh, the prime minister said.</p>

<p>"The details of the plea deal were worked through over a period of time," he said.</p>

<p>"This was the only way that I could see a resolution being achieved -- and the objective here was to conclude these matters."</p>

<p>Albanese said he had never met with Assange but spoke with him the moment his jet touched down in Canberra as part of a mutually agreed plan.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After Julian Assange was released by a court on the remote US Pacific territory of Saipan on Wednesday, ending a 14-year legal battle, the WikiLeaks founder's lawyer first thanked Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese for making the outcome possible.</p>

<p>Jennifer Robinson, the Australian attorney of Assange, said diplomacy and intense lobbying with the highest authorities in the US played a big role in Assange walking free, after spending five years in a high-security British prison and seven years holed up in the Ecuadorean embassy in London.</p>

<p>"At every opportunity, and when Australian officials were making outreach to the US, they knew that they were acting with the full authority of the prime minister of Australia," Robinson told reporters outside the courtroom in Saipan.</p>

<p>Albanese has claimed Assange's release as a win for the country, which leveraged its security ties with Washington and London to strengthen its case to resolve the plight of an Australian citizen.</p>

<p>"This work has been complex and it has been considered. This is what standing up for Australians around the world looks like," Albanese, leader of a centre-left Labor government, told parliament on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Assange, who landed in Australia on Wednesday evening, had faced a maximum jail sentence of 175 years after being charged with 17 counts of breaching the US Espionage Act and a hacking-related charge. Under a deal revealed on Tuesday, he pled guilty to a single charge of espionage and walked free.</p>

<p>The deal gained momentum as the US faced growing challenges in the UK over the legality of extraditing Assange, while Australian lawmakers and diplomats raised the heat in Washington and London.</p>

<h2><strong>Political Shift</strong></h2>

<p>A decade ago under a conservative government, there was little political will in Canberra to back Assange's case. But things changed in 2023 when dozens of lawmakers across the political spectrum swung in behind the campaign to bring him home, his father, John Shipton, told Reuters.</p>

<p>That swing culminated in the passage of a parliamentary motion in February this year calling for Assange's release.</p>

<p>Shipton told Reuters the Australian government had been "nothing short of magnificent" and praised former prime minister Kevin Rudd and former defence minister Stephen Smith, Australia's top envoys to the US and Britain.</p>

<p>Australian conservative lawmaker Barnaby Joyce, a former deputy prime minister, was among a cross-party group of politicians who travelled to Washington in September to lobby for a resolution.</p>

<p>Joyce said on Wednesday the trip made the case on Capitol Hill that Australian politicians wanted to "get this thing done", because it was a distraction to Australia's security alliance with the United States.</p>

<p>Long-time advisor to the Australian campaign for Assange, lawyer Greg Barns, said US politicians saw on that trip that "this wasn't a party political issue".</p>

<p>One government official who did not want to be identified said the first big break for Assange came in January 2021, when then shadow Attorney General Mark Dreyfus issued a statement calling for the case against Assange to end after a British court found that it would be unjust to extradite him to the US.</p>

<p>"This was the first indication that a major political party in Australia was supporting the cause to free Assange," the official said.</p>

<h2><strong>Enough Is Enough</strong></h2>

<p>When Labor won power in May 2022, Assange finally had state diplomatic support behind him. Later that year Albanese called for his release on the floor of the House of Representatives, the first time a Prime Minister had mentioned Assange in parliament since 2012.</p>

<p>"Enough is enough, it is time for this matter to be brought to a conclusion," he said.</p>

<p>"My position is clear and has been made clear to the US administration that it is time that this matter be brought to a close. This is an Australian citizen."</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, Albanese and senior cabinet colleagues including Foreign Minister Penny Wong and Attorney General Dreyfus used visits to the US to lobby their counterparts, according to the government official.</p>

<p>The appointment of Smith and Rudd to the top diplomatic jobs in London and Washington in late 2022 added two more sympathetic lobbyists for Assange's cause.</p>

<p>Smith visited Assange in Belmarsh prison in April 2023, the first such visit by Australia's top UK diplomat since he was imprisoned four years earlier.</p>

<p>Deeper ties between Australia and the US through the AUKUS security pact helped push diplomatic efforts along, said Mark Kenny, a professor at Australian National University.</p>

<p>"It looks pretty odd if we're getting ever closer to the US and yet we don't have a special relationship with the US such that we can advocate and get concessions for an Australian citizen," Kenny said.</p>

<h2><strong>Final Details</strong></h2>

<p>As recently as last July, US officials appeared determined to prosecute Assange. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that month Australia needed to understand US concerns over the issue.</p>

<p>However, a month later, US Ambassador to Australia Caroline Kennedy said a deal was possible.</p>

<p>After the cross-party delegation of Australian politicians travelled to Washington in September to speak to Republican and Democrat lawmakers about the Assange case, the Biden administration appeared to be softening its response.</p>

<p>Joe Biden said in April, "We are considering it," when asked by media about Australia's request to end Assange's prosecution.</p>

<p>But it was the UK High Court's decision in May to allow Assange to appeal against his extradition that triggered the breakthrough in negotiations over a plea deal according to his wife Stella.</p>

<p>The court's decision meant the legal battle over extradition would likely be delayed for months more to make time for appeals.</p>

<p>An early plan to have Assange fly to New York or Washington to enter his plea was changed to Saipan because of Assange's opposition to entering the continental United States, according to an Australian government official.</p>

<p>The deal marks the end of a legal saga following WikiLeaks' mass release of secret US documents in 2010 - one of the largest security breaches in US military history.</p>

<p>As Assange was moved from Belmarsh prison to London's Stansted airport in the dead of night on Monday, the secrecy was such that his children weren't told in case they spilled details about his release, according to his wife Stella Assange.</p>

<p>In a global outpouring of support following the news, a crowdfunding campaign to raise the $520,000 owed to the Australian government for the flights had already raised almost 330,000 pounds ($418,000) by Wednesday evening.</p>

<p>"I don't think that would have happened if it hadn't been for the incredible support that there has been for Julian, and which has been building over the years, which is global, which is across all sectors, all politics," she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some of the world's biggest music production companies, including Sony Music Entertainment, are suing two US-based artificial intelligence (AI) platforms Suno and Udio that generate songs based on text prompts, news agency Associated Press reported.</p>

<p>The lawsuit was announced by the Recording Industry Association of America on Tuesday, stating Universal Group Recordings and Warner Records are also plaintiffs in the lawsuit. The case against Suno AI has been filed in Boston federal court, and of Udio AI in New York.</p>

<p>The case seeks damages of $150,000 per song infringement, alleging some popular songs like Mariah Carey's Christmas classic "All I Want for Christmas Is You" have been replicated by the AI music generators.</p>

<p>Suno AI came under the limelight in December last year when Microsoft partnered with it, integrating it inside Microsoft's own chatbot Copilot.</p>

<p>Music artists have expressed apprehensions over AI-generated music. Over 200 artists from across genres, including Billie Elish, Nikki Minaj and Zayn Malik, signed an open letter on 1 April, asking developers, tech companies and music platforms "to cease the use of AI to infringe upon and devalue the rights of human artists." The letter expressed concern of AI-generated content flooding platforms and diluting royalty pools.</p>

<p>According to the Financial Times, Sony Music in May sent warning letters to 700 AI developers and music streaming platforms, asking them to not use data owned by Sony for training, developing or commercialising AI systems.</p>

<p>In India, AR Rehman has embraced the use of AI to produce music, using it to recreate the voice of late singers Bamba Bakya and Shahul Hameed in the song 'Thimiri Yezhuda' that released on January 26 for the movie 'Lal Salaam'. The Oscar winning singer and composer took to X (formerly Twitter) at the time to clarify that technology can be used to enhance the musical experience ethically.</p>

<p>Assange landed on a chilly Canberra evening in a private jet, the final act of an international drama that led him from a five-year stretch in the high-security Belmarsh prison in Britain to a courtroom in a US Pacific island territory and, finally, home.</p>

<p>His white hair swept back, the Australian raised a fist as he emerged from the plane door, striding across the tarmac to give a hug to his wife Stella that lifted her off the ground, and then to embrace his father.</p>

<p>Dozens of television journalists, photographers, and reporters peered through the airport fencing to see Assange, who wore a dark suit, white shirt, and brown tie.</p>

<p>WikiLeaks said on X that it would hold a press conference in the Australian capital at 9:15 pm (1115 GMT) on Wednesday, but did not say if Assange would be present.</p>

<p>"He will be able to spend quality time with his wife Stella, and his two children, be able to walk up and down on the beach and feel the sand through his toes in winter -- that lovely chill," said <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/julian-assanges-father-awaits-his-arrival-in-australia-says-my-faith-never-ever-ever-died-5973543">Assange's father, John Shipton</a>.</p>

<p>Assange's long battle with US prosecutors came to an unexpected end in the Northern Mariana Islands where a judge accepted his guilty plea on a single count of conspiracy to obtain and disseminate national defence information.</p>

<p>The remote courtroom was chosen because of the 52-year-old's unwillingness to go to the continental United States and because of its proximity to Australia.</p>

<h2><strong>'A free man'</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

<p>As part of a behind-the-scenes legal negotiation with the US Justice Department he was sentenced to the time he had already served in London -- five years and two months -- and given his liberty.</p>

<p>"You will be able to walk out of this courtroom <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/wikileaks-founder-julian-assange-freed-in-us-plea-deal-hearing-5971114">a free man</a>," the judge told him.</p>

<p>Assange had published hundreds of thousands of confidential US documents on the whistleblowing website from 2010.</p>

<p>He became a hero to free speech campaigners but a villain to those who thought he endangered US security and intelligence sources.</p>

<p>"Working as a journalist, I encouraged my source to provide material that was said to be classified," Assange told the court.</p>

<p>Assange's lawyer Jen Robinson told reporters it was a "historic day" that "brings to an end 14 years of legal battles".</p>

<p>"It also brings to an end a case which has been recognised as the greatest threat to the First Amendment in the 21st century," she said.</p>

<h2><strong>'Too long'</strong></h2>

<p>Australian Prime Minster Anthony Albanese said he was "very pleased" by the outcome.</p>

<p>"Regardless of your views about his activities, and they will be varied, Mr Assange's case has dragged on for too long," he told parliament in Canberra.</p>

<p>The United Nations also hailed Assange's release, saying the case had raised human rights concerns.</p>

<p>But former US vice president Mike Pence slammed the plea deal on social media platform X as a "miscarriage of justice" that "dishonors the service and sacrifice of the men and women of our Armed Forces."</p>

<p>The US Justice Department said after the hearing that Assange was banned from returning there without permission.</p>

<p>US authorities had wanted to put Assange on trial for divulging military secrets about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>

<p>He was indicted by a US federal grand jury in 2019 on 18 counts stemming from WikiLeaks' publication of a trove of national security documents.</p>

<p>The material he released through WikiLeaks included videos showing civilians being killed by fire from a US helicopter gunship in Iraq in 2007. The victims included a photographer and a driver from Reuters.</p>

<h2><strong>'Can't stop crying'</strong></h2>

<p>In 2019, he was arrested and held in Belmarsh prison while fighting extradition to the United States.</p>

<p>He had spent seven years in Ecuador's embassy in London to avoid being extradited to Sweden, where he faced accusations of sexual assault that were eventually dropped.</p>

<p>He met his wife Stella Assange while holed up in the embassy, and the pair married in a ceremony in London's Belmarsh prison. They have two young children.</p>

<p>"I can't stop crying," Stella, who was waiting for him in Australia, said on X.</p>

<p>"I am beyond excited," she later told reporters as she left a Canberra hotel together with Assange's father to see her husband at the airport.</p>

<p>The announcement of the plea deal came two weeks before Assange was scheduled to appear in court in Britain to appeal against a ruling that approved his extradition to the United States.</p>

<p>Washington had accused Assange under the 1917 Espionage Act and supporters warned he risked being sentenced to 175 years in prison.</p>

<p>The plea deal was not entirely unexpected. US President Joe Biden had been under growing pressure to drop the long-running case against Assange.</p>

<p>The Australian government made an official request to that effect in February and Biden said he would consider it, raising hopes among Assange supporters that his ordeal might end.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Julian Assange's father, John Shipton, could breathe a massive sigh of relief on Wednesday after a decade-long campaign to free his son.</p>

<p>The WikiLeaks founder on Wednesday was released by a court on the U.S. Pacific island territory of Saipan after pleading guilty to violating U.S. espionage law.</p>

<p>Assange's family, including his father, children and wife, Stella, gathered in Australia's capital Canberra ahead of his expected evening arrival by private jet, marking the end of a long legal fight tied to WikiLeaks' release of hundreds of thousands of classified U.S. defence documents in 2010.</p>

<p>Shipton said he planned to ask his son in a low-key Australian way when he arrives: "Where have you been?"</p>

<p>"My faith has never, ever, ever died," he told Reuters in an interview at parliament.</p>

<p>"That Julian can come home to Australia and see his family regularly and do the ordinary things of life is a treasure. Life measured amongst the beauty of the ordinary is the essence of life," Shipton said.</p>

<p>He said he was "divided in two" on the deal that saw Assange plead guilty to one charge of espionage, saying his release meant he would have precious time with his sons.</p>

<p>He was nonetheless concerned about the "political and legal circumstances surrounding it".</p>

<p>"I think it is going to be a problem for journalists and publishers anywhere in the world to publish criticism of the United States government," he said.</p>

<p>Assange's release was cause for celebration in Canberra, where politicians who had campaigned for Assange gathered around Shipton in a hall outside the parliament chamber.</p>

<p>"We want to give you a hug," said lawmaker Sophie Scamps.</p>

<p>Assange will need time to recover from his "monastic life" in self-exile in the Ecuadorian embassy in London for seven years, and then prison for five years, Shipton said.</p>

<p>He looked forward to being involved in his son's "practical everyday human life, not the sweep of politics."</p>

<p>"The American Secret Service in 2011 published their review saying we must hound him and his family to the end of the earth and bankrupt them. Its been expensive but I've got no complaints - the results are there for everyone to see," he said.</p>

<p>He said the Australian government had been "nothing short of magnificent".</p>

<p>Assange has previously said he got his "rebel gene" from his father. Shipton said he considers his son to be personally conservative and polite.</p>

<p>"It is his understanding of the capacity of the internet to bring to us information that can be the foundation of knowledge that is revolutionary," he said.</p>

<p>"He is only 52 I imagine he will find something to do. He will be 53 next week. The momentum he has got ... he will conjure forth those things that he can do."</p>

<p>Shipton said the family had devoted the last decade to doing everything in its capacity to see Assange free.</p>

<p>"We Australians managed to turn around a superpower in its attempt to destroy an Australian citizen," he said.</p>

<p>Shipton learned of the plea deal from his son Gabriel.</p>

<p>Gabriel told Reuters on Wednesday he was "feeling extremely relieved that this ordeal is finally over and that Julian can move on with his life."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The death count from protests in Kenya has climbed to 13, an official from the main doctors' association told AFP Wednesday, after anti-tax hike rallies turned violent and police opened fire at demonstrators who ransacked parliament.</p>

<p>The unprecedented scenes that left parts of parliament ablaze and destroyed and injured scores of people on Tuesday have shocked Kenyans and prompted President William Ruto's government to deploy the military.</p>

<p>The mainly youth-led rallies began mostly peacefully last week, with thousands of demonstrators marching in the capital Nairobi, and across the country against the tax increases.</p>

<p>But tensions flared sharply on Tuesday afternoon, as police officers fired live rounds on crowds that later ransacked the parliament complex.</p>

<p>Hours later, Defence Minister Aden Bare Duale announced that the government had deployed the army to support the police in tackling "the security emergency" in the country.</p>

<p>"So far, we have at least 13 people killed, but this is not the final number," Simon Kigondu, president of the Kenya Medical Association said, adding that he had never seen "such level of violence against unarmed people."</p>

<p>"Deaths, mayhem", read the front-page headline on the Standard newspaper, while the Daily Nation described the situation as "Pandemonium", saying: "The foundations of the country have been shaken to the core."</p>

<p>An official at Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi said Wednesday that medics were treating "160 people... some of them with soft tissue injuries, some of them with bullet wounds".</p>

<p>In a late-night press briefing, Ruto warned that his government would take a tough line against "violence and anarchy", likening some of the demonstrators to "criminals".</p>

<p>"It is not in order or even conceivable that criminals pretending to be peaceful protesters can reign terror against the people, their elected representatives, and the institutions established under our constitution and expect to go scot-free," he said.</p>

<p>The government has been taken by surprise by the intensity of opposition to its tax proposals -- mostly led by young, Gen-Z Kenyans -- which culminated in the scenes at parliament that played out live on television.</p>

<p>Images shared on local TV stations after crowds broke through the barricades showed the building ransacked, with burnt furniture and smashed windows.</p>

<p>As police fired at the angry crowds, leaving several bodies strewn on the ground, protest organisers urged people to walk home together and "stay safe".</p>

<h3><strong>'Madness'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>A heavy police presence was deployed around parliament early on Wednesday, according to an AFP reporter, the smell of tear gas still in the air.</p>

<p>A policeman standing in front of the broken barricades to the complex told AFP he had watched the scenes unfold on TV.</p>

<p>"It was madness, we hope it will be calm today," he said.</p>

<p>Earlier on Tuesday, the rallies in various Kenyan cities had been largely peaceful.</p>

<p>However, tensions escalated in Nairobi later in the day, with some protesters hurling stones at police, who deployed tear gas and water cannons before firing live bullets.</p>

<p>AFP journalists saw three people bleeding heavily and lying motionless on the ground near parliament.</p>

<h3><strong>'Brute force'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The unrest has alarmed the international community, with the White House appealing for calm and more than 10 Western nations -- including Canada, Germany, and Britain -- saying they were "especially shocked by the scenes witnessed outside the Kenyan Parliament".</p>

<p>UN chief Antonio Guterres and the head of the African Union Commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat, have also expressed deep concern.</p>

<p>Veteran opposition leader Raila Odinga, who heads the Azimio coalition, accused the government of unleashing "brute force on our country's children".</p>

<p>Rights watchdogs have also accused the authorities of abducting protesters.</p>

<p>The police have not responded to any AFP requests for comment.</p>

<h3><strong>Cost of living&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Long-running grievances over the rising cost of living spiraled last week as lawmakers began debating proposed tax hikes in the 2024 finance bill.</p>

<p>The cash-strapped government says the increases are needed to service the country's massive debt of some 10 trillion shillings ($78 billion), equal to roughly 70 percent of Kenya's GDP.</p>

<p>After rolling back some of the more controversial proposals -- which would have affected bread purchases, car ownership, and financial and mobile services -- the government now intends to increase fuel prices and export duties.</p>

<p>Kenya's treasury has warned of a gaping budget shortfall of 200 billion shillings, following Ruto's decision to roll back some of the tax hikes.</p>

<p>While Kenya is among East Africa's most dynamic economies, a third of its 52 million population live in poverty.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NATO allies on Wednesday selected Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte as NATO's next boss, as the war in Ukraine rages on its doorstep and uncertainty hangs over the United States' future attitude to the transatlantic alliance.</p>

<p>Rutte's appointment became a formality after his only rival for the post, Romanian President Klaus Iohannis, announced last week that he had quit the race, having failed to gain traction.</p>

<p>"The North Atlantic Council decided to appoint Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte as the next Secretary General of NATO, succeeding Jens Stoltenberg," NATO said in a statement.</p>

<p>"Mr Rutte will assume his functions as Secretary General from 1 October 2024, when Mr Stoltenberg's term expires after ten years at the helm of the Alliance," it added.</p>

<p>After declaring his interest in the post last year, Rutte gained early support from key members of the alliance including the United States, Britain, France and Germany.</p>

<p>Others were more reticent, particularly Eastern European countries which argued the post should go to someone from their region for the first time.</p>

<p>But they ultimately rowed in behind Rutte, a fierce critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin and a staunch ally of Ukraine.</p>

<p>Stoltenberg said he warmly welcomed the selection of Rutte as his successor.</p>

<p>"Mark is a true transatlanticist, a strong leader, and a consensus-builder," he said. "I know I am leaving NATO in good hands."</p>

<p>NATO takes decisions by consensus so Rutte, who is bowing out of Dutch politics after nearly 14 years as prime minister, could only be confirmed once all 32 alliance members gave him their backing.</p>

<p>Rutte will face the challenge of sustaining allies' support for Ukraine's fight against Russia's invasion while guarding against NATO's being drawn directly into a war with Moscow.</p>

<p>He will also have to contend with the possibility that NATO-sceptic Donald Trump may return to the White House after November's U.S. presidential election.</p>

<p>Trump's possible return has unnerved NATO leaders as the Republican former president called into question the U.S. willingness to support other members of the alliance if they were attacked.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US family whose home was hit by space debris earlier this year is seeking compensation from the American space agency NASA for property damage and mental anguish. The metallic cylinder slab punched a hole in the roof through two layers of ceiling in Alejandro Otero's home in Naples in March. Back then, NASA said that the object was part of a 2.9-ton pallet of used batteries jettisoned from the International Space Station in March 2021. Mr Otero said his son was nearly injured by the impact.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, law firm Cranfill Summer said in a press release that it filed a claim on behalf of Mr Otero and his family. It listed damages including non-insured property damage loss, business interruption, emotional/mental anguish and the costs for assistance from third parties.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9www02e49zo"><em>BBC</em></a>, Attorney Mica Nguyen Worthy said <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/science/nasa-confirms-object-that-destroyed-florida-home-was-space-junk-5452204">space debris </a>"is a real serious issue because of the increase in space traffic in recent years". "My clients are seeking adequate compensation to account for the stress and impact that this event had on their lives," she added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Separately, speaking to <em>CBS</em> affiliate <em>Wink-TV </em>Mr Otero said that the space junk created a tremendous sound" as it blasted into his home. "I was shaking. I was completely in disbelief. What are the chances of something landing on my house with such force to cause so much damage," Mr Otero said.</p>

<p>The US space agency confirmed that the debris was from its flight support equipment. It was a metal support used to hold old batteries on a disposal pallet jettisoned from the station in 2021. While most of the pallet was expected to burn up in the atmosphere, this particular piece survived the fiery re-entry.</p>

<p>&nbsp;"The hardware was expected to fully burn up during entry through Earth's atmosphere on March 8, 2024. However, a piece of hardware survived and impacted a home in Naples, Florida," the agency said. The ISS will "perform a detailed investigation" on how the debris survived burn-up, according to Nasa.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>The BBC</em> reported that the agency now has 6 months to respond to Mr Otero's claims.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korea test-fired what appeared to be a hypersonic missile off its east coast on Wednesday, but it exploded in midair, South Korea's military said.</p>

<p>The missile was launched from near the capital, Pyongyang, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said. Japan's Defence Ministry said the missile flew to an altitude of about 100 km (62 miles) and a range of more than 200 km.</p>

<p>Senior officials of South Korea, the United States and Japan held a phone call and condemned the launch as a violation of multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions and a serious threat to the peace and stability of the region and beyond.</p>

<p>South Korea's marine corps said its troops staged firing drills near the maritime border with the North for the first time since Seoul scrapped an inter-Korean military pact early this month. The drills were announced earlier in June.</p>

<p>U.S. Indo-Pacific Command also issued a condemnation and called on Pyongyang to refrain from further unlawful and destabilising acts.</p>

<p>"While we have assessed that this event does not pose an immediate threat to U.S. personnel, or territory, or to our allies, we continue to monitor the situation," it said in a statement.</p>

<p>North Korea's last missile launch was on May 30.</p>

<p>North Korea this week criticised the deployment of a U.S. aircraft carrier to joint drills with South Korea and Japan, and warned of an "overwhelming, new demonstration of deterrence".</p>

<p>The missile launch comes a day after the 74-year anniversary of the beginning of the Korean War.</p>

<p>Last week, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a summit and signed a mutual defence pact. Seoul, Washington and Tokyo criticised the two countries' deepening military cooperation, with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol calling the pact "anachronistic".</p>

<p>North Korean state media KCNA said on Wednesday a mass rally in Pyongyang was held to commemorate the war anniversary, calling it a day of "struggle against U.S. imperialism" and calling the United States the archenemy.</p>

<p>Recently, North Korea has flown hundreds of balloons carrying trash toward the South, including on Tuesday, while Pyongyang deployed a large group of soldiers to build new fortifications within the heavily armed border between the two Koreas, according to the South's military, occasionally drawing warning shots from South Korean counterparts.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A union representing Hollywood film and television crew said on Tuesday it has reached a tentative three-year deal with major studios that includes agreed-on pay hikes and guardrails against the use of artificial intelligence (AI).</p>

<p>The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) members, which include lighting technicians and costume designers, are to ratify the deal with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which represents Disney, Netflix, and others.</p>

<p>The terms of the agreement include scale-rate increases of 7%, 4%, and 3.5% over the three-year term, the union said.</p>

<p>On the AI front, the deal includes "language that ensures no employee is required to provide Al prompts in any manner that would result in the displacement of any covered employee."</p>

<p>In late 2023, the SAG-AFTRA actors union and the studios reached a labor agreement which ended a near six-month dispute that had halted film and TV production.</p>

<p>That contract also provided for pay raises and streaming bonuses that union leaders said amounted to more than $1 billion over three years, and also included protection around the use of AI in filmmaking.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An online gaming rivalry turned violent when a 20-year-old man travelled from New Jersey to Florida and assaulted another player with a hammer. Despite never having met in person, Edward Kang reached Fernandina Beach on Sunday and allegedly attacked the victim, the police said.</p>

<p>Kang now faces serious charges, including attempted second-degree murder and armed burglary with a mask, according to court records from Nassau County.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a press conference, Nassau County Sheriff Bill Leeper said that Kang and the victim - also around the same age - played ArcheAge, a mediaeval fantasy multiplayer online role-playing game. The Sheriff called the case a “weird one.”</p>

<p>“Some things you just can't make up,” he added.</p>

<br />
Kang flew from New Jersey to Florida, telling his mom he was visiting a friend he met online, reported authorities. After landing, Kang purchased a hammer from a local hardware store before heading to the victim's house, which was reportedly left unlocked.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kang confronted the victim inside the home around 2 am and hit him on the head with the hammer. The victim suffered multiple head wounds but managed to call for help. As the victim struggled with Kang, his stepfather intervened and helped restrain the attacker until police arrived at the scene.<br />
<br />
The victim survived the assault and received medical treatment for his injuries, described as serious but not life-threatening, reported ABC News.<br />
<br />
In custody, Kang called the victim a "bad person online". He asked deputies how much jail time he would get for breaking and assault. An official replied, "It's going to be long before you play video games again."<br />
<br />
Kang is being held without bond and does not have an attorney listed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shocking visuals have surfaced online showing how&nbsp;a key dam in southern Minnesota built in the early 1900s, is at risk of failing after&nbsp;severe storms and flooding hit the region. Videos&nbsp;show strong water continuing to rush around the dam that has ''partially failed'' with officials saying the dam is in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=771440118493427&amp;id=100068823386285&amp;ref=embed_post">"imminent failure condition."</a></p>

<p>As per the<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/06/24/rapidan-dam-break-minnesota-flooding/"> Washington Post,</a></em> the alarming situation was brought on by days of torrential rains last week, triggering flooding that had killed at least two people.&nbsp;The floods have destroyed homes, swamped farmland, overtopped levees and caused a major railroad bridge to collapse.</p>

<p>One video shows a tremendous volume of water flowing around the dam, as it swallows a building.&nbsp; As the building falls into the fast-flowing river, it breaks into multiple pieces as it is washed away.&nbsp;Large trees are also seen breaking off at the side of the Blue Earth River and falling into the rapids.</p>

<p>An Xcel Energy substation, which supplies power to 600 customers, was also swept downriver during the overflow Monday, according to the company. Mankato Police and Fire posted on Facebook Monday afternoon that the water level at the dam was 28 feet. The levee system is built to withstand a river capacity of up to 39.5 feet.</p>

<p>However, as of Tuesday afternoon, the dam was still intact and there are no plans for a larger evacuation. Nearby residents who are in immediate danger have been notified, officials said.</p>

<p>"The Dam is currently intact and there is not an evacuation order in place for Blue Earth County residents. A portion of the river flow has diverted around the west side of the dam and water continues to flow. The situation is being monitored closely by BEC Public Works, Emergency Management, and the Sheriff's Office,'' officials said.</p>

<p>According to<em> <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/minnesotas-rapidan-dam-risk-failure-amid-severe-flooding/story?id=111399672">ABC News</a></em>, the Rapidan Dam, built in 1910, is located on the Blue Earth River. Owned by the county, the dam is capable of generating 6 million watts of hydroelectric power. It&nbsp;is near the city of Mankato, about 90 minutes from Minneapolis, and home to some 45,000 people.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A six-foot-tall wax statue of former US President Abraham Lincoln in Washington melted as the capital city's temperatures soared over the weekend.</p>

<p>The temperatures, which reportedly touched 37 degrees Celsius, disfigured the wax structure at the site of Camp Barker, a Civil War-era refugee camp that housed formerly enslaved and freed African Americans.</p>

<p>The statue's head was the first to surrender to the scorching heat, followed by the legs, BBC reported. Authorities are now repairing the sculpture.</p>

<p>The structure was a candle and a wax structure with a plaque that said, "Please blow out your wick within 1-2 minutes."</p>

<p>The replica, commissioned by the non-profit organisation CulturalDC, was scheduled to be placed at the site till September 2024.</p>

<p>The organisation also commented on the incident and said, "Whether it's the state of the union, the upcoming election, or this record-level heat, we are all over it!</p>

<p>The statue was created by US-based artist Sandy Williams as part of the Wax Monument Series. It was placed at the site of Camp Barker, which now houses an elementary school.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The indictment alleges that the children were forced to work on the couple's farmland because of their race and treated as slaves.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A wealthy white couple in West Virginia has been charged with human trafficking, forced labour and child neglect. The couple, Donald Ray Lantz (63) and Jeanne Kay Whitefeather (62), allegedly subjected their five adopted black children to forced labour and confinement, <a href="https://www.wvnews.com/news/wvnews/west-virginia-couple-accused-of-forced-labor-and-abuse-of-adopted-children/article_47603a5c-332f-11ef-99e4-37e6c030b9f5.html ">WNews</a>&nbsp;reported.<br />
<br />
The children, aged 6-16, were found living in deplorable conditions. Two teens were locked in a filthy shed without basic amenities, while another child was in a loft in the main house.<br />
<br />
The indictment alleges the children were forced to work on the couple's farmland because of their race and treated as slaves. The couple allegedly also prohibited them from entering the main house, reported the outlet.<br />
<br />
The couple faces multiple charges, including human trafficking, forced labour involving minors, and child neglect, creating a substantial risk of severe injury or death. They pleaded not guilty to the charges on Tuesday, <a href="https://m.wchstv.com/news/local/court-to-hold-400000-used-to-post-sissonville-couples-bond-until-case-resolved ">WCHSTV</a> reported.<br />
<br />
The investigation began after a neighbour reported concerns about the well-being of children.<br />
<br />
Police found two teenagers, a 14-year-old boy and a 16-year-old girl, locked in a shed on the couple's property. The shed had no lights, running water, or mattresses, only an RV porta-potty. The teens told police they were forced to sleep on the concrete floor and were last fed 12 hours prior.<br />
<br />
The boy had open sores on his bare feet, and both children wore dirty clothes and smelled of body odour. A 9-year-old girl was found inside the residence, while an 11-year-old boy and a 6-year-old girl were brought to the property later by the couple.<br />
<br />
Kanawha County Circuit Judge Maryclaire Akers described the indictment as “one of the worst" she has ever seen, citing allegations of human trafficking and racial targeting. “It alleges human trafficking, human rights violations, the use of forced labour,” Judge Akers said, as per the <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/25/us-news/wealthy-white-couple-allegedly-kept-their-black-adopted-children-as-slaves-locked-them-in-barn-report/ ">NY Post</a>. “These children were targeted because of their race, and they were used basically as slaves from what the indictment alleges.”&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Judge Akers increased the couple's bond from $200,000 to $500,000 each, citing the severe nature of the human trafficking and child neglect charges. She stated that the initial bond was insufficient due to the risk of bodily harm or death involved. The case will go to trial on September 9.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The city of Karachi is grappling with a mysterious and concerning trend as the number of unidentified bodies found in various areas of the metropolis has now reached 22, according to a Geo News report on Wednesday.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, five new bodies were discovered, adding to the growing list of unexplained deaths.</p>

<p>According to the Chhipa Welfare Association, a non-profit welfare organization in Pakistan, three of the latest victims appear to be drug addicts, as per Geo News.</p>

<p>Despite efforts by the organization's volunteers, none of the 22 bodies have been identified.</p>

<p>A spokesperson of the Chhipa Welfare Association said in a statement on Tuesday, that volunteers found five more bodies in different areas of Karachi on Tuesday. "Three of them were seemingly drug addicts, however, not a single body was identified so far," the spokesperson added.</p>

<p>According to Geo News, the non-government organisation, that runs a network of ambulances in the metropolis, confirmed that the number of unidentified bodies has reached 22 after today's recoveries.</p>

<p>It added that nearly two dozen of those bodies were still unclaimed as no relatives of the dead came to receive them.</p>

<p>The deaths were attributed to an ongoing heatwave in the port city which affected a vast number of citizens as many of them were admitted to different hospitals due to heatstroke.</p>

<p>An official of another humanitarian organisation in Karachi, Edhi Foundation's Azeem Khan told The News yesterday that most of the dead were drug addicts who died due to severe heat while being under the influence of drugs after over a dozen unidentified persons were found dead in different areas of Karachi.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, In Karachi a senior citizen was brutally assaulted by a group of drug users after confronting them about openly using drugs outside his residence, ARY News reported.</p>

<p>According to details, the victim attempted to stop the youths from engaging in drug activity in front of his home, which provoked the youths, resulting in severe violence against the elderly man.</p>

<p>This incident highlights the rising issue of drug abuse in Pakistan, particularly the increasing use of Ice, also known as crystal methamphetamine, in recent years.</p>

<p>Crystal meth is a highly addictive and potent stimulant that can have devastating effects on individuals and society as a whole. The usage of ice in Pakistan has been particularly prevalent among the younger generation.</p>

<p>The drug is often seen as a party drug that can enhance energy, alertness, and confidence, making it appealing to young people looking for a quick high. The ease of access to ice, as well as its relatively low cost compared to other drugs, has contributed to its popularity among young Pakistanis.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

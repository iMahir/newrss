       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States is hours away from going out to cast the ballot. Democratic nominee Kamala Harris and Republican candidate Donald Trump have been tirelessly campaigning for the past few months, reaching out to voters and presenting their case. &nbsp;</p>

<p>This time, nearly 95 per cent of registered voters live in areas where paper ballots will be the primary way to vote.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Here's a breakdown of how votes are cast and counted in the US elections.</strong></p>

<p><strong>How US Elections Are Organised</strong></p>

<p>Unlike many countries with centralised election bodies, the US has a highly decentralised election system. While the Federal Election Commission oversees campaign finance laws, state and local authorities manage the election process. Each state sets its election regulations, from voter eligibility to ballot design and counting procedures. Thus, voting and vote-counting processes can vary widely across the country.</p>

<p><strong>Voting Methods In The 2024 Elections</strong></p>

<p>Voters in the US cast their ballots through three primary methods:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Handmarked Paper Ballots: The most common method, used by 69.9 per cent of voters, involves marking paper ballots by hand.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Ballot Marking Devices (BMDs): Used by 25.1 per cent of voters, BMDs are computerised systems that allow voters to select options on a screen, and then print a paper ballot to confirm their choices. This method, implemented under the Help America Vote Act (HAVA), includes accessibility features for individuals with disabilities.</li>
	<li>Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) Systems: This electronic method, similar to India's EVMs, stores votes electronically without a paper trail. DRE use has declined sharply due to security concerns, with only 5 per cent of voters relying on these systems in Louisiana and Nevada.</li>
</ul>

<p>The 2000 election, marked by the infamous "butterfly ballot" issues in Florida, stressed the need for ballot clarity and led to an initial shift toward electronic voting. Security concerns - especially following reports of interference in the 2016 election - marked a return to paper-based systems. Today, electronic voting is limited, with most jurisdictions relying on hand-marked ballots or BMDs.</p>

<p><strong>How Votes Are Counted</strong></p>

<p>Votes cast on hand-marked paper ballots and BMDs are typically scanned using optical scanners that automatically record and tabulate results. This process is followed by a state-level audit, which may include machine-assisted or manual verification. States have different timelines for certifying results, with the final official vote tally required by December 11 this year.</p>

<p><strong>In-Person Votes</strong></p>

<p>Votes cast on Election Day or during early voting are counted after the polls close. Paper ballots are sent to counting centres, while digital voting machine data is transmitted electronically or hand-delivered for processing.</p>

<p><strong>Mail-In Ballots</strong></p>

<p>Mail-in ballot processing and counting rules vary by state. Many states allow officials to verify ballots before Election Day, but counting often begins on Election Day, with results held until after polls close.</p>

<p><strong>Verification Of Mail-In Ballots</strong></p>

<p>Every state requires a signature on mail-in ballots. Many use signature matching, and some require additional verification, such as a witness signature or notarisation depending on the state's rules.</p>

<p><strong>Ballot Curing</strong></p>

<p>In states allowing ballot curing, voters can fix errors, like mismatched signatures, to ensure their ballot is counted. Some states require curing by Election Day, while others allow it after. Eight states do not allow ballot curing.</p>

<p><strong>Provisional Ballots</strong></p>

<p>Provisional ballots are used if voter eligibility is uncertain, and they are hand-counted after verification. Military and overseas ballots also add to the timeline due to their verification requirements.</p>

<p><strong>The Electoral College&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The US President is chosen by 538 electors representing all states and the District of Columbia, based on each state's population. Except in Maine and Nebraska, each state operates under a "winner-take-all" system, awarding all its electoral votes to the candidate who wins the popular vote in that state. To win, a candidate must secure at least 270 electoral votes.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Certification And Inauguration</strong></p>

<p>On January 6, a joint session of Congress, presided over by the Vice President, counted the electoral votes. If a candidate reaches 270 votes, they are declared the President-elect, even if they lost the national popular vote. Inauguration takes place on January 20, when the President-elect is sworn into office for a four-year term.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cassius, the world's largest known crocodile in captivity, has died in a Queensland wildlife sanctuary in Australia. The massive saltwater crocodile, nearly 5.5 metres (18 feet) in length and weighing close to one tonne, was estimated to be over 110 years old, although his exact age remained unknown, according to a report in the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyvzyyd6l7o" rel="nofollow,noindex">BBC</a>.</p>

<p>Cassius lived at the Marineland Melanesia Crocodile Habitat on Green Island since being captured in Australia's Northern Territory during the 1980s.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/marinelandgreenisland" rel="nofollow,noindex">post on Facebook</a>, Marineland Melanesia paid tribute to Cassius, describing him as “our beloved mate” and “a cherished member of our family.”</p>

<p>The post read, “It is with deep sadness that we share the passing of our beloved mate Cassius. He was more than just a crocodile, he was a cherished member of our family and brought joy and companionship to his best mate George for over 37 years. George had only recently relocated into Cairns from Marineland after 52 years living on Green Island to an assisted care residence on the 5th of October.”</p>

<p>“Cassius's condition declined since the 15th of October. He was very old and believed to be living beyond the years of a wild Croc. Cassius will be deeply missed, but our love and memories of him will remain in our hearts forever. Thank you to everyone who visited Cassius throughout his life and offered kindness along the way. Please be advised that we may be operating in a limited capacity over the next few days and we apologise for any inconvenience this may cause,” they concluded.</p>

<p>Cassius's life in the wild was filled with adventure. The crocodile was known for hunting cattle and even damaging boat propellers before his eventual capture. The sanctuary's founder, George Craig, bought him in 1987, bringing him to his new home on Green Island.</p>

<p>Known for his immense size, Cassius earned the <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-crocodile-in-captivity" rel="nofollow,noindex">Guinness World Record</a> in 2011 as the largest captive crocodile. According to the Guinness World Record, “Cassius, an Australian saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus), is the largest crocodile in captivity at 5.48 m (17 ft 11.75 in). The Australian saltwater crocodile is the largest and most fearsome of today's species. Specimens can live for more than 100 years, can grow to 7 m (23 ft) and weigh more than 1 tonne (1.1 ton).”</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[In an ad for Kamala Harris, a woman marks her ballot for the Democratic candidate while her husband thinks she's voting for Republican Donald Trump.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In an ad for Kamala Harris, a woman marks her ballot for the Democratic candidate while her husband thinks she's voting for Republican Donald Trump: "What happens in the booth, stays in the booth" a voiceover says.</p>

<p>The 30-second-clip, narrated by actor Julia Roberts, shows the couple arriving at a polling station wearing baseball caps featuring the American flag, a symbol often sported by Trump supporters.</p>

<p>The ad, financed by a religious nonprofit, has elicited fury in the Trump camp, with the former president calling it "stupid" and asking "Can you imagine a wife not telling her husband who she's voting for?"</p>

<p>In the ad, the wife exchanges knowing glances with another female voter, before filling in her choice for Harris.</p>

<p>"You can vote any way you want, and no one will ever know," the voiceover says, before the husband asks "Did you make the right choice?"</p>

<p>"Sure did, honey," the woman replies.</p>

<p><strong>Unprecedented gender gap</strong></p>

<p>On conservative Fox News, a host recently said his wife secretly voting for Harris would be "the same thing as having an affair," while former Republican House speaker Newt Gingrich said the Harris spot was an example of the depth of her camp's "corruption."</p>

<p>Anti-Trump political group The Lincoln Project aired a similar ad showing two upper-middle class men who assure each other their wives are voting for Trump. The women -- and other females at the voting precinct -- then fill in their ballots for Harris.</p>

<p>The videos, and the furious reaction from Trump supporters, illustrate two key facets of the US presidential campaign.</p>

<p>One is that Trump and Harris are truly fighting for every last vote, in what is perhaps the most down-to-the-wire presidential race in modern US history.</p>

<p>The other is that Harris is counting heavily on mobilizing women in the ultra-tight race that will see a gender gap in votes like never before.</p>

<p>According to a latest poll by NBC, there is a 34-percentage point difference between male and female intended voters.</p>

<p>Harris has a 16-point lead among women while Trump has an 18-point lead among men.</p>

<p>The unprecedented gap comes with Harris's campaign having leaned heavily on reproductive and abortion rights, following the Supreme Court strike-down of the federal right to the procedure in 2022.</p>

<p><strong>Clooney surprise</strong></p>

<p>More broadly, the election is a clash between the "traditional and kind of patriarchal masculinity" espoused by Trump and Harris's policies which are "less aligned with stereotypical gender roles," said Kelly Dittmar, a political science professor at Rutgers University.</p>

<p>Former Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney, who has stumped for Harris, is openly betting on "secret" votes for the Democrat.</p>

<p>"I think you're going to have, frankly, a lot of men and women who will go into the voting booth and will vote their conscience and will vote for Vice President Harris," said Cheney, who is the daughter of former vice president Dick Cheney.</p>

<p>"They may not ever say anything publicly but the results will speak for themselves," she said.</p>

<p>Former first lady Michelle Obama recently hammered home the point, reminding the female electorate: "If you are a woman who lives in a household of men that don't listen to you or value your opinion, just remember that your vote is a private matter."</p>

<p>The Harris campaign's quest for "secret" voters doesn't stop with women. The group that funded the Julia Roberts-narrated ad, Vote Common Good, recently released a second spot, this time featuring two male voters casting their ballots for her without telling their Trump-supporting buddies.</p>

<p>The ad is narrated by another star, George Clooney.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the date for the US presidential election nears, the race between Democratic nominee Kamala Harris and her Republican counterpart Donald Trump has heated up. Even though American citizens prepare to cast their votes on November 5, the electoral journey began many months ago, and it involves a complex process.</p>

<p><strong>Early preparations</strong></p>

<p>A year before the election, candidates from the two main political parties, the Democrats and Republicans, start their campaigns. They assemble teams, launch fundraising initiatives and embark on nationwide tours to garner support.</p>

<p><strong>Campaign kick-off</strong></p>

<p>As campaigns ramp up, candidates engage in televised debates, which serve as a platform to articulate their policies and defend positions on various issues.</p>

<p><strong>Election process</strong></p>

<p>The US presidential election process can seem overwhelming, with terms like ‘Electoral College,' ‘National Conventions,' ‘Primary' and ‘Caucus' often confusing. Let's understand them better first:</p>

<p><strong>Here's what they mean:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Primaries: Primaries allow party members to vote for their preferred candidate in a secret ballot, similar to a general election. The results determine the allocation of delegates who will support candidates at the national conventions.</li>
	<li>Caucuses: Caucuses involve party members gathering to discuss and publicly vote for their preferred candidate. This interactive process also impacts the number of delegates each candidate receives for the conventions.</li>
	<li>National Conventions: National conventions are important for each political party. Delegates endorse their chosen candidates, leading to the official announcement of the presidential nominee. The selected candidate also names their Vice President or running mate.</li>
	<li>Electoral College: The Electoral College is a mechanism through which electors from each state cast their votes to elect the President. Each state is allocated a specific number of electors based on its Congressional representation, totalling 538 electors nationwide. After the general election, each elector casts one vote, with a majority of 270 needed to win.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Here's a breakdown of the election timeline:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Spring of the year before the election: Candidates announce their intentions to run, starting their campaigns. They officially register with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to run for president.</li>
	<li>Summer of the year before the election to spring of election year: Primary and Caucus debates are held across the country.</li>
	<li>January to June of election year: States and political parties conduct presidential Primaries and Caucuses, allowing voters to express their preferences for candidates.</li>
	<li>July to early September: Each party hosts nominating conventions to select their presidential candidates. It is during these conventions that the chosen presidential candidates usually announce their Vice-Presidential nominees.</li>
	<li>September and October: Candidates participate in a series of presidential debates, providing voters with an opportunity to assess their stance on issues and policies they will work on, should they get elected.</li>
	<li>Early November: The voting takes place on the first Tuesday of November in the election year.</li>
	<li>December: Members of the Electoral College cast their votes for president, finalising the nation's leader.</li>
	<li>Early January of the next calendar year: Congress officially counts the electoral votes, confirming the results.</li>
	<li>January 20: On Presidential Inauguration Day, the newly elected president is sworn in.</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris will watch Tuesday's election night from the campus of Howard University -- her alma mater -- a fitting place for possibly the most significant night of her life.</p>

<p>Nicknamed "the Black Harvard," the Washington school occupies a central role in the US vice president's biography: Since graduating there in 1986, she has frequently returned at key moments.</p>

<p>"Howard University is one of the most important aspects of my life," she said in 2019 as a candidate in the Democratic presidential primaries, "and it is where I first ran for my first elected office," as a student council representative.</p>

<p>"So this is where it all began."</p>

<p>Her presence there Tuesday night -- when Harris could become the first Black woman to be elected US president -- is thus deeply symbolic.</p>

<p>The US Congress founded Howard in 1867, two years after the Civil War had put an end to slavery in the mostly Southern states where it remained legal.</p>

<p>The school took its name from Oliver Howard, a Northerner known as "the Christian general" who had promoted higher education for freed slaves.</p>

<p>Howard has built a reputation as one of the best of the roughly 100 institutions known as Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), which draw mostly Black and minority students.</p>

<p>The campus of Howard, which has around 11,000 students, features several imposing red-brick buildings with traditional white columns arrayed around a large central lawn commonly known as The Yard.</p>

<p>It was in an amphitheater there that, in mid-August, Kamala Harris prepared for her lone debate against Republican rival Donald Trump -- telling students that someday, "you might be running for president of the United States."</p>

<p><strong>Celebrity graduates</strong></p>

<p>Among Howard's most illustrious graduates have been author and Nobel laureate Toni Morrison, and famed civil rights leader Thurgood Marshall, who in 1967 became the first Black justice appointed to the US Supreme Court.</p>

<p>It was Marshall's example, Harris later said, that inspired the future lawyer to choose Howard for her university studies in 1982.</p>

<p>There she joined the debate club and took part in anti-apartheid demonstrations.</p>

<p>She also joined Alpha Kappa Alpha (AKA), one of the nation's largest sororities, founded at Howard in 1908.</p>

<p>AKA makes no presidential endorsements, but its national membership of some 300,000 has given Harris a far-reaching network of activist supporters.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[While carbon dioxide (CO2) is the best-known greenhouse gas, several others, including methane and nitrous oxide, are also driving global warming and altering the Earth's climate.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While carbon dioxide, or CO2, is the best known greenhouse gas, several others, including methane and nitrous oxide, are also driving global warming and altering the Earth's climate.</p>

<p>Atmospheric concentrations of all three hit new highs in 2023, locking in future temperature increases for years to come, the World Meteorological Organization reported in October.</p>

<p><strong>Methane</strong></p>

<p>CO2 accounts for about two-thirds of the warming attributed to greenhouse gases, said Piers Forster, an expert at the University of Leeds and author of reports by the IPCC, the UN's climate science panel.</p>

<p>Methane, or CH4, is the second most important greenhouse gas linked to human activity after CO2.</p>

<p>Around 40 percent of methane comes from natural sources, notably wetlands, but the majority (around 60 percent) is linked to human activities such as agriculture (ruminant breeding and rice cultivation), fossil fuels and waste.</p>

<p>Its warming power is more than 80 times greater over 20 years than that of CO2, but its lifespan is shorter, making it an important lever in attempts to limit global warming in the short term.</p>

<p>Reducing methane emissions "would have a strong short-term cooling effect, because atmospheric methane concentrations would drop quickly", said Mathijs Harmsen, a researcher at the PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency.</p>

<p>Policies should "focus on capturing the low hanging fruit, so the very low-cost measures such as reducing natural gas leaks", he said.</p>

<p>Despite a global commitment to reduce planet-heating emissions signed by many countries, including the European Union and the United States, the trend is not positive.</p>

<p>"Methane is rising faster in relative terms than any major greenhouse gas and is now 2.6-fold higher than in pre-industrial times," said an international group of researchers under the aegis of the Global Carbon Project, in a study published in the academic journal Environmental Research Letters.</p>

<p><strong>Nitrous oxide</strong></p>

<p>Nitrous oxide, or nitrous protoxide (N2O), is the third major greenhouse gas and almost 300 times more potent than CO2.</p>

<p>It is mainly emitted by synthetic nitrogen fertilisers and manure used in agriculture.</p>

<p>Other emissions come from human activities (the chemical industry, wastewater, fossil fuels) or natural sources (the soil and oceans).</p>

<p>"Global human-induced emissions, which are dominated by nitrogen additions to croplands, increased by 30 percent over the past four decades," concluded a major study in the journal Nature in 2020.</p>

<p>The key to the problem lies in more efficient use of fertilisers.</p>

<p>"Two-thirds of the climate change mitigation potential of N2O could be realised by reducing fertilisers on just 20 percent of the world's cropland, particularly in humid subtropical agricultural regions," wrote French researcher Philippe Ciais in 2021.</p>

<p><strong>Fluorinated gases</strong></p>

<p>Fluorinated greenhouse gases (PFCs, HFCs and SF6) are found in fridges, freezers, heat pumps, air conditioners and electrical networks.</p>

<p>Even when in small quantities, they stand out for their extremely high warming capacity.</p>

<p>For example, SF6, which is found in electrical transformers, has a greenhouse effect 24,000 times greater than CO2 over a 100-year period.</p>

<p>The Montreal Protocol signed in 1987, and ratified by 195 countries, has already significantly reduced the atmospheric presence of CFCs, another ozone-depleting fluorinated gas.</p>

<p>In 2016 the Kigali agreement also provided for the phasing out of HFCs.</p>

<p>And last year the EU sealed a pact to progressively ban the sale of equipment containing fluorinated gases, in particular HFCs, with the aim of eliminating them completely by 2050.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the UN climate summit to start in Azerbaijan in a week, here is a recap of 10 key dates in the battle against global warming.</p>

<p><strong>1988: key UN body created</strong></p>

<p>Alerted by scientists to signs that the Earth's surface is warming, the United Nations in 1988 establishes the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to investigate.</p>

<p>Two years later, the panel reports that heat-trapping "greenhouse" gases generated by human activity are on the rise and could intensify planetary warming.</p>

<p>In a series of studies, evidence accumulates that human activities -- the burning of coal, oil and gas; logging of rainforests and destructive farming practices -- are heating the Earth's surface, a prelude to disruptions of its climate system.</p>

<p><strong>1992: Earth Summit</strong></p>

<p>A 1992 "Earth Summit" in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, creates the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), with the aim of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<p>Since 1995, so-called "Conferences of the Parties", or COPs, have been meeting to pursue that elusive goal.</p>

<p><strong>1997: Kyoto Protocol</strong></p>

<p>In 1997, nations agree in Kyoto, Japan, on a 2008-2012 timeframe for industrialised nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by an average of 5.2 percent from 1990 levels.</p>

<p>Developing countries, including China, India and Brazil, are not required to take on binding targets.</p>

<p>But in 2001, the United States, at the time the world's biggest carbon emitter, refuses to ratify the protocol, which takes effect in 2005.</p>

<p><strong>2007: Nobel prize</strong></p>

<p>The IPCC reports in 2007 that evidence of global warming is now "unequivocal" and extreme weather events will probably multiply.</p>

<p>In October 2007, the UN panel shares the Nobel Peace Prize with former US vice president Al Gore for their efforts in raising the alarm about climate change.</p>

<p><strong>2009: Copenhagen collapse</strong></p>

<p>Participants at the COP15 gathering in the Danish capital Copenhagen fail to achieve an agreement for the post-2012 period.</p>

<p>Several dozen major emitters, including China and the US, announce a goal of limiting global temperature increases to two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, but are vague on how the goal will be reached.</p>

<p><strong>2015: Paris landmark deal</strong></p>

<p>In December 2015, nearly every nation on Earth commits to limit warming to "well below" two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.</p>

<p>A more ambitious cap of 1.5 Celsius is also adopted in the French capital Paris as the preferred target.</p>

<p><strong>2018: Greta Thunberg</strong></p>

<p>In 2018, Swedish teen Greta Thunberg starts skipping school on Fridays to sit outside the Swedish parliament, demanding more substantive action to combat climate change.</p>

<p>Despite ending her Friday protests in 2023 after graduating, her protest inspires students worldwide to skip class each Friday in a bid to demand more efforts from global leaders.</p>

<p><strong>2022: biodiversity deal</strong></p>

<p>An accord on biodiversity is reached in Montreal, Canada in December 2022, calling for the designation of 30 percent of the planet's land and oceans as protected zones by 2030, and an end of extinctions of threatened species due to human activities.</p>

<p><strong>2023: 'beginning of end' for fossil fuels</strong></p>

<p>The COP28 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, ends with a landmark deal to transition away from fossil fuels.</p>

<p>EU climate chief Wopke Hoekstra calls the agreement "long, long overdue", saying it has taken nearly 30 years of climate meetings to "arrive at the beginning of the end of fossil fuels".</p>

<p><strong>2024: hottest on record</strong></p>

<p>The 2024 northern summer sees the highest global temperatures ever measured.</p>

<p>The global average temperature in August 2024 at the Earth's surface is 16.82C, according to the EU's climate monitor Copernicus.</p>

<p>This breaks through the level of 1.5C above the pre-industrial average -- the key threshold for limiting the worst effects of climate change.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The recent attack at a Hindu temple in Canada's Brampton has angered Indo-Canadians with a prominent member of the country's parliament saying the anti-India extremists have crossed a "red line".</p>

<p>"A red line has been crossed by Canadian Khalistani extremists today. The attack by Khalistanis on the Hindu-Canadian devotees inside the premises of the Hindu Sabha temple in Brampton shows how deep and brazen has Khalistani violent extremism has become in Canada," Chandra Arya wrote on X this morning.</p>

<p>Videos showed dozens of men storming the Hindu Sabha temple near Toronto and assaulting devotees, which Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau condemned.</p>

<p>The Indian embassy said "anti-India elements" orchestrated the violence outside a consular camp co-organised by the temple.</p>

<p>Mr Arya said he feels the Khalistani extremists have infiltrated the country's law enforcement agencies besides its political apparatus.</p>

<p>"I begin to feel that there is a small grain of truth in the reports that in addition to Canadian political apparatus, Khalistanis have effectively infiltrated into our law enforcement agencies. No wonder that under the 'freedom of expression' Khalistani extremists are getting a free pass in Canada," read his post, echoing India's accusation that Canada provides a safe haven to terrorists and extremists.</p>

<p>He also called on Hindu-Canadians to step up and asserts their rights and hold politicians accountable for the security and safety of the community.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Trudeau said the violence at the Brampton temple was unacceptable and thanked the local police for swift action.</p>

<p>"The acts of violence at the Hindu Sabha Mandir in Brampton today are unacceptable. Every Canadian has the right to practice their faith freely and safely. Thank you to the Peel Regional Police for swiftly responding to protect the community and investigate this incident," said Trudeau.</p>

<p>The Indian embassy called the violence "deeply disappointing", despite which, it said the consulate was able to issue more than 1,000 life certificates to the Indian and Canadian applicants.</p>

<p>The violence comes amid diplomatic tensions between India and Canada triggered by Trudeau's charges that "Indian agents" were behind the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. India had trashed the charges as "baseless".</p>

<p>The central government last month pulled its top diplomats from Canada. The latest statement too raised concerns over its diplomats receiving threats in the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Titan, the moon of the second-largest planet in our solar system is believed to be one of the most hospitable worlds]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new study has claimed that methane gas might be trapped beneath a 9.7-kilometre-thick distinct crust of Saturn's largest moon, Titan. The research team led by planetary scientists at the University of Hawaii <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.hawaii.edu/news/2024/10/29/saturn-moon-methane/" rel="nofollow, noindex">observed </a>that Titan's impact craters were hundreds of metres shallower than expected and that only 90 of them had been identified. The observations were surprising as based on data from other moons, additional impact craters that are much deeper should have been present on the surface of Titan.</p>

<p>"We realised something unique to Titan must be making them become shallower and disappear relatively quickly," said lead researcher Lauren Schurmeier, adding that the scientists turned to computer modelling to further the investigation.</p>

<p>"Using this modeling approach, we were able to constrain the methane clathrate crust thickness to five to ten kilometres [about 3 to 6 miles] because simulations using that thickness produced crater depths that best matched the observed craters," she added.</p>

<h2><strong>Titan could house life?</strong></h2>

<p>Methane clathrate, or "methane hydrate," is a solid compound in which a large amount of methane is trapped within the crystalline structure of water, creating a solid similar to ice. Scientists are of the view that studying Methane clathrate would help understand Titan's carbon cycle and its changing climate.</p>

<p>The thickness of the methane-rich crust could also suggest that Titan's interior was insulated, making the ice shell very warm and ductile, which implies it was slowly connecting. The convection indicated that&nbsp;biomarkers indicating life may have hoisted from Titan's subsurface ocean and carried to its outer icy shell, just awaiting discovery.</p>

<p>"If life exists in Titan's ocean under the thick ice shell, any signs of life, biomarkers, would need to be transported up Titan's ice shell to where we could more easily access or view them with future missions," Ms. Schurmeier added.</p>

<p>Notably, Earth's methane clathrate hydrates are found in the permafrost of Siberia and below the arctic seafloor.</p>

<p>Titan, the moon of the second-largest planet in our solar system is believed to be one of the most hospitable worlds. It is the only place other than Earth to have an atmosphere and liquids in the form of rivers, lakes and seas on the surface.</p>

<p>Moreover, Titan's nitrogen atmosphere is so dense that a human wouldn't need a pressure suit to walk around on the surface. However, an oxygen mask would be required for protection against frigid cold temperatures that hover around minus 179 Celsius.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[At least six people died after a volcano in eastern Indonesia erupted several times overnight, officials said Monday, raising the alert level to the highest of a four-tiered system.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A volcano in eastern Indonesia erupted overnight, killing at least 10 people as it spewed fireballs and ash on surrounding villages, officials said Monday as they raised the alert status to its highest level.</p>

<p>Mount Lewotobi Laki-Laki, a 1,703-metre (5,587-feet) twin volcano located on the popular tourist island of Flores, erupted shortly before midnight, forcing authorities to evacuate several villages.</p>

<p>Residents described their horror when the crater started to shoot flaming rocks at their homes.</p>

<p>"I was asleep when suddenly the bed shook twice, as if someone had slammed it. Then I realised the volcano had erupted, so I ran outside," said 32-year-old hairdresser Hermanus Mite.</p>

<p>"I saw flames coming out and immediately fled. There were ashes and stones everywhere. My salon also caught fire and everything inside was lost."</p>

<p>Abdul Muhari, spokesman of the country's disaster mitigation agency (BNPB), confirmed the death toll at a press conference, adding that 10,295 people had been affected by the eruptions.</p>

<p>He said the number of evacuees was still being calculated.</p>

<p>Footage received by AFP showed houses near the volcano covered by thick ash, with some areas on fire.</p>

<p>An AFP journalist near the volcano said five villages were evacuated, forcing thousands of people to seek shelter elsewhere.</p>

<p>Some wooden homes caught fire, and the ground was pockmarked with holes caused by flying molten rocks.</p>

<p>The crater erupted just before midnight and then again at 1:27 am (1727 GMT Sunday) and 2:48 am, the country's volcanology agency said.</p>

<p>It hoisted the highest alert level and told locals and tourists not to carry out activities within a seven-kilometre (4.3-mile) radius of the crater.</p>

<p>"There has been a significant increase in volcanic activity on Mount Lewotobi Laki-Laki," it said in a press release Monday.</p>

<p>It released images that showed the roofs of houses collapsed after they were hit by volcanic rocks, and locals sheltering in communal buildings.</p>

<p><strong>Ash rain</strong></p>

<p>The volcanology agency warned there was a potential for rain-induced lava floods and told locals to wear masks to avoid the effects of volcanic ash.</p>

<p>There were a series of eruptions at the volcano last week, the biggest on Thursday, sending a column of ash 2,000 metres (6,500 feet) into the sky.</p>

<p>The mountain had several major eruptions in January, prompting authorities at the time to raise the alert status to the highest level and evacuate at least 2,000 residents.</p>

<p>Indonesia, a vast archipelago nation, experiences frequent eruptions due to its position on the Pacific "Ring of Fire", an area of intense volcanic and seismic activity.</p>

<p>In December last year, an eruption at one of the country's most active volcanoes, Mount Marapi in West Sumatra, killed at least 24 climbers, most of them university students.</p>

<p>And in May, more than 60 people died after heavy rains washed volcanic material from Marapi into residential areas, sweeping away homes.</p>

<p>That month Mount Ruang in North Sulawesi province erupted more than half a dozen times, forcing thousands of residents of nearby islands to evacuate.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US president Donald Trump is 'clearly the better choice,' as compared to his Democratic rival Vice President Kamala Harris, former US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley has said.</p>

<p>Haley urged undecided voters to look at both candidates' policy proposals, which she said clearly show Trump as the better option in a Wall Street Journal op-ed published two days before Election Day.</p>

<p>"I don't agree with Trump 100 per cent of the time. But I do agree with him most of the time, and I disagree with Harris nearly all the time. That makes this an easy call. Here are the facts most relevant to me," the former South Carolina governor wrote in an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal on Sunday.</p>

<p>Batting for her former boss, the Indian American wrote; “Will Trump do some things I don't like in a second term? I'm sure he will. If that was the question before voters, then I imagine Trump would lose. But that isn't the question in any election.</p>

<p>"No politician gets everything right. For those of us who are clear-eyed enough to see Trump's flaws and honest enough to acknowledge them, the question is whether we're better off with his policies or his opponent's. On taxes, spending, inflation, immigration, energy and national security, the candidates are miles apart. And Trump is clearly the better choice," she wrote.</p>

<p>Haley alleged that the Biden-Harris agenda has made the world far more dangerous.</p>

<p>"Our southern border is our most pressing security threat; Biden and Harris have made it dramatically worse. Their debacle in Afghanistan not only created a new terrorist state; it also signalled weakness that sparked Russia's war against Ukraine," she wrote.</p>

<p>"Their appeasement of Iran has enriched that despotic regime and emboldened it to pursue war with Israel through its terrorist proxies. And the administration's weakness toward China has done nothing to impede the communist power's expansion at our expense. This is the world that Biden-Harris failures have given us in four short years,” she said.</p>

<p>Haley argued a Trump administration would be different.</p>

<p>"It wouldn't be perfect. But I agree with Trump that we need to keep taxes low and cut them more. I agree that we need to roll back trillions of dollars in special-interest handouts. I agree that we need to expand American energy to empower our families and job creators while making us less dependent on foreign energy," Haley said.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The case dates back to 1990 when Marlene Warren was shot in her home by an assailant dressed as a clown.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Florida woman called “killer clown” has been released from prison after she served a sentence related to the 1990 murder of her husband's former wife.</p>

<p>Sheila Keen-Warren, now 61, walked free on November 2, nearly two years after accepting a plea deal that saw her admit to second-degree murder. According to the Florida Department of Corrections, she was released 18 months following her plea, just before she was due to stand trial.</p>

<p>Though Keen-Warren spent seven years in custody since her 2017 arrest, Florida's sentencing laws in place at the time of the crime allowed her to reduce her time significantly through credits for good behaviour. Consequently, despite her initial 12-year sentence, she was eligible for early release.</p>

<p>“Sheila Keen-Warren will always be an admitted convicted murderer and will wear that stain every day for the rest of her life,” Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg said in a statement, according to the <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/03/us-news/floridas-killer-clown-sheila-keen-warren-released-from-prison/" rel="nofollow,noindex">New York Post</a>.</p>

<p>Greg Rosenfeld, Keen-Warren's attorney, said she accepted the plea deal only because it meant she could be released soon, avoiding the risk of a life sentence. “We are thrilled that Ms Keen-Warren has been released from prison and is returning to her family. As we've stated from the beginning, she did not commit this crime,” Mr Rosenfeld reportedly said in a message.</p>

<p>The case dates back to 1990 when Marlene Warren was shot in her home by an assailant dressed as a clown. According to Ms Warren's son, Joseph Ahrens, he and his friends were present when a clown appeared at their door bearing balloons. When Ms Warren&nbsp;opened the door, the clown handed her the balloons and, after she commented, “How nice,” the clown pulled out a gun and shot her in the face before fleeing the scene.</p>

<p>Detectives had suspected Keen-Warren for years, though it wasn't until 2017 that she was arrested, with authorities attributing the delay to advancements in DNA technology that allegedly linked her to the crime. But Mr Rosenfeld, Keen-Warren's attorney, maintained that this evidence was unreliable.&nbsp;He highlighted issues with the DNA evidence, claiming it contained both male and female genes and that one of the samples was common enough that it could have matched many women.</p>

<p>At the time of the shooting, Keen-Warren worked for Michael Warren, Marlene Warren's husband, at his used car dealership. In the years following Ms Warren's death, Keen-Warren married Michael, and the two eventually relocated to Abingdon, Virginia, where they operated a restaurant.</p>

<p>Witnesses from 1990 reportedly told investigators that Keen-Warren&nbsp;and Michael Warren were romantically involved, although both denied it. Some costume shop employees identified Keen-Warren as the woman who bought a clown suit shortly before the killing. One of the balloons held by the clown — a silver one bearing the message, “You're the Greatest” — was traced to a Publix supermarket near Keen-Warren's home, where employees recalled seeing a woman who looked like her buying the balloons an hour before the incident.</p>

<p>The apparent getaway vehicle, a white Chrysler convertible, was found abandoned with strands of orange, hair-like fibres inside. The car was reported stolen from Michael Warren's lot a month before the murder. Keen-Warren and her then-husband had worked in repossession for Michael at the time.</p>

<p>Relatives of Marlene Warren previously said&nbsp;that she had been considering leaving her husband, suspecting him of infidelity. According to the New York Post, she had allegedly told her mother, “If anything happens to me, Mike did it.” Michael Warren has never been charged in connection with her death and denies any involvement.</p>

<p>State Attorney Aronberg acknowledged the challenges posed by the 27-year delay in bringing the case to trial, including the death of key witnesses.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The dollar slipped in Asia on Monday as investors braced for a potentially pivotal week for the global economy as the United States chooses a new leader and, probably, cuts interest rates again with major implications for bond yields.</p>

<p>The euro rose 0.4% to $1.0876 but faces resistance around $1.0905, while the dollar dipped 0.3% on the yen to 152.45 yen. The dollar index eased 0.3% to 103.94.</p>

<p>Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump remain virtually tied in opinion polls and the winner might not be known for days after voting ends.</p>

<p>Analysts believe Trump's policies on immigration, tax cuts and tariffs would put upward pressure on inflation, bond yields and the dollar, while Harris was seen as the continuity candidate.</p>

<p>Dealers said the early dip in the dollar might be linked to a well-respected poll that showed Harris taking a surprise 3-point lead in Iowa, thanks largely to her popularity with female voters.</p>

<p>"It is widely considered that a Trump win will be positive for the USD, though many feel this outcome has been discounted," said Chris Weston, an analyst at broker Pepperstone. "A Trump presidency with full control of Congress could be most impactful, as one would expect a solid sell-off in Treasuries resulting in a spike higher in the USD."</p>

<p>"A Harris win and a split Congress would likely result in 'Trump trades' quickly reversed and priced out," he added. "The USD, gold, bitcoin and U.S. equity would likely head lower."</p>

<p>Uncertainty over the outcome is one reason markets assume the Federal Reserve will choose to cut rates by a standard 25 basis points on Thursday, rather than repeat its outsized half-point easing.</p>

<p>Futures imply a 99% chance of a quarter-point cut to 4.50%-4.75%, and an 83% probability of a similar-sized move in December.</p>

<p>"We are pencilling in four more consecutive cuts in the first half of 2024 to a terminal rate of 3.25%-3.5%, but see more uncertainty about both the speed next year and the final destination," said Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius.</p>

<p>"Both our baseline and probability-weighted forecasts are now a bit more dovish than market pricing."</p>

<p>The Bank of England also meets Thursday and is expected to cut by 25 basis points, while the Riksbank is seen easing by 50 basis points and the Norges Bank is expected to stay on hold.</p>

<p>The Reserve Bank of Australia holds its meeting on Tuesday and again is expected to hold rates steady.</p>

<p>The BoE's decision has been complicated by a sharp sell-off in gilts following the Labour government's budget last week, which also dragged the pound lower.</p>

<p>Early Monday, sterling had regained some of its losses to stand at $1.2963, some way from last week's trough at $1.2841. [GB/]</p>

<p>More stimulus is also expected from China's National People's Congress, which is meeting from Monday through Friday.</p>

<p>Sources told Reuters last week that Beijing is considering approving next week the issuance of more than 10 trillion yuan ($1.40 trillion) in extra debt in the next few years to revive its fragile economy.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican former President Donald Trump will face Vice President Kamala Harris in a Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election, with both candidates making their final pitches in battleground states ahead of what is projected to be a tight race.</p>

<p>Several third-party hopefuls are also running. Here are the candidates.</p>

<p><strong>Democratic Party</strong></p>

<p><strong>Kamala Harris&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Harris, 60, won the Democratic Party's nomination after Biden ended his reelection bid, allowing Democrats to present a renewed American vision in contrast to Trump's agenda as they seek to revive their coalition of young voters, people of color and suburban women.</p>

<p>A former U.S. senator, California attorney general and San Francisco prosecutor, Harris became the first woman and person of color to serve as vice president after Biden selected her as his 2020 running mate. She would become the first woman to serve as president in the nation's 248-year history if she wins.</p>

<p>Opinion polls show Harris is in a close race against Trump. She leads the former president nationally 44% to 43%, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll published on Oct. 29.</p>

<p>Other surveys show Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, in tight races among the seven battleground states that could decide the election: Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, North Carolina, Michigan and Nevada.</p>

<p>During the final weeks of the campaign, Harris has renewed efforts to paint Trump as a threat to democracy after he made ominous comments about "the enemy within" the United States and threatened to deploy the military domestically. She also agreed with the assessment by Trump's former chief of staff, John Kelly, that her opponent is a fascist, a characterization Trump and his allies rejected.</p>

<p>Harris has made reproductive rights and personal freedoms a rallying cry and backs a national law codifying access to safe abortion.</p>

<p>Her economic plans include tax cuts for most Americans, bans on price gouging, more affordable housing and a new child tax credit as well as efforts to boost domestic manufacturing. She proposed increasing the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% and ending taxes on tips.</p>

<p>She has promised tougher immigration and fentanyl controls at the border. Her climate and energy positions are similar to those held by Biden, who made fighting climate change a top priority.</p>

<p>Harris has been seen as tech-friendly even as she took on alleged anticompetition and privacy issues, and she has sought to reassure donors that she backs capitalism.</p>

<p>On foreign policy, Harris is expected to stick largely to Biden's playbook on key issues such as Ukraine, China and Iran. She has also pressured Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for a Gaza ceasefire deal but has also taken a hard line against Hamas, saying the militant group must be "eliminated," and remains committed to the U.S. policy of arming Israel.</p>

<p>Key labor groups, including the Service Employees International Union, the United Auto Workers and the American Federation of Teachers, endorsed her. Former U.S. military officials, company executives and numerous former top Republican officials have also backed her.</p>

<p><strong>Republican Party</strong></p>

<p><strong>Donald Trump</strong></p>

<p>Trump, 78, secured the Republican nomination in July to make his third consecutive run for the White House after losing his 2020 reelection bid.</p>

<p>Trump continues to repeat his false claim that Democrats stole the 2020 election as he campaigns amid unprecedented legal challenges, including a fresh U.S. indictment over efforts to subvert his loss to Biden.</p>

<p>In office from 2017 to 2021, he has cast his indictments in four criminal cases as a political attack, vowing "retribution" against perceived enemies and embracing increasingly dystopian rhetoric.</p>

<p>Trump became the first former U.S. president to be convicted of a crime in May, in New York City. He was also the first president to be impeached twice. He denies any wrongdoing.</p>

<p>Trump, who chose U.S. Senator JD Vance of Ohio as his running mate, has refused to commit to accepting the 2024 results or to rule out possible political violence, while he and Republicans lay the groundwork to contest a potential loss. His false claims about voter fraud in battleground Pennsylvania have raised concerns that he could again try to overturn election results if he loses.</p>

<p>Trump has also promised to pardon supporters imprisoned for the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and threatened to prosecute election officials, donors, Google and others if he wins.</p>

<p>He said he would <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-presidential-elections-donald-trump-remark-on-2020-poll-sparks-fear-he-may-not-accept-result-if-he-loses-6937172">not run again if he loses</a>.</p>

<p>Trump is the oldest U.S. presidential nominee and would become the nation's second oldest president. He faced two assassination attempts, one at a Pennsylvania campaign rally in July and another one in September near one of his Florida golf courses.</p>

<p>Trump-friendly think tanks' sweeping "Project 2025" policy agenda would target the Justice Department's independence, among other plans. Trump has sought to distance himself from the project despite his former aides' and Vance's involvement. He also wants the power to replace federal civil service workers with loyalists.</p>

<p>On foreign policy, Trump has vowed to fundamentally alter the U.S. relationship with NATO and to resolve the Ukraine war with possible peace talks that might require Kyiv to cede territory. He has said Hamas must be "crushed" and vowed to be tougher on Iran, but has given few details or policy proposals.</p>

<p>Trump has made immigration a top issue, promising mass deportations, including legal Haitian immigrants given Temporary Protected Status in Springfield, Ohio. He would end birthright citizenship and expand a travel ban on people from certain countries.</p>

<p>He takes credit for the U.S. Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade protections, saying abortion laws should be left to the states. Trump said he does not support banning birth control.</p>

<p>On the economy, Trump would impose sweeping tariffs on imported goods and on specific companies and countries. He pledged to end taxes on tips and overtime, to make emergency generators tax-deductible in states hit by natural disasters, to lower corporate tax rates and to open federal lands to foreign companies and housing. He has also vowed to undo much of Biden's climate change work.</p>

<p>Trump has faced criticism, including from some Republicans, for personal attacks against Harris, including over her race and gender.</p>

<p>Trump appointed former Democrat Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to his transition team and said he would tap billionaire supporter Elon Musk to address government efficiency.</p>

<p>The National Fraternal Order of Police and other police groups have also backed his election bid.</p>

<p><strong>Third Parties &amp; Independents</strong></p>

<p><strong>Libertarian Party</strong></p>

<p><strong>Chase Oliver</strong></p>

<p>While the Libertarian Party invited Trump to its convention, it ultimately selected Oliver, 39. Oliver ran for a Georgia state Senate seat in 2022 and garnered 2% of the vote.</p>

<p><strong>Green Party</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jill Stein</strong></p>

<p>Stein, 74, a physician who ran under the Green Party in 2016, is running again in 2024.</p>

<p>She launched her current campaign accusing Democrats of betraying their promises "for working people, youth and the climate again and again - while Republicans don't even make such promises in the first place."</p>

<p><strong>Independent</strong></p>

<p><strong>Cornel West</strong></p>

<p>The political activist, philosopher and academic is making a bid to attract more progressive, Democratic-leaning voters.</p>

<p>West, 71, initially ran as a Green Party candidate but in October said people "want good policies over partisan politics" and declared himself an independent. He has promised to end poverty and guarantee housing.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shortly after a violent attack on a Hindu temple in Canada's Brampton, the Indian High Commission in Ottawa said a consular camp was being held near the temple and added that it was "deeply disturbing" that such "disruptions" are being allowed during routine consular work.</p>

<p>The remarks come amid diplomatic tension between India and Canada, which was sparked by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegations of New Delhi's involvement in the assassination of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. India has trashed the charges.</p>

<p>"As in previous years, the High Commission of India in Ottawa and Consulates General of India in Vancouver and Toronto have organized/plan consular camps during this period, for the benefit and ease of local life certificate beneficiaries (Canadian and Indian). On account of the prevailing security situation in Canada, the Canadian authorities had been requested well in advance to provide strong security measures for these events, which constitute routine consular work," the High Commission said in a statement shared on X.</p>

<p>"We have seen violent disruption today (Nov 3) orchestrated by anti-India elements outside the consular camp.co-organized with the Hindu Sabha Mandir, Brampton, near Toronto. It is deeply disappointing to see such disruptions being allowed for routine consular work being organized by our Consulates with the fullest cooperation of local co-organizers. We also remain very concerned for the safety of applicants, including Indian nationals, on whose demand such events are organized in the first place," it added.</p>

<p>"Despite these efforts by anti India elements, our Consulate was able to issue more than 1000 life certificates to the Indian and Canadian applicants. There were also attempts to disrupt similar camps held in Vancouver and Surrey on Nov 2-3," the High Commission said.</p>

<p>It added that in light of these incidents and with Indian diplomats receiving threats, the organisation of more scheduled consular camps would depend on security arrangements by local authorities</p>

<p>"In case any camp is infeasible to be held due to such disruptions, alternative arrangements will be made to render those services, which may unfortunately inconvenience local users of these services," the High Commission said.</p>

<p>Some Indian-Canadian leaders, including MP Chandra Arya, have alleged that Khalistani extremists were behind the violence at the Hindu Sabha Mandir temple. Some videos that went viral show a group of men attacking devotees at the temple.&nbsp;A spokesperson for Peel Regional Police told AFP that no arrests had been made.</p>

<p>Mr Arya said a "red line has been crossed by Canadian Khalistani extremists today". "The attack by Khalistanis on the Hindu-Canadian devotees inside the premises of the Hindu Sabha temple in Brampton shows how deep and brazen Khalistani violent extremism has become in Canada."</p>

<p>The Canadian Prime Minister has responded to the attack on the temple, describing it as "unacceptable". "The acts of violence at the Hindu Sabha Mandir in Brampton today are unacceptable. Every Canadian has the right to practice their faith freely and safely. Thank you to the Peel Regional Police for swiftly responding to protect the community and investigate this incident," Trudeau said in a post on X.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Texan woman is currently being held in the Harris County Jail on a $30,000 bond and has been charged with a felony.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 21-year-old woman in the US state of Texas has been arrested for attempting to sell her baby on Facebook. The accused, identified as Juniper Bryson, posted on a Facebook group called "Birth Mothers Looking for Adoptive Parent(s)" in September, stating that she was looking for someone who would be willing to adopt her unborn baby boy, as per the court documents.&nbsp;She is currently being held in the Harris County Jail on a $30,000 bond and has been charged with a felony.</p>

<p>A day prior to posting the message, Bryson had reached out to a family member, asking if they knew someone who was looking to adopt a baby. She hinted during the conversation that the child would be drug-positive, according to a report in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://abc7chicago.com/post/texas-mom-arrested-after-allegedly-trying-sell-newborn-baby-facebook/15500818/" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>ABC 13</em></a>. During a subsequent conversation, Bryson told the family member that she wanted payment in exchange for the baby.</p>

<p>"It's not even like that, just enough to move into an apartment so I can work a job and get (my daughter) back, or a cheap down payment, or any car to get to different places to DoorDash. Nothing crazy at all," Bryson told them.</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-couple-accused-of-trying-to-sell-their-baby-for-1-000-and-beer-6675022" rel="nofollow, noindex">Also read |&nbsp;US Couple Accused Of Trying To Sell Their Baby For $1,000 And Beer</a></strong></p>

<h2><strong>Bryson demands money</strong></h2>

<p>According to the police, Bryson spoke to several people about adopting her baby, including a same-sex couple and a woman who was with her in the hospital. The same-sex couple even drove overnight from Louisiana with the baby but pulled out when Bryson started demanding money.</p>

<p>According to the prospective parents, Bryson asked them to send her $150 after previously requesting $25 to pay for food delivery.</p>

<p>"If the baby wasn't worth $200 to them, then screw all," Bryson reportedly told the couple as they headed back to Louisiana.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Wendy Williams, who lives in Houston, was in the hospital when Bryson went into labour and stayed with Bryson for the subsequent days.</p>

<p>"I felt a connection as if he were biologically mine." She said she watched Bryson suffer from withdrawals while in the hospital. "I just thought this was someone who was in a really bad position," Williams said. "The drugs had overtaken, and she just wanted to get better."</p>

<p>Court documents reveal that Bryson allowed Williams and her husband to name the baby, with both parties signing legal documents as well. While she was still in the hospital. Bryson posted on Facebook, saying she found a home for the baby and tagged Williams.</p>

<p>However, the netizens who had seen Bryson's ad, lashed out at Williams for allegedly buying the baby, which left her confused.</p>

<p>"A lot of people started commenting really really ugly things. 'How dare you sell this baby?' And then they were tagging me, 'How dare you buy this baby?'" she said.</p>

<p>When Williams confronted her, Bryson told a nurse to escort Williams out of the room. Williams then notified the Child Protective Service about the incident who arrested Bryson days later.</p>

<p>Notably, in September, a couple from the state of Arkansas was also arrested after they attempted to sell their baby boy for $1,000 and cans of beer. The parents, identified as Darien Urban (21) and Shalene Ehlers (20), signed a letter granting custody of their kid and handed him off to another person.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[In July 2022, Elon Musk suggested Donald Trumpt "hang up his hat and sail into the sunset." Fast forward a couple of years and Mr Musk now holds the world's largest megaphone with Make America Great Again (MAGA) printed on it.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The evolution of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/topic/elon-musk" target="_blank">Elon Musk</a> and <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/topic/donald-trump" target="_blank">Donald Trump</a>'s relationship has been a slow burn. Not too long ago, it could best be described as contentious. In July 2022, Mr Musk even suggested the former US President "hang up his hat and sail into the sunset." Fast forward a couple of years and Mr Musk now holds the world's largest megaphone with Make America Great Again (MAGA) printed on it as the US braces for the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/topic/us-elections" target="_blank">2024 presidential elections</a> this November.</p>

<p>Elon Musk's influence on X (formerly Twitter) has skyrocketed since its acquisition two years ago, with followers nearly doubling to 194 million.</p>

<p>This meteoric growth, however, is marred by a reputation for spreading misinformation, contributing to political violence in countries like the United Kingdom and Venezuela. Analysts link X's misinformation to real-world harm. Mr Musk's controversial moderation policy changes have weakened X's ability to regulate harmful content, amplifying incendiary rhetoric and spreading misinformation.</p>

<p>Engaging with far-right accounts, the self-proclaimed "free speech absolutist" Mr Musk has inadvertently provided these figures with a "personal algorithm booster," amplifying their reach and influence on the platform. According to the Center for Countering Digital Hate, Mr Musk has made at least 50 posts this year concerning the US election that have been debunked by independent fact-checkers, collectively attracting over 1.2 billion views. And none of these misleading posts has received community notes to fact-check the claims.</p>

<p>One example includes Mr Musk's repost in July of a manipulated campaign advertisement from Democratic nominee and US Vice President Kamala Harris, in which she seemingly referred to herself as "the ultimate diversity hire." This synthetic video has garnered 135.4 million views on X.</p>

<p>Mr Musk's increasingly subversive commentary on social media raises questions about his political alignment. How did a technocrat born in a foreign land, who previously voted "overwhelmingly" for Democrats, become Cheerleader No.1 for Republican Donald Trump, a man impeached twice while in office?</p>

<h2><strong>Elon Musk's Political Leaning</strong></h2>

<p>By the time Mr Musk was born in 1971 in apartheid South Africa, Nelson Mandela was into his seventh year of imprisonment in a cramped 8-foot by 7-foot dark cell at the isolated Robben Island prison, serving an 18-year sentence.</p>

<p>His rightward lean is the culmination of a political evolution unfolding over decades. As one of the richest and most powerful individuals globally, the Tesla and SpaceX chief's political stances carry weight.</p>

<p>Historically, Mr Musk has been somewhat reticent in his political donations. His donations have often straddled the political spectrum, reflecting a more centrist approach earlier in his career. Mr Musk referred to the US government as the "ultimate corporation" at a CEO summit in December 2020. Throughout his career, he has maintained a somewhat cautious approach to political donations, contributing moderate amounts to candidates from both parties.</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption"><span class="ins_instory_span_credit">Photo Credit: AFP</span></p>

<p>At a Vanity Fair event in 2015, Mr Musk stated, "I get involved in politics as little as possible," though he acknowledged the necessity of engaging when business interests are at stake.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His donations illustrate this ambivalence; he gave $2,000 to both George W. Bush and John Kerry in 2004, supported California Democrats, and donated $25,000 to the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) in 2006. During the 2008 primaries, he contributed to both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton but did not support either in 2016.</p>

<p>Initially a sceptic of Mr Trump, Mr Musk found himself publicly denouncing the idea of winning the GOP nomination as "embarrassing."</p>

<p>"I don't really have strong feelings except that hopefully Trump doesn't get the nomination of the Republican party, because I think that's, yeah ... that wouldn't be good," Mr Musk said at a Vanity Fair event in 2015. "I think at most he would get the Republican nomination, but I think that would still be a bit embarrassing."</p>

<h2><strong>2016 US Elections: A Radical Shift</strong></h2>

<p>Mr Musk has admitted to being a Democrat prior to the 2016 elections. His political worldview shifted dramatically during this time, particularly in response to Mr Trump's rise. In various tweets, The SpaceX chief has expressed disillusionment with established political norms and what he perceives as a failure of the political elite to address the real needs of the American people. The divisive atmosphere of the 2016 election seems to have played a role in reshaping his beliefs, leading him to embrace a more libertarian ethos that pushes for individual freedom and scepticism of government intervention.</p>

<p>As Mr Trump assumed the presidency, Mr Musk's political donations began to skew significantly Republican. By 2017, he was reportedly spending nearly seven times more on GOP campaigns than Democratic ones. His willingness to accept positions on two of Mr Trump's White House councils highlighted a shift in stance. While Mr Musk initially backed Hillary Clinton's environmental platform, he justified his participation in Mr Trump's business council as a means to raise critical issues, including the controversial travel ban targeting Muslim-majority countries. However, he resigned from these councils in June 2017, citing Mr Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord, tweeting, "Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world."</p>

<p>After a period of relative silence regarding Mr Trump, his public interactions with the former president began to increase, especially following Mr Trump's attendance at a SpaceX launch in May 2020.</p>

<p>As Joe Biden took office, Mr Musk's flirtations with the Trump-led GOP escalated. In mid-2022, he disclosed that he voted for a Republican candidate in a Texas special election. Mr Musk has argued that the Democratic Party has drifted further from the centre, making the GOP appear more palatable.</p>

<p>After acquiring Twitter, now known as X, in late 2022, Mr Musk reinstated Mr Trump's account, calling the decision to expel him after the January 6 riots "morally bad" and "foolish to the extreme."</p>

<p>Mr Musk publicly defended the former president following his felony conviction, claiming that it undermined public faith in the legal system. He echoed Mr Trump's sentiments that the conviction was politically motivated. Mr Trump has even broached the possibility of the technocrat taking an advisory role in his cabinet should he win the presidency in 2024.</p>

<p>The relationship between the two culminated in an official endorsement. Mr Musk's positioning alongside Mr Trump places him in contrast to figures like Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Meta, who has maintained a more centrist approach amid the increasing polarisation in tech and politics.</p>

<h2><strong>The Other Social Media Giant</strong></h2>

<p>Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta (formerly Facebook), has grown increasingly disillusioned with politics. Once seen as a bridge between technology and political advocacy, Mr Zuckerberg has retreated from that role.</p>

<p>The Facebook co-founder's disenchantment with politics has been shaped by years of negative experiences in Washington. In a letter to the US Congress in 2021, he revealed that the Biden administration pressured Meta to censor COVID-19 misinformation beyond what he was comfortable with, admitting that this interference made him appear biased. He also noted that he would not repeat his previous financial contributions to support election infrastructure, such as his infamous $400 million donations to the Center for Tech and Civic Life and the Center for Election Innovation and Research, which were intended to improve voting conditions during the pandemic. The contributions, earned severe backlash, especially from Republicans who accused Mr Zuckerberg of trying to bolster Democratic turnout.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2023-01/21mqmg78_mark-zuckerberg-getty_625x300_30_January_23.jpg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Mr Zuckerburg has hired prominent Republican strategist Brian Baker to help repair Meta's strained relationship with conservative media and officials. The 2020 "Zuckerbucks" controversy, in particular, has become a flashpoint in Republican criticism of the Meta chief.</p>

<p>Mr Zuckerberg has also pivoted away from the political discourse that characterised his company's approach during the 2020 presidential polls. Just days before that election, Mr Zuckerberg was concerned about potential civil unrest resulting from a divided nation. He stated that Meta needed to do "well beyond what we've done before" to protect the electoral process.</p>

<p>However, in a recent statement announcing lacklustre third-quarter results, Mr Zuckerberg omitted any mention of democracy or election integrity. Instead, he expressed a focus on creating innovative products, leading analysts to question Meta's commitment to political accountability. This abrupt change is especially striking for those who recall Mr Zuckerberg's frequent reassurances about safeguarding the electoral process and combating misinformation during key electoral periods.</p>

<h2><strong>How Silicon Valley Votes</strong></h2>

<p>In Silicon Valley, once a liberal stronghold, tech elites are increasingly expressing support for Mr Trump. In 2016, nearly all political contributions from Silicon Valley went to Hillary Clinton. By 2020, tech executives intensified their efforts to defeat Mr Trump, except for a handful of contrarians. But something has changed.</p>

<p>As reported by the Wall Street Journal, Mr Musk pledged $45 million per month to a pro-Trump super Political Action Committee (PAC) starting in July. &nbsp;Other tech heavyweights like David Sacks, a former critic of Mr Trump's actions surrounding the January 6 Capitol riot, have also thrown their weight behind the former president.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-07/5jp369v8_jeff-bezos_625x300_03_July_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>In Silicon Valley's heartlands of San Mateo and Santa Clara counties, more than half of voters remain registered Democrats as of 2022, with Republicans making up just 15 per cent. Historically, venture capitalists and tech executives overwhelmingly supported Democratic candidates. According to a Wired analysis, Democrats received $2 for every dollar sent to Republicans from the 20 most active political contributors in Silicon Valley. This remains consistent with a 2017 study showing tech elites favouring progressive policies, from wealth redistribution to immigration reform.</p>

<p>However, there's one key issue where tech moguls diverge from the Democratic platform - government regulation. As Biden ramps up antitrust lawsuits against major tech companies, including Apple, Alphabet (Google's parent), Meta, and Amazon, some Silicon Valley elites are gravitating toward Mr Trump, whose economic stance and promises of lighter regulatory burdens appear more appealing to them.</p>

<p>The administration's crackdown on crypto, including lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance, has also nudged crypto moguls toward the Republican camp.</p>

<p>Amazon chief Jeff Bezos, who has kept a more subdued profile, faced his own controversy when he abruptly cancelled The Washington Post's endorsement of Democratic nominee Kamala Harris - a decision that prompted a mass cancellation by Post subscribers.</p>

<p>The repercussions of Mr Bezos's decision were immediate: nearly a quarter-million Post readers ended their subscriptions, perceiving the move as an attempt to appease Mr Trump. While Mr Bezos denies any political intent, many of The Post's loyal readers have their doubts, especially as it has often been critical of Mr Trump's policies.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Sam Altman, co-founder of ChatGPT's parent company Open AI, has consistently donated to Democrat politicians since 2013, as per data from OpenSecrets. Mr Altman has reportedly donated over $1 million to Democratic candidates in his home state California alone.</p>

<h2><strong>2024: What's The Endgame</strong></h2>

<p>For months, Mr Musk has used X to promote conservative causes, and push conspiracy theories, often targeting immigration policies and railing against what he calls the "woke mind virus." However, his endorsement of Mr Trump and participation in his public rallies signals Mr Musk's deeper engagement in US politics.</p>

<p>Election officials in critical battleground states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Arizona are grappling with a surge in election misinformation emanating from X. Mr Musk's amplification of debunked election claims is posing a serious challenge for officials trying to maintain public trust in the voting process. Despite multiple attempts to fact-check Mr Musk in real time, election officials find themselves repeatedly outmatched. According to CNN, Stephen Richer, an Arizona election official, has even sent personal notes to Mr Musk, urging him to curb the spread of falsehoods.</p>

<p>Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson has been one of the few officials able to counter Mr Musk's claims on X effectively. After Mr Musk posted inaccurate claims about Michigan's voter registration, Ms Benson's fact-check reached over 33 million views. But even this effort led Mr Musk to retaliate, accusing her of lying.</p>

<p>In other battleground states like Georgia, officials are forgoing attempts to engage with Mr Musk directly, instead holding regular press conferences to counter misinformation. As the election nears, officials are increasingly concerned about the unchecked spread of falsehoods on X, which they fear could lead to voter confusion and legal challenges post-election.</p>

<p>Beyond misinformation, Mr Musk has been accused of turning X into an echo chamber for conservative voices, reinstating White supremacists and conspiracy theorists while clamping down on content that challenges right-wing narratives.</p>

<p>Mr Musk's endorsement of Mr Trump goes beyond shared political ideologies. His vast business empire - spanning Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, and X-relies heavily on government contracts, subsidies, and favourable policies. Should Mr Trump return to the White House, the tech billionaire stands to gain access to even more significant opportunities.</p>

<p>Mr Musk is building what he calls the "world's largest supercomputer" in Memphis for his AI startup, xAI. This high-stakes project, however, has raised eyebrows and concerns over its secrecy and potential impacts on local resources. According to a Forbes report, neither Memphis residents nor city council members were informed until the project was well underway, despite xAI's rapid progress and heavy resource demands.</p>

<p>The report claims that six months ago, Mr Musk's representatives held confidential meetings with local and federal law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Memphis Police Department. Organised by the Greater Memphis Chamber, the discussions around the project required attendees to sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) with CTC Property, a shell company managed by Mr Musk's close advisor Jared Birchall. Known for overseeing Mr Musk's ventures from SpaceX to Neuralink, Mr Birchall has reportedly enforced similar confidentiality on other Musk-led projects across the US</p>

<p>In just four months, xAI's Memphis facility - dubbed "Colossus" - went online in a repurposed factory near the Mississippi River. This massive supercomputer will draw enough power for 100,000 homes and requires more than a million gallons of water daily for cooling. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), which will provide up to 150 megawatts of electricity, is now developing an entirely new substation to meet xAI's needs. TVA has not commented on its agreements with xAI, and it remains unclear if it signed an NDA with Mr Musk's team.</p>

<p>The handling of Mr Musk's project adds to the growing list of NDAs shielding corporate projects from public scrutiny. According to Forbes, in Texas and Nevada, Mr Musk's companies used similar agreements to conceal key details from state officials.</p>

<p>A key element of Mr Musk's potential influence under a Trump presidency is the proposal that he lead a government efficiency commission. During their August conversation, Mr Musk suggested the creation of such a commission to rein in government spending, offering his expertise in cost-cutting. Mr Trump responded enthusiastically, praising the Tesla chief as the "greatest cutter" of jobs and budgets.</p>

<p>It is not the first time that a call for an "efficiency commission" has been made. Former President Ronald Reagan established a similar body called the Grace Commission during his presidency between 1981-89.</p>

<p>If Mr Musk were to head such a commission, he would gain a direct role in shaping federal spending priorities, giving him unprecedented influence over the government's financial policies. This would also put him in a position to shape regulations that could benefit his own companies. SpaceX, for example, depends on federal contracts for rocket launches, while Tesla benefits from tax credits and subsidies for electric vehicles. Mr Musk's involvement in government could give him the power to shape rules in ways that favour his business ventures.</p>

<p>According to the New York Times, SpaceX and Tesla have secured at least $15 billion in government contracts over the last decade.</p>

<p>Mr Musk's foray into national politics is not entirely unexpected. His personal and business ethos have always been aligned with a libertarian, anti-regulation philosophy. He has frequently clashed with government oversight, particularly in California, where he fought against public health restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic and has sparred with labour interests.</p>

<p>But Washington is a different arena. The federal government's bureaucracy, regulations, and competing interests present a more complicated landscape than the world of Silicon Valley startups and high-tech innovation. Mr Musk's potential role in a future Trump administration could place him at the intersection of business, politics, and governance in unprecedented ways.</p>

<p>Critics argue that Mr Musk's history as a contrarian and his approach to leadership, which has often involved drastic cost-cutting and labour disputes, may not translate well into the political sphere.</p>

<p>Mr Musk's political clout has grown significantly since his purchase of X. While his platform has lost value, with investors reportedly losing over $24 billion, Mr Musk's influence in conservative political circles has increased. His willingness to leverage X as a political tool, combined with his ability to engage with Mr Trump and other political figures directly, positions Mr Musk as an unexpected player in the upcoming election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris courted voters angered by the Gaza war while Donald Trump doubled down on violent rhetoric with a comment about journalists being shot as the tense US election campaign entered its final hours.</p>

<p>The Democratic vice president and the Republican former president frantically blitzed several swing states as they tried to win over the last holdouts with less than 36 hours left until polls open on Election Day on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Trump predicted a "landslide", while Harris told a raucous rally in must-win Michigan that "we have momentum -- it's on our side."</p>

<p>The 2024 race is going down to the wire, with more key states effectively tied at this point than in any comparable election. Over 77.6 million people have cast early votes, around half of the total ballots cast in 2020.</p>

<p>With the clock ticking, Harris, 60, spent the day in Michigan where she risks losing the critical support of a 200,000-strong Arab-American community that has denounced US handling of the Israel-Hamas war.</p>

<p>"As president, I will do everything in my power to end the war in Gaza," Harris said at the start of her speech at Michigan State University, noting that there were leaders of the community present.</p>

<p><strong>'Demonic'</strong></p>

<p>But the rest of the speech was upbeat, with Harris spending more time on urging people to get out and vote than on attacks on Trump.</p>

<p>"We got two days to get this done," she said.</p>

<p>Earlier, Harris quoted scripture in a majority-Black church in Detroit, Michigan and urging Americans to look beyond Trump.</p>

<p>"Let us turn the page and write the next chapter of our history," she said.</p>

<p>Trump on Sunday zigzagged through Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia -- the three biggest swing-state prizes in the Electoral College system that awards US states influence according to their population.</p>

<p>The 78-year-old Trump, the oldest major party candidate in US history, added to his increasingly dark rhetoric by musing to supporters in Lititz, Pennsylvania, that he wouldn't mind if journalists were shot.</p>

<p>Discussing his the near-miss assassination attempt against him in July, he said to laughter that to be hit again "somebody would have to shoot through the fake news -- and I don't mind that so much."</p>

<p>Trump called Democrats "demonic" and, despite no evidence of any meaningful election cheating so far, claimed that Democrats in Pennsylvania "are fighting so hard to steal this damn thing."</p>

<p>Adding to fears that he would not accept a defeat in 2024, Trump added that he "shouldn't have left" the White House after he lost his 2020 reelection effort to Joe Biden.</p>

<p><strong>RFK Jr controversy</strong></p>

<p>Trump meanwhile said in Macon, Georgia, that he had asked vaccine-skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who dropped his own presidential bid to support Trump, to work on "women's health" and "pesticides."</p>

<p>His comments came a day after Kennedy caused consternation by saying that a Trump White House would order US water systems to remove fluoride from public water supplies.</p>

<p>Later in another rambling speech in Kinston, North Carolina Trump said "we're going to have on Tuesday a landslide that's too big to rig."</p>

<p>The polls however show that the result is likely to be historically tight.</p>

<p>A final New York Times/Siena poll Sunday flagged incremental changes in swing states, but the results from all seven remained within the margin of error.</p>

<p>Harris got a boost Saturday as the final Des Moines Register poll for Iowa -- seen as a highly credible test of wider public sentiment -- showed a stunning turnaround, with Harris ahead in a state won easily by Trump in 2016 and 2020.</p>

<p>In the last hours, both candidates are desperately trying to shore up their bases, and win over any undecided voters.</p>

<p>Pollsters have noted an erosion in Black support for Harris.</p>

<p>But with abortion rights a top voter concern, her campaign has hailed the large proportion of women turning out among early voters.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All eyes are on the US elections 2024. Ahead of the November 5 voting, former President Donald Trump is leading the predictions, especially in all seven swing states, shows <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://file:///C:/Users/aasthaa/Downloads/Atlas%20Poll%20US%20Elections%20National%20-%2002%20Nov%202024.pdf" rel="nofollow,noindex">AtlasIntel's latest poll</a>.</p>

<p>About 49% of the respondents said they would vote for Donald Trump in the upcoming presidential election, the poll shows, as the Republicans hold a 1.8% vote lead over his counterpart Democrat Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>The survey conducted on the first two days of November included nearly 2,500 likely voters in the US, the majority female.</p>

<p>As the 2024 Presidential Election heads into its final days the focus is on swing states, the battleground states which are the major deciders of the US presidential election.</p>

<p>Another <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://file:///C:/Users/aasthaa/Downloads/Atlas%20Poll%20-%20US%20Swing%20States%20-%2002-11-2024.pdf" rel="nofollow,noindex">survey of swing states</a> has revealed that the Republican nominee is favored to win in all swing states – Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p>

<p>In Arizona, Trump holds his widest margin — with a 51.9% to 45.1% lead over Harris.</p>

<p>In Nevada, when asked whom would people vote for in the upcoming presidential election, 51.4% of voters chose Trump while 45.9% chose Harris.</p>

<p>In North Carolina, Trump leads by 50.4% of votes, while Harris gets 46.8% of the vote share.</p>

<p>In the US, presidential elections are shaped by three types of states: Red States, Blue States, and Swing States. Red States are those where Republicans have consistently won since 1980, while Blue States are where Democrats have dominated since 1992. These states are generally considered predictable in terms of their electoral outcomes.</p>

<p>In Swing states, the battle between Republicans and Democrats is often extremely close, with winners prevailing by tiny margins. For instance, in the 2020 presidential election, Joe Biden won Arizona by just 10,000 votes.</p>

<p>A <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/days-ahead-of-2024-us-presidential-elections-poll-shows-kamala-harris-leading-donald-trump-by-single-point-6904709">Reuters/Ipsos poll</a> published last week on October 29 showed Kamala Harris lead over Donald Trump, with the Democrat ahead by a single percentage point over the Republican, 44% to 43%.</p>

<p>Interestingly, while Harris has led Trump in every Reuters/Ipsos poll of registered voters since she entered the race in July, her lead has steadily shrunk since late September.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Upholding the right to practice religion "freely and safely", Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday called the violence at a Hindu temple near Toronto "unacceptable".</p>

<p>Heavy police deployment was seen at the Hindu Sabha temple in Brampton after skirmishes blamed by some leaders on Sikh activists. In videos that went viral, some men were seen breaching the gates of the temple and assaulting devotees inside the complex.</p>

<p>A spokesman for the Peel Regional Police told AFP that no arrests had been made. Police have also declined to assign blame for the reported violence.</p>

<p>Canada MP Chandra Arya said the incident showed how "deep and brazen" violent extremism has become in Canada. "Hindu-Canadians, for the security and safety of our community, &nbsp;need to step up and asserts their rights and hold politicians accountable," the member of Trudeau's Liberal Party wrote. He also alleged that extremist elements have infiltrated both the political apparatus and law enforcement agencies of Canada.</p>

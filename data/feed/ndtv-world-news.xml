       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran on Thursday called Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election an opportunity for the United States to reassess past "wrong policies".</p>

<p>Trump, who is set to return to the White House in January after defeating US Vice President Kamala Harris in Tuesday's election, had pursued a "maximum pressure" strategy on Iran during his first term.</p>

<p>"We have very bitter experiences with the policies and approaches of different US governments in the past," foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei was quoted as saying by state news agency IRNA.</p>

<p>Trump's win, he added, was a chance "to review previous wrong policies".</p>

<p>Iran and the United States have been adversaries since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, which overthrew the Western-backed shah, but tensions peaked during Trump's first term from 2017 to 2021.</p>

<p>Before Trump was declared the winner on Wednesday, Iran had dismissed the US election as irrelevant.</p>

<p>"The general policies of the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran are fixed," said government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter who becomes president. Plans have already been set so that there is no change in people's livelihood," she added.</p>

<p>During his first term, Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and imposed harsh sanctions on the Islamic republic.</p>

<p>In 2020, under Trump's presidency, the United States killed revered Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps general Qasem Soleimani in an air strike on Baghdad airport.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The victim's daughter told police that her mother's new haircut was the motive behind the attack.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Pennsylvania man has been arrested and charged with homicide after allegedly fatally stabbing his girlfriend in a violent attack. According to court documents obtained by <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.pennlive.com/crime/2024/11/man-charged-with-homicide-in-fatal-central-pa-stabbing.html">PennLive</a></em>, Benjamin Gual, 49, allegedly stabbed his 50-year-old girlfriend to death because he was upset that she had cut her hair.&nbsp;The victim's daughter reportedly told police that her mother's new haircut was the motive behind the attack. She further revealed that Gual had previously threatened to stab her mother over the haircut, prompting Carmen Martinez-Silva to seek temporary refuge at her daughter's home overnight.</p>

<p>After spending the night at her daughter's home, Martinez-Silva visited her brother's residence and simultaneously asked a friend to inform Gual that their relationship was over, according to the probable cause affidavit. Meanwhile, Gual had been searching for her and eventually tracked her down to her brother's home.</p>

<p>Upon arrival, Gual was initially told by Martinez-Silva's brother that she wasn't there. However, when he returned minutes later, he violently attacked the brother with a knife. Martinez-Silva intervened in an attempt to protect her sibling, but Gual turned his aggression towards her, unleashing a frenzied stabbing attack.</p>

<p>Martinez-Silva was found dead at the scene by cops while her brother suffered multiple stab wounds.&nbsp;Two bystanders who attempted to intervene and stop the stabbing spree narrowly escaped being knifed by Gual.</p>

<p>When police arrived at the scene, they found Benjamin Gual still present, sitting in his car with the knife used in the attack still in his hand. The knife had visible blood on it, according to court documents. Gual has been charged with multiple counts, including homicide, attempted homicide, aggravated assault, and reckless endangerment.&nbsp;He is currently being held at the Lancaster County Jail without bail, pending further legal proceedings.</p>

<p>A <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-us-honor-carmen-martinezs-memory?fbclid=IwY2xjawGYpbRleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHbFtSJhqc8MOwFiIDl_x_mKB8OSDu1PLKaY478hSVMKZ6hGO0tpStKnaFw_aem_Wk4Ggb2pYrjmh1iuBfBQbw">GoFundMe page</a> has been set up by Martinez-Silva's family to raise funds for her funeral. ''The family is devastated by this loss we would've never imagined a tragedy like this would happen to our beloved Carmen. We know this time is hard for a lot of us, but we are please asking it you feel in your heart to donate anything that will help the family to be able to put her to rest as she deserves,''&nbsp;part of the fundraiser reads.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>World leaders raced to congratulate Donald Trump on Wednesday as he triumphed in a stunning US election victory over Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>European leaders in particular were quick to extend their best wishes and offers of cooperation, in contrast to a much cooler reaction when Trump won for the first time in 2016.</p>

<p>There were some exceptions, such as Russia, where the foreign ministry frostily commented on the outcome but let it be known that no congratulations would be forthcoming from President Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>Here are Wednesday's reactions, with many being expressed even before the election win was confirmed:</p>

<p><strong>China: 'mutual respect'</strong></p>

<p>Without directly mentioning Trump, foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told a regular briefing that China hopes for "peaceful coexistence" with the United States.</p>

<p>"We will continue to approach and handle China-US relations based on the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation," she said.</p>

<p><strong>Russia: 'no illusions'</strong></p>

<p>"We are under no illusions about the American President-elect," Moscow's foreign ministry said, adding that it will "work with" a new US administration and prioritise achieving its "set goals" in Ukraine. It said its "conditions" on ending the conflict "are unchanged and are well known in Washington".</p>

<p><strong>Israel: 'powerful recommitment'</strong></p>

<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described Trump's win as "history's greatest comeback" as well as a "new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America."</p>

<p>President Volodymyr Zelensky congratulated Donald Trump on his "impressive victory" and said he hoped his presidency would bring a "just peace in Ukraine closer."</p>

<p>NATO chief Mark Rutte said Trump's return to power would help keep the alliance "strong".</p>

<p>"His leadership will again be key to keeping our Alliance strong. I look forward to working with him again to advance peace through strength through NATO," Rutte said in a statement.</p>

<p><strong>EU: 'strong transatlantic agenda'</strong></p>

<p>"I warmly congratulate Donald J. Trump," European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen wrote on X. "We are bound by a true partnership between our people, uniting 800 million citizens. Let's work together on a strong transatlantic agenda that keeps delivering for them."</p>

<p><strong>United Nations: 'work constructively'</strong></p>

<p><strong>Germany: 'better off together'</strong></p>

<p>Chancellor Olaf Scholz told Trump: "we're better off together."</p>

<p>"Both sides benefit from the transatlantic partnership," Scholz said in a statement to media. "The EU and the USA are two similarly large economic areas, linked by the closest economic relations in the world."</p>

<p><strong>Mexico: 'no concern'</strong></p>

<p>President Claudia Sheinbaum said Trump's election victory was "no cause for concern", despite his threats of tariffs and mass migrant deportations.</p>

<p>"We are a free, independent, sovereign country and there will be good relations with the United States. I am convinced of this," she told a news conference.</p>

<p><strong>Brazil: 'luck and success'&nbsp;</strong></p>

       <description><![CDATA[Exit polls showed that Kamala Harris had an eight-point advantage among women voters -- but that was nearly half what Joe Biden had mustered four years ago.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>She needed their support, but it wasn't enough: Kamala Harris failed to get as many women to back her as she had hoped, despite a presidential campaign heavily focused on abortion access, in the face of Donald Trump's macho rhetoric.</p>

<p>Exit polls conducted by CNN showed that the Democratic vice president had an eight-point advantage among women voters -- but that was nearly half what Joe Biden had mustered four years ago.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the flip side, the Republican once and future president had a 13-point lead over his rival with men, as opposed to an eight-point boost when he faced Biden in 2020.</p>

<p>"I think there were high expectations going into the election about how women would vote," Sabrina Karim, a professor at Cornell University, told AFP.</p>

<p>"But it is always important to remember that women are not a monolithic group," and "their concerns are multi-faceted," Karim noted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The CNN exit poll shows Harris's dominance with Black women voters, for example, while Trump did better with white women.</p>

<p>"The Harris campaign's strong focus on abortion likely energized some women to vote, but a single issue was not enough to bring a diverse range of women to vote for Harris," Karim said.</p>

<p>Nathalie Feldgun, a lawyer in New York, said she felt it was time for Trump to return to the Oval Office.</p>

<p>"The country doesn't have a border. It's not a country," said Feldgun, who had been persuaded by the Republican's stark anti-immigration rhetoric.</p>

<p>The economy -- and inflation in particular -- played a major role in the election, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In many US households, women are the primary shoppers, and felt the pinch as prices of basic goods soared.</p>

<p>"I have five children, and the economy for the past three-and-a-half years was bad," Tessa Bonet, a 51-year-old immigrant from Guyana who lives in New York, told AFP at Trump's giant Madison Square Garden rally.</p>

<p>"I'm here for change and my eyes are wide open," she said. "Trump means well for us -- yes, regular Americans."</p>

<p>Harris did not make her identity as a Black woman also of South Asian descent a major part of the campaign, relying on surrogates like former first lady Michelle Obama, Republican former lawmaker Liz Cheney or celebrities like Beyonce to do it for her.</p>

<p>But neither Obama's powerful feminist speeches nor an endorsement from pop megastar Taylor Swift prevented Trump from scoring a decisive victory, despite the repeated sexist remarks he made at his opponent's expense.</p>

<p>Just a week ago, he made waves when he told one campaign rally in an anti-crime appeal: "I want to protect the women of our country... whether the women like it or not."</p>

<p>The 78-year-old Trump even called the 60-year-old Harris "mentally disabled" and "retarded," and suggested she would become "a playtoy" for other world leaders if elected.</p>

<p>At the last minute, the Harris campaign tried to bet that women in conservative households would secretly vote for her despite the misgivings of their husbands, but the strategy was a flop.</p>

<p>In an ad financed by a progressive Christian group, and narrated by Oscar winner Julia Roberts, a woman is shown voting for Harris -- and hiding it from her apparently Trump-leaning spouse.</p>

<p>"In the one place in America where women still have a right to choose, you can vote any way you want, and no one will ever know," Roberts says.</p>

<p>"Did you make the right choice?" the husband asks his wife, who responds: "Sure did, honey," exchanging a smile and a wink with another woman voter.</p>

<p>"That was an appealing idea, but now we know it's pretty much just wishful thinking," said Alex Keena, a professor of political science at Virginia Commonwealth University.</p>

<p>For Karim, "gender dynamics are not limited to women, but what masculine appeal Trump has for a diverse range of men."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Exit polls showed that Trump got a boost from Latino voters, while Biden had largely beaten him with that part of the electorate four years ago.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump sealed a dramatic comeback to power after sweeping to victory in the US presidential election against Kamala Harris.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US allies at NATO scrambled Wednesday to put a brave face on the return of Donald Trump to the White House amid fears the unpredictable Republican could upend European security and pull the plug on Ukraine support.&nbsp;Trump sealed a dramatic comeback to power after sweeping to victory in the US presidential election against Democrat Kamala Harris.&nbsp;</p>

<p>NATO chief Mark Rutte - chosen recently in part due to his good relations with Trump -- was quick to congratulate the victor and played up the positive impact he could make.</p>

<p>"His leadership will again be key to keeping our Alliance strong. I look forward to working with him again to advance peace through strength through NATO," Rutte said.</p>

<p>But beneath the veneer of calm, there remains deep disquiet about what Trump could do to European security as an aggressive Russia wages war on Ukraine just beyond NATO's border.</p>

<p>The volatile former reality TV star rattled NATO during the campaign by saying he'd encourage Moscow to "do whatever the hell they want" to members not spending enough on defence.</p>

<p>Senior diplomats at NATO, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive issues, sought to put a positive spin on his return for a second term, saying it could push Europe to get serious about protecting itself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Why be scared by Trump now? It is going to be rough, but at least he will pump some energy into the whole thing," one diplomat said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump's first term in power was a rollercoaster for NATO as the bulldozing president lambasted European allies such as Germany for weak defence spending and reportedly even mulled pulling Washington out.</p>

<p>But officials said that not only did the alliance survive -- it actually emerged stronger as Trump and his no-holds-barred style pressured Europe to spend more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"During his first term, our working relationship focused on bolstering transatlantic security and adapting NATO for the future. In a world of growing instability, strong US leadership remains essential," former NATO head Jens Stoltenberg wrote on X.</p>

<p>- 'A different world' -<br />
Analyst Camille Grand of the European Council on Foreign Relations said there are "two theories" on how a second Trump term could go for NATO.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"One is that it will be like the first time, unpleasant but not catastrophic," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Or, we are today in a different world with a Trump entourage who are unwaveringly Trumpist, who share his doubts about alliances, support for Ukraine; and especially during the first mandate there was no war in Europe."</p>

<p>In a bid to appeal to Trump, NATO leaders have sought to repeatedly credit him with making other allies cough up more on defence.</p>

<p>The urgency on spending in Europe was ramped up by Moscow's 2022 invasion of Ukraine and now 23 of the 32 NATO members reach the target of spending two percent of gross domestic produce on defence -- up from just three a decade ago.</p>

<p>Now the feeling is that Europe will have to do even more to make sure it can stand on its own.</p>

<p>"I expect a serious push to finally start taking our security and defence in Europe seriously, to invest much more, to finally do it," said one former senior NATO diplomat.</p>

<p>But the ex-official warned to expect more rhetoric from Trump questioning Washington's commitment to NATO's collective defence clause that would "undermine security" and could embolden Russia and China.</p>

<p>For Ukraine, already struggling to hold back the Kremlin's forces on the battlefield, the picture appears grim.</p>

<p>Trump has cast doubt on continuing US military support for Kyiv and promised to cut a quick deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war.</p>

<p>"If Trump starts negotiations with Russia, it will be very transactional, not built on values and principles -- and this may lead to a result that would be catastrophic for Ukraine and for the whole of Europe," the former diplomat said.</p>

<p>Other officials agreed that Ukraine was in a perilous position, but said Trump coming to power could give Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky the cover to make hard compromises.</p>

<p>And if Putin pushes for too much he could find the notoriously whimsical Trump far from pliant -- and even willing to back Kyiv harder if the Kremlin doesn't give ground.</p>

<p>"The Russians always make exaggerated demands," said the first NATO diplomat.</p>

<p>"If they annoy Trump too much, they will get something in return they weren't counting for."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Donald Trump's victory was, let's say, an emphatic contradiction of the legacy media's confidence that the race was “too close to call”. So, did the traditional media genuinely get it wrong? Or was it an inspired act of wishful thinking? We might never know, but that's a mystery for another day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today, let's talk about the man of the hour: Elon Musk. The billionaire who spent months reshaping Twitter (now X) after he bought it in 2021, was duly accused by the mainstream media of amplifying certain voices and curbing others. Nevertheless, he did indeed seem to play his part in shaping public opinion like a maestro. I couldn't help but wonder whether Trump would pause during his victory lap in Florida to give a shoutout to Musk, perhaps for handing him this sweet electoral success on a digital platter.</p>

<h2><strong>'An Amazing Guy'</strong></h2>

<p>Often magnanimous in praise, Trump indeed gave Musk his due with loud cheers from the gathering crowd, declaring, “A star is born!” and calling him “an amazing guy”. &nbsp;If Trump were a Bollywood fan, he might as well have said to the Tesla boss, "<em>Jo jeeta wahi Sikander</em>"! For, Musk, the Great Gambler, gambled his entire empire—X, Tesla, SpaceX and other ventures—for Trump. And it has now paid off handsomely.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Podcaster Joe Rogan's millions of followers might point out that his endorsement was a game-changer. Who knows, it might have been. Roger, the world's most-followed podcaster, endorsed Trump in the campaign's final days and reached millions. He also interviewed Trump's running mate, JD Vance, and yes, Musk, too. For those who do not know, Rogan has 18 million subscribers on YouTube and 14 million on Spotify. Musk has 200 million followers on X. No traditional media has such reach. Legacy media honchos may not like this data, but it is hard to argue against the fact that Musk's massive reach and his hands-on approach to steering the Trump campaign in the right direction paid rich dividends.</p>

<h2><strong>Musk's Spaces Session</strong></h2>

<p>As voting drew to a close, Musk decided to hit Spaces for a live chat on X. I joined in—and so did 17,000 others, staying glued to every word for a full hour. He held court like a seasoned political analyst, fielding questions and giving his take on the election's high stakes and the future of American politics. It was a one-man show, no doubt, in support of his new-found ally, Trump. “This will be the last election” if Trump doesn't win, he warned, in reply to a question, still unsure of the impending victory on election night, making it clear he saw this election as a final stand. And yet, he sounded confident of Trump's triumph as he saw a steady increase in his popularity in all the seven swing states. At one point, he declared that Trump could take all the seven swing states. That, indeed, turned out to be true.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The world's richest man helped create a Political Action Committee (PAC), called America PAC, whose primary task was to support Trump's presidency by encouraging early voting and mail-in ballots in swing states. As we witnessed, in terms of early voting trends, some states started seeing record numbers. According to the Election Lab at the University of Florida, over 8 million Americans had voted early, with 1.8 million voting in person and 6.5 million returning mail ballots. Musk emphasised in his Spaces chat how much the American PAC mobilised voters to go to the polling booths to vote.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>The Failure Of Mainstream Media</strong></h2>

<p>If we are to take mainstream media, such as <em>The New York Times</em> and <em>The Washington Post </em>at their word, Musk didn't just throw a fistful of dollars at Trump's campaign. He, according to these papers, poured a whopping $80-120 million into America PAC—practically his own political slush fund for Trump. Musk isn't your average billionaire donor either: normally, most big donors write a cheque and watch from the sidelines. Musk, however, officially hopped on to the campaign ride after he endorsed his man in July. US media have it: he wasn't just a silent partner, he was frequently on the phone with Trump, sometimes even taking the stage beside him. In a campaign season packed with uncertainties and political slugfest, Musk managed to stand out by transforming himself into a real-time megaphone for Trump.</p>

<p>Right now, Musk's popularity in the US is perhaps next only to Trump. It wouldn't be a stretch to say that many would have even rooted for him to be a future presidential candidate if he could run for the coveted post (he can't as he was not born in the US). Even so, he has managed to make waves in the 2024 presidential election. His bold $1 million voter petition giveaway has stirred up questions about election law. Experts were divided: some claimed it edges into sketchy legal territory, while others argued that it's a loophole-free move, as signing his petition isn't explicitly tied to voter registration. A petition challenging Musk's move was thrown out by court.</p>

<h2><strong>Musk's Moment Of Reckoning</strong></h2>

<p>Ironically, Musk, 53, was, not so long ago, a moderate Democrat. He and twice-elected Barack Obama were known to be buddies. He had endorsed Obama both in 2008 and 2012. He had even donated to his re-election campaign. During the Biden presidency, he described himself as "half Democrat, half Republican" and "socially liberal and fiscally conservative".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Musk's endorsement of Trump came hot on the heels of Trump surviving a July 2024 assassination attempt. He wasted no time, conveying his “full support” and wishing Trump a speedy recovery. He later praised Trump's policies, especially on immigration and meritocracy, leaving little doubt about his loyalty. His endorsement clearly boosted Trump's profile among conservative and libertarian crowds. Musk's alignment with the Republican's divisive policies has drawn its share of criticism, but there's no denying that his influence helped give Trump a substantial leg up in visibility and credibility.</p>

<h2><strong>Biden's Snub Was Unwise</strong></h2>

<p>But what really pushed Musk into Trump's arms? &nbsp;Apparently, it was none other than Joe Biden. It was widely reported in 2021 that when Tesla officials reached out to the White House several times, they were repeatedly rebuffed. Apparently, the Biden administration's wish to avoid angering the powerful United Auto Workers union, which had been critical of Tesla's labour practices, was the main reason behind this snubbing.</p>

<p>More frustratingly for Musk, he was believed to be quite angry when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rejected SpaceX's application for nearly $900 million in broadband subsidies, citing that the company failed to "meet basic programme requirements". Musk disagreed with the decision, stating that Starlink, SpaceX's satellite internet service, was the only provider actively solving rural broadband issues at scale. Musk felt the decision was part of a "pattern of regulatory harassment" against him. Several times, Musk vented his frustration against government regulatory authorities, terming them anti-development. After Biden came to power, the scrutiny of Musk's various ventures intensified, with investigations and actions from at least seven federal agencies.</p>

<h2><strong>Musk, Now A Regulator To The Regulators?</strong></h2>

<p>Many have asked, what's in it for Musk? Fair question. Trump isn't exactly coy about it—he has already dangled the role of the head of a “government efficiency commission” before Musk, practically promising him a front-row seat to slice through federal spending and chop down regulatory bodies. When asked about Trump's offer on a live Spaces chat, Musk sounded ready to roll, claiming he'd tackle government “over-spending” by paring back agencies. “There shouldn't be more referees than players,” he quipped, nodding at the countless regulatory bodies in the system, which, he says, stifle innovation more than they support it.</p>

<p>It's funnily ironic, though. Musk, who thrived under government oversight to launch EVs, rockets and even internet satellites, is now poised to lead the charge against the very regulatory labyrinth that boosted his empire, but which also of course sometimes harassed him. Conflict of interest? Maybe. But Musk seems more than happy to play regulator to the regulators.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump won the US Presidential elections on Tuesday, defeating Vice-President Kamala Harris by 69 electoral votes. While Harris still carried New Jersey, Trump significantly reduced the gap from previous elections in the historically blue state. Having lost New Jersey by double digits in 2016 and 2020, Trump finished election night just five points behind Harris, the closest margin for a Republican presidential candidate in the state since George W Bush's 2.4-point loss in 1992.</p>

<p>This shift is significant considering the massive growth of registered Democratic voters in New Jersey who outnumber Republicans by a 900,000-voter margin. Yet, Trump's surge indicates that the state's traditionally solid Democratic slant is beginning to erode.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump's influence extended beyond New Jersey, with the Republicans securing victories in key swing states of Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina, and Georgia, and currently leading in Arizona and Nevada. Trump even rallied in South Jersey, suggesting the state could be competitive, mentioning as recently as the weekend before the election that "a little birdie" told him he was leading Harris in New Jersey.</p>

<p>"We had a beautiful day yesterday," said Jose Arango, Republican Party chair of urban Hudson County, a region traditionally dominated by Democrats. Mr Arango believes that working-class Hispanics in Hudson County, struggling with rising rents and taxes, are increasingly dissatisfied with the status quo.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hudson County, home to a 41 per cent Hispanic population, saw a shift from 26 per cent support for Trump in 2020 to around 35 per cent this year. Similarly, Passaic County, which also boasts a significant Hispanic population, voted for Trump, contributing to a much closer-than-expected race in New Jersey's traditionally Democratic 9th District. Democrat Nellie Pou won the district by only 4 points, a visible contrast to her 34-point victory in 2020, Politico reported.</p>

<p>"We certainly saw a wave, a red wave, around the country last night," Ms Pou said, as per the outlet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The shifting demographics in Passaic County, home to one of the largest Arab American populations in the US, also played a significant role. "I think people are at a point where they're willing to use any means electorally to get their voice out," Ali Aljarrah, senior adviser for the Council on American-Islamic Relations Action New Jersey, told Politico. "It's not exclusive to the Arab or Muslim community. We see the Hispanic community even in Hudson County go rightwards."</p>

<p>Despite the unexpectedly tight race, Democrats managed to hold onto all nine of their House seats and retain a US Senate seat, which hasn't been Republican since 1972.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Hollywood-led fundraisers helped raise tens of millions of dollars for Kamala Harris's record-breaking campaign war chest.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A raft of celebrities from Taylor Swift and Beyonce to George Clooney and Harrison Ford proved unable to prevent Kamala Harris's crushing defeat in the US election, underlining the limited impact of sweeping star endorsements on voters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Instead, it was Donald Trump and the Republicans -- who received scant support from the entertainment industry at large, but tapped into a targeted subset of well-known, hypermasculine influencers -- who won comfortably.</p>

<p>So, did the Democrats' long-standing Hollywood and music industry connections, including last-minute rally appearances from Lady Gaga and Jennifer Lopez, make any difference at all in the end?</p>

<p>"Not in this election, clearly," said New York University arts professor Laurence Maslon.</p>

<p>"At the end of the day, people probably realize that Beyonce and George Clooney don't have to worry about the cost of gas or the cost of eggs -- so maybe they're sort of irrelevant," he told AFP.</p>

<p>Celebrity endorsements have long been part of the fabric of US elections, harking back to the days when Frank Sinatra wrangled the "Rat Pack" to support John F. Kennedy in 1960.</p>

<p>Even this year, Hollywood-led fundraisers helped raise tens of millions of dollars for Harris's record-breaking campaign war chest.</p>

<p>But their impact in actually influencing votes has always been a "mixed bag," said Arizona State University associate professor Margaretha Bentley, who teaches a public policy course on Taylor Swift.</p>

<p>"It's never going to be the golden ticket that everybody's looking for," she said.</p>

<p>Mark Harvey, author of "Celebrity Influence: Politics, Persuasion, and Issue-Based Advocacy," agreed that we "shouldn't be terribly surprised" by the lack of celebrity impact.</p>

<p>"There isn't a real strong science behind this idea that celebrities can influence people to vote for candidates," he said.</p>

<p>- 'Macho' -<br />
Famous supporters have only ever been effective when advocating on very specific issues on which they are widely regarded as expert, added Harvey.</p>

<p>As Donald Trump delivered his victory speech early Wednesday, the new president-elect was flanked by -- and showered praise on -- famous names from the world of sport.</p>

<p>UFC boss Dana White was lovingly hailed as "tough" and "a piece of work," while golfer Bryson DeChambeau was celebrated as "fantastic" and even having a "slightly longer" drive than the golf-loving Trump.</p>

<p>Loud cheers -- and a significant portion of Trump's address -- were devoted to his best-known supporter of all, tech billionaire Elon Musk.</p>

<p>Trump also received a last-minute endorsement from Joe Rogan, the influential host of one of the world's top podcasts.</p>

<p>The Republican may have benefited from these associations because, in an election "largely driven by cultural issues, one of the most potent cultural issues was masculinity," said Harvey.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This sort of 'be a real man,' the Trump 'macho' sort of thing... it's the kind of thing that Joe Rogan plays all the time."</p>

<p>- 'Shocked' -<br />
For the Democrats, this latest scarring experience will require a "deep self-analysis... of what they did and didn't do, and what might have been successful," including with celebrity endorsements, said Bentley.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ashley Spillane, author of the report "Celebrities Strengthening Our Culture of Democracy," agreed there was "debate" about the "value and impact of celebrity endorsements of candidates."</p>

<p>But there is still "robust evidence that celebrities do have a real impact in promoting overall, nonpartisan civic engagement," she wrote via email, pointing to Swift's endorsement of Harris, which was credited with driving 400,000 people to a voter registration site.</p>

<p>Even if their endorsements failed, Hollywood celebrities showed no indication Wednesday that they would remain silent.</p>

<p>Waking up to the news of Trump's victory, several well-known figures took to social media to vent their frustrations.</p>

<p>Oscar winner Jamie Lee Curtis said Trump's win would usher in "a sure return to a more restrictive, some fear draconian time."</p>

<p>"Fascist with total power... That may have been the last free election," wrote actor John Cusack. "Horror is coming."</p>

<p>Pop singer Cardi B, who appeared at a Harris rally last Friday, simply wrote: "I hate yall bad."&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[2024 US Elections: US Vice-President Kamala Harris conceded the 2024 presidential race to Donald Trump, ending a campaign many Democrats hoped would usher in the country's first female president.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice-President Kamala Harris conceded the 2024 presidential race to Donald Trump, ending a campaign many Democrats hoped would usher in the country's first female president. In her speech, Kamala Harris accepted the people's mandate for Trump after what was a hard-fought campaign.<br />
<br />
<strong>Struggles with Biden ties and defining her own path</strong><br />
<br />
Harris' campaign struggled from the very beginning, with issues that later proved insurmountable. According to a report in <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/06/politics/harris-campaign-went-wrong/index.html" rel="nofollow,noindex">CNN</a>, key moments, including her appearance on ABC's ‘The View,' showcased her challenge in differentiating herself from the Biden administration. Asked what she would have done differently from Biden, Harris said, “There is not a thing that comes to mind.” Realising the potential misstep, she added that she would consider including a Republican in her Cabinet.<br />
<br />
Despite efforts from campaign aides to clarify her stance, the perception that she was closely tied to Biden's policies became a persistent hurdle. According to a Democratic source, who spoke to CNN, Harris avoided highlighting her differences with Biden on key policies, such as capital gains taxes and child tax credits, out of loyalty. Yet, as the campaign progressed, she appeared hesitant, losing the confident approach that characterised her earlier appearances.<br />
<br />
<strong>Difficulty in building voter trust and support</strong><br />
<br />
Political observers and senior campaign aides pointed to Harris' inability to establish a clear identity apart from Biden as one of the key reasons for her struggle to connect with undecided voters. By the time she began articulating stronger views on contentious issues, such as Biden's support for Israel and his handling of the economy, many voters had already formed their impressions, leading some to turn towards other candidates.<br />
<br />
In retrospect, some Democratic strategists argue that Biden's continued influence over the party might have inadvertently hindered Harris' chances. The CNN report said that a few aides had even urged Biden to step back following the 2022 midterms to allow for a primary process that could have better prepared the party's candidate for the general election.<br />
<br />
<strong>Late optimism fails to deliver</strong><br />
<br />
Harris' campaign was marked by a rollercoaster of optimism and frustration. In the weeks leading up to Election Day, there was some hope among senior campaign staffers as Harris appeared to gain momentum in key battleground states. Yet, it was all short-lived. Aides cited a powerful ground campaign and endorsements from prominent figures, including Liz Cheney and former President Bill Clinton, as evidence of their strength. But that extensive network and high-profile support proved insufficient.<br />
<br />
“I can't imagine… what it would be like if Donald Trump won because he is telling us such dark and sinister things that he's going to do, and I believe him,” New Jersey Senator Cory Booker said in an interview during a campaign event in Pennsylvania, one of the crucial battleground states. Booker stressed the need for Democrats to stay engaged, regardless of the outcome, telling his staff that resilience is essential.<br />
<br />
Tensions within Harris' campaign also emerged as a significant factor. The sudden campaign reshuffle in July, when she replaced Biden as the Democratic candidate, left her team feeling underprepared. Campaign insiders reported internal disputes regarding Harris' running mate, with Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro initially seen as a strong choice due to his appeal in key swing states. Harris ultimately selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, someone she felt aligned more with her campaign values. Yet, this decision raised eyebrows among some Democrats, who felt Shapiro would have provided a stronger counterpoint to Trump's candidacy.<br />
<br />
As results poured in on election night, the mood at Harris' campaign headquarters shifted rapidly. Anticipation turned to disappointment as it became evident that Trump was pulling ahead.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[2024 US Elections: The United States has a new President-Elect, and it's Donald Trump, who brings, above all, unpredictability to the White House.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States has a new President-Elect, and it's Donald Trump, who brings, above all, unpredictability to the White House. It's been just over twenty-four hours since his election, and the world, especially the Middle-East, is attempting to make sense of what the new leader will bring to the table.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Tuesday night, when Trump emerged triumphant, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has had a complex relationship with Trump, was one of the first world leaders to congratulate the US President-elect, calling his win "history's greatest comeback." While outgoing President Joe Biden threw his weight behind Netanyahu's war on Gaza, it remains to be seen how Trump approaches it. During his campaign trail, the President-elect never specified his plans for the Middle East.</p>

<p>But Gaza is not the only place Israel is militarily involved in. It's locked in another intense battle with Iran, while also targeting Hezbollah in Lebanon, making it perhaps the biggest issue on Trump's agenda, come January 20th.</p>

<p>Trump's first term had some notable decisions in the Middle East. This included selecting Saudi Arabia for his inaugural foreign trip, strengthening Israel's regional ties with the "Abraham Accords", and applying heavy pressure on Iran.</p>

<h3><strong>Palestine and Gaza</strong></h3>

<p>With the Biden administration failing to secure a ceasefire in Gaza and Israel now embroiled in fresh conflicts with Iran and Hezbollah in Lebanon, Trump has to detail a clear path for where the US stands in all this.</p>

<p>One Israeli official hinted that Netanyahu might aim to wrap up the offensive in Gaza early in Trump's second term, aiming to present the Republican leader with a quick diplomatic win. "Nobody in Israel wanted Harris. Nobody trusted her over here," the official told CNN.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Netanyahu will face a much tougher president than he is used to in the sense that I don't think that Trump would tolerate the wars in the manner that they are happening," said Mustafa Barghouti, leader of the Palestinian National Initiative. Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli diplomat, echoed this, suggesting Trump would want a quick resolution, telling Netanyahu to "wrap it up; I don't need this."</p>

<p>Some fear he may even endorse Israel's potential annexation of parts of the West Bank, a move that may all but end the two-state solution.</p>

<h3><strong>Saudi Arabia</strong></h3>

<p>Saudi Arabia's King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman extended congratulations, with the United Arab Emirates highlighting the "enduring partnership based on shared ambitions for progress." Meanwhile, Iran downplayed the election, with government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani saying, "There is no significant difference" in US policies, regardless of leadership.</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which established close ties with Trump during his first term, are expected to continue aligning with the US, though with greater caution. Gulf states have increasingly diversified their diplomatic and economic alliances, particularly with China, joining BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.</p>

<h3><strong>Iran</strong></h3>

<p>Trump's prior "maximum pressure" campaign on Iran strained Tehran economically and politically. With his second term, experts predict a resurgence of this hardline approach. "The Islamic Republic appears as fragile as the threats against it are formidable," said Ali Vaez of the International Crisis Group, noting that Iran's leadership may struggle to balance mounting challenges under Trump's watch.</p>

<p>Should Netanyahu feel emboldened by Trump's return, there are concerns of possible escalation against Iran's nuclear facilities. It could heighten tensions, as both countries maintain competing regional influence and military capabilities.</p>

<p>"With Iran, there is a chance that Trump reverts to a maximum pressure stance," said Hasan Alhasan of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, noting that Gulf nations may experience increased US pressure to conform to this strategy. Balancing their deepening partnerships with China, especially in technology and infrastructure, might also become a challenge for these oil-rich states as they manage relations with Washington and Beijing under Trump's leadership.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Phoenix, Arizona, Jimmy Archuleta is happy with Donald Trump's victory. The car mechanic is one of a growing number of Americans of Hispanic origin cheering on the Republican's return to power.</p>

<p>"I don't think he's racist. He's just fed up with illegal immigrants," Archuleta told AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the wake of Kamala Harris' historic defeat in Tuesday's election, Democrats face the difficult task of identifying the reasons for their rout.</p>

<p>The erosion of support from the Latino electorate, which amounted to 10 percent of the electorate in 2024, ranks high on the list.</p>

<p>According to an exit poll published by NBC News on Tuesday, 53 percent of voters of Hispanic origin voted for Kamala Harris in this presidential election, compared to 45 percent for Donald Trump.</p>

<p>This breakdown contrasts with 2020, when Joe Biden won 59 percent of their votes and Donald Trump 38 percent, according to the Pew Research Center.</p>

<p>But the decline isn't new.</p>

<p>"I think it's clear this is a progression. We've seen a trend that began in 2016 and was reaffirmed in 2020 and that has taken a step forward in 2024," Roberto Suro, a professor at the University of Southern California, told AFP.</p>

<p><strong>Blue-Collar Conservatives</strong></p>

<p>To explain the shift towards Trump, he cites several factors.</p>

<p>"The idea that Latinos would react negatively to promises of stricter immigration policies has proven false," added the academic, who said some American Latino voters were prepared to vote for harsh, even xenophobic policies.</p>

<p>He believes this is because they draw "a distinction between two kinds of migration," separating those with longer-standing ties to the country from other newer arrivals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We see this in some of the pre-election polls, people saying 'I favor a legalization program for people who have been here for a long time and have children born here and have been working and don't have a criminal record, and who are part of the fabric of society.</p>

<p>"'And I want to return the recently arrived. I want a wall. I want border security. I want to send them back'," he added.</p>

<p>Religion, gender, and socio-economic determinants also play a role in this shift, he added.</p>

<p>"We've definitely seen among Mexican-American men, Evangelicals, who didn't attend college, and are working class, a consistent move toward Trump in election after election," he continued.</p>

<p>According to Edison Research, 54 percent of Latino male voters supported the Republican this year, compared to 36 percent in 2020.</p>

<p><strong>'Improve The Economy'</strong></p>

<p>This "very clear" shift toward Trump is also geographically defined, concentrated "along the border, in areas most directly affected by this new immigration," said Suro.</p>

<p>Interviewed on Wednesday in the streets of Phoenix, a major city in the border state of Arizona, Archuleta explained that inflation was one of the main reasons why he decided to support Trump.</p>

<p>"He's really a business genius, so I'm hoping he'll improve the economy," the Mexican-American told AFP.</p>

<p>"I just hope he'll make the price of groceries and gas more reasonable," he added.</p>

<p>For the 47-year-old, whose mother legally arrived from Mexico in the 1970s, the Republican will primarily target illegal immigrants, having promised to carry out mass deportations.</p>

<p>"I know that if someone sees me on the street, they don't know what my status is here," he said. "But for me, it's different. I'm not worried, I know I'm legal."</p>

<p>Archuleta didn't seem entirely convinced that the new president would follow through with mass deportations, which could threaten some of his undocumented friends.</p>

<p>"If they come here and get caught, it's part of the rules. They've always known the risks," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The UAE's National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) has attributed the recent hailstorms in the region to a low-pressure system originating from the Arabian Sea and extending to Oman. This weather pattern has brought moisture-laden air into the typically arid area, resulting in a significant shift in weather conditions. Consequently, thunderstorms, hail, and rainfall have swept across Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, defying the region's characteristic dryness and causing unprecedented weather events.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia's weather department has issued severe weather warnings for the coming days, cautioning residents to prepare for prolonged adverse conditions. The forecast predicts thunderstorms with heavy rainfall, hail showers and strong winds. These conditions may reduce visibility, disrupt travel, and impact daily life. Officials have urged residents to exercise caution and take necessary precautions due to the unusual weather.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's election victory not only catapults him back to the White House but grants him a reprieve from looming court battles and soaring legal bills.</p>

<p>Special Counsel Jack Smith is already in talks with Justice Department officials about winding down the two federal cases filed against the former president, NBC News and CNN reported Wednesday, just hours after Trump's win.</p>

<p>They said the move was being taken in light of the long-standing Justice Department policy that a sitting US president cannot be indicted or criminally prosecuted.</p>

<p>Trump pledged during the election campaign against Vice President Kamala Harris to fire Smith "within two seconds" of taking office.</p>

<p>A US president does not have the authority to dismiss a special counsel, but Trump could name an attorney general who could do so.</p>

<p>He could also have simply ordered the Justice Department to drop the charges.</p>

<p>Smith, who was appointed by Merrick Garland, President Joe Biden's attorney general, brought two cases against Trump -- for conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election and for mishandling top secret documents after leaving the White House.</p>

<p>The election interference case is ongoing in Washington but no trial date has been set and it has been complicated by the Supreme Court ruling in July that a former president has broad immunity from criminal prosecution.</p>

<p>Trump is accused of conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding -- the session of Congress called to certify the Biden win, which was violently attacked on January 6, 2021, by a mob of his supporters.</p>

<p>The Republican is also accused of seeking to disenfranchise US voters with his false claims that he won the 2020 election.</p>

<p>His documents case was tossed out by a federal judge in Florida, a Trump appointee, on the grounds that Smith was unlawfully appointed.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>State Cases&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Trump also faces two state cases -- in New York and Georgia.</p>

<p>He was convicted in New York in May of 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels on the eve of the 2016 election to stop her from revealing an alleged 2006 sexual encounter.</p>

<p>Trump was scheduled to be sentenced in July, but his lawyers asked that his conviction be tossed in light of the Supreme Court immunity ruling.</p>

<p>Judge Juan Merchan is to rule on the dismissal motion on November 12 and has set sentencing -- should it still be necessary -- for November 26.</p>

<p>Trump, the first former president convicted of a crime, faces up to four years in prison on each count. As a first-time offender, however, he was considered far more likely to receive a fine and probation -- and that was before his White House win.</p>

<p>"It would also be possible to have a deferred sentence if it involved any jail term," said Claire Finkelstein, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>In Georgia, Trump faces racketeering charges over his efforts to subvert the 2020 results in the southern state, but that case will likely be frozen while he is in office under the policy of not prosecuting a sitting president.</p>

<p>The case has also been bogged down in accusations of impropriety by the Fulton County district attorney, Fani Willis, who had an intimate relationship with the man she hired to be a special prosecutor. &nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[2024 US Elections: President Joe Biden extended an invitation to President-elect Donald Trump to discuss the transition of power, after Vice President Kamala Harris pledged to support a peaceful transition.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Joe Biden extended an invitation to President-elect Donald Trump to discuss the transition of power, after Vice President Kamala Harris pledged to support a peaceful transition.</p>

<p>Vice President Kamala Harris delivered an impassioned concession speech last night, confirming that she had congratulated Trump on his victory and assured him of her commitment to an orderly transfer of authority. "We must accept the results of this election," she told supporters. "We owe loyalty not to a president or a party, but to the Constitution."</p>

<p>According to the Washington Post, President-elect Trump has already begun preparing his administration, with advisors reportedly narrowing down candidates for key Cabinet roles. Contenders for Treasury Secretary include billionaire hedge fund investor John Paulson and economic advisor Scott Bessent.</p>

<p>For Secretary of State, Trump's team is considering Senator Marco Rubio and former acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell. Among other notable potential appointments, North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum and primary rival-turned-ally Vivek Ramaswamy are expected to be named to the Cabinet, with Senator Tom Cotton under consideration for Defense Secretary.</p>

<p>The highest priority for Trump's transition team is selecting a Chief of Staff, with his campaign advisor Susie Wiles reportedly in the lead, alongside Brooke Rollins. According to a Washington Post report, Trump's campaign team has vetted thousands of candidates to ensure that only loyalists are selected, as Trump is keen to avoid disloyal figures who could obstruct his agenda.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a statement, Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt assured that personnel decisions would soon be underway, while Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung confirmed the upcoming meeting at the White House, marking the beginning of transition planning.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Several US media reports claim that Robert F Kennedy Jr. may lead an overhaul of health and food safety agencies, a controversial move likely to draw strong reactions given Kennedy's known opposition to vaccines.&nbsp;<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After her husband Donald Trump was elected the President of the US for the second time, Melania Trump on Thursday expressed optimism about the country's future.</p>

<p>Taking to social media platform X, Melania posted Americans have entrusted them (she and her husband) with an important responsibility, reflecting on Donald Trump's win over Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>"The majority of Americans have entrusted us with this important responsibility. We will safeguard the heart of our republic – freedom," the post read.</p>

<p>Stressing on the importance of unity, she said: "I anticipate the citizens of our nation rejoining in commitment to each other and rising above ideology for the sake of individual liberty, economic prosperity, and security."</p>

<p>She concluded, saying, "American energy, skill, and initiative will bring together our best minds to propel our nation forward forevermore."</p>

<p>Donald Trump made a phenomenal comeback beating back a conviction, three indictments, two assassination attempts, two impeachments, and continuous assault by most of the mainstream media to reclaim the White House.</p>

<p>After winning the polls, Donald Trump declared, "We made history."</p>

<p>Donald Trump, who will become the 47th President of the US, won with a clear majority.</p>

<p>At 78, he will be the oldest President to set foot in the White House.</p>

<p>He is also the second President to be elected after being defeated; the last one was Grover Cleveland who won his second term in 1893.</p>

<p>Donald Trump's victory was powered by economic issues, the popular disquiet over the inflation that has sent prices of food soaring by about 25 per cent now compared to when he was defeated in 2020.</p>

<p>The election was a shocking disappointment for Kamala Harris who stepped in to carry the Democratic Party torch three months ago after President Joe Biden dropped out as questions arose over his mental and physical capabilities.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a statement on the phone conversation Modi had with Trump a day ago, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said the prime minister highlighted that the US leader's "spectacular and resounding victory" in the election reflected the "deep trust" of the American people in his leadership and vision.</p>

<p>Modi warmly congratulated him on his "re-election as the president of the United States of America as well as Republican Party's success in the Congressional elections", it said.</p>

<p>"They reaffirmed their commitment to working together to further strengthen bilateral ties across technology, defence, energy, space and several other sectors," the statement said.</p>

<p>The MEA, in its statement, shared some of the broader points of their telephonic conversation.</p>

<p>Both leaders reiterated the importance of the India-US Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership for the "benefit of the people of the two countries as well as for global peace and stability", it said.</p>

In a remarkable political comeback, Trump, 78, won the race to the White House to become the 47th President of the US, trouncing his Democratic rival Kamala Harris. Trump had earlier served as the 45th President of the US, after his first victory in the election in 2016.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Congress leader and former diplomat Mani Shankar Aiyar on Wednesday expressed his disappointment and concern over Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election, calling him a "man of doubtful character."</p>

<p>Speaking to the news agency ANI, Mr Aiyar said, "I feel extremely sorry that a man of such doubtful character as Donald Trump shouldn't have been elected the president of the world's most powerful democracy."</p>

<p>Mr Trump is accused in a case related to falsifying business records in a hush-money case involving adult film actor Stormy Daniels. The case centred on payments made to Ms Daniels just days before the 2016 presidential election.</p>

<p>"The moral dimension was missing. It's very saddening that such a powerful country will be led by such a man who has been convicted as a felon on 34 different counts and who has made an infamous name for himself by consorting with prostitutes and making payments to them to cover up for his sins. I don't think a man of such a character is good for either his country or the world," Mr Aiyar said.</p>

<p>Aiyar has been known for his candid and sometimes provocative opinions, which have sparked debates and discussions in Indian politics.</p>

<p>In the US presidential election, Trump, a Republican candidate, clinched a decisive victory over his Democratic rival Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>He will be sworn in as the 47th President of the United States, which will be his second term in this post.</p>

<p>Earlier, Trump was the President of the United States from 2016 to 2020. He had to face defeat in the election field for his second consecutive term from the then Democratic candidate Joe Biden.</p>

<p>A few months before the US presidential election, Biden withdrew from contesting for a second term, after which the Democratic Party declared Kamala Harris as its candidate.</p>

<p>This will be only the second instance of a president serving two non-consecutive terms in the White House, the first in over 100 years. Grover Cleveland served as a non-consecutive president in 1884 and 1892. Trump had earlier served as US President from 2016 to 2020.</p>

<p>Aiyar also expressed grief over Kamala Harris's defeat. He said that Kamala Harris, who would have won, would have been the first woman and the first politician from India to become president. This would have been a historic and positive step.</p>

<p>"As for Kamala Harris, she was given a very short time. She came up from behind. She was performing extremely well. But it seems that very deep faultlines in American society ultimately coalesced against her, and she lost in this race," said Aiyar.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The prediction dates back to the 2000 episode "Bart to the Future", where "The Simpsons" famously depicted a future in which Lisa Simpson becomes the US president.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With Republican Donald Trump's victory, <em>The Simpsons,</em> renowned for its uncanny ability to predict real-world events, has fumbled with the 2024 US presidential election.</p>

<p>The much-loved animated show's forecast of Democrat <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/the-simpsons-prediction-comes-true-joe-biden-out-kamala-harris-in-6159125" target="_blank">Kamala Harris succeeding Trump</a> as the President didn't play out as expected. Instead, Trump has returned to the White House, defeating Harris and upending the show's long streak of prophetic accuracy.<br />
<br />
The origins of this prediction go back to the 2000 episode “Bart to the Future,” where <em>The Simpsons </em>depicted a future in which Lisa Simpson becomes president, inheriting a chaotic financial situation from her predecessor, Donald Trump.<br />
<br />
In an Oval Office scene, President Lisa remarked, “As you know, we've inherited quite a budget crunch from President Trump.” When Trump became the 45th president of the United States in 2016, fans were astounded at the apparent foresight, seeing a connection between his administration and the episode's fictional budget crisis.<br />
<br />
With US President Joe Biden's endorsement of Harris as the Democratic nominee in 2024, many believed that <em>The Simpsons</em>' prediction might finally come true.</p>

<p>Social media lit up with discussions, memes, and videos speculating that Harris' election could complete the so-called “Trump-to-female-president” prophecy. Yet, with her defeat, the prediction now appears to have missed not once but twice – first in 2020, when Biden succeeded Trump, and again in 2024.<br />
<br />
After Trump won the Presidential election, social media buzzed with reactions from fans who have come to view <em>The Simpsons</em> as a pop culture oracle. Many shared clips from the “Bart to the Future” episode, some were surprised, and some were disappointed that the prediction about Harris did not come true.<br />
<br />
“False prophecy,” a user wrote on X.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump's victory speech after his thumping win in the US election was full of praise for SpaceX CEO and X boss Elon Musk]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's victory speech after his thumping win in the US election was full of praise for SpaceX CEO and X boss Elon Musk. Describing Musk as an "amazing guy" and a "super genius", the 78-year-old Republican leader mentioned SpaceX Starlink, a telecom giant known for its capability to provide Internet connectivity to the remotest corners of Earth using satellite constellation technology. The President-Elect spoke about how Starlink proved to be a lifesaver in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene that hit parts of the US earlier this year.</p>

<p>Back in India, Musk's proximity to Trump and the US President's high praise for the SpaceX founder have sparked a buzz -- is Starlink coming here? Musk has been trying to enter the Indian space for a while now, but regulatory frameworks here have proved to be an obstacle. With the Indian government's recent announcement on how it plans to allocate satellite spectrum and the Trump administration likely to back up Musk, Starlink's entry may be a matter of time.</p>

<p><strong>What's Different About Starlink</strong></p>

<p>Starlink uses thousands of satellites in low earth orbit to provide high-speed internet connectivity. The satellites beam Internet data through radio signals. Ground stations broadcast signals to orbiting satellites and they relay the data back to users. This form of internet service does not require overhead or underground wires stretching for miles. This might not make a huge difference in urban areas where traditional broadband Internet is available and users have several options to choose from. Starlink scores in remote areas where traditional services such as optical fibers are unviable and hence, unavailable. Launched in 2019, Starlink already has over 4 million users worldwide. In a country like India, such a service can prove a game-changer in tackling the digital divide.</p>

<p><strong>Starlink's India Push</strong></p>

<p>Elon Musk has been trying to push Starlink into the Indian market since 2021. SpaceX had even started inviting pre-orders, before the Centre intervened and asked the company to meet regulatory requirements first. "For rendering satellite-based services in India, requisite license(s) from the Department of Telecommunications, Government of India are required. It is hereby informed to the public at large that the said company has not obtained any license/authorization for rendering satellite-based internet services that are being booked on their website," the government said, asking SpaceX to comply with the country's regulatory framework.</p>

<p>However, a recent development has raised hopes. Last month, Communications Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia announced that the spectrum for satellite services would be allocated administratively and the cost would be determined by the telecom regulator. Musk welcomed the announcement and said SpaceX would do its best to "serve the people of India with Starlink".</p>

<p><strong>The Home Players</strong></p>

<p>If the government's new stance makes it easier for global players such as Starlink to provide satellite internet in India, it will set the stage for intense competition with the home players, primarily Mukesh Ambani's Jio and Sunil Bharti Mittal's Airtel.</p>

<p>Jio has stressed that the government must allocate the spectrum through auction to create a level-playing field. Mr Mittal, too, has said that satellite companies with urban ambitions must buy spectrum like telecom companies.</p>

<p>According to reports, Starlink has told regulator TRAI that the Indian telecom companies are pushing for reasonable pricing for their systems and lobbying for inflated rates for others. It argues that the home players have their business model, and not the interests of underserved communities, in mind.</p>

<p>The Indian telecom firms, however, argue that the rural connectivity plank is used by global players to get favourable terms for spectrum and that they will soon push to expand in urban areas, competing directly with the local service providers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Moo Dengs prediction of Donald Trumps victory in the US presidential election proved to be bang on.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Moo Deng, a baby pygmy hippopotamus from Thailand, must be doing splish-splash or simply chilling and relaxing in the water, protecting her delicate skin from the harsh sun. The baby hippo is unaware and unbothered by her latest achievement. No mean feat, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/watch-viral-hippo-moo-deng-predicts-2024-us-election-winner-6946402">Moo Deng's prediction of Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election</a> proved to be bang on.</p>

<p>From Nostradamus' “13 Keys to the White House” system to ChatGPT's “dark horse”, everything failed in front of baby Hippo Moo Deng's cute walk to the humble fruit bowl in the name of former US president Donald Trump.</p>

<p><strong>READ </strong>|&nbsp;<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/magnificent-victory-for-american-people-donald-trump-on-us-election-result-6955510">Donald Trump's "Will Fight For You" Vow After Securing US Presidency</a></p>

<p>On Monday, a day before the US election, Moo Deng was asked to predict the US presidential election result. The internet sensation Moo Deng was called out of water, with food as the bait. The baby hippo was given two watermelons with candidates' names written over them. She walked straight to the fruit basket, made using a watermelon shell, for the Republican leader and relished it to the core.</p>

<p>She ate and left no crumbs.</p>

<p>The video was recorded at the Khao Kheow Open Zoo in Si Racha, Thailand.</p>

<p>On the contrary, Allan Lichtman, Nostradamus of US polls, who has forecasted the winner of every election since 1984 right, was proven wrong. In 1981, he developed the 13 "Keys to the White House" system, identifying that governance, not campaign tactics, decides the US elections. Using the same model, he predicted Kamala Harris' victory.</p>

<p>"Consign them (opinion polls) to the flames," Mr Lichtman had told NDTV before the elections. "Yes, we are going to have Kamala Harris, a new path-breaking president, the first woman president and the first president of mixed African and Asian descent.”</p>

<p>Interestingly, when the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/from-chatgpt-to-gemini-what-ai-tools-predict-on-2024-us-elections-6946809">artificial intelligence (AI) tool ChatGPT was asked to pick a winner</a> between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump, it chose neither and instead suggested that "a dark horse would rise from the shadows to take power".</p>

<p>According to the report, adding a poetic twist to its prediction, the AI said, “But in the final hour, a twist unforeseen, neither may claim the throne of serene. A name unspoken in many a tale will rise to power, beyond the pale. Though Trump and Kamala shall fight with might, another will lead, emerging from the night.”</p>

<p><strong>Moo Deng, The New Political Analyst In Town</strong></p>

<p>Born in July 2024, Moo Deng is a celebrity hippo and an internet sensation, courtesy of her playful antics. The pint-sized creature went viral after her handlers posted videos of her on TikTok and Instagram from her home.</p>

<p>Recently she caught the attention of the netizens with her “<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/thailands-pygmy-hippo-moo-deng-stuns-the-internet-with-iconic-moonwalk-6727104">moonwalk</a>”, reminiscent of American singer-dancer Michael Jackson's iconic dance move.</p>

<p>Named through a public poll, Moo Deng's name translates to “bouncy pork” in Thai. She has become the face of the endangered pygmy hippo. Her popularity led to a 4-fold increase in the zoo's revenue earlier in September.</p>]]></content:encoded>

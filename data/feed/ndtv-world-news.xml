       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States called Monday on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to emphasize Ukraine's territorial integrity as he met in Russia with President Vladimir Putin on the eve of a NATO summit in Washington.</p>

<p>"We would urge India, as we do any country which engages with Russia, to make clear that any resolution to the conflict in Ukraine needs to be one that respects the UN Charter with respect to Ukraine's territorial integrity, Ukraine's sovereignty," State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters.</p>

<p>"India is a strategic partner with whom we engage in a full and frank dialogue, and that includes on our concerns about the relationship with Russia," he said.</p>

<p>Miller said, however, that he was unaware of specific conversations with India about PM Modi's visit to Russia.</p>

<p>The United States has built strong relations with India, seeing it as a powerful partner in the face of the rise of China, with President Joe Biden inviting PM Modi for a state visit a year ago.</p>

<p>India has a longstanding relationship with Moscow dating to the Cold War and has refused to join Western sanctions over the Ukraine war, instead turning to Russia for discounted energy imports.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last month was the hottest June on record, the EU's climate change monitoring service said on Monday, continuing a streak of exceptional temperatures that some scientists said puts 2024 on track to be the world's hottest recorded year.</p>

<p>Every month since June 2023 - 13 months in a row - has ranked as the planet's hottest since records began, compared with the corresponding month in previous years, the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) said in a monthly bulletin.</p>

<p>The latest data suggest 2024 could outrank 2023 as the hottest year since records began after human-caused climate change and the El Nino natural weather phenomenon both pushed temperatures to record highs in the year so far, some scientists said.</p>

<p>"I now estimate that there is an approximately 95% chance that 2024 beats 2023 to be the warmest year since global surface temperature records began in the mid-1800s," said Zeke Hausfather, a research scientist at U.S. non-profit Berkeley Earth.</p>

<p>The changed climate has already unleashed disastrous consequences around the world in 2024.</p>

<p>More than 1,000 people died in fierce heat during the haj pilgrimage last month. Heat deaths were recorded in New Dehli, which endured an unprecedentedly long heatwave, and amongst tourists in Greece.</p>

<p>Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College London's Grantham Institute, said there was a "high chance" 2024 would rank as the hottest year on record.</p>

<p>"El Nino is a naturally occurring phenomenon that will always come and go. We can't stop El Nino, but we can stop burning oil, gas, and coal," she said.</p>

<p>The natural El Nino phenomenon, which warms the surface waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean, tends to raise global average temperatures.</p>

<p>That effect subsided in recent months, with the world now in neutral conditions before cooler La Nina conditions are expected to form later this year.</p>

<p>C3S' dataset goes back to 1940, which the scientists cross-checked with other data to confirm that last month was the hottest June since the 1850-1900 pre-industrial period.</p>

<p>Greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels are the main cause of climate change.</p>

<p>Despite promises to curb global warming, countries have so far failed collectively to reduce these emissions, pushing temperatures steadily higher for decades.</p>

<p>In the 12 months ending in June, the world's average temperature was the highest on record for any such period, at 1.64 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial average, C3S said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tropical Storm Beryl's howling winds and torrential rain killed at least two people, closed oil ports, grounded hundreds of flights and knocked out power to more than 2 million homes and businesses in southeast Texas on Monday.</p>

<p>Beryl, the season's earliest Category 5 hurricane on record, weakened from a hurricane after pounding the coastal Texas town of Matagorda with dangerous storm surges and heavy rain before moving across Houston, the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.</p>

<p>The storm, which was expected to rapidly weaken as it moved inland, swept a destructive path through Jamaica, Grenada, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines last week. It has killed at least 12 people in the Caribbean and Texas.</p>

<p>In Texas, a 53-year-old man and a 74-year-old woman were killed in two incidents by trees that fell on their homes in the Houston area on Monday, according to Harris County officials.</p>

<p>The state's energy industry, the nation's biggest producer of US oil and natural gas, braced for Beryl's impact as the powerful storm slowed refining activity and prompted the evacuation of some production sites.</p>

<p>"Life-threatening storm surge and heavy rainfall is ongoing across portions of Texas. Damaging winds ongoing along the coast, with strong winds moving inland," the NHC said even as Beryl began to lose strength.</p>

<p>Following warnings that it could be a deadly storm for communities in its path, residents had rushed to board up windows and stock up on fuel and other essential supplies.</p>

<p>Before daybreak, strong gusts and torrential rain lashed cities and towns such as Galveston, Sargent, Lake Jackson and Freeport, television footage showed. By late morning, many fallen trees blocked roads in Houston as the worst of the storm passed, with persisting winds and some road flooding, rendering lanes on major freeways impassable. The city barricaded flooded areas.</p>

<p>In video posted on social media by Houston's local ABC station, crews using a life jacket and ladder fire truck rescued a man from a truck on a flooded stretch of freeway.</p>

<p>In a late morning press conference, Houston Mayor John Whitmire urged people to shelter in place. He noted that flood waters exceeded 10 inches (25 cm) across most of the city.</p>

<p>"We're literally getting calls across Houston right now asking for first responders to come rescue individuals in desperate life safety conditions," Whitmire said.</p>

<p>The storm had strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane as it crossed the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico before making landfall. But the NHC said it was now expected to weaken rapidly as it moves across land, as hurricanes typically do, before becoming a tropical depression on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Beryl was expected to barrel over eastern parts of the state through the day before moving into the Lower Mississippi Valley and the Ohio Valley on Tuesday and Wednesday, the NHC said.</p>

<p>"People in the path of Beryl's track should not let their guard down this week," Accuweather said in a statement, warning of possible tornadoes as far away as Ohio and possible flash flooding as far north as Detroit.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden is being regularly updated about the storm while administration officials remain in close contact with state and local counterparts, a White House official said.</p>

<p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the US Coast Guard had prepositioned staff to assist with search and rescue efforts, with FEMA also readied with water, meals and generators to boost local response efforts, according to the Biden administration.</p>

<p>Schools said they would close as the storm approached. Airlines canceled more than 1,300 flights, and officials ordered a smattering of evacuations in beach towns. Small businesses in Houston, including package delivery services and chiropractors, delayed openings or were closed on Monday.</p>

<p>More than 2 million homes and businesses in Texas have lost power, according to local utilities and PowerOutage.us data.</p>

<p>Several counties in southeastern Texas - including Houston, where many US energy companies are headquartered - are under a flash-flood warning as thunderstorms unleashed up to nearly 12 inches (30 cm) of rain in some areas.</p>

<p>Resident Gary Short said he was most concerned about possible flooding, which the NHC warned was expected across parts of Texas into Monday night.</p>

<p>"I'm more worried about the rain than anything," he said as he filled up cans with gasoline at a service station on Sunday. "Other than that, not too concerned. Just getting ready."</p>

<p>Closures of major oil-shipping ports around Corpus Christi, Galveston and Houston ahead of the storm could disrupt crude oil exports, along with shipments of crude to refineries and motor fuel from the plants.</p>

<p>Some oil producers, including Shell and Chevron, evacuated personnel from their Gulf of Mexico offshore production platforms ahead of the storm.</p>

<p>Marathon Petroleum Corp's refinery in Texas City, Texas was hit by a power interruption on Monday amid the storm, the company said in a statement.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Taiwanese semiconductor titan TSMC briefly joined a rarefied club of companies valued at more than $1 trillion on Monday.</p>

<p>Here are five things to know about the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company:</p>

<p><strong>'Godfather'</strong></p>

<p>MIT and Stanford graduate Morris Chang founded TSMC in 1987 after an extensive tech industry career in the United States.</p>

<p>Taiwan's government was trying to set up a semiconductor industry that would compete with the countries, such as Japan, that led the sector at the time.</p>

<p>TSMC has become one of the world's most important companies in the nearly four decades since -- a leader in producing the chips that help run everything from smartphones to advanced robots.</p>

<p>Chang, who was born in mainland China in 1931, retired from TSMC in 2018. He was revered in Taiwan by then and often described as the "godfather" of the island's chip industry.</p>

<p>Taiwan awarded him one of its highest medals of honour in April.</p>

<p><strong>AI boom</strong></p>

<p>Thanks to the revolution in artificial intelligence sparked by the success of ChatGPT, TSMC has been riding a massive wave of demand for the advanced semiconductors needed to train and run AI apps.</p>

<p>It works closely with AI leader Nvidia, which became the world's most valuable traded company in June with a market capitalisation of around $3.3 trillion.</p>

<p>TSMC also supplies Nvidia competitors Qualcomm and AMD, among others, and such is the demand for its chips that production has been reportedly booked for years in advance.</p>

<p>Arguably its best-known client is Apple, which relies on TSMC chips for the latest iPhones and MacBooks.</p>

<p>"We have established a research pipeline for technology to enable leading-edge AI devices, circuits, and systems for decades to come," TSMC says on its website.</p>

<p><strong>Fears about China</strong></p>

<p>Taiwan is one of the most important links in the supply chain for semiconductors, the lifeblood of the modern global economy, and TSMC is its crown jewel.</p>

<p>However, China claims the self-ruled island as its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to bring it under its control.</p>

<p>Beijing has ramped up pressure on Taipei in recent years, including with large-scale military drills, sparking worries in capitals and boardrooms around the world about its chip industry.</p>

<p>US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told a Congressional hearing in May that a Chinese invasion of Taiwan and seizure of TSMC would be "absolutely devastating".</p>

<p>"Right now, the United States buys 92 percent of its leading-edge chips from TSMC in Taiwan," she said.</p>

<p><strong>US, Japan expansion</strong></p>

<p>TSMC has faced pressure to diversify away from Taiwan, where the bulk of its factories are based, to guard against any further escalation of the tussle between Washington and Beijing.</p>

<p>It is building two "fabs" -- manufacturing plants -- in the United States and announced plans for a third in April, bringing its total investment in the state of Arizona to $65 billion.</p>

<p>But its US projects have faced obstacles in the past year, which the company attributed to a lack of human resources because making chips requires highly specialised skills.</p>

<p>TSMC also launched an $8.6 billion plant in Japan this year -- a coup for the country as it vies with the United States and Europe to woo top chip firms with huge subsidies.</p>

<p>With "strong" Japanese government support, TSMC has announced a second factory to make more advanced chips. The firm is also planning a new factory in Germany -- its first in Europe.</p>

<p><strong>Quake threat</strong></p>

<p>Geopolitics is not the only worry for TSMC and Taiwan's chip industry.</p>

<p>The island is prone to natural disasters, too.</p>

<p>It sits on the "Ring of Fire", an arc of intense seismic activity along the Pacific Rim, and -- much like neighbouring Japan -- has a long history of catastrophic quakes.</p>

<p>TSMC was one of the firms that halted production because of a 7.4-magnitude earthquake in April this year, the most severe to hit Taiwan in decades.</p>

<p>It told customers the impact from the quake was minimal.</p>

<p>TSMC has invested in a number of seismic resistance features at its facilities to reduce damage and casualties, including an earthquake early warning system, according to its website.<br />

<p>It is an occasion for the two leaders to cherish &amp; celebrate India-Russia friendship, it said.</p>

<p>In his first trip since the start of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, Prime Minister Modi on Monday travelled to Russia to hold summit talks with President Putin on Tuesday -- a visit that is being seen as having a wider geopolitical context and signalling.</p>

<p>Shortly after landing in Moscow, PM Modi said he is looking forward to deepening bilateral partnership in futuristic areas and that stronger ties between India and Russia will "greatly benefit our people".</p>

<p>India seeks to play a "supportive role" for a peaceful and stable region, the prime minister said in his departure statement.</p>

<p>PM Modi was received at the Vnukovo-II airport by Russia's First Deputy Prime Minister Denis Manturov. The Russian first deputy minister also accompanied the Indian prime minister to his hotel from the airport, officials said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Rawalpindi court on Monday rejected Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder and former Prime Minister Imran Khan's plea for a weekly WhatsApp call with his sons, ARY News reported.</p>

<p>Notably, Imran Khan had filed a petition and sought permission to have a conversation with his sons via WhatsApp once a week.</p>

<p>However, the jail administration asserted that there is no legal provision that allow prisoners to communicate with their relatives through WhatsApp. The court had earlier said that Imran be allowed to talk with his children twice a month, who currently reside in the UK with their mother Jemima Khan, according to ARY News.</p>

<p>Earlier, the former Pakistan Prime Minister had submitted an application to Rawalpindi Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) after he was denied a telephonic conversation with his sons from Adiala Jail. In the petition, the PTI founder had argued that he has been denied to speak with his sons despite being allowed to do so by law.</p>

<p>The ATC, presided over by Judge Malik Aijaz Asif, had sought a response from the jail administration, ARY News reported.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, an anti-terrorism court, a day earlier, reserved its decision on Imran Khan's interim bail requests in cases associated with the May 9 incidents in 2023, including the Jinnah House and two other cases, Pakistan-based The Express Tribune reported.</p>

<p>During the hearing on Saturday, Imran lawyer, Barrister Salman Safdar, argued that the PTI founder was being targeted for political reasons.</p>

<p>"In my entire career, I have never seen so many cases against a single individual. Those who were actually inciting against institutions at the scene were not arrested," Safdar alleged."How could a case be filed against him when he was in custody at the time of the crime?" PTI chief's lawyer questioned.</p>

<p>In response, the government's lawyer argued that according to a special branch report, Imran Khan had asked his followers to target civil and military installations if he got arrested.The prosecutor said, "The directive to attack military installations across Pakistan resulted in the events that transpired." After hearing arguments from both sides, the court reserved its verdict on the PTI founder's interim bail requests, The Express Tribune reported.</p>

<p>On May 9 last year, violent clashes broke out across Pakistan after former prime minister Imran Khan was arrested. The protests were held in remote and major cities as the party workers were agitated due to Mr Khan's arrest, with Balochistan, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Islamabad summoning the armed forces to ensure law and order, ARY News reported.</p>

<p>Army installations, including the Corps Commander's house in Lahore, had come under attack during the protests by PTI workers. Notably, the PTI founder was named as the main accused in all the May 9 riots cases.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>France was plunged into political turmoil on Monday three weeks before hosting the Olympics, while a call for strikes at Paris airports added fresh uncertainty to the already tense build up.</p>

<p>The run-up to the world's biggest sporting event is usually fraught for host nations, but French President Emmanuel Macron added unexpected complexity last month by calling snap parliamentary elections.</p>

<p>A second round of voting for the National Assembly on Sunday delivered a hung parliament, making it hard to know who will be in key government positions when the Games open on July 26.</p>

<p>"Our country is facing an unprecedented political situation and is getting ready to host the world in a few weeks," Prime Minister Gabriel Attal stressed on Sunday evening as he offered his resignation.</p>

<p>Macron has asked the ambitious 35-year-old to remain at his post "for the time being to ensure the stability of the country", a statement from the presidency said.</p>

<p>It is unclear whether the head of state will seek to keep a caretaker government in place until the Paris Games close on August 11, but a left-wing alliance that topped Sunday's vote is already pushing to name a candidate to replace Attal.</p>

<p>The fate of Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin, who has overseen security preparations for the Games, is also in the balance.</p>

<p>"What organisers worry about the most are things like delinquency and crime, and of course terrorism, as well as traffic conditions," Paul Dietschy, a history and sports professor at the Universite of Franche-Comte in France, told AFP.</p>

<p>"The interior minister is the most important position."</p>

<p>Darmanin said last week that if the far-right National Rally or hard-left France Unbowed party formed a government, then he would resign immediately.</p>

<p>"The Olympic Games have been very well-prepared. Everyone knows it and everyone welcomes it," he told AFP.</p>

<p><strong>Disruption threat</strong></p>

<p>Elsewhere on Monday, unions representing workers at ADP, which runs the capital's two main airports, said they had called for a strike next week to demand Olympics bonuses for all staff and a "massive" recruitment plan.</p>

<p>Paris's airports will be the main gateway into France for foreign visitors to the Olympics, with up to 350,000 people expected to transit there daily, as well as most athletes and their equipment.</p>

<p>The strike on July 17 will occur just before athletes are set to arrive to take up residence in the newly built Olympic village in northern Paris.</p>

<p>ADP has built new temporary over-sized baggage terminal at Charles de Gaulle airport to handle specialised sports equipment such as kayaks and bikes.</p>

<p>Ahead of the 1998 football World Cup in France, the last time the country hosted such a major sporting event, pilots at national carrier Air France went on strike on the eve of kick-off along with taxi drivers and other transport workers.</p>

<p>Police, air traffic controllers, rubbish collectors, central government employees, metro and train drivers as well as firefighters have all made pay demands ahead of the Olympics, seeking to use the leverage.</p>

<p>Chief Olympics organiser Tony Estanguet has called for a "truce" between unions and employers during the competition.</p>

<p>"I want us to welcome the world in the best possible conditions and we don't want to spoil the party," he told French television in February.</p>

<p><strong>Excitement?</strong></p>

<p>Estanguet and the International Olympic Committee were both blindsided by Macron's election gamble so close to the start of the Paris Games -- as were most government ministers and voters.</p>

<p>The prospect of the far-right taking power was seen by many observers as a risk that would undermine France's image -- and the themes of diversity and openness stressed by Paris 2024.</p>

<p>Estanguet "must be feeling very happy since last night," said David Roizen, an Olympics specialist at the left-leaning Jean-Jaures Foundation think-tank in Paris.</p>

<p>Paris 2024 figures have also sought to stress that senior civil servants with responsiblity for Games-related issues like security and transport will remain in place even if the cabinet changes.</p>

<p>The Games can count on "the continuity of the state", the Paris organising committee told AFP, adding they had worked "night and day in previous weeks to be ready."</p>

<p>In France, the election has entirely overshadowed the build-up to the sporting extravaganza, with the local media paying more attention to the political manoeuvrings than the new sports facilities nearing completion around the capital.</p>

<p>"If Macron hadn't dissolved the parliament, then there would be a bit more passion for the Games," Dietschy said. "You don't really feel excitement building. Most French people have been focused on the election."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe Biden urged Democratic lawmakers Monday to either back his reelection campaign or challenge him at the party convention next month as the US president's reelection bid entered a critical week.</p>

<p>The 81-year-old doubled down on his defiance of calls to step aside, after a disastrous debate against Republican rival Donald Trump last month turbocharged fears that he is too old to serve a second term.</p>

<p>Biden will be under extra scrutiny this week as he hosts a summit of NATO leaders in Washington, with many allies seeking reassurance amid polls forecasting that the isolationist Trump will win in November.</p>

<p>Biden called in to MSNBC's "Morning Joe" television program to say that he was "confident" the "average voter out there still wanted Joe Biden."</p>

<p>Sounding angry in the telephone interview, Biden said he was "getting so frustrated by the elites... in the party."</p>

<p>"Any of these guys that don't think I should run -- run against me. announce for president, challenge me at the convention," he added.</p>

<p>In a blitz of action to start the week, Biden also penned a lengthy letter to Democratic Party lawmakers that saying "I decline" to stand down.</p>

<p>"I am firmly committed to staying in the race," Biden wrote.</p>

<p>"The question of how to move forward has been well-aired for over a week now. And it's time for it to end."</p>

<p><strong>NATO summit</strong></p>

<p>Biden must overcome concerns sparked by the debate, during which repeatedly lost his train of thought, mangled his syntax and spoke with a raspy voice.</p>

<p>He has blamed jetlag and a cold.</p>

<p>But on Sunday four senior congressmen said on a call with party lawmakers that it was time for Biden to bow out, according to US media.</p>

<p>Democrats this week return from a brief recess to Capitol Hill under pressure to either fall in line behind the president or urge him to step aside.</p>

<p>Tuesday, when the NATO summit begins, could prove a turning point: party lawmakers are expected to hold their regular caucus meeting, which could coalesce any bid to force him out.</p>

<p>Biden's performance at the summit marking the 75th anniversary of the NATO alliance will also be closely watched. He is due to attend several meetings and give his first press conference since the debate debacle.</p>

<p>Many European countries are fearful of a return of Trump, as the 78-year-old has long criticized the defense alliance, voiced admiration for Russian strongman Vladimir Putin, and insisted he could bring about a quick end to the war in Ukraine.</p>

<p><strong>Busy schedule</strong></p>

<p>After a barnstorming day of campaign events in swing state Pennsylvania on Sunday, Biden has no public events scheduled for Monday, which he is expected to spend preparing for the summit.</p>

<p>First Lady Jill Biden, a fierce defender of the president, is scheduled to campaign for him instead in Georgia, Florida and North Carolina.</p>

<p>On Friday the president picks up the campaign trail once more, heading for the battleground state of Michigan, before going to his beachside home in Rehoboth, Delaware.</p>

<p>With election day just four months away and the party convention in mid-August, the clock is ticking on any move to replace Biden as the nominee.</p>

<p>Biden and his team appear determined to dig in for the siege, with the campaign unveiling an intense schedule for later in July, including an avalanche of TV spots and trips to key states.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Indian-origin astronaut Sunita Williams is safe and continues helping with research and maintenance of the International Space Station, said American space agency NASA.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian-origin astronaut Sunita Williams is safe and continues helping with research and maintenance of the International Space Station, said American space agency NASA after her return to Earth was delayed, which sparked fears about the safety of the crew that flew on board the Boeing Starliner spacecraft to the space station on June 5. She will discuss the crew's mission in a live address from the space station on July 10 at 8.30 pm.</p>

<p>Ms Williams and her crewmate Butch Wilmore have already spent over a month in the space station on a trip that was originally supposed to be 10 days long due to a series of technical glitches in the Boeing Starliner.</p>

<p>Currently, the ISS is hosting nine crew members who are continuing their planned activities, said NASA. Ms Williams, in the last four weeks on the ISS, has helped disassemble and empty racks for future missions and also assessed air flow in the filters. Her crewmate, Mr Wilmore, joined another NASA astronaut Tracy Dyson on July 2 to load trash and discarded gear inside the Cygnus spacecraft, said NASA. Cygnus, built by Northrop Grumman, is scheduled to be released from the ISS's Unity module later this month for disposal over the South Pacific Ocean, ending its five-and-a-half-month stay at the orbiting lab. On the same day, the crew also checked up on the quiescent Boeing Starliner awaiting its return to Earth.</p>

<p>The crew's work on the ISS, which is like a mini city the size of a football field in space, is of immense significance. The space station, which weighs 419 tonnes and costs over $150 Billion, has been hosting astronauts since 2000. The crew there experiences 16 sunrises daily in its orbit, making the upkeep of the space station a crucial and challenging task.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Riding atop the Boeing Starliner on its first crewed mission, Ms Williams and Mr Wilmore reached the ISS on June 6. She was supposed to return on June 14, however, the return trip was delayed till June 26 due to some technical glitches on the spacecraft. Failing to return on June 26 as well, no new date has been disclosed by NASA.</p>

<p>The space agency and Boeing, while announcing the delay in a statement, said, "NASA and Boeing leadership are adjusting the return to Earth of the Starliner Crew Flight Test spacecraft with agency astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams from the International Space Station. The move off Wednesday, June 26, deconflicts Starliner's undocking and landing from a series of planned International Space Station spacewalks while allowing mission teams time to review propulsion system data."<br />
The delay has been attributed to five helium leaks on the Starliner and technical issues in five of its 28 thrusters. Experts say a minimum of 14 thrusters are required for a safe trip back.</p>

<p>While Ms Williams' trip to the ISS has faced an indefinite extension, NASA says the crew is not pressed for time to leave the station since there are plenty of supplies in orbit, and the station's schedule is relatively open through mid-August.</p>

<p>However, Boeing is facing heat for the unexpected obstruction technical glitches in its spacecraft's maiden {test} mission. According to some experts, the same problems that beset the Boeing Company in its aviation business may be plaguing its space business as well. Recently, Boeing CEO David Calhoun was grilled by US Senators regarding the aviation giant's safety culture and transparency during his first appearance before the US Congress.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former British prime minister Rishi Sunak spent the weekend calling the Conservative Party candidates who lost their seats in the general election last week to apologise for the party's worst performance at the ballot box, with just 121 seats in the House of Commons.</p>

<p>Several former members of Parliament told 'The Daily Telegraph' about the "very sympathetic call" they received from the British Indian MP, who won his own seat of Richmond and Northallerton in Yorkshire and remains the Leader of the Opposition until the Tories elect his successor.</p>

<p>The 44-year-old had apologised to his party colleagues and the nation in his farewell speech at 10 Downing Street on Friday, when he also announced his resignation as Tory leader after the Labour Party won a landslide victory with 411 MPs in a 650-seat Commons.</p>

<p>"He took the time to ring me on a Saturday night and I think he's taken the time to ring other MPs. He was ringing to say that he was incredibly sorry that I'd lost my seat," an unseated Tory MP was quoted as saying.</p>

<p>"To all the Conservative candidates and campaigners who worked tirelessly but without success, I am sorry that we could not deliver what your efforts deserved," Sunak said in his speech last week.</p>

<p>Frontrunners to replace him as party leader are working behind-the-scenes to shore up their support. Former home secretary Suella Braverman, who has been openly critical of Sunak's leadership, is among the contenders but her campaign received an early blow as one of her supporters switched loyalties to her former home office colleague, Robert Jenrick.</p>

<p>Others lining up for the race include two more former home secretaries Priti Patel and James Cleverly and former business secretary Kemi Badenoch. Further former ministers from the Sunak Cabinet, Victoria Atkins and Tom Tugendhat, are also likely to throw their hat in the ring when the contours of the contest are devised by the party's 1922 Committee - which will be electing its new chair after the election.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the new Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, spent his first weekend in office travelling to different parts of the United Kingdom starting with Scotland. He will then embark on his first foreign visit as PM for the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) meeting in Washington to set the tone for his Labour government's relations with US President Joe Biden's administration and other international allies.</p>

<p>On Saturday, he spoke to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the leaders agreed to meet at the "earliest opportunity".</p>

<p>"Discussing the Free Trade Agreement, the prime minister said he stood ready to conclude a deal that worked for both sides. The leaders hoped to meet at the earliest opportunity," a Downing Street spokesperson said about the call.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-story-element="paragraph" data-testid="paragraph-component">The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) on Monday approved 16 species of insects including various species of crickets, mealworms, grasshoppers, locusts and silkworms for human consumption. The announcement has&nbsp;delighted industry players who have been gearing up for this long-awaited moment.</p>

<p>''With immediate effect, SFA will allow the import of insects and insect products belonging to species that have been assessed to be of low regulatory concern. These insects and insect products can be used for human consumption or as animal feed for food-producing animals,'' the agency said in a circular addressed to processed food and animal feed traders.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-story-element="paragraph" data-testid="paragraph-component">According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/sfa-approves-16-insect-species-for-food-companies-gear-up-to-offer-new-dishes-and-products">Straits Times</a></em>, suppliers and caterers in Singapore have been gearing up to source insects from regulated farms in China, Thailand, and Vietnam.</p>

<p data-story-element="paragraph" data-testid="paragraph-component">SFA guidelines mandate that imported or locally farmed insects must adhere to strict food safety controls, ensuring they are not harvested from the wild. Insects that are not on SFA's list of 16 will have to undergo an evaluation to ensure that the species are safe to consume, the agency said.</p>

<p data-story-element="paragraph" data-testid="paragraph-component">Further, companies selling pre-packaged food containing insects will also be required to label their packaging as such. Those that are found to be non-compliant with its food safety regulations will not be allowed for sale.</p>

<h2 data-story-element="paragraph" data-testid="paragraph-component"><strong>Restaurants gearing up</strong></h2>

<p>Meanwhile, several restaurants and cafes are gearing up to prepare new dishes made of insects that they hope will increase their sales and attract customers. House of Seafood restaurant's chief executive Francis Ng said he is cooking up a menu of 30 insect-infused dishes.&nbsp;The insects will be added to some of its seafood dishes, such as salted egg crab, for example.</p>

<p>Mr Ng said that his&nbsp;restaurant had been getting five to six calls daily inquiring about its insect-based dishes, and when customers can start ordering them.</p>

<p>"Many of our customers, especially young people who are under 30 years old, are very daring. They want to be able to see the whole insect in the dish. So I'm giving them many options to choose from," he said.</p>

<p>He anticipates that sales from insect-based dishes will increase his revenue by around 30 per cent.</p>

<p>According to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/insects-food-singapore-grasshopper-cricket-locust-worm-sfa-import-4464861">Channel News Asia</a></em>, crickets, grasshoppers and mealworms, are rich in protein. These insects also contain plenty of antioxidants and minerals including iron, zinc, copper and magnesium. &nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hundreds of people, including from the vibrant Indian community in Russia, lined up on both sides of the road as Prime Minister Narendra Modi travelled from the airport to his hotel in Moscow, on Monday.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi arrived to a ceremonial welcome at the Vnukovo-II International Airport in what is his first visit to the Russian capital since 2015. He was received by Russia's First Deputy Prime Minister Denis Manturov.</p>

<p>Members of the Indian community, waiting to catch a glimpse of PM Modi, were seen gathered in huge numbers as the PM's motorcade drove through the Red Square.</p>

<p>At the hotel, the Indian community gave a rousing reception to PM Modi who last visited Russia for the 20th India-Russia Bilateral Summit held on the sidelines of the 5th Eastern Economic Summit - where he was the guest of honour - at Vladivostok in September 2019.</p>

<p>As people danced and waved the Indian flag, Prime Minister Modi interacted with a few in the gathering while getting inside the building.</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin will be hosting a private dinner for PM Modi later in the evening with the two leaders expected to discuss a range of issues of regional and global importance of mutual interest.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, PM Modi will interact with the Indian community in Russia, lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in the Kremlin and thereafter visit the Rosatom pavilion at an exhibition venue in Moscow.</p>

<p>These engagements will precede a restricted-level talk between PM Modi and President Putin, which will then be followed by delegation-level talks.</p>

<p>"I look forward to reviewing all aspects of bilateral cooperation with my friend President Vladimir Putin and sharing perspectives on various regional and global issues," PM Modi said in his departure statement before leaving New Delhi.</p>

<p>He spotlighted that the Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership between India and Russia has advanced over the past 10 years, including in the areas of energy, security, trade, investment, health, education, culture, tourism and people-to-people exchanges.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amid increasing gun violence in the United States, some grocery stores around the country now have vending machines that are stocked with ammunition. A company has installed automated kiosks in grocery stores, allowing gun owners in three US states to purchase rounds from these devices, as per a report in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/news/2024/07/07/bullets-ammunition-vending-machines-three-american-states/"><em>The Telegraph.</em></a></p>

<p>In certain stores in Texas, Oklahoma, and Alabama, people can now obtain ammunition for their firearms by just scanning their ID on a machine that resembles a drinks vending machine. The machines' manufacturer, American Rounds, claims that operating them is just like using an ATM. "Our automated ammo dispensers are accessible 24/7, ensuring that you can buy ammunition on your own schedule, free from the constraints of store hours and long lines," the company said on its website.</p>

<p>These vending machines, according to the firm, contain "built-in AI technology, card scanning capability, and facial recognition software." According to American Rounds, the software can confirm the buyer's identity and ascertain if the machine matches the identity scanned. Customers use a touchscreen to pick the ammunition they want to purchase, then the machine scans their ID to retrieve it through a hole in the bottom.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.newsweek.com/ammunition-vending-machines-grocery-stores-1921976"><em>Newsweek</em></a>, "there are eight machines installed or in the process of being installed across four states." The first machine was installed at a Pell City, Alabama, Fresh Value grocery shop. Since then, four have been placed at Super C Marts in Oklahoma and one in Canyon Lake, Texas, at Lowe's Market. Another is being placed at LaGrees Food Stores in Buena Vista, Colorado, and another is scheduled to be installed shortly in a Lowes Market in Canyon Lake, said CEO of American Rounds, Grants Magers.</p>

<p>He told the outlet, "We have over 200 store requests for AARM (Automated Ammo Retail Machine) units covering approximately nine states currently and that number is growing daily," he told Newsweek. Mr Magers stated that the company supported "law-abiding, responsible gun ownership."</p>

<p>"Currently ammunition is sold off the shelf or online. These environments lead to inadvertent sales to underaged purchasers and or, in the case of retail stores, a high theft rate. What we loved about this concept is the AARM units use state-of-the-art ID scanners combined with facial recognition before a transaction can be made," he added.</p>

<p>Further, as per Oklahoma TV station KOCO-TV, there is no limitation on the quantity of ammunition customers can purchase and the vending machines would be restocked every two to four weeks.</p>

<p>However, a machine in Alabama was recently removed after its legality was debated.</p>

<p>Tuscaloosa City Council President Kip Tyner said that he initially thought the machines were a joke after he received calls about them. President of the Tuscaloosa City Council Kip Tyner stated that when he first started receiving calls regarding the machines, he assumed they were a prank. "I got some calls about ammunition being sold in grocery stores, vending machines. "I thought it was a lie. I thought it was a joke-but it's not," he said.</p>

<p>Notably, the machines are authorised by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) and are lawful, according to Tuscaloosa Police Chief Brent Blankley.</p>

<p>Discussing the same, Mr Magers told Newsweek: "American Rounds made the business decision to relocate the Fresh Value Automated Ammo Retail Machine located in Tuscaloosa to another store location. This was strictly a business decision based on sales at that specific store."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived here on Monday on a two-day high-profile visit to Russia during which he will hold summit talks with President Vladimir Putin to review all aspects of bilateral ties and explore opportunities to further boost cooperation in sectors like trade, energy and defence.</p>

<p>It is PM Modi's first trip to Russia in nearly five years. His last visit to Russia was in 2019 when he attended an economic conclave in the Far East city of Vladivostok.</p>

<p>During the 22nd India-Russia annual summit on Tuesday, PM Modi and Putin are expected to explore ways to further expand bilateral relations in diverse areas, including trade, energy and defence.</p>

<p>"The special and privileged strategic partnership between India and Russia has advanced over the past 10 years, including in areas of energy, security, trade, investment, health, education, culture, tourism and people-to-people exchanges," PM Modi said in his departure statement.</p>

<p>"I look forward to reviewing all aspects of bilateral cooperation with my friend President Vladimir Putin and sharing perspectives on various regional and global issues," he said.</p>

<p>"We seek to play a supportive role for a peaceful and stable region," he said without making any specific references.</p>

<p>The annual summit between the Prime Minister of India and the President of Russia is the highest institutional dialogue mechanism in the strategic partnership between the two countries.</p>

<p>So far, 21 annual summits have taken place alternatively in India and Russia.</p>

<p>The last summit was held on December 6, 2021, in New Delhi. President Putin had visited India to attend the summit. Putin, as head of the Russian state, has visited India nine times.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi and President Putin last held bilateral talks on the margins of a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) at Samarkand in Uzbekistan on September 16, 2022.</p>

<p>In the meeting, PM Modi had famously pressed Putin to end the conflict in Ukraine saying, "Today's era is not of war".</p>

<p>Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, PM Modi has held several telephonic conversations with Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p>

<p>In reflection of its strong friendship with Russia, India has not yet condemned Moscow's invasion of Ukraine and it has been maintaining that the crisis must be resolved through diplomacy and dialogue.</p>

<p>In Russia, the prime minister will also meet the vibrant Indian community.</p>

<p>From Russia, PM Modi will travel to Austria on Tuesday in the first visit by an Indian prime minister to that country in over 40 years.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[On June 24, she was declared brain dead and her life support was removed.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 25-year-old woman from Queensland, Australia, died on June 24 after suffering severe headaches, as per <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/25yo-queensland-woman-loses-unborn-baby-and-dies-days-later-after-suffering-headaches/news-story/27046332d16bcea93e35caf269b47106"><em>news.com.au</em></a>. She had lost her unborn baby eight days before her death. The woman, Olivia Harlow, visited the hospital several times and was sent home, as per her family.</p>

<p>Olivia's sister-in-law Stefanie Harlow, who set up a fundraising website on behalf of Olivia's partner Ryan Stephenson, revealed that when the 25-year-old was 34 weeks pregnant, she visited Royal Brisbane Hospital due to headaches and blurred eyesight. She was sent home to rest but was hurried back to the hospital two weeks later, on June 16, when she noticed her baby was not moving. Ms Harlow was later informed that her unborn daughter had died. Stefanie said that Olivia spent a few days in the hospital before being discharged, but she returned days later with severe headaches.</p>

<p>"They said she was probably still stressed from what she had gone through and pretty much sent her on her way. The next day Olivia was found by her partner in her room unresponsive so they rushed her to the hospital on life support," Stefanie said.</p>

<p>Olivia, who was a mother of one young girl, had brain tumours, according to her sister-in-law, one of which was "almost the size of two golf balls" and located at the back of her head. On June 24, she was declared brain dead and her life support was removed.Her family is still in the dark about how a healthy and fit woman's life could have altered so radically in just 26 days.</p>

<p>Her sister-in-law wrote on the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/in-memory-of-olivia-harlow-and-adeline-stephenson">GoFundMe </a>page, "Understandably, this has taken its toll on the family and has come as a huge shock. Olivia was the most caring and loving mother, partner, daughter, granddaughter, sister, niece, cousin and friend anyone could ever have asked for."</p>

<p>"I am reaching out on behalf of the family to help raise some funds to give Liv and Adeline the send off they both deserve and to help ease the financial burden off Ryan so he is able to take his time to grieve and be there for Evaliah while they come to terms with the sudden change of their lives."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two pistols that Napoleon Bonaparte once intended to use to kill himself were sold in France on Sunday for 1.69 million euros ($1.8 million), the auction house said, with the government insisting that they stay in the country as national treasures.</p>

<p>The identity of the buyer at the auction in Fontainebleau south of Paris of the finely adorned objects was not made public but the final sale price, with fees, was above the estimates of 1.2-1.5 million euros.</p>

<p>Ahead of the sale of the weapons, the national treasures commission of the French culture ministry had classified the objects as national treasures and placed a ban on their export, in a decision published in the government's official journal on Saturday.</p>

<p>The issuing of the export ban certificate opens a 30-month period during which the French government can make a purchase offer to the unidentified new owner, who has the right to refuse.</p>

<p>Whatever its value and age, a cultural property qualified as a national treasure can leave France only temporarily, with a mandatory return.</p>

<p>"Being classified as a national treasure gives an incredible value to the object," said a representative of the Osenat auction house, asking not to be named.</p>

<p>The richly decorated guns inlaid with gold and silver feature the engraved image of Napoleon in full imperial pomp.</p>

<p>They are said to have almost been used to end the French ruler's life in 1814, when he was forced to give up power after foreign forces defeated his army and occupied Paris.</p>

<p>"After the defeat of the French campaign, he was totally depressed and wanted to commit suicide with these weapons but his grand squire removed the powder," auction house expert Jean-Pierre Osenat told AFP ahead of the sale.</p>

<p>Napoleon instead took poison but vomited and survived, and later gave the pistols to his squire to thank him for his loyalty, Osenat added.</p>

<p>Memorabilia of the emperor is extremely sought after among collectors.</p>

<p>One of his famous "bicorne" black cocked hats with its blue, white and red trimmings sold for 1.9 million euros in November.</p>

<p>Upon his abdication, Napoleon went into exile on the island of Elba off the coast of Italy.</p>

<p>He would soon make a dramatic return to France, only to have his career definitively ended when he was defeated by the British at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, dying in exile on the island of St Helena six years later.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday embarked on a two-day visit to Russia, for the 22nd India-Russia Annual Summit. During the trip, PM Modi and his Russian counterpart are likely to discuss and assess multifaceted relations between the two nations and also exchange views on issues of regional and global concern.</p>

<p>Among the slew of programmes, Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to host a dinner for PM Modi while the latter is slated to address the Indian community during the two-day visit.</p>

<p>PM Modi-Vladimir Putin meeting will see the world media including the Chinese, zeroing in on the high-profile meeting that is bound to have a wide geo-political impact in the region.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, an old photo of PM Modi and President Putin has surfaced on social media. The viral photo is from the meeting that happened when Narendra Modi was Gujarat CM and accompanied the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to Moscow for the India-Russia Summit in 2021.</p>

<p>Modi Archive, the popular X account sharing the photograph of the two leaders, said that the longstanding relationship between India and Russia has deep historical roots, which got strengthened over a period of time and also mentioned a specific incident on how the then Gujarat CM Narendra Modi's initiative led to solidification of ties.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The longstanding relationship between India and Russia has deep historical roots, significantly strengthened by Prime Minister <a href="https://twitter.com/narendramodi?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@narendramodi</a> during his tenure as Chief Minister of Gujarat.<br />
<br />

— Modi Archive (@modiarchive) <a href="https://twitter.com/modiarchive/status/1810204557084877113?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 8, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>"During this (2001) visit, CM Modi signed a protocol pact for cooperation between his state Gujarat and the Russian province Astrakhan in which both states agreed to work together in the fields of petro and hydrocarbon sectors, trade, science and technology, education, tourism and culture. In the following years, these ties were strengthened through several visits," the Modi Archive said.</p>

<p>It further informs that the Gujarat CM visited Russia's Astrakhan in 2006 again and met with Governor Alexander Zhilkin, and the protocol pact for cooperation was extended for another five years.</p>

<p>In 2009, he was invited to address the 4th International Energy Week and deliver a keynote at the 9th Russian Oil and Gas Week conference.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The then CM Modi stumped the Russian businessmen by giving the presentation in Russian language.</p>

<p>In 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi recalled his vivid memories of his 2001 visit to Russia and remarked that it was his first meeting with President Vladimir Putin.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He had stated that despite coming from a small state and relatively new to the international stage, President Putin treated him with great respect, which opened the doors to a lasting friendship.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-07/gnkqeqeo_governments_625x300_08_July_24.jpg?im=FitAndFill,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Politics around the world is evolving in ways that both leaders and analysts are finding difficult to assess and respond to. Politicians are scrambling to sustain support as new entrants make inroads into constituencies that have lost faith in the established order. It is in this melee of the old and the new that the grammar of today's politics is charting a course of its own. Globally, the political elites have never seemed so out of touch as they seem today, unable to respond to the challenge from their streets.</p>

<p>In just the last few days, US President Joe Biden's credibility saw a free fall, while the UK booted out an accidental, out-of-touch Prime Minister, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/rishi-sunak-lost-big-youtuber-niko-omilana-mocks-him-with-a-giant-l-sign-behind-him-6042279">Rishi Sunak</a>, and ushered in the Labour Raj at a time when the rest of Europe is moving to the right. The French have given a mandate to the Far Right. Nine months after the terror attacks of October 7, Israel is facing a civil war-like situation, with people demanding Prime Minister <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/leaving-with-heavy-heart-israel-war-cabinet-minister-benny-gantz-quits-over-gaza-plan-5855047">Benjamin Netanyahu's</a> resignation even as the nation remains in a state of war on multiple fronts. In Iran, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/masoud-pezeshkian-iran-has-a-new-reformist-president-what-it-would-mean-for-india-6045285">Reformist Masoud Pezeshkian</a> found himself elected as the nation's new president, beating his hardline conservative rival Saeed Jalili by securing around 53.3% of votes, nine percentage points more than Jalili.</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/opinion/ex-uk-pm-rishi-sunak-for-whom-everything-that-could-go-wrong-went-wrong-6040945">Also Read |&nbsp;Rishi Sunak: For Whom Everything That Could Go Wrong, Went Wrong</a></strong></p>

<h2><strong>A Reformist In Iran, 'Changemaker' In UK</strong></h2>

<p>Different nations, different challenges, different political arcs, but all facing a moment of political reckoning. Ironically, it is Iran where the recent change of leadership holds the most promise. This is not the first time a reformist has come to power in Iran in a system that has been dominated by the "supreme leader" Ayatollah Ali Khamenei since 1989. The conservatives have controlled all the levers of power and have managed to scuttle earlier reformists like Mohammad Khatami and Hassan Rouhani. However, there has been a growing disillusionment with the ruling elites. By criticising Iran's morality police and promising "unity and cohesion" &nbsp;as well as an end to Iran's "isolation" from the world, Pezeshkian talked in a language that appealed to those who want normalcy in a nation that has been on the edge of a precipice for years now.</p>

<p>Rishi Sunak, on the other hand, was not only bogged down by the legacy of his predecessors who had made a mockery of public mandates, but he was also unable to soothe the British public struggling with rising costs of living and a crumbling public services infrastructure. The Conservative Party imploded, and Sunak's leadership never managed to rise to match the needs of today's Britain. And so, the Labour Party ended up getting a landslide even without increasing its vote share, thereby taking the United Kingdom in a direction opposite to the rest of Europe, where the Right is ascending.</p>

<h2><strong>Close Shave For Macron</strong></h2>

<p>In France, President Emmanuel Macron had to call a snap election fearing the resurgence of the nation's far-right party, the National Rally (RN). Only a last-minute, left-wing tactical adjustment could prevent an outright landslide for the RN. But this should be seen as just a consolation prize, as the RN has greatly increased its representation in Parliament.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/france-legislative-elections-disaster-averted-emmanuel-macron-still-faces-big-challenge-ahead-6056303">Also Read |&nbsp;Disaster Averted, But Macron Still Faces Big Challenge Ahead</a></strong></p>

<p>Separately, last month, the European Union elections saw a resurgence of the right in ways few had anticipated, and the triumph of Eurosceptic parties will have serious long-term consequences for the ability of the 27-member bloc to work cohesively.</p>

<h2><strong>Concerns About Biden</strong></h2>

<p>The world's eyes, however, are now on the leadership contest in the US, where two old white men are busy damaging the brand of American democracy. Donald Trump, under whose presidency the foundations of the American democratic institutional fabric came close to collapsing, continues to be ahead in the presidential race, as the base of the Republican Party continues to move to the right. Trump's supporters still view him as an anti-establishment candidate and despite facing a number of charges in the courts, he is hailed as a victim. His greatest advantage is that he has his primary opponent in President Joe Biden, who, after a disastrous debate performance, is having a difficult time convincing his own party about his candidacy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Old templates no longer apply to the new political climate, where fast-evolving aspirations demand a change in the status quo. Back home in India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's third consecutive victory and Indian democracy's continuing resilience underscores the Indian electorate's ability to make nuanced choices even as the world around it undergoes a dramatic shift. Even so, this global churn has a lesson for Indian political leaders and the larger system.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia struck cities across Ukraine on Monday with a missile barrage that killed three dozen people and ripped open a children's hospital in Kyiv, an assault condemned as a ruthless attack on civilians.</p>

<p>Dozens of volunteers including hospital staff and rescue workers dug through debris from the Okhmatdyt paediatric hospital in a desperate search for survivors after the rare day-time bombardment, AFP journalists on the scene saw.</p>

<p>President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia launched dozens of missiles toward five towns and cities, in the south and east of the country, as well as the capital.</p>

<p>Ukrainian officials said 33 people were killed and another 137 wounded in the wave of 38 missiles. Three more were killed by Russian fire in Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine.</p>

<p>The air force said air defence systems had downed 30 projectiles.</p>

<p>Zelensky called for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council over the barrage and urged Ukraine's allies to deliver "a stronger response to the blow that Russia has once again delivered on our population, on our land and on our children."</p>

<p><strong>France denounces 'barbaric' attack</strong></p>

<p>The UN condemned the "unconscionable" Russian strikes while the EU slammed Moscow for "ruthlessly" targeting civilians and the French foreign ministry called the bombardment of a children's hospital "barbaric".</p>

<p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau described the attack as "abhorrent."</p>

<p>Kyiv said the children's hospital had been struck by a Russian cruise missile with components produced in NATO member countries and announced a day of mourning in the capital.</p>

<p>Russia hit back claiming the extensive missile damage in Kyiv was caused by Ukrainian air defence systems.</p>

<p>Moscow said its forces had struck their "intended targets", which it added were only defence industry and military installations.</p>

<p>Medical staff acted quickly to move patients and personnel to the facility's basement after air raid sirens rang out over Kyiv on Monday.</p>

<p>"For some reason, we always thought that Okhmatdyt was protected," said Nina, a 68-year-old hospital employee.</p>

<p>"We were 100 percent sure that they would not hit here," she told AFP, as she described the frantic rush as staff moved children with IV drips to the bunker.</p>

<p>Officials in Kyiv said the attack had also damaged several residential buildings and an office block in Kyiv where AFP reporters saw cars on fire and shredded trees in charred courtyards.</p>

<p><strong>Energy sites 'destroyed, damaged'</strong></p>

<p>DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy company, said three of its electrical substations had been destroyed or damaged in Kyiv. Russian strikes on electricity infrastructure have already halved Ukrainian generation capacity in recent weeks compared to one year ago.</p>

<p>Russian forces have repeatedly targeted the capital with massive barrages since Moscow invaded Ukraine in February 2022, and the last major attack on Kyiv with drones and missiles was last month.</p>

<p>The emergency services said 22 people were killed in Kyiv on Monday, including at both medical facilities hit in the attack and that another 72 had been wounded.</p>

<p><strong>Must respond 'with force'</strong></p>

<p>In Zelensky's hometown of Kryvyi Rig, which has been repeatedly targed by Russian bombardment, the strikes killed at least 10 and wounded over 41, officials there said.</p>

<p>In Dnipro, a city of around one million people in the same region, one person was killed and six more were wounded, the region's governor said, when a high rise residential building and petrol station were hit.</p>

<p>And in the eastern Donetsk region, where Russian forces have taken a string of villages in recent weeks, the regional governor said three people were killed in Pokrovsk -- a town that had a pre-war population of around 60,000 people.</p>

<p>"This shelling targeted civilians, hit infrastructure, and the whole world should see today the consequences of terror, which can only be responded to by force," the head of Ukraine's presidential administration, Andriy Yermak, wrote on social media.</p>

<p>Zelensky and other officials in Kyiv have been urging Ukraine's allies to send more air defence systems, including Patriots, to the war-battered country to help fend off deadly Russian aerial bombardment.</p>

<p>"Russia cannot claim ignorance of where its missiles are flying and must be held fully accountable for all its crimes," Zelensky said in another post on social media.<br />

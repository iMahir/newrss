       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world's biggest rainforest, the Amazon, has lost an area about the size of Germany and France combined to deforestation in four decades, a study showed Monday.</p>

<p>The South American jungle, spanning nine countries, is seen as crucial to the fight against climate change due to its ability to absorb planet-warming carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Deforestation, mainly for mining and agricultural purposes, has led to the loss of 12.5 percent of the Amazon's plant cover from 1985 to 2023, according to RAISG, a collective of researchers and NGOs.</p>

<p>This amounts to 88 million hectares (880,000 square kilometers, 339,773 square miles) of forest cover lost across Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana.</p>

<p>RAISG experts reported an "accelerated transformation" of the Amazon, with an "alarming increase" in the use of land previously occupied by forest for mining, crops, or livestock.</p>

<p>"A large number of ecosystems have disappeared to give way to immense expanses of pastures, soybean fields or other monocultures, or have been transformed into craters for gold mining," they said.</p>

<p>"With the loss of the forest, we emit more carbon into the atmosphere and this disrupts an entire ecosystem that regulates the climate and the hydrological cycle, clearly affecting temperatures," Sandra Rio Caceres, from the Institute of the Common Good -- a Peruvian association that took part in the study -- told AFP.</p>

<p>She said she believes the loss of vegetation in the Amazon is directly linked to severe drought and wildfires affecting several South American countries.</p>

<p>The World Weather Attribution network of scientists said Sunday that climate change was increasing the risk and severity of fires in the Amazon and Pantanal wetlands which are releasing "massive amounts" of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.</p>

<p>"Never-ending heat has combined with low rainfall to turn these precious ecosystems into highly flammable tinderboxes," said Clair Barnes, a researcher from Imperial College London.</p>

<p>"As long as the world burns fossil fuels, the risk of devastating wildfires will continue to increase in the Amazon and Pantanal," she added.</p>

<p>The drought has placed some Amazon rivers at their lowest level in decades, threatening the lifestyle of some 47 million people who live on their banks.</p>

<p>The dry spell has sent fires -- often lit to clear land for farming -- burning out of control in Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia, and Peru.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[In New Mexico, scientists are exploring a futuristic solution to defend Earth against asteroid threats: harnessing X-ray blasts from nuclear explosions.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Asteroid collisions with Earth are surprisingly common, with NASA estimating 48.5 tonnes of meteoric material entering our atmosphere daily. Most burn up, producing shooting stars. Although devastating asteroid impacts are rare in Earth's history, humanity has learned a crucial lesson from the catastrophic event 66 million years ago. The asteroid responsible for the dinosaurs' extinction was approximately six miles wide, but significantly smaller objects still pose a significant threat.&nbsp;In the face of potentially catastrophic asteroid impacts, scientists are racing to develop innovative solutions to protect our planet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In New Mexico, scientists are exploring a futuristic solution to defend Earth against asteroid threats: harnessing X-ray blasts from nuclear explosions, the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/sep/23/nuclear-blast-could-save-earth-from-large-asteroid">Guardian</a></em> reported. Scientists at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque have&nbsp;successfully demonstrated a revolutionary method to deflect incoming asteroids using nuclear explosions. For the experiment, researchers harnessed the power of X-rays from a nuclear blast to vaporise the surface of a nearby asteroid.</p>

<p>The process works by unleashing an immense pulse of radiation, heating the asteroid's surface to tens of thousands of degrees. This creates a rapidly expanding ball of gas that can nudge the asteroid off its catastrophic course. By precisely calculating the blast's impact, scientists believe this technique can effectively push threatening asteroids away from Earth, potentially saving humanity from doomsday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The primary mechanism involves using X-rays to rapidly heat the target surface, causing it to vaporize and expand into the adjacent vacuum. The expanding gas pushes against the asteroid, transferring momentum (in the opposite direction)," authors of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-024-02633-7">study</a>&nbsp;published Monday in the journal Nature Physics wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Scientists noted that the nuclear option is for larger asteroids, particularly when time is short. Researchers believe this strategy can effectively deflect asteroids up to 2.5 miles wide, although this isn't a rigid limit.</p>

<p>“If there is enough warning time, one can certainly deflect larger asteroids,” &nbsp;Dr Nathan Moore, the first author of the study said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Moore and his team plan to conduct further experimental tests to refine the X-ray deflection technique, building on their initial success. Their goal is to enhance the method's effectiveness through additional laboratory experiments. Ultimately, they envision a space-based demonstration, similar to NASA's DART (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) mission, to test the technique on a real asteroid.&nbsp;</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Prime Minister Narendra Modi today called for reforms in the top global bodies, saying, "The success of humanity lies in our collective strength, not in the battlefield".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi today reiterated his message for world peace and called for reforms in top global institutions from the high platform of the UN General Assembly. "Reform is the key to relevance," he said.&nbsp;Speaking at the "Summit Of The Future" at the United Nations headquarters in New York, PM Modi said, "The success of humanity lies in our collective strength, not in the battlefield and for world peace and development, reform is essential for global organisations".</p>

<p>"For global peace and security, on the one hand there is a big threat like terrorism, on the other hand many new fields of conflict like cyber, maritime, space are also being created. On all these subjects, I would like to emphasize that Global Action must match Global Ambition,' he added.</p>

<p>PM Modi's message for peace comes after the UN General Assembly, which convened yesterday, adopted a "Pact for the Future" -- designed to address 21st Century challenges including climate change, conflict, and human rights.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was adopted despite resistance by a band of seven nations -- led by Russia which is currently engaged in armed conflict with Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Russia criticised the pact contending that the countries not satisfied with the agreement had not been given the opportunity for further negotiations.</p>

<p>"Regrettably, there is nothing good that today the United Nations adopted a Pact for the Future. The United Nations had infringed upon its own principles to pander to a group of delegations from the 'beautiful garden,' who have usurped the talks from the very beginning. And the majority from the 'jungle,' like a herd, could not find courage enough to protest and defend their rights. This is they who will bear responsibility for the consequences," Russia's First Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations Dmitry Polyansky said on his X account as cited by TASS.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[According to court documents, Sasser met David Wallace on Match.com and became obsessed after he revealed his engagement.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Melody Sasser, a 48-year-old Tennessee woman, was sentenced to 100 months in prison for attempting to hire a hitman to kill the wife of a man she met on a dating website. According to <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://people.com/woman-tried-hire-hitman-kill-wife-man-met-match-seem-random-8715907">People,</a></em> Sasser used the dark website "Online Killers Market" to seek a hitman, offering $9,750 in Bitcoin for a "random" or "accident" killing.&nbsp;According to court documents, Sasser met David Wallace on Match.com and became obsessed after he revealed his engagement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Wallace told investigators that their relationship was limited to hiking companionship.&nbsp;Sasser had assisted him on an Appalachian Trail hike and they had also explored trails together in the Knoxville area before he relocated to Alabama&nbsp;and married his now-wife.</p>

<p>However, Sasser's interest evolved into an unhealthy obsession.&nbsp;After learning of his engagement, she showed up at his Alabama home, making disturbing threats and beginning a campaign of harassment against his now-wife.&nbsp;Sasser monitored the couple's activities using a fitness app and harassed the wife with six phone calls in one day.</p>

<p>''It needs to seem random or accident. or plant drugs, do not want a long investigation. She recently moved in with her new husband,” she wrote on the website, including details such as the couple's license plate numbers and the wife's workplace.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sasser also notified the website administrator when he left her home for a mere two-mile walk.</p>

<p>"I have waited for two months and 11 days and the job is not completed. 2 weeks ago you said it has been worked on and would be done in a week. The job is still not done. Does it need to be assigned to someone else? Will it be done? What is the delay? When will it be done," Sasser wrote in a follow-up message to the website's administrator.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the plan was unsuccessful. During the search of her home, law enforcement uncovered incriminating evidence, including a journal detailing multiple hitman websites and a handwritten account of her communications with the notorious "Online Killers Market". Additionally, investigators found a stash of cash hidden beneath a sticky note bearing a Bitcoin address.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a result, a federal grand jury indicted Sasser in June last year for utilising interstate commerce facilities to facilitate murder-for-hire. Sasser ultimately accepted responsibility for her crimes through a plea deal. On Wednesday, she received her sentence: 100 months in prison, accompanied by an order to pay over $5,300 in restitution to the victim.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Sri Lanka has made history by voting leftist Anura Kumara Dissanayake to power.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sri Lanka has made history by voting leftist Anura Kumara Dissanayake to power. The people rejected all the known and tested political leaders and dynasts - Rajapaksa, Wickremesinghe and Premadasa - who, according to them, contributed to the island nation's economic collapse.</p>

<p>The Election Commission declared AKD, as Dissanayake is popularly known, as the winner after the second round of counting. Dissanayake won 5.7 million (42.3%) votes after two rounds of counting in the nation's first-ever second preference vote count - defeating Sajith Premadasa of the SJB (Samagi Jana Balawegaya), who got 4.5 million (32.8%). It was a big defeat for incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who fought as an independent and was a distant third with 17.3% votes. Namal Rajapaksa, the son of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, managed only 2.4% of the total votes.</p>

<p>It is a robust victory for Dissanayake, the leader of the Marxist JVP (Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna) and also the broader front NPP (National Peoples Power), which had won just over 3% of votes in the previous presidential election in 2019. It also reflects the extent of Sri Lankans' distrust of the old regime.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Soon after his win, Dissanayake wrote on X: "This achievement is not the result of any single person's work, but the collective effort of hundreds of thousands of you. Your commitment has brought us this far, and for that, I am deeply grateful. This victory belongs to all of us."</p>

<p><strong>Pragmatic leader</strong></p>

<p>An analysis of Dissanayake's political career reveals that he is a pragmatic leader who knows how to deal with global political realities despite his ideological moorings rooted in Marxism.</p>

<p>Dissanayake's political activism began when he was a university leader in the early 1990s, and it brought him close to the JVP (Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna), a left-wing Marxist-Leninist party mainly consisting of Sinhalese rural youth and known for its armed uprisings in 1971 and 1987-89. It is interesting to note that JVP's origins are linked to a faction within the Communist Party of Sri Lanka (CPSL) in the 1960s, mostly in its pro-China bloc.</p>

<p>However, ground-level electoral politics forced JVP to temper its stand, which had a positive impact on leaders like Dissanayake, who became the party's national organiser in 1997. In 2000, he became an MP. His elevation as JVP chief came after a long wait, in 2014. Dissanayake's flexibility and willingness to learn enabled him to grasp Sri Lanka's economic issues and relate to the rural and working-class citizens, especially through the country's worst economic crises in the late 2010s and early 2020s. His brief stint as Agriculture Minister also helped him connect with Sri Lanka's rural agricultural sector, setting him apart from the political elite.</p>

<p>Incandescent anger against the political elite over an economic mess saw Sri Lankans overthrow the Rajapaksa family in 2022. To voters fed up with steep inflation, food, fuel and medicine shortages and swelling debt, Dissanayake's anti-corruption stance and promise of political reforms appealed to the masses, especially the youth.</p>

<p>The victory will be overwhelming both for Dissanayake and JVP. This is their first time in power, and the lack of experience could be a worry domestically as well as internationally.</p>

<p>India is closely observing the developments in its neighbourhood, just a couple of hours away by speed boat from its southern tip Rameswaram. So is China, which is striving to increase its influence over the island nation.</p>

<p>Sri Lanka has undeniably moved towards China in the past 15 years, handing many lucrative projects to the country. Among other projects, China snagged one to develop an airport in Colombo. Earlier, the strategically important Hambantota Port, situated along the world's busiest shipping lane linking Asia and Europe was given to China, which gave it an upper hand in the region.</p>

<p><strong>India's stakes</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
India has splurged millions of dollars in the form of aid and loans to ensure stability in Sri Lanka, its closest neighbour.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Dissanayake on his victory and said he looks forward to working closely with him to further strengthen the Indo-Lanka multifaceted cooperation.</p>

<p>In his response on Monday (Sept 23), Dissanayake thanked PM Modi for his 'kind' words and support and said he shared his commitment to strengthening ties.</p>

<p>Historically, JVP has been anti-India, especially during the late 1980s, when the party held agitations against Indian imports, including medicines and drugs.</p>

<p>India will also be concerned about the Tamil population in Sri Lanka, as Dissanayake's party has had a complex and antagonistic relationship with Tamil nationalism and LTTE. The JVP opposed the Indo-Sri Lanka Peace Accord in 1987, and did not support the implementation of the 13th amendment of the Sri Lankan Constitution, which delegates powers to the country's Tamil minority.</p>

<p>A majority of Tamils did not vote for Dissanayake, given what they believe is the apathy of his alliance NPP towards Tamils' political demands. Whether Dissanayake, after taking office, will reach out to the country's Tamil minority will be watched.</p>

<p>Experts believe that the rigid stance may not hold up against the strategic geopolitical realities. Dissanayake displayed his eagerness to engage with India as early as February 2024 and met with Foreign Minister S Jaishankar and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval.</p>

<p>Sri Lankans have reposed their faith in Dissanayake as their last hope. They are yet to experience his rule or his policies. His recent speeches do suggest a more nuanced approach, moderating his Left-leaning position. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Dissanayake has a lot on his plate on the domestic front, and fixing the economy will be his priority. He is expected to dissolve parliament and call parliamentary elections soon. Some of his public statements and decisions didn't seem to favour India's interests in the recent past.</p>

<p>India needs to use its diplomatic channels to ensure that Indian investments like the wind power project in the northern part of Sri Lanka are not jeopardised. Given the project's strategic location in northern Sri Lanka, any setback could mean a Chinese company or its proxy taking over, which would be a concern given the significance of the region and the presence of the Tamil minority.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Speaking at the "UN Summit of the Future" on Saturday, Google CEO Sundar Pichai has said that he wants to close the "AI Divide" and pledged 120 million USD for AI training and education around the world, according to a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://blog.google/inside-google/message-ceo/united-nations-keynote-2024/">blog</a> on Google.</p>

<p>Pichai addressed the United Nations General assembly (UNGA) at the very first "UN Summit of the Future," delivering the keynote speech. Pichai announced "Global AI Opportunity Fund" at the event and said that the AI education will be done in local languages, in partnerships with nonprofits and NGOs.</p>

<p>Pichai expressed his confidence in AI being the most transformative technology yet, and shared his personal experience as to how technology changed his life, being born and brought up in Chennai. He mentioned four ways through which AI technology has potential for transformative change: access to information in one's own language, AI driven scientific discoveries, AI's climate-related disaster management systems, and AI's contribution to the world economy.</p>

<p>However, Pichai also cautioned regarding AI's potential for harm as well. He expressed concerns of accuracy, biasness as well as misapplication of AI like in case of deep fakes. Pichai also called for regulations that do not give into protectionist impulses, enabling wider reach of AI technologies for equal opportunity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kelly Andrade, a 25-year-old live-in nanny, has been awarded a $2.78 million payout after discovering she was secretly videotaped by her millionaire boss, Michael Esposito, at his New York home. Ms Andrade, from Colombia, cared for Esposito's four children while living with the family, the <em><u><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/22/us-news/nyc-jury-awards-au-pair-who-was-secretly-filmed-by-creepy-chicken-mogul-employer-2-78m/" rel="nofollow, noindex">New York Post</a></u></em> reported.&nbsp; However, her job abruptly ended when she found a hidden camera in a smoke detector in her bedroom.&nbsp;The twisted episode unfolded in 2021.</p>

<aside>
<p>Ms Andrade's suspicions arose after noticing Esposito frequently adjusting the smoke detector, which was constantly repositioned. Her worst fears were confirmed when she discovered a hidden camera inside, containing a memory card filled with hundreds of recordings – many of which captured intimate moments of her nude or dressing/undressing. Within minutes of her finding the device, Esposito showed up at the house.&nbsp;Fearing for her safety, she escaped through a window when he arrived home and started banging on her door.</p>

<p>''He seemed very nervous and he seemed very worried when he arrived at the house,'' she recalled.</p>

<p>Esposito was arrested on suspicion of illegal surveillance, which carries a maximum four-year prison sentence. However, he was allowed to walk free after agreeing to two years of probation and counselling. A Manhattan jury awarded Ms Andrade $780,000 in emotional distress damages against Esposito and his wife Danielle, plus $2 million in punitive damages against him.</p>
</aside>

<p>Speaking to the <em>Post</em>, the nanny said, ''It's not enough for the whole situation I've been through these three years. It's not enough. I was angry because the damage that he caused me was irreversible.''</p>

<p>After enduring a traumatic experience, she is now devoted to healing and moving forward. The Colombian native, residing in New Jersey with her husband, reflected on the gruelling trial process, stating that it forced her to "relive" painful memories she had sought to forget.&nbsp;By sharing her story, she seeks to ensure that no one else suffers in silence and that perpetrators are held accountable for their actions.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japan lodged a "very serious protest" with Moscow after a Russian patrol plane entered its airspace three times, the defence minister said Monday, calling it the first confirmed incursion since 2019.</p>

<p>The military responded by scrambling fighter jets and issuing radio and flare warnings, Japan's Defense Minister Minoru Kihara told reporters.</p>

<p>"We confirmed today that a Russian Il-38 patrol aircraft has violated our airspace over our territorial waters north of Rebun Island, Hokkaido, on three occasions," he said.</p>

<p>"The airspace violation is extremely regrettable and today we lodged a very serious protest with the Russian government via diplomatic channels and strongly urged them to prevent a recurrence."</p>

<p>Japan has supported the Western position on Ukraine, providing Kyiv with financial and material support and sanctioning Russian individuals and organisations after Moscow's invasion of its neighbour.</p>

<p>Mr Kihara said it was "the first publicly announced airspace incursion by a Russian aircraft since June 2019", when a Tu-95 bomber entered Japanese airspace in southern Okinawa and around the Izu Islands south of Tokyo.</p>

<p>In 2023, an aircraft believed but not confirmed to be Russian entered Japanese airspace, according to the defence ministry.</p>

<p>Top government spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi also said on Monday that "we will refrain from giving any definitive information on the intent and purpose of this action, but the Russian military has been active in the vicinity of our country since the invasion of Ukraine".</p>

<p>Japan also scrambled fighter jets this month when Russian aircraft flew around the archipelago for the first time since 2019.</p>

<p>The Tu-142 planes did not enter Japanese airspace but flew over an area subject to a territorial dispute between Japan and Russia, Tokyo said.</p>

<p>Russian and Chinese warships recently held joint drills in the Sea of Japan, part of a major naval exercise that President Vladimir Putin said was the largest of its kind for three decades.</p>

<p>Japan scrambled fighter jets in August after the first confirmed incursion by a Chinese military aircraft into its airspace, with Tokyo calling it a "serious violation" of its sovereignty.</p>

<p>Then last week, a Chinese aircraft carrier sailed between two Japanese islands near Taiwan for the first time. Japan called that incident "totally unacceptable from the perspective of the security environment of Japan and the region".</p>

<p>China said the passage complied with international law.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Despite his decade-long absence, the government official remarkably escaped termination or penalties, continuing to collect his salary and bonuses without interruption.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A shocking scandal has rocked Thailand, exposing the country's deep-seated corruption issues. According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/article/3279397/thai-official-inactive-10-years-continues-receive-salary-while-working-nightclub" rel="nofollow, noindex">South China Morning Post</a></em>, a government official from the Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Department in Ang Thong province allegedly received a salary and bonuses for 10 years without ever showing up to work. The reason? He was too busy singing at a nightclub to bother with his day job. The official was constantly exhausted from working at night, which led him to skip work during the day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite his decade-long absence, the government official remarkably escaped termination or penalties, continuing to collect his salary and bonuses without interruption. To maintain a facade of accountability, he would periodically receive a summons to the office to receive reprimands or sign documents at the mayor's behest - a strategic move seemingly designed to dodge scrutiny.</p>

<p>The shocking case of misconduct was only revealed thanks to a Facebook page called Watchdog, dedicated to exposing government wrongdoing. The page has garnered 1.1 million followers, highlighting the widespread concern over corruption in Thailand. According to Transparency International's 2023 Corruption Perceptions Index, Thailand scored a dismal 35 out of 100, ranking 108th out of 180 countries. A staggering 88% of Thai respondents view government corruption as a significant problem, with 24% admitting to paying bribes in the past year.</p>

<p>This incident has sparked outrage, with many questioning the government's lack of accountability. Under Thai law, corrupt officials can face one to 10 years in prison and fines ranging from 2,000 to 20,000 baht ($60 to $600).&nbsp;The local government has maintained silence regarding the case,&nbsp;and it remains unclear whether or how the official will be punished.</p>

<p>Notably, this isn't an isolated incident. Another case involves a family in Nakhon Ratchasima province, who endured six years of bullying by their neighbour – a government official and son of a high-ranking police officer. Despite reporting the abuse, the family faced legal threats, and the perpetrator remains uncharged.</p>

<p>Thailand's public sector employs approximately 1.68 million workers, including 421,000 civil servants. Once coveted for their financial security and benefits, these jobs are now losing appeal among young people, who increasingly opt for riskier careers to pursue their passions.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Israeli air strikes on Hezbollah strongholds in Lebanon on Monday killed 182 people, according to the Lebanese health ministry, in by far the deadliest cross-border escalation since war erupted in Gaza on October 7.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli air strikes killed 274 people, including 21 children, in Lebanon on Monday, the Lebanese health minister said, in by far the deadliest cross-border escalation since war erupted in Gaza on October 7.</p>

<p>War began when Palestinian militant group Hamas carried out the worst-ever attack on Israel, with Hezbollah and other Iran-backed groups around the region drawn into the violence.</p>

<p>Israel said it hit about 800 Hezbollah sites in south and east Lebanon during the day and carried out a "targeted strike" later in Beirut. A source close to Hezbollah said the strike on the capital targeted a senior operative from the group.</p>

<p>Lebanese state media reported a new wave of raids in the country's east, while Hezbollah said it targeted five sites in Israel.</p>

<p>The Israeli strikes killed 274 people in Lebanon, including 21 children and 39 women, Health Minister Firass Abiad said, adding about 5,000 people had been wounded since Tuesday.</p>

<p>World powers have implored Israel and Hezbollah to pull back from the brink of all-out war, with the focus of violence shifting sharply in recent days from Israel's southern front with Gaza to its northern border with Lebanon.</p>

<p>"We sleep and wake up to bombardment... that's what our life has become," said Wafaa Ismail, 60, a housewife from the southern Lebanese village of Zawtar.</p>

<p><strong>- More to come -</strong></p>

<p>The Israeli military said it hit "approximately 800 Hezbollah terror targets in southern Lebanon and in the area of Bekaa deep inside Lebanese territory".</p>

<p>Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari warned of further strikes and told people in Lebanon to avoid potential targets linked to Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Abiad said "thousands of families from the targeted areas have been displaced".</p>

<p>Bilal Kachmar, an official in Tyre, said hundreds had fled their homes, while AFP correspondents saw rows of cars leaving the nearby city of Sidon.</p>

<p>The Israeli military also warned people living in the Bekaa valley, in eastern Lebanon, to flee their homes, as it announced it was "broadening" the scope of its strikes.</p>

<p>Explosions around the ancient city of Baalbek in eastern Lebanon triggered flashes of fire and sent smoke billowing into the sky.</p>

<p>Lebanon's official National News Agency (NNA) later reported new "enemy raids targeted the mountain" areas in the Baalbek region and several towns and villages, adding that "the Israeli enemy" launched a strike on the town of Hermel.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said it had fired rockets at military sites near Haifa.</p>

<p>It later said it launched "dozens of rockets" at two Israeli bases "in response to the Israeli enemy's attacks on the south and the Bekaa".</p>

<p>The education minister said schools in targeted areas would close for two days.</p>

<p>The NNA said Lebanese had received phone messages from Israel telling them to "quickly evacuate".</p>

<p>Hezbollah, a powerful political and military force in Lebanon, has exchanged near-daily fire with Israel in support for its Palestinian ally Hamas.</p>

<p><strong>- Israel changing 'security balance' -</strong></p>

<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday that Israel was preempting threats and was acting to change the "security balance" in the north.</p>

<p>Hezbollah's deputy chief, Naim Qassem, said Sunday the group was in a "new phase, namely an open reckoning" with Israel, and ready for "all military possibilities".</p>

<p>They spoke after Hezbollah rocket attacks on northern Israel caused damage in the area of Haifa, a major city on Israel's north coast.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning, hundreds of thousands of people in northern Israel fled to their bomb shelters as Hezbollah fired a barrage of rockets across the border.</p>

<p>The attack came after an Israeli air strike in Hezbollah's southern Beirut stronghold on Friday killed its elite Radwan Force commander, Ibrahim Aqil, along with other commanders and civilians.</p>

<p>Last week on Tuesday and Wednesday, coordinated communications device blasts that Hezbollah blamed on Israel killed 39 people and wounded almost 3,000.</p>

<p>"No country can live like this," said Ofer Levy, 56, a customs officer, who lives on the edge of Haifa.</p>

<p>Since the cross-border exchanges between Israel and Hezbollah began in October, tens of thousands of people on both sides have fled their homes.</p>

<p>An Israeli military official, who cannot be further identified under military rules, on Monday outlined the goals of the military operation.</p>

<p>It seeks to "degrade threats" from Hezbollah, push them back from the border, and then to destroy infrastructure built near the frontier by Hezbollah's Radwan Force, the official said.</p>

<p>Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati urged the United Nation and world powers to deter what he called Israel's "plan that aims to destroy Lebanese villages and towns".</p>

<p><strong>- Another Gaza? -</strong></p>

<p>US President Joe Biden, whose country is Israel's main ally and weapons supplier, said his administration was "going to do everything we can to keep a wider war from breaking out".</p>

<p>Ahead of the annual General Assembly in New York, UN chief Antonio Guterres warned of Lebanon becoming "another Gaza" and said it was "clear that both sides are not interested in a ceasefire" there.</p>

<p>Speaking at the General Assembly, Masoud Pezeshkian, the recently elected president of Iran -- which backs Hezbollah and Hamas -- accused Israel of seeking "to create this wider conflict".</p>

<p>The UNIFIL peacekeeping force in south Lebanon meanwhile warned that "any further escalation of this dangerous situation could have far-reaching and devastating consequences".</p>

<p>Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures that include hostages killed in captivity.</p>

<p>Of the 251 hostages also seized by militants, 97 are still held in Gaza, including 33 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 41,431 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to figures provided by the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. The UN has described the figures as reliable.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The dead-celebrity industry has proved lucrative. Despite Michael Jackson being about $500 million in debt at the time of his death, his estate has amassed a fortune of $2 billion, according to People.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Can you think of a better way to get into the spirit of Halloween than listening to The Legend of Sleepy Hollow read by the ghost of James Dean?</p>

<p>The actor's career may have ended tragically in 1955, but his estate is keeping his paycheck alive through artificial intelligence. Alongside the estates of Judy Garland, Laurence Olivier and Burt Reynolds, it signed with AI voice-cloning startup ElevenLabs in July as part of the company's "iconic voices" project. The actors now narrate books, articles and other text material put into ElevenLabs' Reader app; essentially, Garland can now read you The Wonderful Wizard of Oz or your tax return-the choice is yours.</p>

<p>The dead-celebrity industry has proved lucrative. Despite Michael Jackson being about $500 million in debt at the time of his death, his estate has amassed a fortune of $2 billion, according to People, thanks to projects such as a jukebox musical and even featuring work made while he was alive. Yet advances in AI mean a late artist like Jackson can still generate new art.</p>

<p>Mark Roesler, an intellectual-property lawyer, has represented more than 3,000 celebrities, most of whom are dead, and has made some 30,000 deals on their behalf since founding his company CMG Worldwide Inc. more than four decades ago. Among current clients including Rosa Parks and Malcolm X, he's negotiated Jerry Garcia his own ElevenLabs deal.</p>

<p>There are two key ways a living celebrity makes money, Roesler says. The first is personal services, which, for a musician like Prince, would have been income from his concerts and songs. The second is intellectual property, which is independent of those services and could be anything from the copyright of music to pictures.</p>

<p>When a celebrity dies, their personal services revenue expires immediately, leaving to their estate just the intellectual-property revenue, which, Roesler found, used to decline on average by 10% annually, but now can rise. "I've been assisted by all the technological changes, like AI," he says. "With intellectual property, there are so many different uses of it."</p>

<p>For instance, Travis Cloyd, founder and chief executive officer of Worldwide XR (where Roesler is chairman), has cast Dean in the movie Return to Eden, currently in production. With dead celebrities, there are now two pathways for filmmakers, Cloyd says: "You could either hire an actor, or now, because of the technology, you can create a digital human of James Dean."</p>

<p>The latter process begins with a base of source material, so-called legacy assets that even include family videos. These are put through machine learning to create a digital model of the actor. From there, other elements are created by using body doubles for skin texture and movement, and vocals get layered on top.</p>

<p>It's similar to how Paul Walker (Furious 7) and Peter Cushing (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story) made their controversial CGI appearances almost a decade ago. A large role by Ian Holm, who died in 2020, in this summer's Alien: Romulusinflamed critics and did little to quell the ethical debate around AI, even though his widow, kids and estate signed off.</p>

<p>Hollywood is slowly getting on board after last year's actors' and writers' strikes brought the industry to a standstill over a number of issues, chief among them AI. In August, SAG-Aftra reached a deal allowing brands to replicate living actors' voices in AI audio ads on a job-by-job basis.</p>

<p>For dead ones, Cloyd says, enormous demand will dictate the terms. The potential for AI projects to become the main driver of income for celebrities' estates in the next five years is massive, he says: "With the rise of digital platforms, streaming services and virtual experiences, there are ample opportunities for celebrities to monetize their legacies in new and exciting ways."</p>

<p>Consider ABBA Voyage, which opened in London in May 2022 and has been making more than $2 million a week with concerts featuring de-aged, virtual-reality avatars of the Swedish pop stars. Although the foursome collaborated on the show and were all still alive as of press time, these CGI renderings could theoretically keep minting money for their estates long after their deaths.</p>

<p>Not everyone is convinced. Jeff Jampol, who manages "inactive artists" including Janis Joplin and the Doors, sees AI as a "nonstarter." He's turned down offers to replicate Jim Morrison's voice and casts the technology as a fad akin to nonfungible tokens, or NFTs. "There'll be something else next," he says, noting his decades in the industry seeing "waves come and go." But mostly, "I can't put anything in Jim Morrison's mouth that he didn't say ever. That would be a travesty."</p>

<p>Jampol compares handling the legacy of an artist to having six matches on a fireplace. Each venture they sign on to is like striking a match. "They hold it into the fireplace, and the fireplace glows, and then nine seconds later the match goes out. You're left with an empty, cold, dark fireplace and one burnt match. Just repeat that five times, and it's the end of a legacy for 25 years," he says. "How they lived, what they said and what they created is their legacy. I can't change that."</p>

<p>Svana Gisla, the Emmy- and Grammy-nominated co-producer behind ABBA Voyage, which didn't use AI in cloning the singers, thinks there's one key place the new technology falls short. "We will always be seeking that emotional connection that lies within that communication that art brings," she says, "and AI will never provide that communication or replace artistry in any form."</p>

<p>Perhaps the biggest test of AI will arrive next spring, when Elvis Evolution premieres at ExCeL London and sees the King of Rock 'n' Roll performing for the first time in more than 45 years. For the almost two-hour immersive biopic-think piped-in scents of earthy cotton fields and cranked-up humidity to evoke rural Mississippi-capturing the icon's stage presence in hologram form has been no easy task, says Andrew McGuinness, founder and CEO of Layered Reality, the show's producer.</p>

<p>"It's not a kind of fabrication or the work of a digital artist," he says. "It actually comes from his real-life performances, his real-life facial movements, his real-life voice structure," and it takes hundreds of hours of performance and home videos fed into AI software to create his digital double. Layered Reality had access to the full archive of his home-turned-museum Graceland.</p>

<p>"If you wish to, you can see what he had for lunch on a certain day 45 years ago," says McGuinness. Elvis' favorite dishes might even be available to fans in the bar that keeps the 1960s atmosphere going as they exit the show.</p>

<p>Will the infamous peanut butter, banana and bacon sandwich be on the menu? McGuinness won't say.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A couple, who bought Bochym Manor in Cornwall, England, were devastated to find the former owner gutted the property before leaving.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple's dream of owning a £1.5 million, approximately Rs 16.65 crore, mansion quickly turned into a nightmare when they found the previous owner stripped the property of its most valuable assets. Martin and Sarah Caton bought the home, Bochym Manor, in Cornwall, but were devastated to see it in ruins when they first moved in. They were eager to transform the estate into a wedding venue and holiday destination.</p>

<p>“I was distraught. It was like a warzone or like a tornado had shredded the place. He took pretty much every door handle, tiles off the wall, the locks were removed,” Mr Caton was quoted as saying by the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/09/21/couple-buy-1-500-000-cornwall-mansion-worst-nightmare-comes-true-21588379/">Metro</a>.</p>

<p>The once-majestic property, steeped in history, featured a Jacobean oak staircase and a walnut-panelled library. The 10-bedroom gothic-revival villa had 13 vacation houses on the estate, as well as hidden tunnels and antique stained-glass windows.</p>

<p>It was found stripped of doors, windows, fireplaces, floors and even plumbing and electrics. The stained-glass windows and the library's original panelling — carved by the same artisans who worked on the Houses of Parliament — had also been removed. The Catons further revealed the holiday homes were left gutted, and the estate's clock tower staircase had been torn out.</p>

<p>“There was some very random and bizarre destruction. I don't understand the mentality behind it – it's staggering that you can be that cruel actually,” Mr Caton told Metro.</p>

<p>The couple, who bought the property in 2014, have had to spend an additional £1.5 million to restore the mansion and its surrounding properties. They immediately reported the destruction to the police and Cornwall Council, sparking a nine-year legal battle.</p>

<p>Sellers are prohibited from removing fixtures and fittings without the consent of buyers, especially when dealing with a listed property like Bochym Manor. Despite these regulations, the previous owner, Mark Payne, dismantled and removed several key elements of the historic estate.</p>

<p>According to Metro, in 2015, Payne was arrested on suspicion of theft, criminal damage, and violations of the Planning Act at his new home in Cumbria. Police recovered a few items, but the case stalled when Cornwall Council dropped it, citing concerns over proving Dr Payne had caused the damage. He was released without charge.</p>

<p>The Catons, using historic photographs of the property, provided evidence of what had been taken and presented it to the council again. External legal advice confirmed that there was enough evidence to pursue a case. However, the council declined to prosecute Payne, leaving the Catons baffled and frustrated.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden hosted the Prime Ministers of India, Australia, and Japan for the fourth in-person Quad Leaders' Summit at his hometown, Wilmington, last week. This summit was seen as crucial for multiple reasons. First, it was the last one to be attended by Biden, a key architect of the grouping's institutionalisation, and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who played a pivotal role in adding political heft to the forum. Second, 2024 marks 20 years since the formation of the grouping. Third, and most importantly, the Wilmington summit further consolidated the grouping by expanding key areas of cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. Indeed, this summit has been successful in signalling - 'The Quad is here to stay'.</p>

<p>At a time of highly complex global crises playing out in different parts of the world, the Quad leaders' summit took place in the context of critical challenges and vital opportunities. With enduring wars in Europe and the Middle East, China's belligerent activities in the Indo-Pacific region and emerging non-traditional security challenges in the region, the Quad had its task cut out. The Wilmington Declaration - the joint statement of the Quad leaders - amply addressed these critical questions.</p>

<h2><strong>The Wilmington Statement</strong></h2>

<p>The joint statement issued by the leaders of the Quad grouping in Wilmington exhibits continuity in responding to the war in Ukraine, reiterating the urgent need to put an end to the conflict and uphold the spirit of international law. Similarly, this year's statement expressed concerns over ballistic missile launches conducted by North Korea and the need to prevent the proliferation of nuclear missiles and technologies. Additionally, the Wilmington Declaration focused on the ongoing conflict in Gaza as well.</p>

<p>The group shared its concerns over the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza advocating for a sovereign, viable, and independent state of Palestine while remaining sensitive to the concerns of Israel. Apart from these, the statement further reiterated concerns over the worsening political and humanitarian situation in Myanmar, as well as attacks by the Houthis in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.<br />
However, China remained the big-ticket question for the Quad in the Indo-Pacific context. On the China question, Quad's response this year seems sharper than the previous years. Earlier, at the Quad Foreign Ministers' meet, the grouping called Beijing out - albeit without naming it - for disregarding international law and unilaterally acting in the East and South China Sea region. Similarly, the Quad leaders expressed their concern over increasing militarisation in disputed pockets of the Indo-Pacific. Responding to the tensions in the region, the grouping condemned the use of coastguards and maritime militia vessels, which serve as China's tactics for coercive and intimidating manoeuvres.</p>

<h2><strong>A Slew Of Announcements</strong></h2>

<p>Quad's synergy on issues of maritime safety and security in the Indo-Pacific has also gained vital momentum at this summit. A joint coastguard-level cooperation among the four Quad countries - Quad-at-Sea Ship Observer Mission - proposed at the summit seeks to improve interoperability among the coastguard services of the four countries, advancing cooperation in the domain of maritime safety and security. Similarly, responding to the imminent challenges posed by natural calamities and disasters in the Indo-Pacific, the grouping announced the launch of the 'Quad Indo-Pacific Logistics Network', which is meant to pursue shared airlift capacities in a bid to improve cooperation in the domain of Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) activities.</p>

<p>Additionally, Quad's efforts to bolster Maritime Domain Awareness through the Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness (IPMDA) received a significant push with Australia committing to involve the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency to enhance cooperation, as well as by the grouping proposing a new Maritime Initiative for Training in the Indo-Pacific (MAITRI). This summit further consolidated its regional partnerships through continued cooperation with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA), and the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF). Notably, the Quad Fellowship programme has been expanded to include students from ASEAN countries demonstrating the grouping's inclusion of regional partners in fostering people-to-people ties.</p>

<p>The slew of announcements made at this year's Quad summit, and the resultant Wilmington Declaration, underscore the enduring promise and relevance of the grouping. While Quad continues to respond to critical geopolitical challenges in the world - specifically in the Indo-Pacific - it has also demonstrated a robust positive agenda to harness shared opportunities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Indeed, the Quad is here to stay, in pursuit of a free and open Indo-Pacific - one that is inclusive and resilient.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Testimonies from the first week of a US Coast Guard hearing have cast a damning spotlight on OceanGate and its founder, Stockton Rush, who was also killed during the tragedy.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's been over a year since the Titan submersible, on a deep-sea expedition to explore the wreck of the Titanic, imploded, killing all five individuals onboard. Now, testimonies from the first week of a US Coast Guard hearing have cast a damning spotlight on OceanGate, the Washington-based company behind the submersible, and its founder, Stockton Rush, who was also killed in the tragedy.</p>

<p>The company, which charged wealthy adventurers around $250,000 per dive, is now being scrutinised for prioritising profit over safety.</p>

<p>“What this really comes down to is hubris and greed,” Peter Girguis, a Harvard oceanographer, told <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/22/us/titan-submersible-hearing-takeaways/index.html">CNN</a>. He pointed out the grim parallels between the Titan disaster and the Titanic's sinking over a century ago. “It's both tragic and ironic that this hubris occurred within a few hundred metres of the Titanic, another emblem of human pride,” he said.</p>

<p>According to testimony, one of the last messages sent from the Titan came at 10:14 am local time in Newfoundland: “<a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/all-good-here-haunting-last-message-before-oceangates-titan-submersible-imploded-6585522">All good here</a>.” Just 30 minutes later, at 10:47 am, the submersible reported it had “dropped two weights,” a possible indication of the crew's attempt to abort the mission. Six seconds after that, all contact was lost.</p>

<p>The final message and loss of communication came around 90 minutes into the dive. The Titan's wreckage was later found on the ocean floor, just hundreds of yards from the Titanic's remains.</p>

<p>Chris Roman, an expert in oceanography from the University of Rhode Island, stated how out of place the disaster was in the deep-sea exploration world. "It's not a cavalier, high-risk, daredevil event if done properly," Mr Roman said. "If you cut corners, it will bite you."</p>

<p>One of the hearing's key witnesses, David Lochridge, former director of marine operations at OceanGate, was concerned about the Titan's safety years before the tragedy. Mr Lochridge testified that OceanGate's focus was on "making money" rather than ensuring the vessel's safety, branding the company's operations as "smoke and mirrors."</p>

<p>He described a 2018 report in which he detailed serious safety issues, including concerns about the sub's viewport, which was certified for a depth of only 1,000 metres. OceanGate, however, intended to take the submersible to 4,000 metres - far beyond its certified capacity.</p>

<p>"They wanted to be able to qualify a pilot in a day, someone who had never sat in a submersible," Mr Lochridge testified. He said he was fired after raising these concerns.</p>

<p>Mr Lochridge also recounted a troubling incident during a 2016 dive to the Andrea Doria shipwreck, in which Stockton Rush allegedly panicked while piloting the Cyclops 1 submersible. Mr Lochridge testified that Rush had made multiple errors during the dive and that he had to intervene to bring the sub safely back to the surface. "Just remember I'm the CEO, you're just an employee," Mr Rush reportedly told him during one dive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Renata Rojas, a mission specialist, who was on board during that dive, gave a different account. She testified that no one panicked, and there was no shouting or swearing, as Mr Lochridge had claimed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I did not use any foul language," she said. "Nobody was really nervous. They were excited about what they were going to see."</p>

<p>Ms Rojas also spoke emotionally about the doomed Titan voyage. "They were just very happy to go. That's the memory I have," she said of the five passengers on the submersible's final dive.</p>

<p>OceanGate's approach to submersible design also came to focus during the testimony. Rather than going for an externally certified viewport, Stockton Rush had the window designed in-house and manufactured by a third party, a decision that raised safety concerns among industry experts.</p>

<p>Alfred McLaren, a retired Navy captain and friend of one of the victims, said that OceanGate had consistently avoided safety protocols to expedite missions to the Titanic.</p>

<p>"They did not build a safe vehicle," Mr McLaren testified. "They avoided all this to save money, to get down to Titanic as soon as they can, taking all these chances."</p>

<p>Stockton Rush, who was among those killed in the implosion, wanted to make deep-sea voyages more accessible to wealthy tourists, often at the expense of safety. Peter Girguis criticised this mindset, saying, "There are people willing to put their lives on the line to push the envelope. This is an example of someone who put their life on the line and the lives of four other people, and that part was reckless."</p>

<p>As the hearings continue, the investigation into the causes of the Titan disaster has revealed a pattern of negligence. OceanGate, which has since ceased operations, extended its condolences to the families of the victims and hoped that the ongoing hearings will "shed light on the cause of the tragedy."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian-origin NASA astronaut Sunita Williams is now commander of the International Space Station. She was in space on an eight-day mission that had to be extended to over eight months because the Boeing Starliner spacecraft she travelled in faced technical glitches.</p>

<p>NASA has announced that Russian cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko handed over the command of the space station to Sunita Williams at a ceremony onboard the space station.</p>

<p>Kononenko is completing a year-long mission on the station and is among three astronauts, along with Tracy C Dyson and Nikolai Chub, who are set to return to Earth.</p>

<p>Williams has been working aboard the microgravity laboratory to advance scientific knowledge and demonstrate new technologies for future human and robotic exploration missions.</p>

<p>This is the second time Sunita Williams is taking command of the ISS. She last took charge 12 years back. As commander of the International Space Station, her key responsibility will be to maintain safety onboard the space station.</p>

<p>Speaking at the formal handover event, Sunita Williams said. "This Expedition 71 has taught all of us a lot, the ability to adapt, you adopted Butch and me even though that was not part of the plan, you welcomed us as family."</p>

<p>Oleg Kononenko formally handed over a golden key to Sunita Williams -- a part used in the Soyuz spacecraft's docking port. An elated Sunita Williams was seen swirling and playing with the key in the near zero gravity environment of the ISS. In all, she has spent 431 days in space and is likely to return to Earth on the SpaceX Crew Dragon in February.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Sunita Williams shared her thoughts on the unexpected delay and described the International Space Station as her "happy place". She mentioned how life in space has not been a difficult adjustment due to her previous experience -- this is her third sojourn into space.</p>

<p>The International Space Station is like a mini-city in space that has been flying for 25 years. The ISS weighs 419 tonnes, and costs over $150 billion. It is the size of a football field -- about 109 metres long. Astronauts see 16 sunrises daily in its orbit.</p>

<p>On June 6, after she reached the International Space Station, Sunita Williams hugged the crew members. "A big thanks to family and friends who lived this [moment] for a long time. I think you are glad we are not with you anymore and we have another family up here which is just awesome," she said.</p>

<p>Born to Dr Deepak Pandya and Bonnie Pandya, 59-year-old Sunita Williams is also a Navy-trained pilot. She is also a marathon runner and ran one while on the International Space Station.</p>

<p>A lover of Indian cuisine, Sunita Williams will have fish curry during her space flight, NASA has confirmed. During her earlier flights, she has enjoyed samosas in space.</p>

<p>Before her flight, Sunita Williams had told NDTV that she would carry an idol of Lord Ganesh with her as it was her good luck charm.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Russian RS-28 Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile likely failed during a test earlier this month, according to arms experts and satellite imagery from the launch site.</p>

<p>Maxar satellite images from Sept. 21 show a crater about 60 metres (200 feet) wide at the launch silo at the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in northern Russia and damage around the area that was not visible in imagery from earlier in the month.</p>

<p>It was not clear from the imagery if the liquid-fuelled Sarmat failed during a launch or if there was an accident during defuelling.</p>

<p>"By all indications, it was a failed test. It's a big hole in the ground," said Pavel Podvig, an analyst based in Geneva, who runs the Russian Nuclear Forces project.</p>

<p>"There was a serious incident with the missile and the silo."</p>

<p>Russia's defence ministry did not respond to a request for comment and has made no announcements about planned Sarmat tests in recent days.</p>

<p>The 35-metre RS-28 Sarmat, known as Satan II, has a range of 18,000 km (11,000 miles) and a launch weight of over 208 tonnes and can carry up to 16 multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicle nuclear warheads as well as some Avangard hypersonic glide vehicles, according to Russian media.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China's Xiaomi has asked India's antitrust body to recall its report that found the company and Walmart's Flipkart breached competition laws, arguing it contains commercial secrets, two people familiar with the matter said.</p>

<p>Any recall of the Competition Commission of India (CCI) report could delay its antitrust investigation, which began in 2021. In a rare move in August, the commission recalled an antitrust report on Apple after the company similarly complained commercial secrets were disclosed.</p>

<p>Xiaomi has told the commission in an application the investigation report on Flipkart contains sensitive business data on the smartphone company which was supposed to be redacted when the document was shared with parties in the case, said the two sources familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>One of Xiaomi's concerns with the Flipkart report is that it contains its model-wise sales which is sensitive information, one of the sources said.</p>

<p>Xiaomi, Flipkart and the competition watchdog did not immediately respond to Reuters queries.</p>

<p>The commission does not make investigation reports public and they are only shared with parties to the case. A recall requires parties to return the report which then undergoes further review for redactions.</p>

<p>The watchdog has found that e-commerce giants Amazon and Flipkart gave preference to select sellers and prioritised certain listings, and also colluded with companies like Xiaomi to launch phones exclusively on their websites, Reuters reported this month citing the August reports on Flipkart and Amazon.</p>

<p>Counterpoint Research data shows that South Korea's Samsung and China's Xiaomi are two of India's biggest smartphone players, together holding an almost 36% market share, with China's Vivo on 19%.</p>

<p>Xiaomi is not concerned with data in the report made on Amazon, in which the investigators also said the two companies colluded on online sales in breach of antitrust laws, said both the sources, who declined to be named as the matter is confidential.</p>

<p>It wants the commission to ask parties to return the report and destroy any copies, allowing the watchdog to further redact the sensitive information and reshare the reports, said the first source.</p>

<p>The watchdog took a similar step with its Apple report, which found the U.S. company exploited its dominant position in the market for app stores on its iOS operating system. The company denies wrongdoing.</p>

<p>The commission's Flipkart report said the Indian units of Samsung, Xiaomi, Motorola, Vivo, Lenovo and Realme indulged in the practice of exclusive product launches on Flipkart's shopping website, saying this was "against free and fair competition" and "against the interest of consumers".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The head of South Africa's flagship Black economic empowerment programme plans to introduce additional incentives and potential fines to improve corporate participation and curb exploitation of the system meant to tackle the country's gross inequality, he said.</p>

<p>The African National Congress, which had ruled unchallenged for 30 years until it lost its parliamentary majority in the May elections, is under intense pressure to improve the lives of Black people left disadvantaged by decades of white minority rule.</p>

<p>The empowerment law enacted in 2003 created a scorecard system that encourages companies to hire and promote Black people by offering them tax breaks and access to government contracts.</p>

<p>Two decades later, unemployment is five times higher for Black people than for white people and income inequality is the worst in the world, according to the World Bank, and critics say the empowerment policy has not worked. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>"There's no society that can be viable with (this) level of inequality," Tshediso Matona, head of the Broad-based Black Economic Empowerment Commission told Reuters.</p>

<p>Under the voluntary programme, companies earn points in categories such as Black ownership, management control and skills development.</p>

<p>However, Matona says some companies inflate their scores by falsely listing Black people as managers, a practice commonly known in South Africa as "fronting", a crime under the law.</p>

<p>The commission, which refers cases of infringement to state prosecutors, has received 1,348 complaints of fronting since 2017, said Matona. He added, without saying how many cases had been sent to trial, that no one had yet been convicted of fronting largely because the criminal justice system was "still figuring out how to work with the B-BBEE regulation".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Listed companies are required to disclose their Black empowerment status in annual reports, but fewer and fewer are doing so. In 2022, only 141 of about 400 listed companies submitted a report.</p>

<p>Matona said he hoped to enhance company incentives for compliance while "naming and shaming" and possibly fining those who fail to submit the reports. &nbsp;</p>

<p>President Cyril Ramaphosa has said he wants to focus on showing companies the advantages of Black empowerment, but that if they refuse to comply then penalties would be needed.</p>

<p>"On this one (Black empowerment), we are unequivocal," Ramaphosa told reporters over a week ago, describing racial inequality as an "existential challenge" for South Africa.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It must be done, and it will be done."</p>

<p>Matona would not be drawn on the specifics of the proposals but said incentives could focus on increasing recognition for companies that invest in skills and enterprise development and should not be "too obsessed about ownership in existing businesses".</p>

<p>He said he hoped to have amendments to the law tabled in parliament within 12 months.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Any inclusion of punitive measures could set the ANC on a collision course with its coalition partner, the pro-business Democratic Alliance party, which has said it would resist them.</p>

<p>"Businesses don't exist for altruistic purposes, we must accept that," said DA labour spokesperson Michael Bagraim.</p>

<h3><strong>'BLACKWASHING' AND TRAINING LOOPHOLES&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>A common criticism of the affirmative action system is that it made a small number of political insiders extremely wealthy through shareholding deals, especially in its early years.</p>

<p>Economist Duma Gqubule said his research - based on an analysis of companies' annual reports and shareholding plans - found Black ownership of the 50 biggest firms listed on the Johannesburg bourse was barely 1%, far below the official average figure of about 30%.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This was because legal loopholes allowed firms to count Black shareholders even after they sold their stake, or to use shareholding structures that artificially increase Black ownership, a practice Gqubule described as "Blackwashing".</p>

<p>Matona blamed a lack of oversight of independent agencies which issue Black empowerment scorecards and said the industry needed regulation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His attempt to shift the focus away from ownership to skills development and training also has loopholes, consultants and trainees Reuters spoke to said.</p>

<p>To get skills points companies must pay for training courses for Black people, but they don't have to hire them. Some engage a consultancy to find them disabled people to train, because these earn more points, the head of one such consultancy said.</p>

<p>This often leaves Black job seekers in a cycle of training.</p>

<p>"They keep on promising us that they will hire us but they've never done that," said Nonhle Mnguni, a 22-year-old woman in Soweto who has done such courses in business administration, banking, freight forwarding and call centre work since leaving high school.</p>

<p>Giles Von Broembsen, CEO of property management company Pretor Group, said his company ran training programmes for employees, more than half of whom are Black, but that he could only earn points by sending them on a training course elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The points and the scoring and the system is all very laudable, but it's not practical," he said.</p>

<p>While some political and economic analysts agree with Matona's approach to push for more compliance, others want the law repealed, saying it adds unnecessary bureaucracy which increases business costs and deters foreign investment.</p>

<p>"I think the whole thing should be repealed," said political analyst Moeletsi Mbeki. "(The state) should help entrepreneurs to develop new businesses, irrespective of their race."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hamas's Gaza-based leader Yahya Sinwar has been incommunicado for a long time, making Israel look for evidence of his possible death. Reports by Israel's public broadcaster Kan, news outlets such as Haaretz, Maariv and Walla, and the IDF Military Intelligence Directorate suggested that Sinwar may have been killed in recent Israeli strikes in Gaza. However, there is no concrete evidence to support this claim. Meanwhile, the Shin Bet agency reportedly believes that he is still alive.</p>

<p>According to The Times Of Israel, some reports quoted sources stating that the elusive Hamas chief, who has been hiding in tunnels in Gaza since Hamas's October 7 attack, has a history of going off the radar before reemerging to deliver messages related to the ceasefire negotiations or other issues. Security officials, cited by multiple outlets, noted that any assertion of Sinwar's death was currently speculative and lacked a solid basis.</p>

<p>Haaretz, quoting sources, reported that Israel bombed tunnels in areas where Sinwar was thought to be hiding, but there was no definitive evidence that he was harmed or killed. He may be deliberately maintaining a low profile. The military's response to inquiries was succinct: “We have no information confirming or refuting the matter.”</p>

<p>Since the October 7 attack on Southern Israel -- believed to have been orchestrated by Sinwar -- Israel has targeted key figures within Hamas, including the group's military wing chief, Muhammad Deif, and Khan Younis Brigade chief, Rafa'a Salameh. Hamas chief&nbsp;Ismail Haniyeh and deputy chief Saleh al-Arouri were&nbsp;also killed in drone strikes in Iran and Beirut, respectively,&nbsp;earlier this year. Reports said that&nbsp;Yahya Sinwar and his brother Muhammad remained high-value targets for Israeli forces, yet attempts to locate them have proven unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Reports have also explored the intricate and secretive methods of communication that Sinwar allegedly employs from his hideouts, involving intermediaries and handwritten notes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

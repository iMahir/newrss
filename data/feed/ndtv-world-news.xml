       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a shocking incident, Hawaii Airport in the United States was evacuated after grenades were found in a carry-on luggage of a man, as per a report in CBS News. The Transportation Security Administration said that they found two items resembling grenades were detected during x-ray screening in a bag belonging to a male Japanese national departing the country.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, officers emptied the terminal as the bomb squad investigated the suspicious items discovered during X-ray scanning. The police said, "The Hilo International Airport experienced a brief halt in operations" for a little over an hour.</p>

<p>According to police, the bomb squad "determined the items to be inert grenades," meaning they posed no threat. As per the authorities, Akito Fukushima, of Kanazawa, Japan, was taken into custody on a charge of first-degree terroristic threats.</p>

<p>"Responding to the 5:44 a.m. call, officers secured and evacuated the terminal area as a precautionary safety measure while the department's bomb squad arrived on scene and determined the items to be inert grenades. At 6:45 a.m., police arrested 41-year-old Akito Fukushima of Kanazawa, Japan, for first-degree terroristic threatening. Fukushima was transported to HPD's East Hawaii Detention Facility and remains in custody while Detectives of the Area I Criminal Investigation Section continue the investigation. The airport resumed operations at 6:50 a.m," the Hawaii Police Department in a press release.</p>

<p>The flight he was trying to board was to a destination outside the US, police noted, however, they didn't say which country it was heading to or what his ultimate destination was. "Police remind the public that replicas of explosives, such as hand grenades, are prohibited in checked and carry-on baggage," they said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[She received medical assistance at the airport before being transferred to a local hospital for further treatment.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An elderly woman on a Cathay Pacific flight bound for London was hurt when a piece of luggage fell from an overhead compartment and hit her on the head. According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/society/article/3269682/passenger-hong-kong-london-cathay-flight-injured-after-hand-baggage-falls-and-hits-her-head">South China Morning Post</a></em>, the incident happened on Monday night as the flight was leaving Hong Kong International Airport for London Heathrow Airport.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Police were notified at 11:22 PM on Monday that a 76-year-old passenger had sustained a head injury on the flight.&nbsp;She received medical assistance at the airport before being transferred to North Lantau Hospital for further treatment.</p>

<p>Due to the accident, the flight was delayed for nearly an hour.&nbsp;Originally scheduled to depart at 11:15 p.m. on Monday, the flight finally took off at 12:06 a.m. on Tuesday.</p>

<p>According to a Cathay Pacific spokesman, the woman's injury may have been caused by improperly stored items in the overhead compartment. The airline ensured that the passenger and her family were given hotel accommodations and rebooked flights to Heathrow, the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/cathay-pacific-passenger-hospitalised-cabin-bag-injury-overhead-b2577192.html">Independent</a></em> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Cathay Pacific said: ''The reason for the injury could be down to a misplaced item of luggage in the overhead storage compartment. Our cabin crew and ground staff immediately called for assistance, sent the passenger to a nearby hospital for further medical care, cancelled the flight for the passenger and her family members, and arranged for the family members to stay at an airport hotel.''</p>

<p>''We take the issue of passenger safety very seriously. We are sorry for the incident and sincerely wish the passenger a speedy recovery. Our team will follow up and provide assistance to the passenger's family,'' the spokesperson added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, airlines are usually liable for injuries sustained by passengers, unless they can demonstrate that the injury resulted from the passenger's own negligence. In this case, the woman may be eligible to seek compensation from Cathay Pacific under Article 17 of the Montreal Convention, which holds airlines liable for injuries and deaths sustained by passengers during flights, boarding and disembarkation.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[EvolutionaryScale was launched on 25 June and has since raised 142 million dollars in seed funding.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A New York based AI research company that focuses on biotechnology has generated a novel protein using a Protein Language Model (ProLLMs) that works on the similar transformer architecture as that of ChatGPT.&nbsp;</p>

<p>EvolutionaryScale unveiled a first of its kind AI generated new protein molecule that glows- mimicking the bioluminescence of a jellyfish molecule called green fluorescent protein- on 25 June. The novel protein sequence is significantly different (less than 60 percent resemblance) to the natural protein: a difference dubbed to be possible "over 500 million years of (natural) evolution" by the company.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The company used its frontier AI language model called EvolutionaryScale Model-3 (ESM3) to achieve this feat and secured 142 million dollars in a seed funding round for the same, including investments from industry giants like Nvidia and Amazon.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">We are thrilled to be partnering with AWS and NVIDIA to push the frontier of AI for the life sciences.</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The ESM3 differs from ChatGPT as it is trained on parameters (internal variables) of three fundamental biological properties of proteins - sequence, structure and functions. The model was trained on 98 billion parameters, making it the biggest biological AI model till date.&nbsp;</p>

<p>EvolutionaryScale dubs this as a "model trained across all of evolution." The training set comprised 2.78 billion natural proteins, ranging from "the Amazon rainforest, to the depths of ocean, extreme environments like hydrothermal vents, and microbes in a handful of soil."</p>

<p>ESM3 lets users generate proteins, using prompts with partial information (sequence, structure, and function keywords) and iterating the model to make predictions until the entire sequence is completed. The model is primarily meant for scientists and gives them unprecedented control over the process of generating proteins.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">We have trained ESM3 and we're excited to introduce EvolutionaryScale.<br />

ESM3 is a generative language model for programming biology. In experiments, we found ESM3 can simulate 500M years of evolution to generate new fluorescent proteins.<br />

<p>EvolutionaryScale states their objective is to make biology programmable. "ESM3 takes a step towards the future where AI is a tool to engineer biology from first principles in the same way we engineer structures, machines and microchips, and write computer programs," states the company website.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The application of this technology can lead to breakthroughs in multiple fields like drug discovery and development, biomedical research as well as sustainability- an example of which is already demonstrated by EvolutionaryScale by showcasing a protein prototype that is capable of degrading plastic waste.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The possibilities are endless, with every cell in every organism containing ribosomes (protein complexes that are responsible for protein synthesis). However, there have also been concerns that AI might be misused for creating biological weapons.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Scientists have taken a proactive approach and laid down "Community Values, Guiding Principles, and Commitments for the Responsible Development of AI for Protein Design" in March, seeking to guide the developments in this domain for the betterment of humanity.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">We're advancing a new global agreement signed by 100+ leading scientists to ensure AI technologies for protein design are developed responsibly.

<p>&nbsp;<br />
EvolutionaryScale has also been praised by experts for releasing a smaller open-source version for others to use freely. The large-scale complete model has not been released, although the training process of the same has been made public, in an attempt to remain transparent and share the technology freely.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[An anti-terrorism court in Pakistan on Thursday said the actions of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan were similar to that of a "terrorist" in a case linked to the May 9 violence.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An anti-terrorism court in Pakistan on Thursday said the actions of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan were similar to that of a "terrorist" in a case linked to the May 9 violence. The court ruled that he had delegated the task of attacking military installations, government properties, and police officials to party leaders to exert pressure for his release.</p>

<p>The 71-year-old PTI founder and hundreds of his party colleagues are being tried under multiple cases, including one under the Official Secrets Act in connection with the May 9, 2023, violent protests by his supporters that damaged key military installations across Pakistan. The unprecedented protests erupted across Pakistan on May 9 last year after Mr Khan was arrested in an alleged corruption case.</p>

<p>Mr Khan's party workers allegedly vandalised a dozen military installations, including the Jinnah House (Lahore Corps Commander House), Mianwali Airbase and the ISI building in Faisalabad. The Army headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi too was attacked by the mob for the first time.</p>

<p>Mr Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party termed the anti-terrorism court's ruling an "absurd order" and declared that it would launch a protest.</p>

<p>The anti-terrorism court (ATC) at Lahore had earlier this week dismissed pre-arrest bail to Mr Khan in three cases related to the May 9 riots and allowed police his continued custody for interrogation.</p>

<p>In a detailed order issued here on Thursday, ATC Judge Khalid Arshad said: "An extraordinary concession of pre-arrest bail is meant for an innocent person and not the petitioner, Imran Khan Niazi, who hatched, materialised alleged criminal conspiracy along with the senior PTI leadership and protesters/accused having a common object to wage a war against the state to topple over the government." The order said that Mr Khan not only incited people but also instructed leaders to create chaos, disturb law and order, and commit arson to pressure the military and government for his release. This was disclosed in statements from two prosecution witnesses, The Express Tribune newspaper reported.</p>

<p>"The pre-arrest bail of the petitioner has no merits and is hereby dismissed while withdrawing his already granted interim bail," the judge said.</p>

<p>The judge further observed: A peaceful demonstrator becomes a "terrorist" when he hatches a criminal conspiracy, disseminates it and shares a common object with other accused, who, being armed, attack and attempt to damage state properties like Lahore Corps Commander House known as Jinnah House at Lahore, targeting government machinery ... He loses his normal right to be a law-abiding citizen."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The order, quoting the special public prosecutor, said that a criminal conspiracy was hatched at Mr Khan's Lahore Zaman Park residence on May 7 and 8 in which Mr Khan himself told the top PTI leadership regarding his apprehension of arrest and the reaction of launching protests and damage of military installations.</p>

<p>Reacting to the detailed ACT order, the PTI said, "The judgment contains no evidence of Imran Khan ordering May 9 violence. The judge while dismissing pre-arrest bails of Mr Khan is drawing inferences and assumptions." The PTI pointed out in its statement, how previously the Supreme Court of Pakistan had termed the arrest of Imran Khan, illegal and added: "We will challenge the verdict of the Anti-Terrorism Court." The anti-terrorist courts in other parts of the country, including Rawalpindi, Sargodha etc have dismissed the case accusing Imran Khan of being the main accused of instigating the May 9 violent incidents, based on the fact that there is no evidence provided establishing the prosecution's point," the PTI said.</p>

<p>The party also claimed that since Mr Khan is in prison only in the Iddat case, "which is evidently coming to a conclusion" on the likely dismissal of rubbish claims by the complainant, it seems this is yet another politically motivated case to prolong the illegal incarceration of Mr Khan."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the party's Parliamentary Committee decided that it would raise its voice for Mr Khan and all the innocent prisoners at protests or rallies, starting the movement immediately.</p>

<p>"Parliamentary Leader Ms Zartaj Gul Wazir @zartajgulwazir presided over the discussion regarding the decisions made in the meeting of the Parliamentary Committee," the PTI said in a post on its official X handle.</p>

<p>PTI core committee member Advocate Abuzar Salman Niazi said on X: "Absurd Order. Judge has declared Imran Khan is not innocent. Note: trial is still going on and no conviction is on record in this case. How can Imran Khan be declared guilty before completion of Trial. Where will principle of law (everyone is innocent until proven guilty). (sic)"&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>British police have launched a manhunt after two suitcases which are believed to contain human remains were found at the Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol, south west England.</p>

<p>Police said they had received a report of a man with a suitcase acting suspiciously on the bridge just before midnight on Wednesday but when they arrived he had already gone, leaving the suitcase behind. A second suitcase was also found nearby.</p>

<p>The suitcases are believed to contain human remains, Avon and Somerset Police said in a statement on Thursday.</p>

<p>"This is a very disturbing incident and I fully recognise the concern it will be causing our communities," Acting Bristol Commander Vicks Hayward-Melen said.</p>

<p>"Our immediate priority is to locate the man who took the suitcases to the bridge, identify the bodies, and inform their next of kin."</p>

<p>Police said they were speaking to the driver of a taxi which took the man to the bridge and had seized the vehicle. The bridge, spanning the Avon Gorge and the River Avon, is closed while crime scene investigators examine the area.</p>

<p>One of Bristol's most recognisable landmarks, the suspension bridge was built based on a design by renowned 19th century engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel and opened in 1864. It has protected status in law.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A dramatic&nbsp;video has captured the moment two&nbsp;planes from major commercial airlines appeared to nearly collide mid-air&nbsp;in Syracuse, New York.&nbsp;A dash camera from a North Syracuse Police Department patrol car captured the near in-air collision late morning on Monday, July 8.&nbsp;The close encounter stemmed from an apparent air traffic control error&nbsp;that cleared one plane to depart from Syracuse Hancock International Airport while the other was cleared to land on the same runway,&nbsp;<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/video-jet-abort-landing-same-runway-departing-plane-near-collision-faa-investigating/">CBS News</a></em> reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Controllers initially cleared American Eagle Flight AA5511, a Bombardier CRJ-700 operated by PSA Airlines, to land on runway 28. Moments later, they gave Delta Connection DL5421, another CRJ-700 operated by Endeavor Air, permission to depart from the same runway.</p>

<p>The video shows both planes coming from different directions and appearing&nbsp;dangerously close to each other in the air near Syracuse Hancock Airport. According to the website&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/36.59,-98.17/5" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="https://www.flightradar24.com/36.59,-98.17/5">FlightRadar24</a>, the planes came within 700-1,000 feet of each other vertically. While the Delta flight carried 76 passengers, the American Airlines flight had 75.&nbsp;Luckily, passengers on both planes were unharmed.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A planet relatively close to Earth could be the first ever detected with a potentially life-sustaining liquid ocean outside our Solar System, according to scientists using the James Webb space telescope.</p>

<p>More than 5,000 planets have been discovered outside of the Solar System so far, but only a handful are in what is called the "Goldilocks zone" -- neither too hot or too cold -- that could host liquid water, a key ingredient for life.</p>

<p>The exoplanet LHS 1140 b is one of the few in this habitable zone, and has been thoroughly scrutinised since it was first discovered in 2017.</p>

<p>It sits 48 light years from Earth, which equates to more than 450 trillion kilometres (280 trillion miles) -- relatively close in the vast distances of space.</p>

<p>The exoplanet had been thought to be a small gas giant called a "mini-Neptune" with an atmosphere too thick with hydrogen and helium to support alien life.</p>

<p>However, new observations from the Webb telescope have confirmed that the exoplanet is in fact a rocky "super-Earth".</p>

<p>It is 1.7 times bigger than Earth, but has 5.6 times its mass, according to a study published late Wednesday in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.</p>

<p><strong>'Best bet' for ocean world</strong></p>

<p>The Webb telescope was able to analyse the planet's atmosphere as it passed in front of its star.</p>

<p>There were no signs of hydrogen or helium, which ruled out that the planet was a mini-Neptune.</p>

<p>The density of the planet indicates that it "actually has large quantities of water," study co-author Martin Turbet of France's CNRS scientific research centre told AFP.</p>

<p>It could be a truly immense amount of water.</p>

<p>All the water in Earth's oceans represent only 0.02 percent of its mass. But 10 to 20 percent of the exoplanet's mass was estimated to be water.</p>

<p>Whether or not this water is in liquid or ice form depends on the planet's atmosphere.</p>

<p>"We do not have direct evidence that it has an atmosphere, but several elements point in that direction," Turbet said.</p>

<p>Lead study author Charles Cadieux, a PhD student at the University of Montreal, said that "of all currently known temperate exoplanets, LHS 1140 b could well be our best bet to one day indirectly confirm liquid water on the surface of an alien world".</p>

<p>One positive is that the planet is gently warmed by its red dwarf star, which is one-fifth the size of the Sun.</p>

<p>The exoplanet's surface temperature should be fairly similar to that on Earth and Mars, Turbet said.</p>

<p>The presence of gasses such as carbon dioxide will play a key role in determining whether the planet is covered in ice or water.</p>

<p><strong>Bull's-eye ocean</strong></p>

<p>One possibility is that the surface is mostly ice, but there is a vast liquid ocean where the planet is most exposed to its star's heat.</p>

<p>This ocean could measure about 4,000 kilometres in diameter, around half the surface area of the Atlantic Ocean, modelling suggested.</p>

<p>Or the liquid water could be hidden under a thick shell of ice, like on the moons Ganymede, Enceladus or Europa orbiting around Jupiter and Saturn.</p>

<p>Webb's instrument spotted signs that suggest "the presence of nitrogen," Cadieux said, adding that more research was needed to confirm the finding.</p>

<p>Nitrogen is found everywhere on Earth, and is thought to be another potentially ingredient for life.</p>

<p>The researchers are hoping to get a few more hours of the Webb's telescope's precious time to find out more about LHS 1140 b.</p>

<p>It will take at least a year to confirm whether the exoplanet has an atmosphere, and two or three more to detect the presence of carbon dioxide, the researchers estimated.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Germany said Thursday it will phase out the use of components from Chinese telecom giants Huawei and ZTE in its 5G networks in the coming years due to national security concerns.</p>

<p>Parts from the firms will no longer be used in "core" 5G mobile networks by the end of 2026 at the latest, the interior ministry said.</p>

<p>In 5G access and transmission infrastructure, the systems of the telecom firms must be replaced by the end of 2029.</p>

<p>"We are protecting the central nervous systems of Germany as a business location -- and we are protecting the communication of citizens, companies, and the state," said Interior Minister Nancy Faeser.</p>

<p>"We must reduce security risks and, unlike in the past, avoid one-sided dependencies."</p>

<p>The ministry said that 5G networks form part of Germany's "critical infrastructure" and are important for the functioning of sectors ranging from health to transport and energy.</p>

<p>China and Germany, the world's number two and number three economies respectively, have long had close economic ties.</p>

<p>But Berlin has been seeking to reduce its economic dependency on China, particularly since the war in Ukraine and subsequent energy crisis exposed an over-reliance on Russia.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>India's stance on the Russia-Ukraine war is well-established: it advocates for a cessation of hostilities and prefers dialogue over conflict, a position consistently articulated in international forums. However, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Moscow, his camaraderie with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and the pledge to enhance bilateral trade and defence cooperation signify a strategic shift in stance.</p>

<p>The visit aims to send a strong message to India's Western allies that while navigating complex global issues, India remains committed to safeguarding its national interests. After all, India's Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) saved over $10 billion from April 2022 to May 2024, largely due to Russian crude imports, as per an analysis by the Indian Express. Additionally, it underscores India's enduring friendship with Russia amidst geopolitical dynamics, including a pointed message to China.</p>

<p>PM Modi has demonstrated adeptness in making bold foreign policy moves, exemplified by strong ties fostered with Gulf countries during his tenure. While India values its friendships with the US and other Western nations, it is steering its own course to protect its national interests. This is a trajectory which is set to accelerate in Modi's third term. The agreement to establish Indo-Russian joint ventures for defence production and facilitating military exports to mutually agreed friendly nations exemplifies this forward-looking approach.</p>

<p>Following his Russian trip, Modi's subsequent visit to Austria marks India's Prime Minister's first official trip since 1983, illustrating a pattern of seeking new allies. This trend has been evident since Modi took office a decade ago.</p>

<p>Modi's third term is distinct in its recent foreign policy decisions. From inviting all neighbouring countries except China and Pakistan to his swearing-in ceremony, to strategic engagements at the G-7 summit in Italy, and now visits to Russia and Austria, Modi is making significant statements on the global stage. Foreign policy remains a cornerstone of Modi 3.0's agenda.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A fire broke out Thursday in the spire of the cathedral in northern French city Rouen, its mayor said, sharing a photo of a column of smoke rising from the Gothic landmark.</p>

<p>The fire's "origin is unknown at this point," mayor Nicolas Mayer-Rossignol posted on X, adding that "all public resources are mobilised" to fight the fire.</p>

<p>Local fire service SDIS76 said the alarm was raised around midday (1000 GMT) and that 33 vehicles and 63 firefighters were on the scene.</p>

<p>"Fire broke out at the tip of the spire, which isn't made of wood, but rather metal," the prefecture of the Seine-Maritime department told AFP.</p>

<p>The monument is "currently undergoing restoration work," it added.</p>

<p>It was not immediately clear whether the wood frame of the spire was ablaze.</p>

<p>Fire in the wooden frame of the roof was behind the massive 2019 damage to the world-famous Notre Dame cathedral in Paris, where repairs are only now nearing completion.</p>

<p>The Our Lady of the Assumption cathedral has been evacuated and a security perimeter set up, the prefecture said.</p>

<p>People should "stay away to give space for emergency responders to work," it added.</p>

<p>Construction began on Rouen's cathedral in the 12th Century, according to its website, with work lasting several centuries until it achieved its present form.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Villagers in Vaideeni at the foot of Romania's Carpathian mountains are fuming at French luxury brand Louis Vuitton for "stealing" the design of their traditional blouse.</p>

<p>Maria Gioanca, 69, one of two dozen women who still hand sew the black-and-white garment in the village, told AFP she "won't let the costume be stolen" for fancy beach wear.</p>

<p>Calls for luxury brands to acknowledge the inspirations of their designs have grown in recent years, as the fashion industry has been faced with accusations of cultural appropriation and exploiting the heritage of minority groups.</p>

<p>In Romania, the activist group La Blouse Roumaine (The Romanian Blouse) has been asking brands since 2017 to come clean and "credit" the places of origin when their clothes are similar to or inspired by Romanian folk costumes.</p>

<p>Dedicated to promoting the traditional "ie" blouse -- known to have inspired fashion designers like Yves Saint-Laurent, Jean Paul Gaultier, and Kenzo -- their complaints have yielded mixed results.</p>

<h3><strong>'Violating cultural rights'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>In Vaideeni, many of the seamstresses had not heard of Louis Vuitton, but noticed the similarity to their traditional "ie" blouses right away when they saw a photo of the French brand's white linen blouse embroidered with black motifs for their new "LV by the Pool" collection.</p>

<p>"Why mock our stuff?" said Ioana Staniloiu, 76, scoffing at the blouse created by star designer Nicolas Ghesquiere and advertised on the Louis Vuitton website as "airy" and having "a fresh, bohemian look".</p>

<p>"Next to our blouse, it's ugly," she said.</p>

<p>Accusing the French company of "violating the cultural rights of the communities", La Blouse Roumaine founder Andreea Tanasescu said people felt offended that a blouse traditionally worn on special occasions is used as beach wear.</p>

<p>"You have to be very careful... It's better you go and talk to the community, spend time there," the former casting director, 49, told AFP, adding fashion could help "protect and promote cultural heritage" if there was an exchange.</p>

<p>Romania's culture minister asked the company last month to acknowledge the heritage.</p>

<p>Louis Vuitton declined to comment when contacted by AFP, but confirmed media reports that it apologised to Romania and stopped selling the blouse.</p>

<p>It no longer appears on the brand's website, and 20 as-yet unsold blouses have been put aside, according to reports.</p>

<h3><strong>'Scared' for future&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>In the past, La Blouse Roumaine convinced US designer Tory Burch to change the description of a coat crediting its Romanian inspiration. They didn't get any reply from Dior in a similar case.</p>

<p>Romanian traditional clothes and textiles have "an exceptional, special aesthetic", according to textile specialist Florica Zaharia, pointing at the blouse's "discretion and elegance".</p>

<p>"There is a beauty that we cannot ignore," said Zaharia, who opened the first textiles museum in Romania in 2018 after almost 30 years working at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.</p>

<p>But critics say these controversies don't end up helping communities to save their dying crafts.</p>

<p>It's like "airing dirty laundry in public", Romanian Peasant Museum curator Horatiu Ilea said, adding "the only thing" that could help is for young people to learn the crafts.</p>

<p>While the making of the Romanian blouse was added to UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage in 2022, there is no patent on it, and there are different styles even among the same group of seamstresses.</p>

<p>In Vaideeni, some women have recently taken up the craft they learned from their elders, but it is far from easy.</p>

<p>It takes at least a month to sew a blouse selling for around 300 to 400 euros ($320-$430), and they don't exactly sell like hotcakes.</p>

<p>"I'm a bit scared (about the future), but we won't give up here," said Staniloiu, whose daughter and four granddaughters have all left the village to look for work elsewhere.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Revelations that cooking oil has been transported in containers also used to carry fuel have sparked outrage in China, the latest scandal in a country where fears about food safety are widespread.</p>

<p>Local state-backed outlet the Beijing News last week published an investigation into what it called an "open secret" in the transportation industry.</p>

<p>The outlet found that several tanker trucks had transported edible cooking oil immediately after unloading coal oil, with no cleaning process in between journeys.</p>

<p>Truck drivers told the newspaper the practice helped to cut costs in the face of increasing competition.</p>

<p>The outlet also quoted food science expert Zhu Yi as saying that long-term consumption of coal oil, which consists mainly of hydrocarbons, could lead to poisoning.</p>

<p>Authorities have vowed to crack down, with the central government announcing Tuesday that it would launch an investigation.</p>

<p>Beijing has in recent years pledged to do much more to tighten food safety regulations and strengthen public trust.</p>

<p>The Chinese public is no stranger to scandals around food safety.</p>

<p>Milk adulterated with the chemical melamine killed six infants and poisoned hundreds of thousands of children in 2008.</p>

<p>In 2022, Chinese pork-processing giant Henan Shuanghui apologised after unhygienic work practices such as packaging meat that had dropped on the floor and workers wearing dirty uniforms were exposed.</p>

<p>And last year, top beermaker Tsingtao opened an investigation after a video that appeared to show a factory employee urinating on raw ingredients went viral.</p>

<p>Social media users expressed outrage at the latest contamination scandal.</p>

<p>"After reading these issues that have been exposed, I am not shocked at all!" said one user on the X-like social media platform Weibo.</p>

<p>"From melamine to drinking kerosene, what have we not experienced?"</p>

<p>Another user said they hoped for a "quick" investigation and a "clear explanation" from authorities.</p>

<p>"Otherwise, I really don't know what oil to buy," they wrote.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you tried manifesting? It's hard to escape on social media – the idea that you can <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/edth.12653">will what you desire</a> into reality through the power of belief. This could be financial success, romantic love or sporting glory.</p>

<p>Singer Dua Lipa, who headlined Glastonbury festival in June 2024, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwo9IoXVZ-4">has said that</a> performing on Friday night at the festival was “on her dream board”. “If you're manifesting out there, be specific – because it might happen!”</p>

<p>Manifesting gained popularity quickly during the pandemic. By 2021, <a href="https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/culture/a38802302/how-to-manifest/">the 3-6-9 manifestation method</a> was famous. A TikTok viewed <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@wtffffkenzie/video/7280676541657320746?lang=en">over a million times</a>, for instance, explains this “no fail manifesting technique”. You write down what you want three times in the morning, six times in the afternoon and nine times before you go to bed and repeating until it comes true. Now, content creators are explaining countless methods to speak your dreams into reality.</p>

<p>But the idea that if you wish for something hard enough it will happen isn't new. It grew out of the self-help movement. Some early popular books that peddled this idea include Napoleon Hill's <a href="https://www.waterstones.com/book/think-and-grow-rich/napoleon-hill/9781785042416">Think and Grow Rich</a> from as long ago as 1937, and Louise Hay's <a href="https://www.waterstones.com/book/you-can-heal-your-life/louise-hay/9780937611012">You Can Heal Your Life</a> from 1984.</p>

<p>The trend really took off with Rhonda Byrne's <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.co.uk/books/The-Secret/Rhonda-Byrne/The-Secret-Library/9781847370297">The Secret</a>, a book published in 2006 which claims you can bring about whatever you desire through the power of manifestation. It has sold more than 35 million copies and boasts many celebrity fans. Drawing upon the “law of attraction”, Byrne proclaims: “Your whole life is a manifestation of the thoughts that go on in your head.”</p>

<h2>Manifesting as an intellectual vice</h2>

<p>But there is a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/edth.12653">dark side</a> to manifesting. Popular trends such as the 3-6-9 manifestation method promote obsessive and compulsive behavioural patterns, and they also encourage flawed thinking habits and faulty reasoning.</p>

<p>Manifesting is a form of wishful thinking, and wishful thinking leads to false conclusions, often through the inaccurate weighing of evidence. The wishful thinker overinflates their optimism about the likelihood of a preferred outcome. In philosophical terms, this kind of thinking is called an <a href="https://archive.philosophersmag.com/intellectual-vices/">“intellectual vice”</a>: it blocks a rational person's attainment of knowledge.</p>

<p>Manifesting urges people to dream big and imagine in detail everything they desire. This sets people's expectations unnaturally high, setting them up for failure and disappointment. It's arguably a form of <a href="https://theconversation.com/lucky-girl-syndrome-the-potential-dark-side-of-tiktoks-extreme-positive-thinking-trend-198439">toxic positivity</a>.</p>

<p>If you believe your own thoughts have the power to create reality, you may end up downplaying or ignoring practical actions and the efforts of others. You might manifest by saying: “I attract positive things to me”. But in doing so, you may not notice or credit the role of luck, chance, privilege and circumstance in explaining why some things happen and others do not.</p>

<h2>Logical errors</h2>

<p>Manifesting leads to logical errors. Someone who practices manifesting – and who finds that something they manifested comes true – is likely to attribute these desired outcomes to their prior hoping or wishing. But this does not mean hoping was the cause of the outcome. Just because one came before the other does not mean it was the cause: correlation does not imply causation.</p>

<p>If you believe the power of wishing for something results in what you want coming true, you will disproportionately attribute your mental activity with causal efficacy over other causes.</p>

<p>For instance, if you study hard for an exam and achieve a good grade, you might end up attributing this outcome to the daily mantra or repeated affirmations you said leading up to the test, rather than crediting the effort you put into studying. For your next test, you might keep on manifesting, but study less.</p>

<p>And when a hoped-for outcome does not occur, you might find yourself accounting for it in positive or fatalistic terms: the universe has something better planned. The negative outcome becomes additional evidence that you should still think positively, and so you won't change your approach.</p>

<p>While it may seem initially appealing, manifesting may also encourage victim blaming: that if someone had thought more positively, an outcome would have been different. It also fails to encourage people to make backup plans, leaving them vulnerable to luck and circumstance.</p>

<p>Manifesting is very self-involved. The wants of the manifester are central to their focus and the use of their mental energy and time.</p>

<p>If you rely solely on mental power to achieve your desires, you will not succeed. Try to consider the various factors that support and resist your goals. Finally, remember that sometimes the thoughts we think are imaginative, fictive, fanciful or fantastic. It is enriching and positive that in many cases, our thoughts do not come true.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

<p>The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is working on a joint project with the US' National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to send an <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/science/exclusive-fashion-technologists-explain-indian-astronauts-uniform-design-5205122" target="_blank">Indian astronaut</a> to space. Of the four astronauts that India had chosen, two will be sent to NASA for training, and one of them will be selected for the space mission, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/exclusive-nasa-to-train-2-indian-astronauts-send-one-of-them-to-space-isro-chief-s-somanath-to-ndtv-5997637" target="_blank">ISRO chief Dr S Somanath told NDTV</a> last month.</p>

<p>The two space agencies have also collaborated for NISAR (NASA ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar), a joint Earth-observation mission.</p>

<p>"India and the US have had much success working together to explore the stars. And our future together could not be brighter," Sunita Williams said in her video message to the US embassy in Delhi on America's Independence Day from the ISS, which orbits some 400 kilometers above Earth.</p>

<p>"NASA and the ISRO continue to work toward the launch of NISAR, which will launch from India this year to measure changes in our planet's surface," she said.</p>

<p>"After returning to Earth, we look forward to meeting Indian astronauts training at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. Our partnership with India and the countries around the world will help expand humanity's reach for the sky," Williams added.</p>

<p>She was joined by her fellow astronauts Tracy C Dyson and Jeanette J Epps.</p>

<h3><strong>NASA To Train 2 Indians, Send One Of Them To Space</strong></h3>

<p>The ISRO's work to send an astronaut to space in a joint project with NASA is going on as scheduled, the Indian space agency's chief Dr S Somanath told NDTV in an exclusive interview on June 29.</p>

<p>Of the four astronauts that India had chosen, two will be sent to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for training, and one of them will be selected for the space mission, he said.</p>

<p>"Similarly, the other two will also get training of a different kind... So all four of them will go through certain levels of training through this programme. Many engineers will also be trained by NASA to handle other aspects of space flight," Dr Somanath said.</p>

<p>He said the ISRO's eventual goal is human space flight, and the learnings from the whole programme with NASA will feed into the Indian space agency's experience in finally sending humans to space.</p>

<p>"When we get the capability, if a head of state wants to fly to space, for example, it must be on our vehicle, from our land. I will wait for our Gaganyaan to be ready, to be proven, to be qualified to do that," the ISRO chief told NDTV when asked whether key leaders would be eligible to fly to space in the far future.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Australian father faced triple murder charges Thursday, accused of setting his home ablaze and locking the door with his seven children and their mother inside.</p>

<p>Three of the children -- two boys aged two and six and a five-month-old baby girl -- died in the weekend blaze in western Sydney's Lalor Park, police said.</p>

<p>The four other young children are in a stable condition in hospital and their 29-year-old mother has been released after treatment, police added.</p>

<p>The 28-year-old father, who is in hospital under police guard after emerging from an induced coma, was refused bail in a Sydney court on three counts of murder and five of attempted murder, court documents showed.</p>

<p>"Police will allege this man is solely responsible for setting fires inside the premises," New South Wales detective superintendent Daniel Doherty told a news conference after the court hearing.</p>

<p>An accelerant had whipped up "a large amount of fire and smoke" in the home and the doors "had been locked" to prevent the family escaping, he said.</p>

<p>A neighbour "very courageously" forced his way inside, rescuing two boys aged four and seven and a nine-year-old girl, as well as the mother, Doherty said.</p>

<p>But the father allegedly prevented the neighbour from saving an 11-year-old boy.</p>

<p>Police then arrived, however, and "had to wrestle with this man and wrestle the boy from his grasp because he was holding on to him, allegedly, and the boy was then rescued", the detective said.</p>

<p>A domestic dispute may have led to the "horrendous murderous act", Doherty said.</p>

<p>Most of the children were the accused man's biological children but in any case "they are his family, they are his kids", he said.</p>

<p>"It's not something that I will forget about very quickly."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden will Thursday give his first press conference since his debate disaster against Donald Trump, in a pressure-cooker moment that could seal the fate of his reelection bid.</p>

<p>The eyes of the world will be on the 81-year-old at a NATO summit as he tries to calm growing calls from his Democratic party to step aside over his age and health.</p>

<p>The White House has dubbed it a "big boy" press conference, and Biden will be under severe pressure to show he can handle what has become a rare unscripted moment in his presidency.</p>

<p>Any missteps by Biden at the 5.30 pm (2130 GMT) event at a Washington DC conference centre could turn the trickle of Democrats who have so far urged him to abandon his 2024 election bid into a flood.</p>

<p>The walls closed in further on Wednesday when Hollywood actor and supporter George Clooney called on Biden not to stand, just weeks after holding a glitzy fundraiser for the president.</p>

<p>Party heavyweight and former House speaker Nancy Pelosi also subtly twisted the knife by stopping short of backing Biden, saying only that he should make a decision after the NATO summit.</p>

<p>The first Democratic senator, Peter Welch of Vermont, meanwhile joined at least eight House Democrats in openly urging the man who beat Trump in 2020 not to stand again.</p>

<p>But many Democrats are believed to be waiting to see if Biden pulls off his first solo press conference since November 2023, or whether it will be a repeat of the debate.</p>

<p>Biden has given fewer news conferences than his predecessors. His recent appearances have been joint appearances with foreign leaders restricted to two questions each.</p>

<p>Coupled with a lack of interviews, it has led critics to accuse the White House of shielding the effects of age on America's oldest president from the public.</p>

<h3><strong>'Devastating'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre has repeatedly promised Thursday's "big boy press conference" -- a phrase first used by a journalist that she has since adopted -- will feature multiple questions.</p>

<p>A poor performance will pour fuel on the flames of the concerns about Biden's age and health that were sparked when he appeared listless and often incoherent against Republican Trump, 78.</p>

<p>NATO allies have also been seeking reassurance about Biden's leadership abilities, and over fears that a return of the isolationist Trump could spell trouble for the alliance.</p>

<p>Biden has blamed his debate meltdown on a bad cold and jet lag after two weeks of gruelling foreign travel.</p>

<p>But Clooney said in a coruscating New York Times piece on Wednesday that the signs were already there at a June 15 fundraiser in Los Angeles that he co-hosted with actor Julia Roberts.</p>

<p>"It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fundraiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010," wrote Clooney.</p>

<p>"He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate."</p>

<p>Clooney said that Biden would lose the presidential election, and Democrats would also lose both chambers of Congress.</p>

<p>Biden has insisted that he is committed to running in November, and with the Democratic party primary votes under his belt there is no real way of forcing him out.</p>

<p>But the New York Times reported on Wednesday that some Democratic grandees like Pelosi are trying a different tack -- appealing to his rational side rather than inflaming the stubbornness that has driven his political career.</p>

<p>Vice President Kamala Harris is widely seen to be the frontrunner to replace Biden if he steps aside, but any move would have to be before the Democratic convention in Chicago in August.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China is staging army drills with Belarus this week at NATO's eastern border, in a sign of escalating tensions between Beijing and the US-led defence alliance.</p>

<p>The joint "antiterrorist" exercises on Russian ally Belarus's soil near the Polish border come as NATO leaders gather for a summit in Washington, with the war in nearby Ukraine high on their agenda.</p>

<p>With relations between NATO on the one hand and China and Russia on the other at a low ebb, analysts believe that Beijing wanted to send the alliance a warning message with the timing of the drills.</p>

<p>Sino-Belarusian exercises have taken place before, but this is the first time since Russia invaded neighbouring Ukraine, a NATO ally, in February 2022.</p>

<p>The exercises began July 8 in Brest, a city right on the border with Poland, according to a statement issued on Wednesday by the Chinese defence ministry.</p>

<p>The statement said the manoeuvres will last until mid-July, but did not give the exact number of Chinese soldiers involved.</p>

<p>Both sides are working to "improve combat techniques and deepen cooperation and communication between the two armies", the statement added.</p>

<p>Chinese diplomatic officials insisted that the exercises were "not aimed at any country in particular".</p>

<p>But Poland's defence ministry slammed the timing of the exercises.</p>

<p>It warned of "the risk of the operations in question being used for disinformation and propaganda purposes... to coincide with the NATO summit".</p>

<p>However small in scale, the exercises still involve China deploying troops on NATO's doorstep, and to a country Russia used as a launchpad for its invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>And the exercises come as Beijing, one of Moscow's key partners is also experiencing increasingly tense relations with NATO.</p>

<h3><strong>Strategic signal&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Analysts believe that the date and location of the exercises were not chosen by chance, arguing that China wanted to send NATO a message.</p>

<p>"Multilateral exercises are often used to send political signals," Kelly Grieco of the Stimson Center foreign policy and defence think tank told AFP.</p>

<p>Indeed, she argues that when it comes to military drills, "it's much more about political signal more than for the exercise itself".</p>

<p>She points out that China had already carried out anti-terrorism exercises in Belarus four times between 2011 and 2018, but had not done so since.</p>

<p>That they are taking place "that close to the border is part of the signalling" too, she added.</p>

<p>Countries often organise their joint exercises to coincide with developments abroad -- not least of them China, added Alice Ekman, senior analyst for Asia at the European Union Institute for Security Studies (EUISS).</p>

<p>"In April 2023, the Chinese held exercises with Russia in the East China Sea, close to Japanese islands, on the eve of a trilateral US-Japan-South Korea summit to signal their opposition to such a summit being held," Ekman told AFP.</p>

<p>Similarly, China staged military manoeuvres in the South China Sea in May 2024 as the US-Japan-Philippines-Australia meeting was in full swing, she added.</p>

<p>As well as moving closer to Russia, China is becoming increasingly hostile to NATO.</p>

<p>It accuses NATO of working to contain China at Washington's instigation, with Beijing worried about the alliance's expanding role in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>

<p>Moreover, China has never forgiven the bombing of its embassy in Belgrade by a NATO plane in 1999.</p>

<p>It also believes that the alliance has already overstepped its geographical sphere of influence in Iraq, Libya and Afghanistan.</p>

<p>NATO is perceived by China as "clearly hostile for historical reasons", Ekman said.</p>

<p>But those reasons were becoming "increasingly strategic as the threat from China becomes an integral part of the organisation's strategic thinking", she added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

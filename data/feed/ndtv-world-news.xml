       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ousted Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and family have landed in Moscow and have been granted asylum, Russia state media reported today, hours after Islamist-led rebels took control of his country.</p>

<p>"Assad and members of his family have arrived in Moscow," a Kremlin source told the TASS and Ria Novosti news agencies. "Russia granted them asylum on humanitarian grounds," he added.</p>

<p>There was buzz on social media with flight trackers speculating the mysterious whereabouts of Assad for most part of Sunday.</p>

<p>A Syrian Air plane took off from Damascus airport around the time the capital was taken by rebels, according to data from the Flightradar website.</p>

<p>The aircraft initially flew towards Syria's coastal region, a stronghold of Assad's Alawite sect, but then made an abrupt U-turn and flew in the opposite direction for a few minutes before disappearing off the map.</p>

<p>The sudden change in course and disappearance of the plane from tracking could indicate it had been shot down, or that it had switched off its transponder.</p>

<p>With Assad and family in Russia now, it is clear the plane had switched off its transponder.</p>

<p>Assad's departure comes less than two weeks after the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group challenged more than five decades of the Assad family rule with a lightning offensive.</p>

<p>"After 50 years of oppression under Baath rule, and 13 years of crimes and tyranny and displacement... we announce today the end of this dark period and the start of a new era for Syria," the rebel factions said on Telegram.</p>

<p>The Islamist leader of HTS, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, visited the capital Damascus's landmark Umayyad Mosque, as crowds greeted him with smiles and embraces. HTS is rooted in the Syrian branch of Al-Qaeda.</p>

<p>Proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Western governments, HTS has sought to soften its image in recent years.</p>

<p>Across Syria, people toppled statues of Hafez al-Assad, Bashar al-Assad's father and the founder of the system of government that he inherited. For the past 50 years in Syria, even the slightest suspicion of dissent could land one in prison or get one killed.</p>

<p>As rebels entered the capital, HTS said its fighters broke into a jail on the outskirts of Damascus, announcing an "end of the era of tyranny in the prison of Sednaya", which has become a by-word for the darkest abuses of Assad's era.</p>

<p>UN war crimes investigators on Sunday described Assad's fall as a "historic new beginning" for Syrians, urging those taking charge to ensure the "atrocities" committed under his rule are not repeated.</p>

<p>The rapid developments came just hours after HTS said it had captured the strategic city of Homs, where prisoners were also released. Homs was the third major city seized by the rebels, who began their advance on November 27.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden was keeping a close eye on the "extraordinary events" unfolding in Syria, the White House said. US president-elect Donald Trump said that Assad had "fled his country" after losing Russia's backing.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[US President-elect Donald Trump aims to deport all immigrants in the US illegally over his four-year term but wants a deal to protect so-called "Dreamer" immigrants, he said in an interview that aired on Sunday on NBC News.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump aims to deport all immigrants in the US illegally over his four-year term but wants a deal to protect so-called "Dreamer" immigrants, he said in an interview that aired on Sunday on NBC News' "Meet the Press with Kristen Welker."</p>

<p>Trump also said he plans to take executive action on his first day in office to try to end birthright citizenship, which confers citizenship on anyone born in the US regardless of their parents' immigration status.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Trump, a Republican who won a second term in the White House promising mass deportations, is expected to declare illegal immigration a national emergency when he takes office on Jan. 20 and draw on resources from across the federal government to support a wide-ranging crackdown.</p>

<p>The US Department of Homeland Security estimated some 11 million immigrants were in the US illegally as of January 2022, although the figure is likely higher today. In the NBC News interview, Welker asked Trump if his plan was to deport everyone without legal status.</p>

<p>"I think you have to do it," Trump said. "It's a very tough thing to do. You know, you have rules, regulations, laws."</p>

<p>Trump said he wanted a deal to protect "Dreamer" immigrants brought to the US illegally as children, saying Republicans are open to the idea.</p>

<p>During his 2017-2021 presidency, Trump tried to end a program that provides deportation relief and work permits to the immigrants, but was rebuffed by the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Trump's plans to try to end birthright citizenship will likely face legal challenges. The right stems from an amendment to the US Constitution and is supported by 1898 Supreme Court precedent.</p>

<p>Speaking to Welker, Trump suggested Republicans may need to pursue a constitutional amendment to address the issue - an arduous process.</p>

<p>"We'll maybe have to go back to the people," he said.</p>

<p>Trump's incoming border czar Tom Homan and deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller both told Fox News' "Sunday Morning Futures" that Congress should provide a major funding increase for immigration enforcement.</p>

<p>The pro-immigration American Immigration Council estimated that deporting all immigrants in the US illegally over more than a decade would cost $88 billion annually.</p>

<p>Homan said the minimum needed would be near that amount.</p>

<p>"We're going to need as much money as Congress can get us," he said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mystery surrounded the whereabouts of Bashar al-Assad, who was no longer in Damascus when rebels captured the Syrian capital on Sunday, ending more than five decades of his family's rule.</p>

<p>Two senior army officers said Assad had boarded a plane early on Sunday in Damascus for an unknown destination.</p>

<p>Russia, one of Assad's closest allies, confirmed that Assad had left Syria but did not say where he was, including whether Moscow had given him refuge.</p>

<p>"As a result of negotiations between B. Assad and a number of participants in the armed conflict on the territory of the Syrian Arab Republic, he decided to resign from the presidency and left the country, giving instructions for a peaceful transfer of power," Russia's Foreign Ministry said in a statement.</p>

<p>Assad has not spoken in public since the sudden rebel advance a week ago, when insurgents seized northern Aleppo in a surprise attack before marching into a succession of cities as frontlines crumbled.</p>

<p>There was also no official announcement on Sunday of the whereabouts of Assad's wife Asma or their children, the eldest of whom has long studied in Russia and received a degree from a university in Moscow last year.</p>

<p>A Syrian Air plane took off from Damascus airport around the time the capital was reported to have been taken by rebels, according to data from the Flightradar website.</p>

<p>The aircraft initially flew towards Syria's coastal region, a stronghold of Assad's Alawite sect, but then made an abrupt U-turn and flew in the opposite direction for a few minutes before disappearing off the map. Reuters could not ascertain who was on board.</p>

<p>Two Syrian sources said the sudden change in course and disappearance of the plane from tracking could indicate it had been shot down, or that it had switched off its transponder.</p>

<p>The plane departed Damascus soon after rebels had taken the central city of Homs, cutting the capital off from the coast where Assad's Russian ally has air and naval bases.</p>

<p>The only trackable flight departing Syria visible after midnight on Flightradar24, a flight tracking site, left Homs for the UAE, hours after rebels had captured the city.</p>

<p>As the rebel advance gathered steam over the past week, there was speculation that Assad might seek refuge in Moscow or with his other main ally Iran. Syrian state media had said on Saturday he was still in Damascus.</p>

<p>He had visited Moscow just before the rebel offensive. Iranian news agencies published a photograph of him on Saturday that they said showed him meeting a top Iranian official in Damascus.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Celebrations erupted around Syria and crowds ransacked President Bashar al-Assad's luxurious home on Sunday after Islamist-led rebels swept into Damascus and declared he had fled the country, in a spectacular end to five decades of Baath party rule.</p>

<p>Assad's whereabouts were not immediately clear, but his key backer Russia said he had resigned from the presidency and left Syria.</p>

<p>Residents in the capital were seen cheering in the streets as the rebel factions heralded the departure of "tyrant" Assad, saying: "We declare the city of Damascus free."</p>

<p>AFPTV footage showed a column of smoke rising from central Damascus, and AFP correspondents in the city saw dozens of men, women and children wandering through Assad's luxurious home after it had been looted.</p>

<p>The rooms of the residence had been left completely empty, save some furniture and a portrait of Assad discarded on the floor, while an entrance hall at the presidential palace not far away had been torched.</p>

<p>"I can't believe I'm living this moment," tearful Damascus resident Amer Batha told AFP by phone.</p>

<p>"We've been waiting a long time for this day," he said, adding: "We are starting a new history for Syria."</p>

<p>Assad's reported departure comes less than two weeks after the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group challenged more than five decades of Assad family rule with a lightning offensive.</p>

<p>"After 50 years of oppression under Baath rule, and 13 years of crimes and tyranny and (forced) displacement... we announce today the end of this dark period and the start of a new era for Syria," the rebel factions said on Telegram.</p>

<p>While there has been no communication from Assad or his entourage on his whereabouts, Prime Minister Mohammed al-Jalali said he was ready to cooperate with "any leadership chosen by the Syrian people".</p>

<p>The head of war monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, Rami Abdel Rahman, told AFP: "Assad left Syria via Damascus international airport before the army security forces left" the facility.</p>

<p>AFP has been unable to independently verify some of the information provided by the different parties, including the reported departure.</p>

<p><strong>Prisoners set free</strong></p>

<p>Around the country, people toppled statues of Hafez al-Assad, Bashar al-Assad's father and the founder of the system of government that he inherited.</p>

<p>For the past 50 years in Syria, even the slightest suspicion of dissent could land one in prison or get one killed.</p>

<p>As rebels entered the capital, HTS said its fighters broke into a jail on the outskirts of Damascus, announcing an "end of the era of tyranny in the prison of Sednaya", which has become a by-word for the darkest abuses of Assad's era.</p>

<p>The rapid developments came just hours after HTS said it had captured the strategic city of Homs, where prisoners were also released.</p>

<p>Homs was the third major city seized by the rebels, who began their advance on November 27, reigniting a years-long war that had become largely dormant.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden was keeping a close eye on the "extraordinary events" unfolding in Syria, the White House said.</p>

<p>US president-elect Donald Trump said that Assad had "fled his country" after losing Russia's backing.</p>

<p>Assad's rule had for years also been supported by Lebanese group Hezbollah, whose forces "vacated their positions around Damascus", a source close to it said Sunday.</p>

<p><strong>'Syria is ours'</strong></p>

<p>Rebel factions aired a statement on Syrian state television, saying they had toppled the "tyrant" Assad and urged fighters and citizens to safeguard the "property of the free Syrian state".</p>

<p>State TV later broadcast a message proclaiming the "victory of the great Syrian revolution".</p>

<p>According to the rebels, the Islamist leader of HTS, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, arrived in Damascus on Sunday.</p>

<p>HTS is rooted in the Syrian branch of Al-Qaeda.</p>

<p>Proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Western governments, it has sought to soften its image in recent years, and has told minority groups living in areas it now controls not to worry.</p>

<p>Before Sunday's announcements, Damascus residents had described to AFP a state of panic as traffic jams clogged the city centre, with people seeking supplies and queueing to withdraw money.</p>

<p>But morning saw chants and cheering, with celebratory gunfire and shouts of "Syria is ours and not the Assad family's".</p>

<p>Before Damascus, a string of towns and cities, including the northern city of Aleppo, had fallen from Assad's hands.</p>

<p>The commander of Syria's US-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which controls much of northeast Syria, hailed "historic" moments with the fall of Assad's "authoritarian regime".</p>

<p>In a sign of the complexity of Syria's war, Israel struck Syrian army weapons depots Sunday on the outskirts of Damascus, according to the Observatory, which relies on a network of sources around the country.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the overthrow of Assad was a "historic day in the... Middle East" and the fall of a "central link in Iran's axis of evil".</p>

<p>"This is a direct result of the blows we have inflicted on Iran and Hezbollah, Assad's main supporters," he added.</p>

<p>The rebel offensive began the very day a ceasefire took effect in Lebanon after nearly a year of war between Israel and Hezbollah.</p>

<p>The UN envoy for Syria said Syria was at "a watershed moment", while Turkey, which has historically backed the opposition, called for a "smooth transition".</p>

<p>Iran, a key backer of Assad throughout the civil war years, said it expected "friendly" ties with Syria to continue, even as its embassy in Damascus was vandalised.</p>

<p>Jordan urged its citizens to leave neighbouring Syria "as soon as possible", as have the United States and Russia, which both keep troops in Syria.</p>

<p>Since the rebels' offensive began, at least 826 people, mostly combatants but also including 111 civilians, have been killed, the Observatory said.</p>

<p>The United Nations said the violence has displaced 370,000 people.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad in Syria was a "historic day in the... Middle East" and the fall of a "central link in Iran's axis of evil".</p>

<p>Netanyahu said the events are "a direct result of the blows we have inflicted on Iran and Hezbollah, Assad's main supporters. It has triggered a chain reaction across the Middle East, empowering those seeking to break free from this oppressive regime."</p>

<p>He spoke on a visit to the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.</p>

<p>In recent months, Israel has killed commanders in Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as well as the senior leaders of Palestinian Hamas and Lebanese Hezbollah, both of which are backed by Tehran.</p>

<p>The Israeli premier said Assad's overthrow "presents significant new opportunities" for Israel "but is not without risks".</p>

<p>He said his country was "pursuing a good neighbour policy" and that: "We extend a hand of peace to our Druze neighbours, who are brothers to our Druze citizens in Israel. We also extend this hand of peace to Kurds, Christians, and Muslims who wish to live peacefully with Israel."</p>

<p>Syria is a multi-ethnic, multi-confessional country with significant minorities of Christians, Alawites and Kurds as well as the Druze, an ethno-religious Arab minority group with significant populations in Israel and Lebanon, and others.</p>

<p>"We will closely monitor developments and take the necessary steps to defend our border and our security", Netanyahu said.</p>

<p>He also said he had ordered the military to take control of a demilitarised buffer zone on the Syrian border.</p>

<p>Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz, speaking on the same trip, said of Iran: "Its tentacles are being severed one by one".</p>

<p>Islamist-led Syrian rebels overthrew more than five decades of rule by Assad and his father Hafez in a lightning offensive that began on November 27, dramatically overturning a years-long stalemate in the civil war that began in 2011.</p>

<p>Assad was propped up by substantial military support from Iran and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah, as well as by the Russian military from 2015 onwards.</p>

<p>The Israeli military killed long-time Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in a massive air strike on Beirut in September.</p>

<p>Since the Syrian civil war erupted in 2011, Israel carried out hundreds of strikes in the country, mainly targeting the army and Iran-backed groups.</p>

<p>The military intensified such strikes after almost a year of hostilities with Hezbollah in neighbouring Lebanon escalated in late September, before a ceasefire took effect on November 27, the same day Syria's rebel advance began.</p>

<p>Israel rarely comments on individual strikes in Syria but has repeatedly said it will not allow Iran to expand its presence in the country.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Syrian rebels declared the fall of President Bashar al-Assad today, less than two weeks after a lightning offensive that ended his family's decades of rule. As Syrians woke up to a changed country, the rebel flags had replaced the posters of Assad, that earlier loomed over almost every corner. The development could lead to a significant change - a new official flag for the country that had its fair share of flag changes.</p>

<p><strong>Current Syrian Flag</strong></p>

<p>The current Syrian flag has been in use since 1980 and is a nod to Arab unity. The colours in the flag mean the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Red represents the blood shed in the revolution for the freedom of Syrians</li>
	<li>White denotes a peaceful future</li>
	<li>The green stars in the middle represent Syria and Egypt - the two founding states of the United Arab Republic</li>
	<li>The Black is for the alleged oppression suffered by Arabs</li>
</ul>

<p>This flag was first adopted in 1958 when the country had become independent of European influence and decided to form the United Arab Republic with Egypt. The country changed its flag another three times between 1961 and 1980 before settling on the current design. However, with the ouster of Bashar al-Assad that could change soon.</p>

<p><strong>Syrian Rebels' Flag</strong></p>

<p>On Sunday, as rebels announced on <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/syria-damascus-bashar-al-assad-out-rebels-take-over-what-next-for-syria-and-its-people-7200024">Syria</a>'s state television that the 50-year family dynasty was eliminated, the green-white-black-red opposition flags were seen across the country. The celebrations echoed in Germany, Turkey and Greece where jubilant crowds of thousands waved the Syrian opposition flags.</p>

<p>Supporters of the rebels entered the Syrian embassy in Athens raised the Syrian opposition flag from the rooftop. The police detained four people, however, left the flag flying, as per a Reuters report.</p>

<p><strong>Rebel Flag And 'Independence'</strong></p>

<p>The rebel flag, however, is not all that much different to the current Syrian flag. It has green at the top, white in the middle and black at the bottom of the flag with three red stars in the middle.</p>

<p>This flag is a modified version of the independence flag first used in 1932 when Syria gained independence from France. The Syrian opposition favoured the flag to represent independence from the Assad government.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/syria-bashar-al-assad-assad-family-damascus-the-al-assads-syrias-first-familys-rapid-rise-brutal-rule-abrupt-end-7198899">Bashar al-Assad</a>&nbsp;and his family are in Moscow, Russian news agencies announced Sunday evening citing a Kremlin source. Russia has granted them "asylum on humanitarian grounds," the source added.</p>

<p>After his regime was toppled, a statement read on television quoted Abu Mohammed al-Jolani - the leader of the Islamist alliance that spearheaded the offensive - as saying: "We continue to work with determination to achieve the goals of our revolution... We are determined to complete the path we started in 2011".</p>

<p>In 2011, Assad cracked down on peaceful pro-democracy protesters, triggering a complex conflict that drew in foreign armies.</p>

<p>While there has been no communication from Assad or his entourage on his whereabouts, Prime Minister Mohammed al-Jalali said he was ready to cooperate with "any leadership chosen by the Syrian people".</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a seismic moment for the Middle East, Islamist rebels in Syria announced President Bashar al-Assad's ouster on Sunday after seizing control of Damascus, forcing him to flee and ending his family's decades of rule after more than 13 years of civil war. The fall of Bashar al-Assad came as a major blow to the influence of Russia and Iran in the heart of the region, key allies who propped up the President during critical periods in the conflict.</p>

<p>The end of the Assad family's five-decade rule in Syria is set to reshape the power balance in the region, with regional and global forces rising to fill the power vacuum left behind by the dramatic regime change. While the Western and Arab states, along with Israel, would try to curtail Iran's influence in Syria, it is unlikely for them to support a radical Islamist regime to replace Assad, according to a report by CNN.</p>

<p>For Iran the fall of Syria could shatter its so-called Axis of Resistance, comprising allied states and militia.</p>

<h2><strong>What Led To Asaad's Fall?</strong></h2>

<p>Rebels reportedly were encouraged to make an advance for Aleppo last week after Israel debilitated Hezbollah and weakened Iran's footprint in the region. "Due to the Lebanese war and decrease in Hezbollah forces, (Assad's) regime has less support," Hadi al-Bahra, a Syrian opposition leader representing anti-Assad groups told news agency Reuters in an interview.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He added that Iran-backed militias also have fewer resources, and Russia is providing less air cover to Assad's forces due to its "Ukraine problem".&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>What's At Stake?</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>Iran</strong></h3>

<p>For years, Syria was used by Iran to expand its regional influence through proxy groups stationed in the majorly Sunni nation. Tehran, along with its proxy Hezbollah, have helped the Syrian government forces regain lost territory. &nbsp;The Islamic Republic also sent its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commanders to advise Assad's military, which proved instrumental in keeping the President in Power. &nbsp;</p>

<p>However, since the beginning of the Middle Eastern conflict in October last year after the Palestinian militant group Hamas launched its attack on Israel, Hezbollah pulled its forces out of Syria to focus on its war with Israel. Iran has been reportedly using supply routes in Syria to transfer weapons to its proxies fighting Israel. The fall of Aleppo and potentially other cities bordering Lebanon could disrupt those routes, placing Iran in a difficult position. Losing Syria would be "a huge blow" for Iran, according to experts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The investment Iranians have made in Syria is very significant, it's an important land bridge to Lebanon, but also the alliance the Iranians have with the Assad regime has lasted across the Islamic Republic's history," Trita Parsi, executive vice president of the Washington DC-based Quincy Institute told CNN.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As per the report, Iran would want to use its proxies in the region as leverage in potential talks with incoming US President Donald Trump's administration.</p>

<p>"If Iran loses too much of their position in the region, will they be too weak to negotiate? But if they fight back to try and retain as much of that position as possible, do they risk escalating the war to the point where diplomacy may no longer be possible?" Mr Parsi said.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Lebanon</strong></h3>

<p>As per experts, the events in Syria are bound to impact Lebanon, where a truce deal between Tehran's proxy Hezbollah and Israel is hanging by a thread. Hezbollah was a crucial player in keeping the Asaad regime afloat, but it has been weakened by the war with Israel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In case the Syrian insurgents manage to reach the Lebanese border, Hezbollah's key logistics and supply route from Iran-- which passes through Syria and Iraq-- could be cut off, confining Tehran's proxy in Lebanon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"One of the causes of what is happening today in Syria is the control of the Syrian-Lebanese borders to prevent the passage of strategic weapons into Lebanon," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.euronews.com/2024/12/04/syria-how-the-conflict-could-impact-the-ukraine-crisis-and-migration" rel="No follow, no index" target="_blank">Euronews</a> quoted Antoine Habchi, Lebanese MP from the Bekka Valley, as saying.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Turkey has tried to make sure that the Lebanese borders are not a route for the transfer of strategic weapons through Syria. Even al-Assad doesn't control passage through his own territory here, which is controlled by other factions and international forces, and notably Iran," Mr Habchi added.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Turkey</strong></h3>

<p>Turkey had been seeking to increase its leverage with President Assad to boost its standing in the region and allow it to keep closer control of Kurdish separatists, located along the Turkish-Syria border, to create a buffer zone. Ankara had represented the rebels in negotiations with Russia in the past decade, which eventually led to a ceasefire agreement between the Syrian government and Opposition forces in 2020.</p>

<p>Despite its support for opposition forces, Turkey has not ruled out a rapprochement with Syria. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has long opposed Kurdish nationalism. He has time and again said that his ultimate goal is to eliminate the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a Kurdish far-left militant and political group based in Turkey and Iraq that has fought the Turkish state for more than three decades.</p>

<p>Another goal for Ankara is to reportedly maintain control over oil-rich Syrian sanctuaries in semi-autonomous northern areas of the country.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Israel</strong></h3>

<p>The imbalance in power in Syria has also caught Israel in a difficult position. While President Assad viewed Israel as an enemy, he did not pose a direct threat to Tel Aviv and opted to not respond to the regular Israeli strikes in Syria over the past year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, Asaad's regime allowed its territory to be used by Iran to supply weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon. But the fall of Mr Asaad did not come as a relief to Israel as the group leading the rebellion in Syria is Hayat Tahrir Al Sham (HTS) whose leader Abu Muhammad Al Jolani is a former al Qaeda fighter with an Islamist ideology that opposes Israel.</p>

<p>"Israel is in between Iran, its proxies and Syria's Islamic rebels," Avi Melamed, a former Israeli intelligence official, told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/07/world/syria-rebellion-middle-east-power-explainer-intl/index.html" rel="no follow, no index" target="_blank">CNN</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"None of the choices are good as far as Israel is concerned but for the time being Iran and its proxies are weakened, which is good," he said</p>

<p>The newly revived conflict has allowed Tel Aviv to resume strikes on targets in Syrian territory. Suspected Israeli airstrikes hit Mazzeh district of Damascus on Sunday, Reuters reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As per the report, jets believed to be Israeli also bombed the Khalkhala air base in southern Syria which was evacuated by the Syrian army overnight. The regional security sources also told the agency that at least six strikes hit the main air base in the north of the city of Suweida which has a large stockpile of rockets and missiles left by Syrian troops.</p>

<p>The attack appeared aimed at preventing these weapons from falling into the hands of radical groups, one source told Reuters.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Christians are celebrating the return of the French capital's most famous place of worship, Notre Dame after a historic re-opening ceremony.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Newly restored Notre Dame cathedral held its first mass on Sunday, with Christians celebrating the return of the French capital's most famous place of worship after a historic re-opening ceremony.</p>

<p>The beloved Paris monument nearly burned down in 2019, but has been fully renovated inside and fitted with a new roof and spire during a frenzied five-year refit.</p>

<p>The inaugural mass was led by Paris archbishop Laurent Ulrich with 150 bishops and more than 100 priests from the capital in attendance, as well as French President Emmanuel Macron.</p>

<p>The archbishop led prayers and consecrated a new altar which replaced the old one that was destroyed five years ago.</p>

<p>"Whether you are here in person in the cathedral or in front of a screen, including perhaps under the rain, I greet you with intense emotion," Ulrich told the congregation, referring to the small rain-drenched crowds outside watching events on public screens.</p>

<p>In a nod to France's ongoing political turmoil, he added that he "prayed also for our country that is looking to the future with worry."</p>

<p>A second mass in the evening at 6:30 pm (1730 GMT) will be open to the public, with roughly 2,500 people who secured free tickets this week expected to attend.</p>

<p>The cathedral will open fully to visitors on December 16 via an online reservation system.</p>

<p><strong>'For Jesus'</strong></p>

<p>During a re-opening service on Saturday attended by world leaders including US President-elect Donald Trump, Macron expressed the "gratitude of the French nation" for the restoration work since 2019.</p>

<p>"We have rediscovered what great nations can do -- achieve the impossible," he said.</p>

<p>Macron is under intense political pressure having called snap elections in June that led to a hung parliament, with the main parties now struggling to form a stable government.</p>

<p>One of the most moving moments on Saturday came when firefighters in their protective gear walked through the congregation to thunderous applause as the word "Merci" ("Thank you") was beamed on the intricate facade and famous belltowers of the Gothic masterpiece.</p>

<p>The architectural wonder had been in danger of collapsing during the April 2019 blaze and was saved only by firefighters pumping vast quantities of water onto the flames from the nearby River Seine.</p>

<p>Groups of worshippers huddled under umbrellas on Sunday beyond a strict security perimeter set up outside Notre Dame.</p>

<p>"Beyond the reconstruction work, it's beautiful because it shows that the church still has a role, discreet and small, but it still has a role to play in France," 21-year-old engineering student Jacques told AFP.</p>

<p>Monique Kashale, a 75-year-old from the Democratic Republic of Congo, said she was "very cold but for Jesus Christ I can put up with it, for the Virgin Mary it is bearable."</p>

<p><strong>Trump in Paris</strong></p>

<p>Saturday's re-opening service began with the archbishop Ulrich, dressed in brightly coloured new vestments designed by fashion designer Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, knocking on the doors of the cathedral three times.</p>

<p>Trump was placed on the front row as guest of honour next to Macron, with invitees marvelling at the freshly cleaned walls, new furniture and state-of-the-art lighting installed as part of the overhaul</p>

<p>The reconstruction effort cost around 700 million euros ($750 million), financed from donations, with the five-year re-opening deadline met despite predictions it could take decades.</p>

<p>Part of the cathedral's lead roofing base still needs to be finished and the statues of the apostles and saints, removed before the fire to allow for their restoration, will only be reinstalled in the first half of 2025.</p>

<p>The exact cause of the 2019 blaze has never been identified despite a forensic investigation by prosecutors, who believe an accident such as an electrical fault was the most likely reason.</p>

<p>Notre Dame welcomed around 12 million visitors a year before the fire, but expects to receive an even higher figure of "14 to 15 million" after the reopening, according to the church authorities.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Indian embassy in war-torn Syria's capital Damascus continues to remain operational and is in touch with all Indian nationals, sources have said.</p>

<p>All Indian nationals in Syria are safe and the embassy remains available to help them, sources said.</p>

<p>Islamist-led rebels today said they have liberated Syria from the regime of Bashar al-Assad.</p>

<p>In an advisory earlier, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) asked Indians living in the violence-hit country to leave by the earliest available commercial flights if they can. The advisory came before the rebels breached the capital Damascus.</p>

<p>"In view of the situation prevailing in Syria, Indian nationals are advised to avoid all travel to Syria, until further notification," the MEA had said.</p>

<p>"Indians currently in Syria are requested to remain in touch with the Indian embassy in Damascus at their emergency helpline number +963 993385973 (also on WhatsApp) and email ID hoc.damascus@mea.gov.in for updates," it said.</p>

<p>"Those who can, are advised to leave by the earliest available commercial flights and others are requested to observe utmost precaution about their safety and restrict their movements to the minimum," it added.</p>

<p>On Friday, India said it is closely following the unfolding situation in Syria.</p>

<p>"We have taken note of the recent escalation in fighting in the north of Syria. We are closely following the situation," MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.</p>

<p>There are about 90 Indian nationals in Syria, including 14 who are working in various UN organisations.</p>

<p>Syria's rebels said the leader of Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, arrived in Damascus hours after fighters seized the capital and said they ousted President Bashar al-Assad.</p>

<p>Identifying him by his real name Ahmed al-Sharaa, the statement on Telegram said he had "knelt down prostrating to God in thanks" on the ground after arriving in the Syrian capital.</p>

<p>A video showed him kneeling in a field and bringing his head to the ground.</p>

<p>Syrians woke up to a changed country on Sunday, as rebels swept into Damascus less than two weeks into a lightning offensive declaring they had toppled "tyrant" Assad, whose whereabouts are unknown after he reportedly fled Syria.</p>

<p>A statement that was read on Syrian state television, which rebels took over, quoted Jolani as saying: "We continue to work with determination to achieve the goals of our revolution... We are determined to complete the path we started in 2011".</p>

<p>That year, Assad cracked down on peaceful pro-democracy protesters, triggering a complex conflict that drew in foreign armies and jihadists.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's embassy in Syria was "attacked" on Sunday, Iranian state TV said, after Islamist-led rebels declared the fall of Tehran ally Bashar al-Assad following a sweeping offensive that culminated in Damascus.</p>

<p>"Unknown individuals have attacked the Iranian embassy, as you can see in these images shared by various networks," a state TV broadcaster said, showing footage from Al Arabiya, said to be from the diplomatic compound.</p>

<p>Iranian newspaper Tehran Times reported online that Iranian diplomats had left the embassy before it was stormed, citing foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei.</p>

<p>The report said that all embassy staff were safe.</p>

<p>It also accused rebel forces of being behind the attack, a claim that could not be independently verified immediately.</p>

<p>Authorities in Iran have yet to comment on Assad's fall.</p>

<p>On Saturday, as the rebels pressed their lightning offensive but had not yet taken Damascus, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi called on "the Syrian government and legitimate opposition groups" to enter negotiations.</p>

<p>His remarks marked a shift in Tehran's tone towards rebel groups which Iran had previously called "terrorists" and refused to recognise them as legitimate actors.</p>

<p>Araghchi visited Damascus on December 1, days into the rebels' offensive, meeting with Assad in the Syrian leader's last public appearance alongside an Iranian official.</p>

<p>A day later, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian reiterated Tehran's support in a telephone call with Assad.</p>

<p>The deposed Syrian leader last visited Iran in May 2024, shortly after the death of former president Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash.</p>

<p>Iran has supported Damascus during Syria's civil war, which began in 2011, sending "military advisers" at Assad's request.</p>

<p>Numerous Iranian Revolutionary Guards commanders have been killed in Syria, in combat and in Israeli strikes against presumed Iranian-linked targets.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Syria should have an 18 month transition period to establish "a safe, neutral, and quiet environment" for free elections, Hadi Al-Bahra, the head of Syria's main opposition abroad, said to Reuters on the sidelines of the Doha Forum on Sunday.</p>

<p>In a seismic moment for the Middle East, Syrian rebels seized control of Damascus on Sunday, forcing President Bashar al-Assad to flee after more than 13 years of civil war, ending his family's decades-long rule.</p>

<p>The lightning offensive sparked concerns in Arab capitals and raised fears of a new wave of regional instability, as well as questions over whether the rebels will be able to ensure an orderly transition.</p>

<p>Al-Bahra, President of the Syrian National Coalition, said Syria should draft a constitution within six months, on which the first election would be a referendum.</p>

<p>"The constitution will say, are we going to have a parliamentary system, presidential system, or mixed system? And based on this, we do the election and the people choose their leader," said Al-Bahra.</p>

<p>He added that the opposition had asked state employees to continue to report to work until the power transition, and assured them that they would not be harmed.</p>

<p>Assad's swift toppling followed a shift in the balance of power in the Middle East after many leaders of Lebanon's Iranian-backed Hezbollah group, a lynchpin of Assad's battlefield force, were killed by Israel over the past two months. Russia, Assad's other key ally, has been focused on the war in Ukraine.</p>

<p>"It was like a domino effect. So it was clear that (Assad) decided to leave. I felt relief, but also a little sad. He should be held accountable for all the crimes that he did," Al-Bahra said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA["Ukrainians want peace more than anyone else. Russia brought war to our land, and it is Russia that most seeks to disrupt the possibility of peace," Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky said Sunday he told US President-elect Donald Trump Kyiv needed an "enduring" peace that Russia will not "destroy" in the future, after they met in Paris for talks on the almost three-year war.</p>

<p>Trump had earlier said Zelensky was keen for a "deal" and called for a start of negotiations.</p>

<p>The pair met a day earlier with French leader Emmanuel Macron at the Elysee.</p>

<p>Trump has boasted he could end the conflict swiftly without saying how and both Moscow and Kyiv are readying for his arrival in the White House, with the dragging conflict seeing an escalation in deadly attacks in recent weeks.</p>

<p>"I stated that we need a just and enduring peace -- one that the Russians will not be able to destroy in a few years, as they have done repeatedly in the past," Zelensky said on social media.</p>

<p>Almost three years of war have ravaged Ukraine, leaving thousands dead and millions fleeing the country.</p>

<p>"Ukrainians want peace more than anyone else. Russia brought war to our land, and it is Russia that most seeks to disrupt the possibility of peace," he said.</p>

<p>He called on Western allies not to "turn a blind eye to occupation" and said Kyiv would only agree to a deal that will bring long-term peace.</p>

<p>"War cannot be endless -- only peace must be permanent and reliable," he said.</p>

<p>In a rare admission of numbers, Zelensky said 43,000 Ukrainian troops had been killed in combat, while some 370,000 were wounded.</p>

<p>Both sides are believed to have suffered massive casualties and that figure is believed to be far higher.</p>

<p><strong>'Key conditions' discussed</strong></p>

<p>Zelensky gave no concrete details on key aspects of what negotiations could look like, but a senior Ukrainian official said they had discussed "some key conditions" for ending the war.</p>

<p>"We are not disclosing details, but the presidents discussed at the meeting that there should be something that would guarantee the reliability of the peace," the source said.</p>

<p>The Kremlin, meanwhile, accused Ukraine of "refusing" to negotiate an end to the war and said its conditions to enter peace talks -- which include Kyiv giving up four regions -- remain unchanged.</p>

<p>"The Ukrainian side refused and is refusing negotiation," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.</p>

<p>He referred to a 2022 Ukrainian decree that ruled out talks with Putin, but not other Russian officials.</p>

<p>Trump had earlier called for an "immediate ceasefire" and called for talks to begin.</p>

<p>"Too many lives are being so needlessly wasted, too many families destroyed, and if it keeps going, it can turn into something much bigger, and far worse," he wrote on his Truth Social platform.</p>

<p>Trump has touted himself as having good relations with Putin.</p>

<p><strong>'How long can we be at war?</strong></p>

<p>But as leaders made statements in Kyiv, Moscow and Paris, the situation on the ground in eastern Ukraine remained dire.</p>

<p>Moscow claimed another village in the east -- Blagodatne in the Donetsk region -- on Sunday, pressing steady gains.</p>

<p>Many in Ukraine have feared that Trump taking office would force it to make heart-aching concessions to Russia, while the nation is also suffering exhaustion.</p>

<p>In the village of Osynovo in the eastern Kharkiv region, news of the meeting between Trump and Zelensky offered some hope to one of the frontline village's last remaining residents, Mykola Lytvynov.</p>

<p>Cleaning earth from vegetables in his backyard, the 80-year-old said he hoped the meeting could help bring about a negotiated end to the conflict.</p>

<p>"How long can we be at war? So many people have been killed, so many young people. And you see the massive level of destruction," he told AFP.</p>

<p>He suggested Ukraine could have retained more of its territory by already entering into talks with Russia, but said he hoped for an end to the fighting for another, personal reason.</p>

<p>"Both my sons are fighting. I just want them to survive."</p>

<p>Ukraine also said that two civilians were killed in the Donetsk region and that seven people were wounded by attacks in the southern Kherson region.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Groups of Syrians strolled through the palaces of President Bashar al-Assad on Sunday following his ouster, wandering from room to room, posing for photographs, and with some taking items of furniture or ornaments.</p>

<p>Video obtained by Reuters showed people entering the Al-Rawda Presidential Palace, as children ran through the grand rooms and men slid a large trunk across the ornate floor.</p>

<p>Several men carried smart chairs over their shoulders. In a storeroom, cupboards had been ransacked and objects strewn across the floor.</p>

<p>Video of another palace, the Muhajreen Palace, verified by Reuters, showed groups of men and women walking across a white marble floor and through tall wooden doors. A man carried a vase in his hand, and a large cabinet stood empty with its doors ajar.</p>

<p>Syrian rebels seized control of Damascus on Sunday, forcing Assad to flee and ending his family's decades of rule after more than 13 years of civil war in a seismic moment for the Middle East.</p>

<p>Assad, who had not spoken in public since the sudden rebel advance a week ago, flew out of Damascus for an unknown destination earlier on Sunday, two senior army officers told Reuters, as rebels said they had entered the capital with no sign of army deployments.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Islamist-led rebels toppled Syria's longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in a lightning offensive that a UN envoy called "a watershed moment" for the nation marred by civil war.</p>

<p>Here are key reactions from around the world:</p>

<p><strong>'Return to stability': China</strong></p>

<p>Beijing "is closely following the development of the situation in Syria and hopes that Syria returns to stability as soon as possible", the foreign ministry said.</p>

<p><strong>'Time for unity': France</strong></p>

<p>Welcoming Assad's ouster, France called on Syrians to "reject all forms of extremism".</p>

<p>"While the (Assad) regime has never ceased to pit Syrians against each other, and Syria is fractured and fragmented, the time for unity has come," foreign affairs minister spokesman Christophe Lemoine said, urging a peaceful political transition.</p>

<p><strong>'Full protection for minorities': Germany</strong></p>

<p>"The country must not now fall into the hands of other radicals, whatever form they take," German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said.</p>

<p>She urged "full protection for ethnic and religious minorities such as Kurds, Alawites or Christians" and political inclusivity.</p>

<p><strong>'Political dialogue': Iran</strong></p>

<p>Diplomats from Assad ally Iran were reported to have left the embassy in Damascus before it was attacked by "unknown individuals" on Sunday, Iranian state TV said.</p>

<p>Their departure followed calls by Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Saturday for "political dialogue" between the Syrian government and opposition groups.</p>

<p><strong>'Country in turmoil': Turkey</strong></p>

<p>Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said the overthrow of the Assad regime was not sudden but rather the result of the grinding civil war.</p>

<p>"Of course, this didn't happen overnight. For the last 13 years, the country has been in turmoil," Fidan said at conference in Doha.</p>

<p><strong>'Work together': UAE</strong></p>

<p>A senior United Arab Emirates official urged Syrians on Sunday to collaborate in order to avert a spiral into chaos.</p>

<p>"We hope that the Syrians will work together, that we don't just see another episode of impending chaos," presidential adviser Anwar Gargash said at the Manama Dialogue in Bahrain.</p>

<p><strong>'Political solution': UK</strong></p>

<p>Britain's Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner told Sky News that while Assad "wasn't exactly good" to the Syrian people, "we need stability in that region".</p>

<p>"Dictatorship and terrorism creates problems for the people of Syria, who have faced so much already," she said. "That's why we have to have a political solution where the government is acting in the interests of the Syrian people."</p>

<p><strong>'Cautious hope': UN</strong></p>

<p>The UN envoy for Syria called the rebel takeover "a watershed moment" for the country marred by nearly 14 years of civil war.</p>

<p>"Today we look forward with cautious hope to the opening of a new (chapter) -- one of peace, reconciliation, dignity and inclusion for all Syrians," special envoy Geir Pedersen said.</p>

<p><strong>'Russia not interested any longer': Trump</strong></p>

<p>US President-elect Donald Trump attributed the fall of Assad to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/russia-was-not-interested-in-protecting-syrias-assad-donald-trump-7200470" target="_blank">losing the backing of Russia</a>.</p>

<p>"Assad is gone," he said on his Truth Social platform. "His protector, Russia, Russia, Russia, led by Vladimir Putin, was not interested in protecting him any longer."</p>

<p>His comments followed an earlier statement from National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett that President Joe Biden was keeping a close eye on "extraordinary events" transpiring and remained in constant contact with regional partners.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hundreds of Syrians celebrated the fall of long-time ruler Bashar al-Assad in joyous scenes on Sunday outside the Fatih Mosque in central Istanbul, one of the focal points for their 500,000-strong Syrian community in the Turkish city.</p>

<p>Turkey has become home for millions of Syrians who fled since civil war erupted in their home nation in 2011.</p>

<p>"I didn't expect it to happen one day, not even in three centuries. No one was expecting this. This is a huge victory for us," said Mohamad Cuma, a student who arrived from the northern Syrian city of Aleppo three years ago.</p>

<p>"It's incredible. It's like we've been born again," said Sawsan al-Ahmad, holding her young son by the hand.</p>

<p>Ahmad lived through the first few months of the siege of the strategic city of Homs.</p>

<p>She said she was delighted to be able to take her son to her "home soil", now that Assad has fallen after a lightning offensive by Islamist-led rebels.</p>

<p>Rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and allied factions seized swathes of Syria from government hands, including the cities of Aleppo, Hama and Homs in an offensive that started November 27.</p>

<p>Early on Sunday they entered the capital, Damascus, declaring the demise of an Assad dynasty that had ruled Syria with an iron fist for five decades.</p>

<p>Behind Ahmad, hundreds of Syrians chanted "Allahu akhbar" ("God is greatest").</p>

<p>Some waved Syrian opposition flags and called for Assad to be executed.</p>

<p>In the middle of the jubilant throng, whose chanting could be heard hundreds of metres (yards) away, a man waved a portrait of Abdel-Basset al-Sarout, a former Syrian football star who became a rebel fighter and was killed in 2019 in clashes with Assad's forces.</p>

<p><strong>'He'll end up in hell'</strong></p>

<p>"Today is a day of huge celebration for us Syrians," said 42-year-old Ibrahim al-Mohamed, one of the three million Syrian refugees living in neighbouring Turkey.</p>

<p>"My son became handicapped because of Assad," he said, his eyes red and his voice cracking with emotion.</p>

<p>"We were living in Aleppo and a bomb was dropped on the building next door. My son was traumatised. He lost the ability to speak. He's 13 now and just starting to get a little bit better."</p>

<p>"God be praised. We're rid of Assad," said Ahmed Mohamad, a teacher of the Koran who came to Turkey from Aleppo 11 years ago after defecting from the Syrian army.</p>

<p>"If God wills, he'll be decapitated," added an onlooker, drawing his thumb across his throat.</p>

<p>Cuma said he didn't care what became of Assad.</p>

<p>"It's enough that he's gone," he said.</p>

<p>"He can go to live in Russia, in Belarus, in Venezuela, wherever the hell he wants to go. Let him go because he's going to end up in hell."</p>

<p>Cuma said he expected the whole of Syria would "be unified under one flag" and predicted 50 percent of Syrian refugees in Turkey would return home.</p>

<p>He said the reported fall of the Assad regime had altered his personal plans.</p>

<p>"Well, my plan before this week was to pursue a Masters (degree) in the UK," explained the civil engineering student at Istanbul's prestigious Bogazici University.</p>

<p>"But now I think I could be a benefit for Syria's future and reconstruction. So most probably I'll go back."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[After the United Arab Emirates (UAE) mandated stricter requirements for tourist visa applications for Dubai, Indians looking to visit the Gulf city are reportedly witnessing an unprecedented rise in visa rejections.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After the United Arab Emirates (UAE) mandated stricter requirements for tourist visa applications for Dubai, Indians looking to visit the Gulf city are reportedly witnessing an unprecedented rise in visa rejections. Earlier, almost 99 per cent of Dubai visa applications were approved, but now even the most meticulously prepared requests are being rejected by the UAE authorities, according to a report by Times of India.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Recently, Dubai's emigration department introduced stricter requirements for tourist visas, mandating travellers to provide hotel booking documents with QR codes and a copy of their return tickets. For travellers staying with relatives, additional proof of accommodation is needed by the latter.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Rise In Dubai Visa Rejections</strong></h2>

<p>As per the report, since the new visa rules for Dubai came into force, at least 5-6 applications out of 100 are being rejected daily. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"Earlier, the rejection rate for Dubai visas was just 1-2%. This is before the new rules were enforced. We are now getting at least 5-6 visa rejections per day from nearly 100 applications daily. Even when confirmed flight tickets and hotel stay details are attached, the visa applications are being rejected," Nikhil Kumar, director of Passio Travels Pvt Ltd told TOI.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The move is creating uncertainty among travellers, who are facing financial losses not just on visa fees, but also pre-booked flight tickets and hotel reservations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We are seeing unprecedented rejection rates (for tourist visa applications to Dubai). Earlier, almost 99 per cent of Dubai visa applications were approved. Now, we are experiencing rejections even for well-prepared travellers," said Rishikesh Pujari, director of Vihar Travels, according to the TOI report.</p>

<p>He said even the most meticulously prepared application, with all relevant documents like confirmed hotel bookings and flight details, attacked with it, is being rejected. "I had a family of four who meticulously prepared their application. Despite this, their visa application was rejected," he said.</p>

<p>Vijay Thakkar, director of Hasmukh Travels, told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/visa-rejections-for-indian-tourists-soar-as-dubai-tightens-entry-rules/articleshow/116087560" rel="no follow, no index" target="_blank">TOI</a> that two of their passengers, who were planning to stay with their relatives in Dubai, recently had their Dubai visa applications rejected.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"While applying for the visa, we had attached all the relevant documents as per the new visa requirements. Yet, their applications were rejected. This resulted in significant monetary loss for the passengers, as they had spent nearly Rs 14,000 on visa fees, and ticket cancellation cost was another Rs 20,000 and more," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Dubai's New Visa Policy</strong></h2>

<p>The UAE has recently introduced a new policy, under which travellers are required to submit hotel booking documents and return tickets on the emigration department's website when applying for a visa. These documents were previously only required if asked by airport officers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Moreover, tourists are also required to provide proof that they have sufficient financial resources to stay in the city. Applicants must at least have AED 5,000 (approximately Rs 1.14 lakh) in their credit or debit accounts for a two-month visa, and AED 3,000 for a three-month visa.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UN envoy for Syria said the country was at "a watershed moment" on Sunday after rebels declared they had taken the capital, Damascus.</p>

<p>Describing Syria's drawn-out civil war as a "dark chapter (that) has left deep scars", special envoy Geir Pedersen said: "Today we look forward with cautious hope to the opening of a new one -- one of peace, reconciliation, dignity and inclusion for all Syrians".</p>

<p>"Today marks a watershed moment in Syria's history -- a nation that has endured nearly 14 years of relentless suffering and unspeakable loss," he said, extending his "deepest solidarity to all who have borne the weight of death, destruction, detention and untold human rights violations".</p>

<p></p>

<p>President Bashar al-Assad's reported flight from Damascus comes less than two weeks after the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) launched a lightning offensive challenging more than five decades of domination by the Assad family.</p>

<p>Assad had ruled Syria since 2000, when he inherited power from his father.</p>

<p>Since 2011, he had overseen a crackdown on the democracy movement, which began with peaceful protests.</p>

<p>The Assad government's repression of the protests morphed into one of the bloodiest wars of the century, killing hundreds of thousands of people and displacing millions.</p>

<p>Pedersen acknowledged in a statement that "the challenges ahead remain immense", stressing however: "This is a moment to embrace the possibility of renewal... (and) a path toward a united and peaceful Syria."</p>

<p>The UN special envoy emphasised "the clear desire expressed by millions of Syrians that stable and inclusive transitional arrangements are put in place, that Syrian institutions continue to function".</p>

<p>He said the Syrian people should be helped to realise their "legitimate aspirations... (to) restore a unified Syria".</p>

<p>The statement said Pedersen had heard from many Syrians, including armed groups and civil society organisations, and had noted "a will to protect their fellow Syrians... against retribution and harm".</p>

<p>He appealed to all armed parties to "maintain... law and order, protect civilians and preserve public institutions".</p>

<p>He urged Syrians "to prioritise dialogue, unity and respect for international humanitarian law and human rights as they seek to rebuild their society".</p>

<p>"There must be a collective effort to secure peace and dignity for all."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan called to "unite and reconstruct" Syria in an orderly manner, without compromising on inclusiveness.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said on Sunday that Syria's new administration must be inclusive because Syrian people would determine their own future after the ousting of President Bashar al-Assad by rebels.</p>

<p>Syrian rebels declared Assad's ouster after seizing control of Damascus on Sunday, ending his family's iron-fisted rule after more than 13 years of civil war.</p>

<p>In a press conference in Doha, Fidan said the Syrian people were not in a position to rebuild on their own and international actors and regional powers had to act with prudence and preserve the country's territorial integrity.</p>

<p>Terrorist organisations must not be allowed to take advantage of the situation, he added.</p>

<p>"As of this morning, Syria has reached a stage where Syrian people will shape the future of their own country. Today there is hope," Fidan said.</p>

<p>"The new (Syrian) administration must be established in an orderly manner, the principle of inclusiveness must never be compromised, there must never be a desire for revenge... It is time to unite and reconstruct the country," he added.</p>

<p>Asked about the whereabouts of Assad, Fidan said he believed he was out of the country.</p>

<p>He said, Turkey had no contact with Assad despite a call from President Tayyip Erdogan to hold normalisation talks, after years of animosity. Fidan added Ankara had reached out to Assad but all efforts had failed.</p>

<p>Turkey has said it did not support the rebel operation in northern Syria, and that Assad's refusal to engage in a serious political solution had triggered his downfall.</p>

<p>Fidan also said that chemical weapons and related materials should be secured, and that Turkey - host to some 3 million migrants from Syria - had started work on their return.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Turkey-backed Syrian forces entered the northern Syrian city of Manbij after taking control of most of the surrounding area from US-allied Kurdish forces there, a Turkish security source said on Sunday.</p>

<p>The operation comes after Syrian rebels in the south declared President Bashar al-Assad's ouster after seizing control of Damascus.</p>

<p>"The fight against the YPG/PKK is very close to victory. Both air and land interventions are ongoing to take Manbij from the hands of the YPG/PKK," the source said, referring to the Kurdish militia which has long been in control of Manbij.</p>

<p>The source subsequently said the rebel forces were in the city of Manbij itself. There was no immediate comment from Kurdish forces in the city, some 30 km (19 miles) south of the Turkish border and to the west of the Euphrates river.</p>

<p>Syrian rebels earlier said they had started an attack on Manbij, according to a statement posted on Sunday but dated Dec. 7 (Saturday) on X by the Ministry of Defense of the Syrian Interim Government.</p>

<p>The YPG has been a central element of US-allied forces in a coalition against Islamic State militants. Ankara says the YPG is a terrorist group, closely tied to Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants who have fought the Turkish state for 40 years.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

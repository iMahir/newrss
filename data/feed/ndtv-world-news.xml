       <description><![CDATA[The body was of 24-year-old Harshita Brella, an Indian woman who was born in Delhi and moved to the United Kingdom in April this year after marrying Pankaj Lamba in August last year.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the morning of November 11, police in East London's Ilford found a body inside the boot of a silver Vauxhall Corsa parked on Brisbane Road. The body was of 24-year-old Harshita Brella, an Indian woman who was born in Delhi and moved to the United Kingdom in April this year after marrying Pankaj Lamba in August last year. Days earlier, she had disappeared from her home in Northamptonshire. A post-mortem examination of the body revealed that she had been strangled.</p>

<p>According to the police, Harshita had likely been murdered by her husband, Pankaj, 23, who allegedly fled the country shortly after committing the crime. Harshita's body, concealed in the car's boot, had been transported 145 kilometres south to Ilford before being abandoned.</p>

<p>"Our inquiries lead us to suspect that Harshita was murdered in Northamptonshire earlier this month by her husband Pankaj Lamba," said Northampton Police.</p>

<p>"We suspect Lamba transported Harshita's body from Northamptonshire to Ilford (east London) by car. We believe he has now fled the country... More than 60 detectives are working on the case and are continuing to follow numerous lines of inquiry, including house-to-house, property searches, CCTV and ANPR (automatic number plate recognition)," the statement added.</p>

<p>Harshita was last heard from on the evening of November 10, when she told her family she was preparing dinner and awaiting her husband's return. Concern grew when her phone remained off for two days, prompting her family to contact Northamptonshire Police on November 13. Officers visiting her home on Skegness Walk found no trace of her, prompting an investigation.</p>

<p>The next day, in the early hours of November 14, her body was discovered in Ilford. By then, Pankaj had disappeared, evading authorities and sparking an international manhunt.</p>

<p>The murder investigation revealed Harshita had endured a history of domestic violence. In September, she was granted a Domestic Violence Protection Order (DVPO) against her husband following incidents of abuse. However, despite legal measures, the threat remained.</p>

<p>Neighbours reported hearing arguments from the couple's home in the days before her death. One recalled a particularly intense confrontation in which a woman "sounded scared."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Harshita's family, based in Delhi, spoke of their anguish in media interviews. Her father, Satbir Brella, described her as a simple, determined young woman with aspirations of becoming a teacher. After marrying Pankaj in an arranged match, she moved to the UK in April 2023. According to Harshita's sister Sonia Dabas, she worked in a warehouse and Pankaj was a student in London.</p>

<p>&nbsp;"I want my son-in-law to be brought to justice and I want my daughter's body brought home," said Satbir Brella, Harshita's father, as quoted by the BBC.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"She was a part of me and I was a part of her. I now feel like I can't do anything in life without her," said Sonia, adding that Harshita had previously fled her home after being assaulted by Pankaj but returned, hoping to salvage the marriage.</p>

<p>According to the family, Pankaj had complained about Harshita speaking too often to her mother or not preparing meals on time. In August, Harshita called her father to say she had run away due to Pankaj's violent behaviour.</p>

<p>CCTV images released by the police show the silver Vauxhall Corsa, which investigators believe was used to transport Harshita's body. However, Pankaj's whereabouts remain unknown. Police have appealed to the public for any information about sightings of Pankaj or suspicious activity in Corby and Ilford around the time of the murder.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine "will lose" its war against Russia if the United States cuts military funding to Kyiv, President Volodymyr Zelensky told Fox News on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"If they cut, we will -- I think we will lose," Zelensky said in an interview with the US television network.</p>

<p>"We will fight. We have our production, but it's not enough to prevail. And I think it's not enough to survive," he continued.</p>

<p>US President-elect Donald Trump is a vocal skeptic of the billions that the administration of President Joe Biden has given to Ukraine since the Russian invasion began in 2022.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-election-results-2024-what-donald-trump-said-about-wars-in-trump-2-0-victory-speech-6956202">Trump has repeatedly promised to end the war quickly</a>, but has not provided details of how he would do so.</p>

<p>This week his allies voiced vehement criticism of Biden's decision to let Ukraine use US-supplied long-range missiles for attacks inside Russia, accusing him of a dangerous escalation.</p>

<p>Zelensky told Fox that "unity" between Ukraine and the United States was "most important."</p>

<p>Trump, he said, could influence Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war, "because he is much more stronger than Putin."</p>

<p>Putin "can be willing and end this war, but it also depends on the United States of America much more. Putin is weaker than the United States of America," he said.</p>

<p>With Russia gaining ground and increasing talk of negotiations, Ukraine is wary of being at a disadvantage when it comes to hashing out a peace settlement.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump has nominated Fox Business host Sean Duffy to be the next Transportation Secretary. The former congressman will replace Pete Buttigieg in January to oversee a huge federal portfolio of infrastructure spending and transit regulations.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol class="CetSht_ol">
	<li class="CetSht_li">Sean Duffy was born on October 3, 1971, in Hayward, Wisconsin. He was part of a large family and was the 10th of 11 children his parents had. &nbsp;He has a marketing degree from St. Mary's University, and a JD degree from William Mitchell College of Law.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Sean Duffy is the second Fox News host to join Donald Trump's cabinet after Pete Hegseth was nominated Defence Secretary. He is married to another Fox News personality Rachel Campos-Duffy.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Sean Duffy and his wife Rachel Campos-Duffy have 9 children - Evita Pilar, Xavier Jack, Lucia-Belen, John-Paul, Paloma Pilar, MariaVictoria Margarita, Margarita Pilar, Patrick Miguel and StellaMaris.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Sean Duffy first met his future wife on the set of MTV's 'Road Rules: All Stars' in 1998. They had appeared separately on MTV's Real World programs. While Sean Duffy was on The Real World: Boston, his future wife Rachel was on The Real World: San Francisco.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Mr Duffy was also an athlete. He holds two speed-climbing titles. He had started log rolling when he was 5 years old and speed climbing at the age of 13. He has even appeared as a commentator for ESPN's 'Great Outdoor Games'.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Sean Duffy had entered the US Congress during the Tea Party wave of the early 2010s. He later went on to become an ally of Donald Trump</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Before becoming a Congressman, he was a practicing lawyer and had worked as a district attorney for more than 8 years.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">He served in the House of Representatives for nearly nine years, where he was a member of the Financial Services Committee.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Mr Duffy quit in 2019 when he and his wife found out that their ninth child had a heart condition. Speaking about his resignation at the time, Mr Duffy had said that being away from his family for four days every week to serve in Congress was difficult. He had said "I have always been open to signs from God when it comes to balancing my desire to serve both my family and my country. I have decided that this is the right time for me to take a break from public service in order to be the support my wife, baby and family need right now."</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Announcing Mr Duffy's nomination on Truth Social, Donald Trump said the incoming Transportation Secretary was a tremendous and well-liked public servant, admired across the aisle. "He will prioritise excellence, competence, competitiveness and beauty when rebuilding America's highways, tunnels, bridges and airports," Mr Trump said.</li>

       <description><![CDATA[President-elect Donald Trump has made a flurry of picks for his cabinet and other high-ranking administration positions following his election victory.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President-elect Donald Trump has made a flurry of picks for his cabinet and other high-ranking administration positions following his election victory.</p>

<p>Here are the early picks and top contenders for some of the key posts overseeing defense, intelligence, health, diplomacy, trade, immigration and economic policymaking.</p>

<p><strong>MARCO RUBIO, secretary of state</strong></p>

<p>Trump tapped US Senator Marco Rubio to be his secretary of state, putting the Florida-born politician on track to be the first Latino to serve as the United States' top diplomat.</p>

<p>Rubio, 53, was arguably the most hawkish option on Trump's shortlist for secretary of state. The senator has in past years advocated for a muscular foreign policy with respect to US geopolitical foes, including China, Iran and Cuba.</p>

<p>Over the last several years he has softened some of his stances to align more closely with Trump's views. The president-elect accuses past US presidents of leading the US into costly and futile wars and has pushed for a less interventionist foreign policy.</p>

<p><strong>MATT GAETZ, attorney general</strong></p>

<p>Trump said that he had selected Gaetz, a US representative, to be his nominee for attorney general.</p>

<p>"Few issues in America are more important than ending the partisan Weaponization of our Justice System," Trump said in a statement announcing the selection of the Florida lawmaker.</p>

<p>Trump's inner circle has described the attorney general as the most important member of the administration after Trump himself, key to his plans to carry out mass deportations, pardon Jan. 6 rioters and seek retribution against those who prosecuted him over the past four years.</p>

<p><strong>TULSI GABBARD, director of national intelligence</strong></p>

<p>Trump named Gabbard, a former Democratic representative and critic of the Biden administration, as his director of national intelligence.</p>

<p>Gabbard left the Democratic Party in 2022 to become an independent and has little direct experience with intelligence work. If confirmed, she would become the top official in the US intelligence community after Trump starts his second term in January.</p>

<p><strong>ROBERT F. KENNEDY, JR., health and human services secretary</strong></p>

<p>Kennedy is an environmental activist who has spread misinformation about the dangers of vaccines. He has suggested he would gut the 18,000-employee Food and Drug Administration, which ensures the safety of food, drugs and medical devices, and replace hundreds of employees at the National Institutes of Health.</p>

<p>Kennedy ran for president in this year's election, first as a Democrat and then as an independent, before dropping out in August in exchange for a role in Trump's administration.</p>

<p>The Department of Health and Human Services oversees the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health and the massive Medicare and Medicaid Services programs, which provide health coverage for the poor, those aged 65 and older, and the disabled.</p>

<p><strong>PETE HEGSETH, defense secretary</strong></p>

<p>Trump said he had picked Hegseth as his secretary of defense. Hegseth is a Fox News commentator and veteran who has expressed disdain for the so-called "woke" policies of Pentagon leaders, including its top military officer.</p>

<p>Hegseth, if confirmed by the Senate, could make good on Trump's campaign promises to rid the US military of generals who he accuses of pursuing progressive policies on diversity in the ranks that conservatives have rallied against.</p>

<p>It could also set up a collision course between Hegseth and the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force General CQ Brown, who Hegseth accused of "pursuing the radical positions of left-wing politicians."</p>

<p><strong>LEE ZELDIN, EPA administrator</strong></p>

<p>Trump announced he had appointed Zeldin, a former congressman from New York state, as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>

<p>Zeldin, 44, a staunch Trump ally, served in Congress from 2015 to 2023. In 2022, he lost the New York governor's race to Democratic incumbent Kathy Hochul. Trump has promised to overhaul US energy policy, with the aim of maximizing the country's already record-high oil and gas production by rolling back regulations and speeding up permitting.</p>

<p><strong>MIKE WALTZ, national security adviser</strong></p>

<p>Trump said he had picked Waltz, a Republican US representative, to be national security adviser. Waltz is a retired Army Green Beret who has been a leading critic of China.</p>

<p>Waltz, a 50-year-old Trump loyalist who also served in the National Guard as a colonel, has criticized Chinese activity in the Asia-Pacific and has voiced the need for the US to be ready for a potential conflict in the region.</p>

<p>The national security adviser is a powerful role, which does not require Senate confirmation. Waltz will be responsible for briefing Trump on key national security issues and coordinating with different agencies.</p>

<p>While slamming the Biden administration for a disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, Waltz has publicly praised Trump's foreign policy views.</p>

<p><strong>SUSIE WILES, chief of staff</strong></p>

<p>Trump announced that Wiles, one of his two campaign managers, will be his White House chief of staff.</p>

<p>While the specifics of her political views are somewhat unclear, Wiles, 67, is credited with running a successful and efficient campaign. Supporters hope she will instill a sense of order and discipline that was often lacking during Trump's first four-year term, when he cycled through a number of chiefs of staff.</p>

<p><strong>TOM HOMAN, 'border czar'</strong></p>

<p>Trump said that Homan, the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement during Trump's first administration, will be in charge of the country's borders.</p>

<p>Trump made cracking down on people in the country illegally a central element of his campaign, promising mass deportations.</p>

<p>Homan, 62, said on Monday he would prioritize deporting immigrants illegally in the US who posed safety and security threats as well as those working at job sites.</p>

<p><strong>ELISE STEFANIK, UN ambassador</strong></p>

<p>Trump announced that Stefanik, a Republican congresswoman and staunch Trump supporter, would be his ambassador to the United Nations.</p>

<p>Stefanik, 40, a US representative from New York state and House Republican conference chair, took a leadership position in the House of Representatives in 2021 when she was elected to replace then-Representative Liz Cheney, who was ousted for criticizing Trump's false claims of election fraud.</p>

<p>Stefanik will arrive at the UN after bold promises by Trump to end the Russia-Ukraine war and Israel's war in Gaza.</p>

<p><strong>ELON MUSK AND VIVEK RAMASWAMY, heads of Department of Government Efficiency</strong></p>

<p>Trump named tech billionaire Musk and Ramaswamy, a former Republican presidential candidate, to lead a newly created Department of Government Efficiency, rewarding two of his well-known supporters from the private sector.</p>

<p>Trump said that Musk and Ramaswamy will reduce government bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut waste and restructure federal agencies. Trump said the new department would bring in external expertise and work with the White House and Office of Management and Budget.</p>

<p><strong>KRISTI NOEM, homeland security secretary</strong></p>

<p>Noem, the governor of South Dakota, has been picked to serve as the next homeland security secretary, Trump said.</p>

<p>Noem, 52, once seen as a possible running mate for Trump, is currently serving her second four-year term as South Dakota's governor. She rose to national prominence after refusing to impose a statewide mask mandate during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>The Department of Homeland Security is responsible for everything from border protection and immigration to disaster response and the US Secret Service.</p>

<p><strong>DOUG BURGUM, interior secretary and 'energy czar'</strong></p>

<p>Trump has chosen Burgum, the governor of North Dakota, to be interior secretary.</p>

<p>Burgum, 68, a wealthy former software company executive, has portrayed himself as a traditional, business-minded conservative. He ran against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination before quitting and becoming a loyal Trump supporter.</p>

<p>The Interior Department manages public lands and minerals, national parks and wildlife refuges. The department also carries out the US government's trust responsibility to Native Americans. In the energy czar role, he is expected to coordinate with several agencies to boost oil and gas output.</p>

<p><strong>JOHN RATCLIFFE, CIA director</strong></p>

<p>Trump said he had picked Ratcliffe, the former director of national intelligence, to serve as director of the Central Intelligence Agency in his second administration.</p>

<p>A former congressman and prosecutor who served as director of national intelligence during Trump's last year in office, Ratcliffe, 59, is seen as a hardcore Trump loyalist who could likely win Senate confirmation. Still, during his time as director of national intelligence, Ratcliffe often contradicted the assessments of career civil servants, drawing criticism from Democrats who said he politicized the role.</p>

<p><strong>HOWARD LUTNICK, commerce secretary</strong></p>

<p>The co-chair of Trump's transition effort and the longtime chief executive of financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald, Lutnick has been picked to head the Commerce Department, the agency that has become the US weapon of choice against China's tech sector.</p>

<p>A bombastic New Yorker like Trump, Lutnick, 63, has uniformly praised the president-elect's economic policies, including his use of tariffs.</p>

<p>He has at times given elaborate, unvarnished opinions about what policies will be enacted in Trump's second term. Some Trump allies complained privately that he too often presented himself as speaking on behalf of the campaign.</p>

<p><strong>KEVIN WARSH, potential treasury secretary</strong></p>

<p>Trump is considering Warsh, 54, a former investment banker who served on the Federal Reserve Board, for treasury secretary according to news reports. He is seen as a fiscal hawk and proponent of higher savings rates.</p>

<p><strong>MARC ROWAN, potential treasury secretary</strong></p>

<p>Trump is considering Rowan, 62, who co-founded Apollo Global Management and became the firm's CEO in 2021, for treasury secretary, according to news reports.</p>

<p><strong>BILL HAGERTY, potential treasury secretary</strong></p>

<p>Republican US Senator Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, is also in the running for treasury secretary, according to the Wall Street Journal. Trump met the 65-year-old at Mar-a-Lago last week.</p>

<p><strong>SCOTT BESSENT, potential treasury secretary</strong></p>

<p>Bessent, a key economic adviser to Trump, is seen as a candidate for treasury secretary. A longtime hedge fund investor who taught at Yale University for several years, Bessent has a warm relationship with the president-elect.</p>

<p>While Bessent has long favored the laissez-faire policies that were popular in the pre-Trump Republican Party, he has also spoken highly of Trump's use of tariffs as a negotiating tool. He has praised the president-elect's economic philosophy, which rests on a skepticism of both regulations and international trade.</p>

<p><strong>ROBERT LIGHTHIZER, potential trade czar or treasury secretary</strong></p>

<p>A loyalist who served as Trump's US trade representative for essentially the then-president's entire term, Lighthizer will almost certainly be invited back.</p>

<p>Though Bessent likely has a better shot at becoming treasury secretary, Lighthizer has an outside chance, and he might be able to reprise his old role if he's interested.</p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal has reported Trump wanted Lighthizer as his trade czar.</p>

<p>Like Trump, Lighthizer, 77, is a trade skeptic and a firm believer in tariffs. He was one of the leading figures in Trump's trade war with China and the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, with Mexico and Canada during Trump's first term.</p>

<p><strong>LINDA McMAHON, potential candidate for various posts</strong></p>

<p>McMahon, a professional wrestling magnate and former Small Business Administration director, is seen as in the running for a top post in the Trump administration.</p>

<p>McMahon, 76, is a major donor and was an early supporter of the Republican president-elect when he first ran for the White House almost a decade ago. This time, Trump tapped her to co-lead a transition team formed to help vet personnel and draft policy ahead of the Nov. 5 election.</p>

<p>McMahon is the co-founder and former CEO of the professional wrestling franchise WWE. She later served as director of the Small Business Administration, resigning in 2019, and went on to lead a pro-Trump political action committee that supported his 2020 reelection bid.</p>

<p><strong>KASH PATEL, potential candidate for national security posts</strong></p>

<p>A former Republican House staffer who served in various high-ranking staff roles in the defense and intelligence communities during Trump's first term, Patel frequently appeared on the campaign trail to rally support for the candidate.</p>

<p>Any position requiring Senate confirmation may be a challenge, however.</p>

<p>Patel, 44, has leaned into controversy throughout his career. In an interview with Trump ally Steve Bannon last year, he promised to "come after" politicians and journalists perceived to be enemies of Trump.</p>

<p>During Trump's first term, Patel, seen as the ultimate Trump loyalist, drew animosity from some more experienced national security officials, who saw him as volatile and too eager to please the then-president.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The two-day gathering wrapped up with a plea from Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva for the world's most powerful leaders to rescue stalled UN climate talks in Azerbaijan, calling it a matter of the planet's "survival."</p>

<p>Joe Biden, attending his last summit as US president before he hands power to Donald Trump -- a noted climate skeptic -- also appealed for urgent action.</p>

<p>"History is watching us," he urged.</p>

<p>But Biden's decision to suddenly reverse key US policy on Ukraine in his last weeks in office took away attention from Brazil's anti-poverty, anti-emissions G20 agenda.</p>

<p>On the eve of the gathering, Biden gave Kyiv the green light to use US missiles to strike deep inside Russia for the first time, in apparent response to Moscow enlisting North Korean soldiers to fight in Ukraine.</p>

<p><strong>'Listen to reason'</strong></p>

<p>The move prompted the Kremlin to announce it was loosening its rules on using nuclear weapons, causing alarm among Kyiv's backers in Washington, European capitals and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who was at the G20, declared that the United States and Russia were "on the brink of direct military conflict."</p>

<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer criticized the "irresponsible rhetoric coming from Russia," sentiments echoed by a spokesperson for the US National Security Council.</p>

<p>French President Emmanuel Macron said he had asked Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to "use all his influence" with Russian leader Vladimir Putin to try to get him to "listen to reason."</p>

<p>Xi, who has cast himself as a defender of the international order at the advent of a new Trump era, held back-to-back meetings with other leaders in Rio.</p>

<p>At each turn, the Chinese leader, who was received with greater fanfare than a lame-duck Biden, stressed that the world was facing a new period of "turbulence."</p>

<p>China and Brazil this summer unveiled a plan to get Russia and Ukraine back to the negotiating table, but were rebuffed by Kyiv because Moscow was not required to pull back first.</p>

<p>The summit's joint declaration made no mention of Russian aggression, saying only that the leaders welcomed "all relevant and constructive initiatives that support a comprehensive, just, and durable peace" in Ukraine.</p>

<p><strong>Taxing the uber-rich</strong></p>

<p>President Lula used his summit hosting duties to rally support for a global campaign against hunger and try to spur on the stalled COP29 climate talks in Azerbaijan's capital Baku.</p>

<p>"We cannot leave the task of Baku until Belem," Lula said Tuesday, referring to the Amazonian city that will host next year's UN climate talks.</p>

<p>But a G20 statement on the matter fell short of the shot in the arm sought by climate negotiators gathered in Azerbaijan.</p>

<p>While acknowledging the need for trillions of dollars in climate finance for poorer nations, the leaders failed to explicitly mention the need to transition away from fossil fuels.</p>

<p>Lula said that next year's conference would be the "last chance" to avoid "irreversible" damage wrought by Earth's warming.</p>

<p>Biden, who has been using a valedictory tour of South America to tout his climate legacy, told his G20 counterparts: "I urge us to keep the faith and keep going."</p>

<p>"This is the single greatest existential threat to humanity."</p>

<p>But in a symbol of the elderly leader's imminent disappearance from the global stage, he missed out on the summit's first group photo, his absence going unnoted by his peers.</p>

<p>Another photo was taken Tuesday that Biden featured in.</p>

<p>Lula, who handed over the G20 presidency to fellow Global South advocate South Africa, came away with wins on two pet projects.</p>

<p>The left-winger who grew up in poverty, got the leaders of 80 countries, including a reluctant Argentine President Javier Milei, to join an alliance to end world hunger.</p>

<p>And G20 members, at his urging, also agreed to cooperate to get the world's billionaires to pay more in tax, a key demand of anti-poverty campaigners.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump announced Tuesday that he was appointing Mehmet Oz, a former surgeon and TV celebrity known as "Dr. Oz," to lead the United States' massive public health insurance program.</p>

<p>The 64-year-old heart surgeon was championed on daytime television by Oprah Winfrey before he entered politics with an unsuccessful bid for a Senate seat in 2022.</p>

<p>Oz is the latest of Trump's eye-catching nominations to key positions, including Fox News host Pete Hegseth to be defense secretary, vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as health secretary and billionaire Elon Musk to head a government cost-cutting unit.</p>

<p>"America is facing a Healthcare Crisis and there may be no Physician more qualified and capable than Dr. Oz to Make America Healthy Again," the president-elect posted on his Truth Social platform.</p>

<p>The appointment puts a man whose health recommendations -- especially on Covid and weight loss -- have often been ridiculed by the medical community at the helm of the United States' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).</p>

<p>As CMS administrator, Oz will be in charge of a federal agency that provides health coverage to more than 160 million Americans -- almost half the country's population.</p>

<p>It employs about 6,700 people, had outlays of $1.48 trillion last year and is one the largest purchasers of healthcare services in the world.</p>

<p>A son of Turkish immigrants, Oz has never held public office before, but has been a steadfast ally of Trump, who backed him in his unsuccessful Senate run in Pennsylvania.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SpaceX's Starship megarocket blasted off on its latest test flight Tuesday, with President-elect Donald Trump joining Elon Musk to witness the spectacle firsthand in the latest sign of their ever closer ties.</p>

<p>But the Republican leader was deprived of the chance to see the booster stage caught in the launch tower's "chopstick" arms, an engineering marvel demonstrated by the company last month and one he personally lauded during his election victory speech.</p>

<p>Instead, the colossal Super Heavy first stage made a more subdued splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico. Company representatives cited unmet technical criteria, dampening the triumph of an event attended by a bevy of Trump-world figures, including Donald Trump Jr.</p>

<p>Earlier, Trump greeted Musk warmly on Tuesday afternoon, sporting a red MAGA hat as the pair headed off to watch from the control tower of the company's Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas, where the rocket blasted off at 4:00 pm local time (2200 GMT) on the sixth test flight for Starship.</p>

<p>SpaceX founder and CEO Musk has been a constant presence at Trump's side since the incoming president's election victory, joining him at a meeting with Argentina's President Javier Milei and even at a UFC bout.</p>

<p>Trump's decision to travel to Musk's home turf was the latest sign of the growing alliance between the billionaire duo, which has raised questions over possible conflicts of interests given SpaceX's lucrative contracts with NASA and the Pentagon.</p>

<p>Tuesday's launch marked the quickest turnaround between test flights for the world's most powerful rocket, a gleaming, 121-meter-tall (400-foot) stainless steel colossus central to Musk's ambition of colonizing Mars and making humanity a multiplanetary species.</p>

<p>Musk aims to launch the first uncrewed missions to the Red Planet as early as 2026, coinciding with the next "Mars transfer window" -- a period when the journey between Earth and Mars is at its shortest.</p>

<p>NASA is also counting on a specialized version of Starship to ferry astronauts to the lunar surface later this decade under its Artemis program.</p>

<p><strong>Stuffed banana</strong></p>

<p>Flight six of Starship was seen as a test of whether SpaceX's first booster catch was pure precision or relied on a stroke of luck after Musk -- perhaps inadvertently -- disclosed how close the last flight came to disaster.</p>

<p>In a clip posted to X showcasing his gaming chops in "Diablo IV," sharp-eared fans caught an employee briefing him that the Super Heavy booster was "one second away" from a system failure that could have spelled catastrophe.</p>

<p>Starship's upper stage will make a partial orbit of Earth, reenter the atmosphere and splash down in the Indian Ocean a little over an hour later, but this time in the daylight, providing clearer visuals for analysis.</p>

<p>Key milestones include reigniting Starship's Raptor engines for the first time in space and trialing new heat shield materials. The flight also carries Starship's first ever payload -- a stuffed banana -- and serves as a swan song for the current generation of Starship prototypes.</p>

<p>With twice the thrust of the Saturn V rockets that powered Apollo missions, Starship is the most powerful rocket ever built. Musk has already teased that its successor, Starship V3, will be "3X more powerful" and could take flight within a year.</p>

<p><strong>Musk riding high</strong></p>

<p>The flight comes as Musk is riding high on Trump's November 5 White House win, having campaigned extensively for the returning Republican leader, as well as donating staggering sums from his own fortune to the cause.</p>

<p>His loyalty has paid off. Musk has been tapped to co-lead a new "Department of Government Efficiency" -- or DOGE, a cheeky nod to the meme-based cryptocurrency Musk loves to promote.</p>

<p>That in turn has led to concerns Musk could engage in "self-dealing" as the CEO is poised to straddle the line between government insider and corporate titan.</p>

<p>Critics worry he could sway regulatory decisions to benefit his six companies, including SpaceX and its marquee Starship program, which has faced launch delays linked to an environmental review the company called "superfluous."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A potential plan to bring in more nations on board the ambitious 6th-generation GCAP jet fighter project was discussed today when the leaders of Italy, Japan and Britain met on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Brazil, the office of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Italy, UK and Japan had signed an agreement in December 2022 to collaborate an manufacture an advanced front-line fighter jet to enter service by 2035.</p>

<p>Earlier this month UK PM Keir Starmer and his cabinet gave the approval for the Global Combat Aircraft Programme or GCAP.</p>

<p>The GCAP programme aims to counter a rising threat from Russia and China. The project will merge two different military programs - UK and Italy's Tempest Project</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/8hdnfuag_gcap-6th-gen-stealth-fighter-jet_625x300_11_November_24.jpeg" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>Prime Minister Meloni held a meeting on Tuesday with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Rio de Janeiro where the three leaders discussed various aspects of the project, including bringing in new members on board for the project.</p>

<p>"They agreed on the importance of the project continuing to move forward expeditiously, reaffirming their common intent to further strengthen the ongoing collaboration," the statement said.</p>

<p>The final cost of the multi-billion-dollar project is not known yet, but the target to develop and commission the stealth fighter jet has been set for 2035. The project is being jointly developed by British aircraft manufacturer BAE Systems, engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce, Italy's Leonardo Aerospace, and Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.</p>

</div>

<p>According to the trilateral agreement, the joint GCAP government headquarters will be based in the UK.</p>

<p>If the deadlines are met, the GCAP supersonic, 6th generation stealth fighter aircraft will become only the second such fighter jet in the world after the United States' B-21 Raider Bomber which is manufactured by Northrop Grumman.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[For world leaders and diplomats at the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, US President-elect Donald Trump was the man who cannot be named.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For world leaders and diplomats at the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, US President-elect Donald Trump was the man who cannot be named.</p>

<p>Almost nobody would mention the next occupant of the White House directly, even as his impending return to power hung over the meeting.</p>

<p>Leaders would instead talk in coded terms about the "next administration," "turbulence" and "change."</p>

<p>But it was clear what they meant, even as they sought to avoid falling out with the man who will be at work in the Oval Office from January 20.</p>

<p>French President Emmanuel Macron, who expended considerable effort trying to win over Trump during the American's first term, made veiled comments at the summit about tariffs and climate.</p>

<p>"Any fragmentation or fracturing of the international order by tariff policies which are carried out by the strongest simply leads all others not to respect it," Macron said -- without referring to Trump by name.</p>

<p>Trump has pledged to impose sweeping tariffs on imports into the United States, including on goods from Europe and as much as 60 percent on goods from China.</p>

<p>Macron also referred to "fragile" climate policies, with Trump threatening to take the United States back out of the Paris accords that are aimed at reducing global warming.</p>

<h2><strong>SWERVE</strong></h2>

<p>It was the same whenever leaders spoke, as they seemingly treated Trump like the villain Voldemort in the Harry Potter films and books, whose name the heroes cannot mention.</p>

<p>UN chief Antonio Guterres swerved any head-on mention of Trump when he talked of the "very important" US role on climate and how he was "deeply confident" that America would "move in the direction of climate action."</p>

<p>The only places Trump's face could be seen were on placards held by protesters outside the summit venue -- and on the social media feed of Argentina's right-wing, Trump-supporting president.</p>

<p>Javier Milei reposted a meme contrasting a photo of himself meeting the smiling Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort after the election, with another of Milei beside a grim-faced Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, officials were circumspect.</p>

<p>One European diplomat said that the continent had "worked with him before" and would do so again.</p>

<h3><strong>DECISIONS</strong></h3>

<p>US officials insisted time and again that Trump's name did not come up in outgoing President Joe Biden's final meetings with his counterparts, or even that it was a major consideration.</p>

<p>"I don't think we are expecting some major reorientation of how other countries look at the world or look at their relationship with us," Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer told reporters.</p>

<p>"They will make those decisions for themselves based on their interests, in January."</p>

<p>Perhaps it was partly out of deference to Biden, making his swan song on the international stage.</p>

<p>Biden himself skirted round the issue -- in fact he has long resisted mentioning the name of the man he often calls "my predecessor," who is now his successor.</p>

<p>The 81-year-old Biden tried to shore up his legacy while his fellow summiteers looked over his shoulder.</p>

<p>As Biden remarked that it was his final summit, he called for leaders to "keep going -- and I'm sure you will, regardless of my urging or not."</p>

<p>On the final day, Biden seemed to realize that the return of he-who-cannot-be named was nigh.</p>

<p>"I have much more to say," Biden said, before stopping himself and adding: "I'm not going to."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk's SpaceX launched its sixth Starship test flight to space on Tuesday from Texas, eyeing an array of improvements on the rocket as US President-elect Donald Trump watched in person.</p>

<p>The roughly 400-foot-tall (122-meter-tall) rocket system, designed to land astronauts on the moon and ferry crews to Mars, lifted off at 4 p.m. CT (2200 GMT) from SpaceX's sprawling rocket development site in Boca Chica, Texas.</p>

<p>The first stage, called Super Heavy, unexpectedly made a splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico instead of attempting to return to its launchpad, indicating something went wrong.</p>

<p>Starship, in space, will travel around Earth for a planned daytime splashdown in the Indian Ocean some 90 minutes later.</p>

<p>Starship last month demonstrated the novel catch-landing method for the first time, achieving a key milestone in its reusable design. Tuesday's catch-landing was expected to be "faster/harder," Musk wrote on social media before the launch.</p>

<p>Trump's attendance signals a deepening alliance with Musk, who stands to benefit from Trump's election victory, with the billionaire entrepreneur expected to wield extraordinary influence to help his companies and secure favorable government treatment.</p>

<p>Musk, the world's wealthiest person, was a prominent supporter of Trump's presidential election campaign, appearing with him at rallies and backing him with at least $119 million in political support.</p>

<p>"I'm heading to the Great State of Texas to watch the launch of the largest object ever to be elevated, not only to Space, but simply by lifting off the ground," Trump wrote on social media, wishing Musk luck on the launch.</p>

<p>Trump on November 13 appointed Musk as co-leader of a new government efficiency project that the SpaceX founder and Tesla CEO has said will rid the federal government of wasteful spending and regulations he has called burdensome.</p>

<p>The US Federal Aviation Administration's regulation of commercial rocket launches has been a source of frustration for Musk, who has complained that the agency impedes his company's progress in getting to Mars.</p>

<p>But the FAA's license approval of Tuesday's Starship launch a little over a month after the rocket's previous flight was its quickest regulatory turnaround yet for SpaceX, as the agency develops new launch-approval processes meant to keep pace with the US space industry's growth.</p>

<p>Musk on Tuesday listed four core objectives for the test flight - restarting Starship's space-tailored engine during flight - key for its in-space maneuverability - and making a more visible ocean landing during the daytime, while past attempts have been at night.</p>

<p>"There are thousands of small design changes also being tested," Musk said.</p>

<p>SpaceX is eyeing swift advances in Starship development during a second Trump administration. The administration's space agenda is expected to give NASA's Artemis program, which is due to return astronauts to the lunar surface, a greater focus on the more ambitious goal of landing people on Mars, Musk's premier space aspiration.</p>

<p>"We just passed 400 launches on Falcon, and I would not be surprised if we fly 400 Starship launches in the next four years," SpaceX President and COO Gwynne Shotwell said at the Baron Investment Conference in New York last week, referring to the company's workhorse rocket.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The World Health Organization on Tuesday approved an mpox vaccine from Japanese pharma company KM Biologics for emergency use, the second one to get the agency's seal of approval.</p>

<p>The WHO said it granted emergency use listing (EUL) authorisation to the LC16m8 vaccine to "facilitate increased and timely access to vaccines in communities where mpox outbreaks are surging".</p>

<p>A WHO EUL paves the way for countries worldwide to quickly approve and import the vaccine for distribution.</p>

<p>"WHO emergency use listing of the LC16m8 vaccine against mpox marks a significant step in our response to the current emergency, providing a new option to protect all populations, including children," Yukiko Nakatani, WHO's assistant director-general for access to medicines and health products, said in a statement.</p>

<p>The WHO had already in September prequalified another vaccine against mpox, Bavarian-Nordic's MVA-BN, in a bid to help step up the fight against swelling mpox outbreaks.</p>

<p>The UN health agency on August 14 declared a fresh international emergency over mpox, amid mounting concern over a surge in cases of the new Clade 1b strain in the Democratic Republic of Congo that spread to nearby countries.</p>

<p>That and other mpox strains have been reported across 80 countries -- 19 of them in Africa -- so far this year, WHO said.</p>

<p>The DR Congo remains by far the hardest-hit country, having recorded a large majority of the more than 39,000 suspected cases and over 1,000 deaths.</p>

<p>WHO said that Tuesday's announcement was particularly relevant since the Japanese government had announced it would donate 3.05 million LC16m8 doses along with specialised inoculation needles to the DRC.</p>

<p>"This is the largest donation package announced to date in response to the current mpox emergency," it said.</p>

<p>The WHO warned the vaccine should not be used during pregnancy or by immunocompromised persons.</p>

<p>Mpox, previously known as monkeypox, is caused by a virus transmitted to humans by infected animals but can also be passed from human to human through close physical contact.</p>

<p>It causes fever, muscular aches and large boil-like skin lesions, and can be deadly.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A suicide attack in northwest Pakistan killed 10 soldiers Tuesday, an intelligence source told AFP, after a separate clash less than a day earlier left eight dead in the same region bordering Afghanistan.</p>

<p>"A suspected suicide bomber detonated an explosive-laden vehicle near the checkpoint, after which his accomplices opened fire," an intelligence official said of the attack in Bannu on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"As of the latest updates, 10 people have been killed and seven injured in the attack," he said.</p>

<p>The official said that the explosion "caused significant damage" to the Mali Khel checkpoint's structure as well as to military vehicles.</p>

<p>The Hafiz Gul Bahadur armed group claimed responsibility for the attack.</p>

<p>The bombing occurred less than 24 hours after another attack, also in the northwest Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, according to another official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>That clash on Monday lasted hours and resulted in the deaths of eight soldiers and nine militants in the Tirah area of the province, the officer said.</p>

<p>The Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), also known as the Pakistani Taliban, later claimed responsibility for that attack, saying it was in response to a search by security forces targeting one of its fighters.</p>

<p>Near the checkpoint blast in Bannu, seven police officers had been taken hostage on Monday, but were released less than a day later.</p>

<p>Their release came after negotiations between a jirga -- or tribal council -- and the captors.</p>

<p>"All the kidnapped policemen have been released following successful negotiations led by local elders with militants," senior police official Muhammad Zia ud-Din told AFP.</p>

<p>He declined to provide further details.</p>

<p>The TTP is separate from the Hafiz Gul Bahadur group, but both were active in supporting the Afghan Taliban in its war against the US-led NATO coalition since 2001.</p>

<p>The Afghan Taliban reclaimed power in Kabul in 2021, and Pakistan's border areas have seen a resurgence of violence since then.</p>

<p>The TTP claimed an attack in late October that left ten police officers dead at a check post in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.</p>

<p>In Pakistan's southwest, seven soldiers were killed at a border post on Saturday by separatist fighters with the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) group.</p>

<p>The incident came a week after a bombing by the same group killed 26 people, including 14 soldiers, at a train station in the provincial capital Quetta.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiga urged Ukraine's Western allies Tuesday to remain "clear-eyed and not give into fear" in the face what he termed Russian "saber-rattling" over its nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>Speaking at the US Capitol at a congressional hearing, Sybiga said: "Right now, we see new attempts by the Kremlin to use nuclear saber-rattling to scare the West.</p>

<p>"Their updated nuclear public rhetoric on the use of nuclear weapons is nothing more than blackmail," he added. "They have used it many times before when strong decisions were made. We must remain cold-headed, clear-eyed, and not give in to fear."</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on Tuesday broadening the scope of when Moscow can use nuclear weapons, in what was seen as a clear message to the West and Ukraine.</p>

<p>The new doctrine outlines that Russia would consider using nuclear weapons against a non-nuclear state, which would include Ukraine, if they are supported by nuclear powers.</p>

<p>The move came on the same day that Ukraine said it had fired US-supplied long-range missiles into Russian territory for the first time.</p>

<p>Putin had previously warned that authorizing the missiles to be used inside Russia would amount to the US-led NATO alliance being at war with his country.</p>

<p>A spokesman for the US Defense Department, Sabrina Singh, criticized "the same irresponsible (nuclear) rhetoric that we've seen before and that we've seen, frankly, for the past two years."</p>

<p>"It's something that we're going to continue to monitor. But we don't have any indications that Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon within Ukraine," she told reporters in Washington on Tuesday.</p>

<p>She said Russia had escalated the conflict "by bringing in another foreign country into the battlefield," referring to what she said were 11,000 North Korean soldiers who had joined Moscow's war effort.</p>

<p>The European Union and Britain both condemned Russia's nuclear policy change and rhetoric from Russian political leaders.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration plans to target federal regulations championed by President Joe Biden that aim to make automobiles more fuel-efficient and incentivize a shift toward electric vehicles, according to sources.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration plans to target federal regulations championed by President Joe Biden that aim to make automobiles more fuel-efficient and incentivize a shift toward electric vehicles, according to two sources in contact with Trump's transition team.</p>

<p>The move appears aimed at satisfying a Trump campaign promise to "end the EV mandate," and would mirror a similar move during the first Trump administration to dismantle Obama-era vehicle-efficiency rules.</p>

<p>Although no such "EV mandate" exists, the Biden administration regulations would effectively require automakers to shift at least 35% of production to EVs in order to meet 2032 requirements, and encourage a gradual phaseout of the production of vehicles that run on fossil fuels.</p>

<p>The incoming administration plans to weaken standards on fuel-efficiency requirements and tailpipe emissions finalized earlier this year by the US National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency, according to the sources. One of the sources said Trump is expected to formally direct those agencies to reconsider the Biden regulations.</p>

<p>The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>The move to undo Biden's vehicle-efficiency rules was first reported by Bloomberg.</p>

<p>Last week, Reuters exclusively reported that Trump's transition team is planning to kill the $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric-vehicle purchases - another move that would likely slow an already stalling US EV transition.</p>

<p>During the first Trump administration, it took nearly three years to overturn similar Obama-era regulations. After Trump called for a review of the rules in early 2017, NHTSA and the EPA began the formal process of rewriting the rules in 2018. It took until March 2020 for both agencies to finalize less-stringent rules.</p>

<p>One of the sources said the move is designed to appease automakers who have complained the Biden regulations are too onerous.</p>

<p>General Motors, Ford, Stellantis, Tesla and the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group representing most major automakers except Tesla, didn't respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>The move to target vehicle-efficiency standards could be a blow to Tesla, which has earned billions of dollars in recent years by selling credits to other automakers who can't comply with federal vehicle standards and other emissions regulations in US states and other markets around the world.</p>

<p>Because Tesla sells only electric vehicles, it overcomplies with the regulations and generates credits it can sell to others. By loosening the standards, those credits become less valuable.</p>

<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk was one of Trump's biggest backers and has become an influential adviser since the election.</p>

<p>During the Biden administration, Tesla pushed for far stricter vehicle emissions regulations than what the EPA ultimately passed.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US special envoy Amos Hochstein said in Beirut Tuesday that an end to the Israel-Hezbollah war was "now within our grasp" as he met officials to discuss a truce plan largely endorsed by Lebanon.</p>

<p>The United States and France have spearheaded efforts for a ceasefire in the war, which escalated in late September after nearly a year of deadly exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and Israeli troops.</p>

<p>Israel expanded the focus of its operations from Gaza to Lebanon, vowing to secure its northern border to allow tens of thousands of people displaced by the cross-border fire to return home.</p>

<p>Since the clashes began with Hezbollah's attacks on Israel, more than 3,544 people in Lebanon have been killed, authorities have said.</p>

<p>Most of the deaths have been since late September, among them more than 200 children, according to the United Nations.</p>

<p>After meeting with Hezbollah-allied parliament speaker Nabih Berri, who has led mediation on behalf of the group, Hochstein told reporters he saw "a real opportunity" to end the fighting.</p>

<p>"I'm here in Beirut to facilitate that decision, but it's ultimately the decision of the parties... It is now within our grasp."</p>

<p>Berri told pan-Arab daily Asharq al-Awsat after the meeting that "the situation is good, in principle", adding his team and US representatives still had "some technical details" to settle.</p>

<p>Hochstein also met Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati and army chief Joseph Aoun.</p>

<p>A Lebanon-based diplomat, requesting anonymity, said "progress" had been made in the talks.</p>

<p>A Lebanese official said Monday that the government had "a very positive view" of the truce plan.</p>

<p>But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday that Israel would continue to conduct military operations against Hezbollah even if a ceasefire was reached.</p>

<p>"We will be forced to ensure our security in the north (of Israel) and to systematically carry out operations against Hezbollah's attacks... even after a ceasefire", to keep the group from rebuilding, he told parliament.</p>

<p><strong>Deaths in Lebanon, Israel&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Hezbollah began its cross-border attacks in support of its ally Hamas following the Palestinian group's attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, which sparked the war in Gaza.</p>

<p>Hamas's attack resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.</p>

<p>The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said the death count from the resulting war had reached 43,972 people, the majority civilians. The United Nations considers the figures reliable.</p>

<p>Of 251 hostages seized during the October 7 attack, 97 remain in Gaza including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.</p>

<p>Netanyahu, in a video showing him inside Gaza and wearing a flak jacket and helmet, on Tuesday offered a $5-million reward to anyone in the territory "who brings out a hostage".</p>

<p>Since expanding its operations to Lebanon in September, Israel has conducted extensive bombing campaigns primarily targeting Hezbollah strongholds.</p>

<p>The UN said Tuesday that more than 200 children had been killed in Lebanon since Israel escalated its campaign.</p>

<p>"Despite more than 200 children killed in Lebanon in less than two months, a disconcerting pattern has emerged: their deaths are met with inertia from those able to stop this violence," said UN children's agency spokesman James Elder.</p>

<p>Israel has also sent ground troops into southern Lebanon, where it said Tuesday one soldier had been killed in combat and three wounded.</p>

<p>Lebanon's army said three soldiers were killed when Israel struck their position in south Lebanon on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Hezbollah has continued to launch rockets, drones and missiles into Israel almost daily.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Israel's military said some 40 projectiles were fired into central and northern Israel, lightly wounding four people.</p>

<p>That followed salvos on Monday that killed one woman in Shfaram and wounded 10 people there and five in Israel's commercial hub Tel Aviv.</p>

<p>Hezbollah said Tuesday it had launched "a salvo of missiles" at the Glilot military intelligence base in the Tel Aviv suburbs.</p>

<p>It said it also attacked Israeli troops in four places in south Lebanon, including near the flashpoint town of Khiam.</p>

<p>The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) later said four Ghanaian peacekeepers were wounded when a rocket, "fired most likely by non-state actors", hit their base.</p>

<p>Another base in Shamma "was impacted by five rockets", UNIFIL said, and elsewhere "an armed person directly fired at" a patrol.</p>

<p>It did not report wounded or specify who was behind those incidents.</p>

<p>Israel's military accused Hezbollah of firing on the peacekeepers.</p>

<p><strong>'Everyone's interest'&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Monday the full implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the last Hezbollah-Israel war in 2006, was "what we believe is in everyone's interest".</p>

<p>Under the resolution, Lebanese troops and UN peacekeepers should be the only armed forces deployed in south Lebanon, where Hezbollah holds sway.</p>

<p>A Lebanese official said US ambassador Lisa Johnson had discussed the truce plan last week with Mikati and Berri.</p>

<p>If an agreement was reached, he said, the United States and France would issue a joint statement, followed by a 60-day truce during which Lebanon would deploy troops in the south.</p>

<p>However, Eyal Pinko, a retired Israeli navy commander and senior research fellow at the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies at Bar Ilan University near Tel Aviv, said hopes for a speedy ceasefire were "wishful thinking".</p>

<p>"The most important thing that is required is that there will be no Hezbollah 30 to 40 kilometres (20 to 25 miles) from the border so that Israel can protect itself if there is a ground manoeuvre," Pinko said.</p>

<p>"Iran and Hezbollah would not accept that."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Delhi-based family of Harshita Brella, the 24-year-old found dead in a car boot in east London recently, have called for justice as the UK police continue to hunt for her husband as a suspect in her murder.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Delhi-based family of Harshita Brella, the 24-year-old found dead in a car boot in east London recently, have called for justice as the UK police continue to hunt for her husband as a suspect in her murder and renewed their appeal for information on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Northamptonshire Police released further CCTV images along with a timeline that identifies November 10 as the evening she was killed at her home in Corby, with the preliminary cause of death given as strangulation allegedly by 23-year-old Pankaj Lamba.</p>

<p>"Our inquiries have established that Pankaj Lamba drove a Silver Vauxhall Corsa from Corby to Ilford sometime on the morning of Monday, November 11. We suspect Harshita's body had been placed in the boot of the vehicle by Lamba before leaving Corby. Lamba then abandoned the vehicle in Brisbane Road, Ilford and made his getaway," said Detective Chief Inspector Johnny Campbell, Senior Investigating Officer from the East Midlands Special Operations Major Crime Unit (EMSOU).</p>

<p>"Any information, no matter how small, may be relevant to the investigation and help us get justice for Harshita. Specialist officers continue to provide support to Harshita's family and our thoughts are with them at this extremely difficult time as they try to come to terms with the tragic loss of their daughter and sister," he said.</p>

<p>In an interview with the BBC this week, Brella's mother Sudesh Kumari, father Sabir Brella and sister Sonia Dabas spoke through tears about losing Harshita. Northamptonshire Police had earlier launched an international manhunt for Pankaj Lamba, whom they suspect of murdering his wife earlier this month at her home in Corby before driving her body to London some 145km away and fleeing the country after abandoning the car.</p>

<p>"I want my son-in-law to be brought to justice and I want my daughter's body brought home," Satbir Brella told the BBC in Delhi.</p>

<p>He described his daughter as a simple and serious young woman who wanted to be a teacher. She had married Lamba after an arranged match last year and moved to the UK in April. According to Dabas, her sister worked in a warehouse and Lamba was a student in London.</p>

<p>"She struggled a lot because of her husband," said Dabas, adding that she had asked her sister to "quit and come to India".</p>

<p>"She was a part of me and I was a part of her. I now feel like I can't do anything in life without her," she said.</p>

<p>The family says they had last spoken to Harshita over the phone on November 10, when she told them she had made dinner and was waiting for Lamba to come home. Her phone was then switched off for the next two days and by November 13 they were worried for her safety and asked people they knew to file a complaint. Northamptonshire Police was contacted then regarding concerns for Harshita's welfare, which then led to the discovery of her body and the launch of a murder investigation.</p>

<p>"Our inquiries lead us to suspect that Harshita was murdered in Northamptonshire earlier this month by her husband Pankaj Lamba," said Chief Inspector Paul Cash.</p>

<p>"We suspect Lamba transported Harshita's body from Northamptonshire to Ilford (east London) by car. We believe he has now fled the country... More than 60 detectives are working on the case and are continuing to follow numerous lines of inquiry, including house to house, property searches, CCTV and ANPR (automatic number plate recognition)," he said.</p>

<p>According to the family, Harshita's husband had complained about her failing to make him food on time and said that she was talking to her mother too much. At the end of August, she had phoned her father in India to say she had run away because her husband was violent. The police have since confirmed that Harshita had been the subject of a domestic abuse order, which imposes restrictions on the accused against approaching or threatening the victim.</p>

<p>Her father told the BBC the family hopes her body can be brought home to India so "her soul can get peace and then maybe we will too".</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the police are continuing to appeal for any information that will help "piece together exactly what happened as we work to get justice for Harshita".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a rare visit to Gaza on Tuesday where he said Hamas shall never rule the Palestinian enclave again once the war is over. He also reaffirmed his pledge to annihilate the militant group and said that the Israeli armed forces have destroyed Hamas's military capabilities thoroughly.</p>

<p>Mr Netanyahu, seen in a battle vest and a ballistic helmet, stood at a seaside location in Gaza and recorded a video where he said "Hamas shall not return" and spoke about the Israeli hostages still in captivity.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Netanyahu said that the search for the remaining 101 Israeli hostages still missing in Gaza will continue. He even offered a $5 million reward for the return of each hostage.</p>

<p>He then went on to warn the terrorists by saying "Anyone who dares to harm our hostages will have blood on their head. We will hunt you down and get you."</p>

<p>Mr Netanyahu also said that "Whoever brings us a hostage will find a safe way. So, the choice is yours, but the result will be the same. We'll get them all back."</p>

<p>Benjamin Netanyahu was visiting Gaza to get a first-hand briefing of operational activities on ground by Israel's military. The Defence Minister and Army chief had accompanied him.</p>

<p>Hamas's 2023 attack on Israel marked the country's bloodiest day in its history, with 1,200 people killed and over 250 taken hostage. The attack, which triggered the over-year-long war so far, saw Israel respond with its most destructive offensive in Gaza ever, killing nearly 44,000 people and wounding 103,898, according to the Gaza health ministry, and turning the Strip into a wasteland of rubble with millions desperate for food, fuel, water and sanitation.</p>

<p>Israel, which has since the beginning of the war, targeted and killed several top Hamas leaders, has vowed to destroy the group entirely. While Israel and its Western allies have declared Hamas a terrorist group, Lebanon-based Hezbollah and Iran have been supporting it in its activities.</p>

<p>Hamas's supporters regard them as heroes leading the fight for Palestinian statehood, which had drifted off the international agenda.<br />

<p>US President-elect Donald Trump nominated Howard Lutnick, the co-chair of his transition team, as his commerce secretary on Tuesday -- a choice set to bring a tougher stance on China from the incoming administration.</p>

<p>Lutnick will also lead the country's tariff and trade agenda, with "additional direct responsibility for the Office of the United States Trade Representative," Trump said in a statement.</p>

<p>Tariffs are a key part of Trump's economic agenda and he has promised sweeping duties on all imports when he returns to the White House.</p>

<p>Lutnick is chief executive of financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald and a Trump ally originally tipped as a front-runner for treasury secretary.</p>

<p>But he was instead named to helm Commerce, a smaller department that works to boost American industry and has a key role in policy to shore up the US semiconductor sector and reduce reliance on Asia.</p>

<p>Under President Joe Biden, the Commerce Department stepped up export controls on critical technologies like quantum computing and semiconductor manufacturing goods, taking aim at access by adversaries like Beijing.</p>

<p>Trump's administration could harden this stance.</p>

<p>Lutnick has expressed support for a tariff level of 60 percent on Chinese goods alongside a 10 percent tariff on all other imports.</p>

<p>Both are among proposals that Trump has floated, with the Republican taking aim at countries which have been "ripping us off for years."</p>

<p>In Trump's first term he engaged in a tariffs war with China, with the US Trade Representative's office issuing duties on imports from the world's second-biggest economy.</p>

<p>Lutnick also previously lamented the loss of manufacturing jobs in the United States and offshoring to China.</p>

<p>"I'm all in with Donald Trump," Lutnick told podcaster Anthony Pompliano last month.</p>

<p>In the same interview, he slammed electric cars as "coastal elite nonsense" and blamed China for being the source of fentanyl in the United States.</p>

<p>The deadly drug, many times more powerful than heroin, is responsible for tens of thousands of overdose deaths a year.</p>

<p>"China is attacking America from its guts," he charged.</p>

<p><strong>Crypto support</strong></p>

<p>Lutnick was initially tipped to head the Treasury Department but a tussle over the position spilled into the public eye last weekend.</p>

<p>Trump's health secretary pick Robert F. Kennedy Jr. expressed support for Lutnick, saying on social media that "Bitcoin will have no stronger advocate" than him.</p>

<p>The world's richest man Elon Musk also threw his support behind Lutnick for Treasury chief while calling the other top contender, hedge fund manager Scott Bessent, "a business-as-usual choice."</p>

<p>"Business-as-usual is driving America bankrupt, so we need change one way or another," said Musk, who Trump has tapped to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency.</p>

<p>Lutnick recalls losing hundreds of employees in the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center, a tragedy narrowly he avoided as he was taking his son to school.</p>

<p>Besides Cantor Fitzgerald, Lutnick heads financial technology firm BGC Group and real estate services firm Newmark Group.</p>

<p>He graduated from Haverford College and has a degree in economics, according to his biography on Cantor's website.</p>

<p>As co-chair of Trump's transition team, Lutnick has been identifying new hires for the president-elect's administration.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi starts a two-day visit on Tuesday to Guyana, the energy-rich nation with strong historic cultural links with India through a large community.</p>

<p>He will co-chair the India-CARICOM summit with 14 nations participating, underscoring India's role as the voice of the Global South that supports the political and economic aspirations of those countries.</p>

<p>"India is an important global actor. Our Member States are keen to meet Prime Minister Modi and develop deeper technical relationships, deepen the relationship in terms of advocacy for small states in the international arena, and strengthen people-to-people ties," CARICOM Assistant Secretary-General Elizabeth Solomon was quoted as saying by Antigua Newsroom.</p>

<p>PM Modi said in a statement previewing the visit that he will pay his respects to one of the oldest Indian community, who migrated more than 185 years ago.</p>

<p>"We will exchange views on giving strategic direction to our unique relationship, which is based on shared heritage, culture and values," he said.</p>

<p>Guyana's Vice President Bharrat Jagdeo said, "The visit underlines the historically strong relations between India and Guyana."</p>

<p>The 2nd India-CARICOM Summit will be co-chaired on Wednesday by Guyana's President Mohamed Irfaan Ali and Grenada's Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell.</p>

<p>CARICOM is the group of the Caribbean countries and the first summit was held in 2019 on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly where India offered a $150 million credit line for climate change and renewable energy projects.</p>

<p>Beyond the cultural links, PM Modi will be looking to Guyana for India's energy security as the small Caribbean country is emerging as a potential major petroleum and gas power.</p>

<p>According to the US Energy Information Agency, the estimate of Guyana's oil and natural gas resources is more than 11 billion oil-equivalent barrels, which is more than three times Kuwait's.</p>

<p>The discovery of the oil reserves, most of which are offshore, has spurred interest in the country by many countries and multinationals.</p>

<p>Guyana could play a role in India's quest to diversify its energy sources.</p>

<p>People of Indian descent make up 39.8 per cent of the population of the multi-ethnic country, with Hindus at 28.4 per cent of the largest religious community.</p>

<p>The Indo-Guyanese are the descendants of the people brought over by the British Raj starting in 1838 as indentured labourers to work on sugar plantations or those who came over as traders or to work in other occupations.</p>

<p>According to Jaggdeo, PM Modi will visit the Indian Arrival Monument which commemorates the arrival of the first ship carrying Indian indentured labourers to the Caribbean in 1838.</p>

<p>PM Modi will address Guyana's Parliament and speak to the Indian community and the community.</p>

<p>Ali visited India last year as the chief guest at the Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas.</p>

<p>PM Modi will be the first Indian prime minister to visit the country since Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's visit in 1968.</p>

<p>India has provided assistance to Guyana with several projects, including $25 million National Cricket Stadium which was the venue for the T20 World Cup Cricket this year.</p>

<p>India has also helped set up of a Centre of Excellence in Information Technology (CEIT).</p>

<p>The trade between the two countries was $223.36 million in 2021-22, with Guyana's exports amounting to $156.96 million, boosted by energy products.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first time G20 leaders took their photo together at a summit in Rio they forgot Joe Biden. On Tuesday they had a reshoot -- with the outgoing US president firmly back in the frame.</p>

<p>Biden, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni all missed the photo on Monday due to what US officials called "logistical issues."</p>

<p>No one was taking any chances the second time around.</p>

<p>This time Biden, attending his final G20 summit ahead of Donald Trump's return to the White House on January 20, was given a spot near the middle of the front row of the assembled world leaders.</p>

<p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi grabbed Biden's hand as the US leader stepped onto the stage. Trudeau, who was next to him, chatted with Biden and pointed at him at one moment.</p>

<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping entered the cavernous room at a Rio art museum where the leaders were gathered just over a minute later and took his place.</p>

<p>When it was all over the leaders clapped and held hands.</p>

<p>The fulsome show of unity could not have contrasted more starkly with the farcical scenes when Biden missed out on the photo a day earlier.</p>

<p>Biden had been spotted walking through some palm trees towards the photo-op on the Brazilian city's stunning bayside on Monday -- but the other leaders were already dispersing after the picture was snapped.</p>

<p>His no-show had seemed to symbolize the 81-year-old's waning influence as the world looks towards a second Trump presidency following the Republican's sweeping US election win.</p>

<p>Throughout a six-day swing through South America, Biden has been making a last pitch for global support on issues from Ukraine and the Middle East to climate change.</p>

<p>But his counterparts have often seemed to have their eyes on January, with Xi saying after meeting Biden in Lima last week that he would work for a "smooth transition" with Trump.</p>

<p>Biden has also kept a low media profile and has not taken questions from the media during his trip, despite major developments such as his granting of approval for Ukraine to use long-range US-made missiles to hit Russia.</p>

<p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov -- attending in place of President Vladimir Putin, who faces an International Criminal Court warrant over the war in Ukraine -- was in the photo on Monday but not on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Lavrov said earlier Tuesday that Kyiv's first strikes with the missiles marked a "new phase" -- while also urging the West to read a decree signed by Putin that lowers the threshold for Russian use of nuclear weapons.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

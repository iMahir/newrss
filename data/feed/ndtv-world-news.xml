<p><em>(This is the second article in a two-part series on the US-China semiconductor battle, and where India stands in it. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/opinion/china-is-eating-away-at-uss-tech-reign-chip-by-chip-6481939">Here is the first part</a>)</em></p>

<p>When Chandrayaan 3 landed on the moon on August 23 last year, there was one place in Mohali that was particularly jubilant: the government-run Semiconductor Laboratory (SCL). It was a personal win for SCL's engineers, the unsung heroes who for months worked on producing a wide variety of semiconductors critical for controlling and commanding the mission. The spacecraft used chips to enable communication with Earth and navigate its way to the landing destination, using sensors and cameras to transmit data and messages.</p>

<p>Mohali's SCL is India's only well-known chip-making foundry. It began production in 1984, three years before the world's biggest semiconductor manufacturing company, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), was founded.</p>

<p>Today, however, while TSMC produces 90% of the world's most sophisticated and advanced semiconductors or microchips, churning out the most valued 5-nanometer (nm) chips in size, SCL can make only legacy chips of 100 nm and above, which are obviously many generations old. TSMC's annual turnover exceeded $70 billion last year, far more than the SCL's meagre $5 million. And while TSMC's clients are some of the world's leading tech firms, such as Apple, AMD and Nvidia, among SCL's top clients is just ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation). TSMC's factories are state-of-the-art; SCL is in dire need of modernisation and upgradation.</p>

<h2><strong>India's Tough Luck</strong></h2>

<p>SCL could have been TSMC's largest rival if it were not for one very unfortunate incident, which pushed India back to the semiconductor dark ages. On February 27, 1989, a mysterious fire broke out in the plant, destroying most of the facilities. To date, no one knows if it was an act of sabotage or an accident. The factory later rose from the ashes, but by then, it was left far behind in the race.</p>

<p>Dan Hutcheson of Canada's TechInsights company, one of the industry's global voices, surprised me when he said he had been monitoring the Indian chip industry since the 1970s. "I have seen India strive for this industry my entire career. There have been only failures. It is important for India to be successful now." Dan is not wrong, as India's semiconductor history is made up of a series of broken dreams and unfulfilled promises. Several multinational companies tried their luck in setting up chip production projects, but they did not materialise for various reasons.</p>

<h2><strong>Micron Project, A Sign Of Good Things To Come</strong></h2>

<p>It took India over three decades after the 1989 tragedy to see a positive development in its semiconductor journey. In August last year, a groundbreaking ceremony was held in Sanand, Gujarat, for Micron Technology's state-of-the-art semiconductor assembly, testing, and packaging facility. Its bosses claim the facility will be operational early next year. The plant will be completed in two phases at a cost of $2.75 billion – $825 million being invested by Micron, and the rest by the Centre and the Gujarat government.</p>

<p>The Micron project appears to be the beginning of the country's bright chip future. Since the groundbreaking ceremony&nbsp;last year, four new projects have been announced, the latest on Monday when the government said it&nbsp;cleared a proposal of Kaynes Semicon to set up a semiconductor unit in Sanand. All the new units, except Tata Electronics' fab unit in Dholera in Gujarat are testing and packaging&nbsp;units. Taiwain's Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (PSMC) and Tata Electronics announced in&nbsp;February this year that they will set up a fabrication unit in Dholera. I am sure the government will be more keen to see the progress of this project because it's India's first fab unit in the private sector. Neither company in their press statements have&nbsp;given a completion date or the costs involved but according to media&nbsp;reports, the total project will cost Rs 91,000 crore.</p>

<p>India have witnessed several false dawns in the last few decades, but now things appear to be changing, and at a fast speed. There was a time when India could not even dream of producing sophisticated smartphones. That was a domain exclusively captured by China. Today, India is a manufacturing hub for iPhones and other smartphone brands. Citing this success story, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said last year, “We have successfully made India a manufacturing hub for mobile phones over the last decade. Now, our next goal is to position the country as a leader in semiconductor manufacturing.”</p>

<h2><strong>India Is Established In Just One Segment&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>A semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem requires infrastructure for designing, fabrication, research, testing, and packaging. Besides, it needs sophisticated tools, minerals, and gases to make chips. While India severely lacks large-scale semiconductor fabrication facilities, it has built a robust ecosystem for chip design and related services. Major global semiconductor companies such as Intel, Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, NVIDIA, AMD and Broadcom have established significant design and R&amp;D centres in India. Indian engineers contribute to the design of the most complex chips used in cutting-edge technologies, from artificial intelligence to 5G networks. Companies like Wipro, Tata Elxsi, and HCL Technologies also provide outsourced semiconductor design services, catering to global clients.</p>

<h2><strong>"Learn To Walk Before You Can Run"</strong></h2>

<p>Now, the Modi government wants India to become a fabrication, R&amp;D, testing, and packaging hub. A tall order indeed, considering India is only at the beginning of the chip race — but not an impossible one. I have spoken to several industry experts worldwide over the last two years, and they believe India can become a semiconductor hub and a global player in 10-20 years if it stays as focused, patient, and committed as the Modi government appears to be today.</p>

<p>To put India's efforts in perspective, we ought to remember that it took semiconductor superpowers Taiwan and South Korea decades to reach where they are in the race today. "Realistically, it'll take 10 to 20 years, assuming it is well-executed. You have to learn to walk before you can run. That's the important thing – to make sure the Micron project is successful," says Hutcheson, who calls the Micron packaging project "a great baby step”. To be sure, South Korea, Taiwan, and China all started with packaging units.</p>

<h2><strong>India's Challenges</strong></h2>

<p>Chip fabrication, which allows for the production of 5 nm or even 2 nm microchips, is widely believed to be the key to the success of a semiconductor mission. A host of things are needed before manufacturing can start 10-15 years later. This is not a simple industry; it requires a lot of work and high-end equipment and materials.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>1. Investment</strong></h2>

<p>According to the Semiconductor Industry Association estimates, a state-of-the-art manufacturing factory takes a minimum of 10 years to produce chips. The initial capital investment and operating costs can run up to anywhere between $10 billion and $40 billion. If India dreams of being a chi hub, it will have to invest hugely in the sector in the next 10-15 years. China has been doing just that, pouring billions of dollars into becoming self-reliant in semiconductor manufacturing. The US has pumped in over $100 billion in its own industry since 2022. Against these stark figures, India has managed to inject just about $15 billion into its semiconductor project.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What India badly needs is private investors and global players.</p>

<h2><strong>2. Gases and Mineral Shortages</strong></h2>

<p>Semiconductor chip manufacturing essentially uses more than 150 types of chemicals and over 30 types of gases and minerals. At present, all these are available only in a few countries. The challenge for India is to be self-reliant in this sector.</p>

<h2><strong>3. Supporting Industries</strong></h2>

<p>Some experts believe that the main task for India is to create supporting industries for the chip industry to emerge. The issue relates to some basic things, like having a stable power grid and consistent water availability, which make it possible to build the semiconductor industry.</p>

<h2><strong>4. Political Will</strong></h2>

<p>The chip industry is capital-intensive and time-consuming, which requires deep commitment from the government and private players alike. It requires the willpower of successive governments to stay in the game. PM Modi wants India to be a developed economy by 2047. A long-term semiconductor strategy will be needed if India really is to become a developed country by 2047.</p>

<h2><strong>5. Skilled Manpower</strong></h2>

<p>India has manpower in abundance, but it has a shortage of the kind of skilled manpower needed in the semiconductor industry.</p>

<h2><strong>6. Brain Drain</strong></h2>

<p>India could achieve its goal of becoming a semiconductor hub in around five to six years rather than the conventional 10-20 year timeframe if we manage to bring big Indian talent, serving global companies, back home. Can we entice them with equivalent salary packages and perks? Can nation-building be a motivator? Can we improve our work culture to make it more professional and productive?</p>

<p>Taiwan's success story owes a lot to the Taiwanese-origin executives who obtained their semiconductor expertise and experiences in the US. The Taiwanese government in the 1980s decided to bring its talented people back to kickstart the semiconductor industry. It paid them salaries on a par with Western companies. These expat Taiwanese played a huge role in making Taiwan a truly global chip hub.</p>

<p>South Korea's chip revolution also started after the government enticed many Korean experts working in Japanese companies to come back and work in Korea.</p>

<p>There is no dearth of Indians who are doing well in the semiconductor business in the US and elsewhere. Around a dozen leaders of the world's leading chip-making companies are either Indian or of Indian origin. I have met a couple. They all love India. But India needs to create the right conditions to bring them back, and also stop the brain drain of young engineering graduates who are in high demand abroad.</p>

<h2><strong>A New Dawn</strong></h2>

<p>India is on the cusp of sealing deals with several multinational companies to launch new projects. The Modi government has recognised the fact that if India needs to be a big geopolitical player, it needs to be the leading light in the semiconductor arena. What follows after the Micron factory will determine the future of India's semiconductor industry.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs has predicted the potential economic implications of a Republican or Democratic victory in the November 5 presidential elections in the US. It claimed the country's GDP may face a hit if Donald Trump secures a second term in the White House, reported Reuters.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In a note on Tuesday, economists at the investment bank stated that the economic growth of the US would likely witness the biggest boost in the coming two years from a Democratic government, headed by Kamala Harris, Reuters reported.<br />
<br />
The economic output would take a hit next year, majorly from the increased tariffs on imports as well as tighter immigration policies, if the Republican Party comes to power, even with a divided government led by the former US president, they said.<br />
<br />
As per Goldman Sachs, there will be more job growth in the US under a Democrat government than the Republicans.<br />
<br />
If Trump sweeps the polls or even manages to form a divided government, in that case, "the hit to growth from tariffs and tighter immigration policy would outweigh the positive fiscal impulse, resulting in a peak hit to GDP growth of -0.5pp in 2025H2 that abates in 2026," it said.<br />
<br />
If Democrats get another term then the new spending and expanded middle-income tax credits will slightly be more than the "offset lower investment due to higher corporate tax rates", the Wall Street behemoth believes.<br />
<br />
This will result in a "very slight boost to GDP investment due to higher corporate tax rates." Ultimately, this will give a little boost to GDP growth on average over 2025-2026.<br />
<br />
"If Democrats sweep, new spending and expanded middle-income tax credits would slightly more than offset lower investment due to higher corporate tax rates, resulting in a very slight boost to GDP investment due to higher corporate tax rates, resulting in a very slight boost to GDP growth on average over 2025-2026," the news agency quoted the note from the company.<br />
<br />
If Harris wins, the job growth will be 10,000 a month higher compared with Trump's win with a divided government, and it will be 30,000 higher in comparison with a sweep by the Republicans, as per Goldman estimates.<br />
<br />
The US' core inflation is likely to rise as a Trump win may lead to increased tariffs on auto imports from China, Mexico and the European Union, it added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chief Adviser to Bangladesh's interim government, Muhammad Yunus, has said the issue of attacks on minority Hindus in his country is “exaggerated” and questioned the manner in which India projected it.</p>

<p>In an interview with PTI at his official residence here, Yunus said the attacks on minorities in Bangladesh are more political than communal.</p>

<p>He suggested that the attacks were not communal, but a fallout of a political upheaval as there is a perception that most Hindus supported the now-deposed Awami League regime.</p>

<p>“I have said this to (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi also that this is exaggerated. This issue has several dimensions. When the country went through an upheaval following the atrocities by (Sheikh) Hasina and the Awami League, those who were with them also faced attacks,” the Nobel laureate told PTI.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/muhammad-yunus-advice-to-sheikh-hasina-stay-silent-in-india-till-6494885"><strong>Read: "Stay Silent In India Till...": Muhammad Yunus' Advice To Sheikh Hasina</strong></a></p>

<p>The minority Hindu population faced vandalism of their businesses and properties, as well as the destruction of Hindu temples, during the student-led violence that erupted following the ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.</p>

<p>After unprecedented anti-government protests that peaked on August 5, Hasina resigned as prime minister and fled to India.</p>

<p>“Now, while beating up Awami League cadres, they had beaten up Hindus as there is a perception that Hindus in Bangladesh mean Awami League supporters. I am not saying that what has happened is right, but some people are using it as an excuse to seize property. So, there is no clear distinction between Awami League supporters and Hindus,” he said.</p>

<p>In his first direct contact with New Delhi last month, shortly after becoming the head of Bangladesh's interim government, Yunus conveyed to Prime Minister Modi that Dhaka would prioritise the protection and safety of Hindus and all other minority groups.</p>

<p>During the conversation, Modi reaffirmed India's support for a democratic, stable, peaceful, and progressive Bangladesh and emphasised the importance of ensuring the safety of Hindus and other minority communities in the violence-hit country.</p>

<p>Hindus, who made up 22 per cent of Bangladesh's population at the time of the 1971 Liberation War, now constitute about 8 per cent of 170 million and have predominantly supported the Awami League, known for its secular stance.</p>

<p>Describing the attacks as more political than communal, Yunus questioned the manner in which India is “propagating” them.</p>

<p>“These attacks are political in nature and not communal. And India is propagating these incidents in a big way. We have not said that we can't do anything; we have said that we are doing everything,” the Chief Adviser said.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi, in his Independence Day address from the Red Fort on August 15, expressed hope that the situation in violence-hit Bangladesh would return to normal soon and said 1.4 billion Indians are concerned about the safety of Hindus and minorities in the neighbouring country.</p>

<p>Discussing the future of India-Bangladesh relations, Yunus expressed a desire for good ties with India but insisted that New Delhi must abandon the narrative that Bangladesh will turn into another Afghanistan without Sheikh Hasina at the helm.</p>

<p>“The way forward is for India to come out of the narrative. The narrative is that everybody is Islamist, BNP is Islamist, and everyone else is Islamist and will make this country into Afghanistan. And Bangladesh is in safe hands with Sheikh Hasina at the helm only.</p>

<p>“India is captivated by this narrative. India needs to come out of this narrative. Bangladesh, like any other nation, is just another neighbour,” he said.</p>

<p>The noted economist added, “The issue of trying to portray the conditions of minorities in such a big way is just an excuse.” Yunus said that when he met leaders of the minority community, he urged them to protest as citizens of the country with equal rights and not merely as Hindus.</p>

<p>“Even when I met members of the Hindu community, I had requested them: please don't identify yourselves as Hindus; rather, you should say you are citizens of this country and you have equal rights. If someone tries to snatch your legal rights as citizens, then there are remedies,” he said.</p>

<p>The Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council (BHBCUC), a prominent Hindu minority group in Bangladesh, had also reported attacks on minorities, especially Hindus, following the fall of Sheikh Hasina's government on August 5.</p>

<p>Thousands of Hindus staged protest rallies in Bangladesh's capital and the northeastern port city of Chattogram on August 10-11, demanding protection amid nationwide vandalism that saw attacks on temples and their homes and businesses.</p>

<p>Earlier in August, the Bangladesh National Hindu Grand Alliance said that the minority Hindu community faced attacks and threats in 278 locations across 48 districts since the fall of the Hasina-led government and termed it as an “assault on the Hindu religion.”&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Muhammad Yunus, the head of Bangladesh's interim government, has said that former prime minister Sheikh Hasina making political remarks from India is an “unfriendly gesture", asserting that she must remain silent to prevent the discomfort to both countries until Dhaka requests her extradition.</p>

<p>"If India wants to keep her until the time Bangladesh (government) wants her back, the condition would be that she has to keep quiet," he said.</p>

<p>In an interview with PTI at his official residence in Dhaka, Yunus, who was appointed the country's Chief Advisor after Hasina's ouster, stressed that while Bangladesh values strong ties with India, New Delhi must move “beyond the narrative that portrays every other political party except Awami League as Islamist and that the country will turn into Afghanistan without Sheikh Hasina.” "No one is comfortable with her stance there in India because we want her back to try her. She is there in India and at times she is talking, which is problematic. Had she been quiet, we would have forgotten it; people would have also forgotten it as she would have been in her own world. But sitting in India, she is speaking and giving instructions. No one likes it,” he said.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/bangladesh-amends-law-scrapping-special-security-for-sheikh-hasina-family-6447607"><strong>Read: Bangladesh Amends Law Scrapping Special Security For Sheikh Hasina, Family</strong></a></p>

<p>Yunus was apparently referring to Hasina's statement on August 13 in which she demanded "justice", saying those involved in recent "terror acts", killings and vandalism must be investigated, identified and punished.</p>

<p>“It is not good for us or for India. There is discomfort regarding it,” he told PTI.</p>

<p>Following unprecedented anti-government protests that peaked on August 5, Hasina resigned as prime minister and fled to India. Her presence in India for nearly four weeks has fuelled speculation in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>When asked whether Bangladesh has communicated its stance to India, Yunus said it has been conveyed verbally and quite firmly that she should keep quiet.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/bangladesh-violence-quota-protests-5-more-murder-cases-filed-against-sheikh-hasina-total-cases-now-71-report-6430267"><strong>Read: 5 More Murder Cases Against Sheikh Hasina, Total Count Now 71: Report</strong></a></p>

<p>“Everyone understands it. We have said quite firmly that she should keep quiet. This is an unfriendly gesture towards us; she has been given shelter there and she is campaigning from there. It is not that she has gone there on a normal course. She has fled following a people's uprising and public anger,” he said.</p>

<p>Yunus stated that the interim government is committed to ensuring justice for the people of Bangladesh against the atrocities, and justice requires that she be brought back to the country.</p>

<p>“Yes, she has to be brought back or else the people of Bangladesh won't be at peace. The kind of atrocities she has committed, she has to be tried in front of everyone here,” he emphasised.</p>

<p>Discussing the future of the India-Bangladesh relationship, Yunus expressed a desire for good ties with India but insisted that New Delhi must abandon the narrative that only Hasina's leadership ensures the country's stability.</p>

<p>“The way forward is for India to come out of the narrative. The narrative is that everybody is Islamist, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) is Islamist, and everyone else is Islamist and will make this country into Afghanistan. And Bangladesh is in safe hands with Sheikh Hasina at the helm only. India is captivated by this narrative. India has to come out of this narrative. Bangladesh, like any other nation, is another neighbour,” he said.</p>

<p>Referring to the recent incidents of alleged attacks on Hindu minorities in the country and India raising concerns about it, Yunus said this is just an excuse.</p>

<p>“The issue of trying to portray the conditions of minorities in such a big way is just an excuse,” he said.</p>

<p>The minority Hindu population has faced vandalism of their businesses and properties, as well as the destruction of Hindu temples, during the student-led violence that erupted following the ouster of Hasina.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his Independence Day address from the ramparts of the Red Fort on August 15, expressed hope that the situation in violence-hit Bangladesh would return to normal soon and stated that 1.4 billion Indians are concerned about the safety of Hindus and minorities in the neighbouring country.</p>

<p>The 84-year-old Nobel laureate emphasised the need for India and Bangladesh to work together to improve their currently strained relationship.</p>

<p>When asked about ways to improve the Indo-Bangla relations, Yunus said both the countries need to work together and it is on a downhill presently.</p>

<p>“We need to work together to improve this relationship, which is now at a low,” he said.</p>

<p>Speaking about the future of bilateral treaties with India, Yunus said there are demands for a relook at certain treaties such as transit and the Adani electricity deal.</p>

<p>“Everybody is saying that it is needed. We will see what is on paper and, second, what is actually happening on the ground. I can't answer it specifically. If there is any need to review, we will then raise questions about it,” he said.</p>

<p>The BNP has said if voted to power, it will review and re-evaluate the “questionable” Adani electricity deal signed during the Awami League regime, as it is putting “tremendous pressure” on the people of Bangladesh.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping today pledged to step up China's support across the debt-distressed African continent with funding of nearly $51 billion, backing for more infrastructure initiatives and a promise to create at least 1 million jobs.</p>

<p>The commitments were made at the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Summit in Beijing.</p>

<p>Beijing, the world's biggest two-way lender, also promised to carry out three times as many infrastructure projects across resource-rich Africa, despite Xi's new preference for "small and beautiful" schemes based around selling advanced and green technologies in which Chinese firms have invested heavily.</p>

<p>"China is ready to deepen cooperation with Africa in industry, agriculture, infrastructure, trade and investment," Xi told delegates from more than 50 African nations gathered in Beijing for the ninth meeting of the three yearly forum.</p>

<p>After the opening ceremony, delegates adopted the Beijing Declaration to build an "all-weather China-Africa community with a shared future in the new era," as well as the Beijing Action Plan for 2025-2027, China's state media said.</p>

<p>Xi also called for "a China-Africa network featuring land-sea links and co-ordinated development," as he told Chinese contractors to return to the one-billion-strong continent, after the lifting of COVID-19 curbs that disrupted its projects.</p>

<p>"China and Africa account for one-third of the world population. Without our modernisation, there will be no global modernisation," Xi told the summit.</p>

<p>The Chinese leader committed 360 billion yuan ($50.70 billion) in financial assistance, but specified that 210 billion would be disbursed through credit lines and at least 70 billion in fresh investment by Chinese companies, with smaller amounts provided through military aid and other projects.</p>

<p>At the 2021 China-Africa summit in Dakar, China promised at least $10 billion in investment and the same again in credit lines. This time, the financial assistance would be in yuan, in an apparent push to further internationalise the Chinese yuan.</p>

<p>Xi did not mention debt in his speech, despite Beijing being many African states' biggest bilateral lender, but the Action Plan for 2024-2027 included terms for repayment postponements and called for the establishment of an African rating agency to bring about "a new rating culture".</p>

<p>United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres told the summit African countries' inadequate access to debt relief and scarce resources was a recipe for social unrest, while proposing fresh reforms to the international financial architecture.</p>

<p><strong>SHARED FUTURE OR DEBT DIPLOMACY?</strong></p>

<p>The Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Summit chalks out a three-year programme for China and every African state bar Eswatini, which retains ties to Taiwan.</p>

<p>In addition to 30 infrastructure connectivity projects, Xi said, "China is ready to launch 30 clean energy projects in Africa," offering to co-operate on nuclear technology and tackle a power deficit that has delayed industrialisation efforts.</p>

<p>But the Chinese leader did not reiterate his pledge at the 2021 forum in Dakar for the Asian giant to buy $300 billion worth of African goods, pledging only to unilaterally expand market access.</p>

<p>Analysts say Beijing's phytosanitary rules for market access are too strict, making China unable to meet that promise.</p>

<p>But Africa continues to receive more Chinese financing instead. Last year, China approved loans worth $4.61 billion to Africa, in the first annual increase since 2016.</p>

<p>"I'm here to see how best we can foster our relationship with China," Princess Dugba, Sierra Leone's fisheries and marine resources minister, said to the summit's sidelines.</p>

<p>"China is getting us a fish harbour, which is one of the first of its kind," she added.</p>

<p>Xi Jinping also said China was "ready to assist in the development of the African Continental Free Trade Area, and deepen logistics and financial co-operation for the benefit of trans-regional development in Africa."</p>

<p>China has been accused of having "hidden agendas" in its "debt diplomacy". Nations dealing with China have often faced the dangers of unaffordable debt via unsustainable financing, which, as highlighted by India at the United Nations, leads to a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/indias-vicious-cycle-of-debt-traps-warning-at-un-meet-presided-by-china-4594233" target="_blank">"vicious cycle of debt traps"</a>.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Black Myth: Wukong has sold 18 million copies in two weeks - one of the fastest starts the global gaming industry has seen. That record pace has in turn minted millions for its earliest and biggest investor.</p>

<p>Wukong was a leap of faith for Daniel Wu, whose little-known Hero Games is the biggest external shareholder in creator Game Science. His startup stuck with its partner through years of flops and contributed a large chunk of the blockbuster title's $70 million budget over six years of development, an unheard-of undertaking for a Chinese project.</p>

<p>It paid off big time. The action game based on the legend of the Monkey King has outsold industry icons such as Elden Ring and Zelda, at least in its initial spurt. It can reach 30 million sales over its lifetime, augmented with an expansion to come, Wu told Bloomberg News.</p>

<p>China's biggest PC creation emerged from a creative team whose biggest claim to fame before this summer was a visit from Apple Inc.'s Tim Cook. Wu, who escorted the iPhone boss around Hero's Shanghai offices in 2017, said one of its early collaborations with Game Science caught Cook's eye - though that project ultimately tanked. It took another four years before Tencent Holdings Ltd. invested in Hero's investee, after a tantalizing Wukong trailer.</p>

<p>Today, Game Science is worth several billion yuan, Wu said, marking a return of several-fold on his studio's 20% stake. Hero Games had paid just 60 million yuan ($8.5 million) for its slice in 2017. Both startups find themselves unexpectedly in the spotlight, hailed for finally showing China is capable of producing a big-budget title on par with the best of the West.</p>

<p>"If you want to hear the truth, Game Science's success today is built upon its four failures in a row," the 36-year-old Wu said in an exclusive interview from his Beijing office. "Wukong proves not only that we have top-notch game-making capabilities, but also we can tell a good story with Chinese elements."</p>

<p>For Wu, who gave up a career as a startup financier to immerse himself in games close to a decade ago, Wukong is much more than just a groundbreaking game. He and Game Science co-founder Feng Ji, five years his elder, tied their fortunes to the success of a title built for consoles and PCs, in a country dominated by mobile entertainment.</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-09/hp0nh4oc_hero-games-office-bloomberg_625x300_05_September_24.jpg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>

<p>Since its release on Aug. 20, the game has broken several records for single-player titles, eclipsing the likes of Cyberpunk 2077 with runaway popularity at home in China. It's estimated to have earned $700 million so far, overshadowed only by Call of Duty's historic $1 billion in 10 days, according to Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad. He sees overseas sales accounting for a larger share going forward as the game's global renown grows.</p>

<p>Wukong got a lift from state media lauding its faithful depiction of historic and cultural sites, but success came only after Wu and Feng risked everything to realize the project.</p>

<p>"We were two drowning rats," Wu, whose company is still not profitable, said of himself and Feng. "Neither of us was afraid of failure, and he already knew his next step. The only thing is that he needed me to place even bigger bets."</p>

<p>Game Science had struck out with its three prior efforts, which were more modest free-to-play mobile games chasing attention in the world's biggest games arena. One of them, Art of War: Red Tides, even got prime placement on the iOS App Store after Cook's visit, but to no avail.</p>

<p>As the sole investor and publishing partner of Game Science, Hero Games took significant losses, but Wu didn't shy away in 2018 when Feng, now his late-night League of Legends teammate, reached out for more money to craft an ambitious project then codenamed Black Myth One.</p>

<p>It won't take another six years for the next chapter in what's planned to be a series based on Chinese mythology - though that won't be a sequel, Wu said. Game Science is working on an expansion to Wukong, which will give it a chance to monetize the game a second time. 2022's Elden Ring, a title with similar play style and design, has shown how the release of an expansion - this year's Shadow of the Erdtree - can spur a fresh flurry of sales for the original.</p>

<p>Wu co-founded Hero Games in 2015 after a three-year stint with famed Chinese venture firm ZhenFund. He zeroed in on Feng and his Game Science team early on, describing them as an asset he couldn't afford to miss out on. At Tencent, Feng had led a team of 250 people on the development of online role-playing game Asura, inspired by similar folklore to Wukong. The title launched in 2010 and initially won praise for its design, though it later upset players with practices around its in-game shop that were deemed exploitative.</p>

<p>Hero Games, which orchestrated a marketing blitz around Wukong that included Luckin Coffee giveaways, also drew criticism outside of China for its guidance to streamers playing Wukong to not discuss "feminist propaganda," politics or Covid-19. Wu declined to comment on the matter.</p>

<p>The 2,000-person Hero Games team, even with that huge winning bet in its portfolio, isn't making a profit. Wu's company is on a yearslong transition from publisher to developer, and it's facing the same challenges that Game Science ran into when trying to score a mobile hit. Until it breaks through, Wu's message to staff this year will be to learn to embrace the death of your project.</p>

<p>"This is the most gruesome year for China's games industry ever," Wu said, noting the large number of unsuccessful games that few will ever see or hear about. The country's economic difficulties have cut into entertainment spending and forced many studios to reconsider or abandon projects.</p>

<p>That makes the triumph of Wukong all the sweeter. Wu expects it will fire up passions and interest to create more games based China's rich history and culture - and more courage to build for consoles.</p>

<p>When Wu encountered the first big fight in Wukong on his PlayStation 5, he texted Feng to say he was welling up.</p>

<p>"How dare you cry without me?" Feng texted him back.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 14-year-old Georgia school shooter, who killed two fellow students and two teachers on Wednesday, attempted to re-enter his algebra class after leaving it at the beginning of the period. He was denied entry by a classmate, who saw he had a gun, reported <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/us/live-news/apalachee-high-school-shooting-georgia-09-04-24/index.html">CNN</a>.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Colt Gray left the room and returned as the class neared its end, asking to be let back in, recounted Lyela Sayarath, a junior who sat beside Gray. Due to the school's security protocol, the classroom doors automatically locked once closed, meaning someone from inside had to manually allow him back in.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
However, a peer noticed that Gray was in possession of a gun and refused to open the door. Gray then opened fire in another classroom. Moments later, a round of gunshots inside the school left four dead and nine injured.<br />
<br />
“They almost let him in, but I'm pretty sure she saw that he had a gun and so she backed away,” Ms Sayarath said. “And then he turned away and that's when you hear like the first round of fire.”<br />
<br />
Lyela Sayarath and her classmates instinctively dropped to the floor, piling desks in front of them and trying to shield themselves. Their teacher turned off the lights.<br />
<br />
First responders arrived at the scene quickly, and Gray was taken into custody just minutes after the shooting began. He was armed with an AR-15, a semi-automatic rifle.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Ms Sayarath wasn't surprised by Gray's alleged actions, as he fit the common stereotype of a school shooter. “It's usually the quiet kid or that's a stereotype for it to be and he was the one that fit that description in our class,” she said.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Among the dead was 14-year-old student Mason Schermerhorn, who had autism, and two teachers whose identities have not yet been released. Eight students and a teacher were also injured in the attack, with some of the injuries resulting from gunfire and others from students trying to flee the scene. Fortunately, all those hospitalised are reportedly stable.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India is likely to soon overtake China as the most influential in a key emerging markets index, pulling in more foreign funds and adding fuel to a stock market rally that, though already among the best globally, is "only past the halfway mark", Morgan Stanley said.</p>

<p>India's weightage in the MSCI emerging markets index rose to 19.8% after a rejig in August, closing in on China's 24.2%. India's weightage has steadily increased from 9.2% in December 2020, while China's has dropped from 39.1%.</p>

<p>"A rising weight essentially means more absolute foreign flows," analysts led by Ridham Desai said in a note on Wednesday.</p>

<p>"In the context of India being underweight in the average emerging markets portfolio, this is even better for foreign portfolio flows."</p>

<p>Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have bought shares worth 531.78 billion rupees ($6.33 billion) so far in 2024, and have remained net buyers since June, bolstered by policy continuity after the country's elections and an imminent start to global interest rate cuts.</p>

<p>So far, the sustained inflows from domestic institutional investors, mutual funds and retail traders have helped power the benchmark Nifty 50 to record highs. Its 16% jump this year is more than most other markets, including China.</p>

<p>Mr Desai expects the rally to continue as fiscal consolidation allows private borrowing and spending to fuel the next leg of earnings growth and as higher FII inflows will keep liquidity in surplus, lending resilience.</p>

<p>"We think we are only past the halfway mark in the current bull market. A bull market peak for India is possibly still in the future and the weight in the EM index could have some more distance to travel before it peaks."</p>

<p>Morgan Stanley retained India as its top pick among emerging markets and second favourite, behind Japan, in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

<p>Among stocks, it prefers cyclicals over defensives and large-caps over small-caps. And among sectors, it is 'overweight' on financials, technology, consumer discretionary and industrials, and is 'underweight' on others. ($1 = 83.9690 Indian rupees)<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ugandan marathon runner Rebecca Cheptegei, who competed in the recent Paris Olympics, has died days after an ex-boyfriend threw petrol and set her ablaze. Ms Cheptegei, 33, had been fighting for her life at a Kenyan hospital since Sunday when the horrific attack occurred near her home in Endebess, reported AFP. The attacker, Dickson Ndiema Marangach, also sustained serious burns.</p>

<p>Ms Cheptegi, who won gold at the World Mountain and Trail Running Championships in Thailand in 2022, was rescued by neighbours after the incident, AFP reported. She suffered severe burns covering 75 per cent of her body. The attack occurred when Ms Cheptegei was returning from church with her two children, as per BBC.</p>

<p>"Dickson, who had procured petrol, began pouring (it) on Rebecca before he set her ablaze," a police report said late Monday, adding he was also injured by the flames.</p>

<p>Earlier, Dr Owen Benach, the senior director of clinical services at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret, where both Cheptegei and her alleged attacker were being treated, told BBC that Ms Cheptegei was "fully sedated" due to the severity of her injuries.</p>

<p>The attack is a tragic example of the escalating violence against women in Kenya. According to the Kenyan Bureau of National Statistics, 34 per cent of women have experienced physical violence since the age of 15, with married women being more likely to suffer abuse.</p>

<p>This incident comes two years after the murder of Kenyan athlete Damaris Mutua and the stabbing death of record-breaking runner Agnes Tirop. In both cases, their partners are the primary suspects. Ms Tirop's husband is facing murder charges, while Ms Mutua's boyfriend remains at large.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A 33-year-old Sri Lankan native, who moved to New York from London in 2022, recently opened up about his living situation in Brooklyn's communal building, where he shares his home with more than two dozen people and pays a staggering $2,100 per month]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New York City has a reputation of being one of the most expensive cities in the world. While the city is known for its character and charm, it's not exactly considered budget-friendly. It is common to see people in their late 20s and early 30s living with roommates to help manage the high cost of living. Amid this, a 33-year-old man, who moved to New York from London in 2022, recently opened up about his living situation in Brooklyn's communal building, where he shares his home with more than two dozen people and pays a staggering $2,100 (approximately Rs 176,000) in rent each month.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In an interview with <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/24/33-year-old-pays-2100/month-to-live-with-23-roommates-in-brooklyn.html" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>CNBC Make It,</em></a> Ishan Abeysekera, an engineer by profession, lifted the lid on what life is like in his "cohab" home. He revealed that he lives with 23 housemates and it costs him a whopping $2,100 in rent each month. He has a shared bathroom and kitchen. His monthly payment covers WiFi, utilities, household supplies, a weekly cleaning service and a monthly communal breakfast.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His living situation might have similarities to college housing and might sound wild, but he says that "it's quite nice".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Abeysekera lives in a space operated by Cohabs, a company that offers fully furnished bedrooms and communal living spaces for stays as short as 6 months or as long as a year or more. When he first moved to New York, his company put him up in a one-bedroom apartment in the Financial District for a few months. However, when it came time for him to look for his own space, he said that the high cost of living in the city forced him to consider alternatives to a traditional renter setup.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After a Google search, the 33-year-old then came across Cohabs. His budget was between $2,000 to $3,000, which more than covered the cost of one of the rooms in the company's Crown Heights property. He also thought that the shared living experience would give him an opportunity to make friends.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"How do you really meet people when you're new to a city? This seemed like a great way to do that," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a result, Mr Abeysekera decided to move into the Cohab space. The building has four floors and 24 bedrooms. The tenants are all in their 20s and 30s. His bedroom is furnished with a bed, storage space, a desk, a desk light and a walk-in closet. He does, however, have to share his bathroom with not just one person, rather than all 23 of his roommates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The building is complete with co-working spaces, an outdoor patio and a finished basement with a massive couch that can fit all the residents at once. There's even some gym equipment and a number of ongoing building-wide exercise challenges.</p>

<p>"There's so much shared amenities and space that you're never really in each other's way," Mr Abeysekera said. "And everyone has their own space in terms of their own room," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, he admitted that his current living situation is similar to living in a college dorm. But he insisted that it hadn't been a problem. "Everyone's a lot more respectful because they're more of an adult and more mature," he said. "Being here has really helped me build a community and make friends. It's really enriched my life," he told the outlet.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Safe Superintelligence (SSI), newly co-founded by OpenAI's former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, has raised $1 billion in cash to help develop safe artificial intelligence systems that far surpass human capabilities, company executives told Reuters.</p>

<p>SSI, which currently has 10 employees, plans to use the funds to acquire computing power and hire top talent. It will focus on building a small highly trusted team of researchers and engineers split between Palo Alto, California and Tel Aviv, Israel.</p>

<p>The company declined to share its valuation but sources close to the matter said it was valued at $5 billion. The funding underlines how some investors are still willing to make outsized bets on exceptional talent focused on foundational AI research. That's despite a general waning in interest towards funding such companies which can be unprofitable for some time, and which has caused several startup founders to leave their posts for tech giants.</p>

<p>Investors included top venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, DST Global and SV Angel. NFDG, an investment partnership run by Nat Friedman and SSI's Chief Executive Daniel Gross, also participated.</p>

<p>"It's important for us to be surrounded by investors who understand, respect and support our mission, which is to make a straight shot to safe superintelligence and in particular to spend a couple of years doing R&amp;D on our product before bringing it to market," Gross said in an interview.</p>

<p>AI safety, which refers to preventing AI from causing harm, is a hot topic amid fears that rogue AI could act against the interests of humanity or even cause human extinction.</p>

<p>A California bill seeking to impose safety regulations on companies has split the industry. It is opposed by companies like OpenAI and Google, and supported by Anthropic and Elon Musk's xAI.</p>

<p>Sutskever, 37, is one of the most influential technologists in AI. He co-founded SSI in June with Gross, who previously led AI initiatives at Apple, and Daniel Levy, a former OpenAI researcher.</p>

<p>Sutskever is chief scientist and Levy is principal scientist, while Gross is responsible for computing power and fundraising.</p>

<p>NEW MOUNTAIN</p>

<p>Sutskever said his new venture made sense because he "identified a mountain that's a bit different from what I was working on."</p>

<p>Last year, he was a part of the board of OpenAI's non-profit parent which voted to oust OpenAI CEO Sam Altman over a "breakdown of communications."</p>

<p>Within days, he reversed his decision and joined nearly all of OpenAI's employees in signing a letter demanding Altman's return and the board's resignation. But the turn of events diminished his role at OpenAI. He was removed from the board and left the company in May.</p>

<p>After Sutskever's departure, the company dismantled his "Superalignment" team, which worked to ensure AI stays aligned with human values to prepare for a day when AI exceeds human intelligence.</p>

<p>Unlike OpenAI's unorthodox corporate structure, implemented for AI safety reasons but which made Altman's ouster possible, SSI has a regular for-profit structure.</p>

<p>SSI is currently very much focused on hiring people who will fit in with its culture.</p>

<p>Gross said they spend hours vetting if candidates have "good character", and are looking for people with extraordinary capabilities rather than overemphasizing credentials and experience in the field.</p>

<p>"One thing that excites us is when you find people that are interested in the work, that are not interested in the scene, in the hype," he added.</p>

<p>SSI says it plans to partner with cloud providers and chip companies to fund its computing power needs but hasn't yet decided which firms it will work with. AI startups often work with companies such as Microsoft and Nvidia to address their infrastructure needs.</p>

<p>Sutskever was an early advocate of scaling, a hypothesis that AI models would improve in performance given vast amounts of computing power. The idea and its execution kicked off a wave of AI investment in chips, data centers and energy, laying the groundwork for generative AI advances like ChatGPT.</p>

<p>Sutskever said he will approach scaling in a different way than his former employer, without sharing details.</p>

<p>"Everyone just says scaling hypothesis. Everyone neglects to ask, what are we scaling?" he said.</p>

<p>"Some people can work really long hours and they'll just go down the same path faster. It's not so much our style. But if you do something different, then it becomes possible for you to do something special."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nvidia did not receive a U.S. Justice Department subpoena, a spokesperson said in a statement on Wednesday.</p>

<p>"We have inquired with the U.S. Department of Justice and have not been subpoenaed. Nonetheless, we are happy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business."</p>

<p>Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday the Justice Department had sent a subpoena related to a potential antitrust investigation, which would signal an escalation in the probe. Bloomberg News said subpoenas had been sent to other companies in addition to Nvidia.</p>

<p>The Justice Department has been asking tech companies about Nvidia's business practices in recent weeks, including questions about the company's hardware bundling practices, two sources familiar with the questions investigators are asking told Reuters.</p>

<p>The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>In addition to questions about bundling, Justice Department officials are examining a recent acquisition of the Israel-based Run:AI for a reported $700 million in April, the sources also told Reuters. Officials are probing whether the purchase could further increase Nvidia's grip on the artificial intelligence computing market.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="theconversation-article-title"><span style="font-size: 13px;">Many people have seen dogs fetch, but cats like to get into the game too. Despite their very different hunting and play styles, fetching appears to combine elements of predatory and social behaviour for both species.</span></p>

<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>Although their domestication histories and natural behaviours are very different, cats and dogs share many similarities. Both species are predators, live closely with humans and are capable of enjoying rich social experiences with us.</p>

<p>In our <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0309068">newly published study</a>, we found that more than 40% of cats described in our survey data played fetch, compared with almost 80% of dogs. We also outlined several possible reasons for fetching, including play, selection during domestication, and learning effects.</p>

<h3><strong>Scant research</strong></h3>

<p><a href="https://vet.purdue.edu/discovery/croney/index.php">Our research group</a> sat up and took note when British researchers published a study in 2023 that explored some <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-47409-w">key characteristics of fetching in cats</a>. The scientists surveyed 924 owners of cats that fetched, and they found that the cats would retrieve a wide variety of objects, from pet toys and balls of paper to pens, bottle caps <a href="https://people.com/pets/cat-steals-shoes-owner-made-facebook-group-to-return-shoes/">and even shoes</a>.</p>

<p>Perhaps most intriguing was the fact that the cats generally were not trained to fetch – they offered the behaviour spontaneously. Cats also preferred to be the ones to start the fetch game and were more likely to play when they brought a toy to their human, rather than the human tossing a toy.</p>

<p>Prior to this study, fetching behaviour in cats hadn't received much scientific attention. However, because this review surveyed only owners of cats that fetched, there was no way to compare those animals with cats that didn't. We wondered whether there was something about the cats themselves that made some more likely to fetch than others.</p>

<p>And what about dogs? Fetching is one of the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0168-1591(99)00078-7">most common forms of play between dogs and humans</a>. Many dogs have been bred and selected specifically to assist human hunts by <a href="https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/dog-breeds/best-dog-breeds-for-hunting/">retrieving prey</a>. We expected to find abundant research about fetching behaviour in dogs, but we learned that it was rarely addressed in dog behaviour studies.</p>

<h3><strong>Fluffy, get the ball!</strong></h3>

<p>To help fill this gap, our group teamed with <a href="https://www.vet.upenn.edu/people/faculty-clinician-search/JAMESSERPELL">University of Pennsylvania researcher James Serpell</a>, who developed two survey-based tools to assess dog and cat behaviour. The surveys include basic questions about each animal's breed, age and living environment, followed by dozens of questions about their behaviour, including traits such as predatory behaviour, sociability with humans, activity level and fearfulness. Both surveys also included questions about fetching.</p>

<p>Using these survey results, we analyzed data from thousands of cat and dog owners to explore just how common fetching is and what characteristics of a cat or dog and their environment are likely to predict fetching.</p>

<p>We found that fetching was much more common in cats than we anticipated. Over 40% of cat owners had a cat that “sometimes, usually, or always” fetched. For comparison, we also provided the first estimate of the prevalence of fetching behaviour in dogs. Almost 78% of dogs represented in the data were reported to fetch.</p>

<p>Interestingly, being male was associated with increased fetching in both species. Being older and having health problems decreased the likelihood that either cats or dogs would be fetchers. And for both species, sharing a home with a dog also made the animal represented in the survey less likely to fetch.</p>

<p>There were breed differences too, especially among dogs. Breeds known for being responsive to human instructions and taking interest in toys, such as <a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/german-shepherd-dog/">German shepherd dogs</a>, <a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/golden-retriever/">golden retrievers</a> and <a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/labrador-retriever/">Labrador retrievers</a>, were among the most likely breeds to fetch. In contrast, hounds and livestock guard dogs were among those least likely to fetch.</p>

<p>Fetching was correlated with trainability in dogs, regardless of breed, pointing to the potential importance of early selection of dogs to be human helpers, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.24272/j.issn.2095-8137.2020.002">long before we started developing dog breeds</a>.</p>

<p>There are far fewer breeds of cats than dogs and fewer purebred cats were represented in our study compared with dogs. Still, we also found breed differences among cats. <a href="https://cfa.org/breed/siamese/">Siamese</a>, <a href="https://cfa.org/tonkinese-article/">Tonkinese</a>, <a href="https://cfa.org/burmese-article/">Burmese</a> and <a href="https://cfa.org/breed/bengal/">Bengals</a> were the most likely cats to fetch.</p>

<p>Fetching was correlated with activity level: Cats that were more likely to run, jump, engage with new items in the home and initiate play with their owners were also more likely to fetch.</p>

<h3><strong>From hunting to playing catch</strong></h3>

<p>The roots of fetching behaviour lie in both species' hunting practices. Cats are known as stalk-and-rush hunters, meaning that they sneak up on their prey and <a href="https://www.felidae.org/KNOWELLPUBL/Prelims.pdf">pounce at an opportune moment</a>. Dogs are believed to be pursuit predators that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/08927014.1995.9522969">chase prey over longer distances</a>.</p>

<p>The development of breeds has altered dogs' typical predatory behaviour sequence, which goes like this: orient, eye, stalk, chase, grab-bite, kill-bite. Dog breeds that have been bred for exaggerated or increased “chase and/or grab-bite” behaviour – such as pointers and retrievers – are more likely to fetch and less likely to complete the predatory sequence and “kill-bite.”</p>

<p>But both cats and dogs will carry prey items away from the kill site, which may also partially explain how a behaviour such as a fetch could arise.</p>

<p>Although cats often are viewed as independent and aloof, recent studies have found that cats can <a href="http://dx.doi.org/%2010.1016/j.cub.2019.08.036">show attachment to humans</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10071-014-0832-2">pick up social cues from humans</a> and even <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10071-013-0620-4">recognize their owner's voice</a>. We hope that our study further encourages people to understand that cats are capable of loving relationships with humans, especially when these popular pets are well-socialized and provided with an enriched and safe environment. Including fetching, if your cat is so inclined.</p>

<p>For all of the differences between dogs and cats, we think it's charming that they have converged on a similar behaviour – fetching. Fetching also highlights the effect of the human-animal relationship. Humans clearly play an important role in fetching behaviour, even if dogs and cats simply perceive us as the thing that makes the toy move so they can chase it.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <description><![CDATA[The report containing the guidelines said it was critical to enable human control as required across an AI system's lifecycle.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p>Australia's centre-left government said on Thursday it planned to introduce targeted artificial intelligence rules including human intervention and transparency amid a rapid rollout of AI tools by businesses and in everyday life.</p>

<p>Industry and Science Minister Ed Husic unveiled 10 new voluntary guidelines on AI systems and said the government has opened a month-long consultation over whether to make them mandatory in the future in high-risk settings.</p>

<p>"Australians know AI can do great things but people want to know there are protections in place if things go off the rails," Husic said in a statement. "Australians want stronger protections on AI, we've heard that, we've listened."</p>

<p>The report containing the guidelines said it was critical to enable human control as required across an AI system's lifecycle.</p>

<p>"Meaningful human oversight will let you intervene if you need to and reduce the potential for unintended consequences and harms," the report said. Companies must be transparent to disclose AI's role when generating content, it added.</p>

<p>Regulators around the world have raised concerns about misinformation and fake news contributed by AI tools amid the rising popularity of generative AI systems such as Microsoft-backed OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini.</p>

<p>As a result, the European Union in May passed landmark AI laws, imposing strict transparency obligations on high-risk AI systems that are more comprehensive than a light-touch voluntary compliance approach in several countries.</p>

<p>"We don't think that there is a right to self-regulation any more. I think we've passed that threshold," Husic told ABC News.</p>

<p>Australia has no specific laws to regulate AI, though in 2019 it introduced eight voluntary principles for its responsible use. A government report published this year said the current settings were not adequate enough to tackle high-risk scenarios.</p>

<p>Husic said only one-third of businesses using AI were implementing it responsibly on metrics such as safety, fairness, accountability and transparency.</p>

<p>"Artificial intelligence is expected to create up to 200,000 jobs in Australia by 2030 ... so it's crucial that Australian businesses are equipped to properly develop and use the technology," he said.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Nga Wai Hono i te po Paki was anointed as the new Maori Queen, succeeding her father, King Tuheitia Pootatau Te Wherowhero VII, who died last week. Thousands gathered at New Zealand's Tuurangawaewae, the meeting place of the King movement, to bid farewell to the late king and witness the anointment of his daughter.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">The ceremony, known as Te Whakawahinga, involved the placement of a sacred bible on the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/new-zealands-maori-crowned-new-queen-after-fathers-death-6494926">queen's head</a> and the use of sacred oils to bestow prestige, power and spiritual essence upon her, as per AFP.&nbsp;During her coronation, she wore traditional Maori attire including a headdress of fern leaves, a light brown cloak and a carved whalebone necklace.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Here are some facts on the new Maori queen:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Nga Wai Hono i te po Paki is the youngest child and only daughter of King Tuheitia and Queen Te Atawhai Makau Ariki. She is 27.</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">She holds a Master of Arts in Tikanga (Maori societal lore) and has served on the board of the Te Kohanga Reo National Trust, which focuses on strenghtening the Maori language, as per AFP.</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">She was chosen as successor at the Te Whakawahinga ceremony where a group of 12 elders from various Maori tribes, known as the Kiingitanga advisory council, chose her to become the Maori queen. Despite having two older brothers, NNga Wai Hono i te po Paki was selected to lead, which the Maori people called a “new dawn”. The late Maori King'sfuneral took place shortly before her ascension.</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">She is the eighth Maori monarch and the second queen. Her grandmother, Queen Te Arikinui Dame Te Atairangikaahu, was the first queen and served for four decades until 2006.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The U.S., Britain and the EU are expected to sign the first international treaty on the use of AI that is legally binding, the Financial Times reported on Thursday.</p>

<p>The three would sign the Council of Europe's convention on AI on Thursday, the newspaper said, adding that the convention was drafted for over two years by more than 50 countries including Canada, Israel, Japan and Australia.</p>

<p>The U.S. was "committed to ensuring that AI technologies support respect for human rights and democratic values" and saw "the key value-add of the Council of Europe in this space," a senior Biden administration official told the newspaper.</p>

<p>"It's the first [agreement] with real teeth globally, and it's bringing together a very disparate set of nations as well," Britain's technology minister Peter Kyle said, according to the report.</p>

<p>The Council of Europe's framework convention on AI, which addresses human rights, democracy, and the rule of law, was drafted by the Committee on Artificial Intelligence (CAI).</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Twenty-seven-year-old Nga Wai hono i te po was Thursday anointed as the new monarch by Maori chiefs in New Zealand. The decision came after the death of <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/new-zealands-maori-king-dies-after-18-year-reign-world-leaders-mourn-6451320">King Kiingi Tuheitia Pōtatau Te Wherowhero VII</a>. Nga Wai was chosen as Kuini in a formal ceremony held on the North Island by a council of the Indigenous Māori chiefs, reported AFP.<br />
<br />
With this, Nga Wai became the second-ever <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/new-zealands-maori-king-wants-whales-to-be-granted-personhood-heres-why-5329988">Maori</a> queen in the eight-dynasty reign of the Kingitanga movement to ascend the throne. Her father died last week at the age of 69, following heart surgery.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
“The new monarch was raised in a ceremony known as Te Whakawahinga, in front of thousands of people gathered for the tangihanga (funeral and burial) of Kiingi Tuheitia,” a spokesperson for the Kiingitanga or royal family said.<br />
<br />
Instead of crowning the queen, Archbishop Don Tamihere placed a bible, that has been in use since 1858, on her head and used holy oils to bestow dignity, sacredness, strength, and spiritual essence upon her.<br />
<br />
Thousands flocked to Turangawaewae, the King movement's meeting spot, to bid farewell to him in a traditional funeral ceremony. After his daughter's anointment, the King's coffin was transported by hearse to the Waikato River. From there, it was floated in a flotilla of traditional Maori waka, or canoes, to Taupiri Mountain, where he was to be buried with other royals and high-profile Maori.<br />
<br />
The Maori <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/all-you-need-to-know-about-sultan-hassanal-bolkiah-and-bruneis-royal-family-6480250">monarchy </a>was established back in 1858 to fight colonisation and protect Māori culture and land from intruders. Although the monarch is primarily ceremonial and has little official authority, it is nevertheless regarded by many tribes as the supreme chief.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
With a master's degree in Māori cultural studies from Waikato University, Nga Wai has served on several boards, including the Te Kohanga Reo National Trust, an organisation charged with revitalising the Maori language, according to 1News.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Her anointment comes amid strained racial relations in New Zealand. Since assuming power last year, the centre-right coalition in New Zealand has begun to roll back the policies of the previous administration, especially those that supported the official use of the Maori language, improved living conditions and rights for Indigenous people, and attempts to right some of the wrongs committed during colonisation.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump said he plans to allow his opponent, Kamala Harris, to speak without interruption during their presidential debate next week, a shift for the reality-television-star-turned-politician who built a career on combative exchanges. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I'm going to let her talk," Trump said Wednesday at a taping of a town hall in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, with Fox News' Sean Hannity. "Debates are interesting, you can go in with all the strategy you want, but you have to sort of feel it out."</p>

<p>The Sept. 10 debate hosted by ABC News is the next big test for the two candidates. That forum has already been the centre of a row over the rules for microphones, and with Trump claiming the network is biased in favour of Harris.</p>

<p>ABC News released the rules of the debate on Wednesday and said they had been accepted by both campaigns.</p>

<p>Trump left a little room to change his plan for the event, adding Wednesday: "Mike Tyson made the statement, 'Everyone has a plan until you're punched in the face.'"</p>

<p>Trump in the past has resisted the traditional debate planning employed by presidential campaigns, involving detailed policy briefings and mock exchanges. Instead, he preferred to have less formal preparation from his team and rely more on his own intuition. He refused to debate his Republican rivals during the 2024 primary battle.</p>

<p>The high-stakes confrontation is the first - and potentially only - opportunity for the two candidates to spar in person in a very close contest. With only two months until Election Day, they have few opportunities to sway the small sliver of persuadable voters.</p>

<p>The debate presents risks for both Harris and Trump. The former president has been chastised by both allies and critics for attacks on Harris that criticize her intelligence, gender and racial identity that could alienate key voters. The vice president has largely been untested as a presidential candidate in unscripted settings, only doing one television interview since she became the Democratic nominee.</p>

<h3><strong>Debate About Debates</strong></h3>

<p>Trump had originally agreed to the ABC News debate with President Joe Biden, then the Democratic candidate. For weeks, he suggested he might not show up for the debate with Harris, before saying he would participate after all. Trump and Biden held one debate, a calamitous performance for the sitting president that led members of his own party to push him out of the race.</p>

<p>For weeks, the campaigns have clashed over the rules for the microphones. Harris' camp has sought to keep both candidates' microphones live throughout the broadcast, while Trump's team has pushed for them to be muted when they were not answering questions, as they were during the June Biden-Trump debate on CNN.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the rules released on Wednesday, ABC said the microphones would be "live only for the candidate whose turn it is to speak and muted when the time belongs to another candidate." Candidates have two minutes to answer questions, two minutes to rebut and one minute for follow-ups or clarifications, according to the network.</p>

<p>The Harris campaign in a letter to ABC said that the muted microphones would disadvantage Harris and shield Trump from having to directly engage with the vice president, according to a campaign official. Harris' team was concerned that Trump would skip the debate if they didn't agree to having the mics silenced, and said that if there is significant cross-talk, the network might unmute the candidates, so that the audience can understand what's happening, the official said.</p>

<p>Trump has floated other debates, including with Fox News. The Harris campaign has ruled out participating in a forum on that network but has proposed a second debate, with the details to be resolved if Trump takes part in the ABC event.</p>

<h3><strong>Swing States</strong></h3>

<p>The debate will take place in Philadelphia, the largest city in Pennsylvania, one of the most critical swing states. Trump's town hall appearance Wednesday marks his second visit there in as many weeks. The two nominees are in a pitched fight for the state's working-class voters, some of them uneasy with Biden's economic agenda and drawn to Trump's populist appeals.</p>

<p>Harris campaigned in the western part of the state on Labor Day with Biden and is returning on Thursday for the 10th time this year, according to her campaign. The state is the most populous of the seven core battlegrounds, offering 19 Electoral College votes.</p>

<p>Trump's team has acknowledged polls showing the race has grown more competitive. A Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll released late August found Harris overtaking Trump in Pennsylvania by 51% to 47%. Republican National Committee co-chair Lara Trump, on Bloomberg Television's Balance of Power last week, said the party would consider putting more money and attention into "must-win" battlegrounds such as Pennsylvania.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A group of scientists, including people from the Royal Society of Chemistry, recently proposed that experiences such as licking an ice lolly should be part of the science curriculum.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="theconversation-article-title">A <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/articles/c984wz29xexo">group of scientists</a>, including people from the Royal Society of Chemistry, recently proposed that experiences such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/article/2024/aug/20/add-ice-lolly-licking-to-england-primary-school-curriculum-urge-scientists">licking an ice lolly</a> should be part of the science curriculum. By licking a lolly and seeing how it melts – the idea goes – children would better learn about melting, and therefore about chemistry and physics.</p>

<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>But does licking a lolly, or experiences such as kneading dough, playing with shadows or digging in soil, actually help pupils learn science? Deploying examples and demonstrations in the classroom can be a helpful gateway towards deeper understanding, but it's not a shortcut to knowledge.</p>

<p>The idea of learning through experiences has a long history. It's perhaps most closely associated with the work of educator <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/ENTRIES/dewey/">John Dewey</a> in the early 20th century. Dewey and other educators of the time were concerned that an emphasis on rote learning would lead to “inert knowledge”: facts that students wouldn't be able to apply <a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9780203056646-5/cognitive-coping-strategies-problem-inert-knowledge-carl-bereiter-marlene-scardamalia">to the real world</a>.</p>

<p>An experience like licking a lolly may at least be memorable – especially if you've never done it before. Licking a lolly or seeing it melt in class would lead to what psychologists call an episodic memory: a memory of an event in your life.</p>

<h3><strong>Experience and understanding</strong></h3>

<p>However, there <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2007-08951-001">is a difference</a> between having memories for events and having knowledge. There is a difference, for example, between having personally lived through the French Revolution and knowing what happened.</p>

<p>The latter involves a different type of memories – semantic memories. These are based on understanding how things work and what they mean. It is the type of memory that is at play when you use a word such as “heavy”, unconnected to a specific heavy object. Such understandings are essential to both scientific learning and our use of language.</p>

<p>If you stop to think about it, most of your knowledge can't be clearly tied to one particular experience. Learning is usually not a one-shot process – think of how much experience a gardener needs before they “know” how plants grow and thrive, for example.</p>

<p>These semantic memories derive from an amalgam of lots of experiences, and sometimes, from comparing and contrasting different things: the difference between two types of plants, or between an ice lolly and an ice cream.</p>

<p>Learning about melting is similar. We don't just demonstrate melting one time, and boom (or squelch), the students have learned it.</p>

<h3><strong>Importance of context</strong></h3>

<p>Understanding science or anything else is also not just about remembering experiences. Learners need to <a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781410603784-7/teaching-learning-understanding-david-perkins-chris-unger">understand the encounter</a>, to have their attention directed towards similar and different processes, and to experience <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00505/full">multiple examples</a>.</p>

<p>To profit most from this, learners need sufficient prior knowledge to understand what is happening when they observe something in class. This is one reason that leaving students to discover things entirely by themselves is a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/0003-066X.59.1.14">flawed strategy</a>.</p>

<p>It's also another reason why relying on one-off experiences doesn't work. Students need to revisit ideas periodically, each time bringing more knowledge and understanding to the table.</p>

<p>Without a basic understanding of science, there is a risk that a learner will fail to connect a classroom observation to its wider context. Knowing about melting, for example, is a lot more than knowing that a lolly melts – it involves knowing why, and under what circumstances. It involves knowing that other everyday substances would melt in higher temperatures.</p>

<p>This foundational understanding is also important to stop students from coming up with scientific misconceptions. In the lolly example, students might <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00461520.2012.695709">overgeneralise surface features</a> such as how quickly the lolly melts or how sticky it is, seeing these as characteristics of melting in general.</p>

<p>In short, understanding science or anything else is not just about remembering things. It's about understanding what an experience connects to, what category it is an example of, and how it differs from other concepts.</p>

<h3><strong>Personal learning</strong></h3>

<p>Another notable claim in the ice lolly story was the suggestion that it is valuable to promote learning <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/articles/c984wz29xexo">“on a personal level”</a>. There is research on this, too.</p>

<p>Imagine you were asked to remember a list of random words such as “music, broccoli, dancing, plastic bottles, baby sharks”. <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1970-03138-001">A study</a> looking at memory found that people better recalled words from lists like this if they were asked “do you like this?” compared to a blander, information-processing question, such as “does the word contain a letter ‘e'?”. We also <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/17470211003770938">remember our own possessions</a> better than generic objects.</p>

<p>So, yes – there is some evidence that we might retain experiences better if we are personally invested in them. However, it's worth noting that such experiments are rather short-term. In everyday life, we can really enjoy and engage with something on a personal level (such as a book or a conversation) yet forget the details within a few weeks or months.</p>

<p>This is partly why people write diaries. Memories of our lives are ephemeral, easily lost over time. Sometimes such memories are distorted, or even <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0079-7421(08)60124-3">entirely imagined</a> – false memories. It's risky to base science learning upon this type of memory.</p>

<p>If we want students to build up their knowledge of science and be able to use it in future, it's vital that the focus is on strategies that build deep understanding of concepts and how they are structured, rather than relying on gimmicks or one-off experiences.</p>

<p>All of this is to say nothing of the practicality of storing an ice lolly for every school pupil, handing them out in class – or cleaning up afterwards.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a major setback to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, key ally Jagmeet Singh's New Democratic Party has pulled out support for his minority Liberal government ahead of the general election next year.</p>

<p>In a video message shared on social media, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/justin-trudeau-weakened-after-key-sikh-ally-withdraws-support-6492183">Jagmeet Singh </a>said Mr Trudeau will not be able to take on the opposition Conservatives amid recent polls showing them securing an easy win in elections.</p>

<p>"<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/canada-to-reduce-number-of-temporary-foreign-workers-6424021">Justin Trudeau</a> has proven again and again he will always cave to corporate greed. The Liberals have let people down. They don't deserve another chance from Canadians," Mr Singh said in the video.</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The deal is done.<br />
<br />
The Liberals are too weak, too selfish and too beholden to corporate interests to stop the Conservatives and their plans to cut. But the NDP can.<br />
<br />
Big corporations and CEOs have had their governments. It's the people's time. <a href="https://t.co/BsE9zT0CwF">pic.twitter.com/BsE9zT0CwF</a></p>
— Jagmeet Singh (@theJagmeetSingh) <a href="https://twitter.com/theJagmeetSingh/status/1831375557507850740?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 4, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p></p>

<p>The leader said that the "big battle" now is defeating the Conservatives to stop them from choosing big corporations over the young people and Canadian families.</p>

<p>"There is another, even bigger battle ahead. The threat of Pierre Poilievre and Conservative cuts. From workers, from retirees, from young people, from patients, from families -- he will cut in order to give more to big corporations and wealthy CEOs," he said.</p>

<p>The two leaders had struck in 2022 to come together to boost the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/setback-for-canadas-trudeau-liberals-lose-stronghold-in-key-polls-5969262">Liberal </a>party's minority government. The deal was supposed to go on till October next year but an NDP spokesperson said the plan to end the agreement was in the works for the past two weeks.</p>

<p>Reports suggest the sudden social media post was a surprise for the Canadian PM's party as within minutes of informing them of their decision to withdraw Mr Singh posted the video on social media.</p>

<p>Mr Singh said "the NDP is ready for an election, and voting non-confidence will be on the table with each and every confidence measure."</p>

<p>Reacting to Mr Singh's announcement, Mr Trudeau said his government will continue to focuse on tackling the affordability crisis in the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"These are the things that we're focused on. I'll let others focus on politics.I really hope the NDP stays focused on how we can deliver for Canadians, as we have over the past years, rather than focusing on politics," he said.</p>

<p>The Canadian prime minister also said he remained hopeful that the next election will not happen "until next fall" so that his government can also work on pharmacare, dental care, and school food programmes.</p>

<p>Mr Singh's NDP kept the Mr Trudeau's Liberal government in power through a confidence-and-supply agreement. In exchange for its support, the government agreed to address key priorities, including introducing dental care benefits, providing one-time rental supplements for low-income tenants, and temporarily doubling the GST rebate.</p>

<p>But some of the promises made to Mr Singh's party are yet to be fulfilled.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

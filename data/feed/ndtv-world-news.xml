       <description><![CDATA[The pollsters' performance was under the microscope this year, after two big misses in succession -- in 2016 and in 2020.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Opinion polls underestimated the level of Donald Trump's support for the third US presidential election in a row, predicting a neck-and-neck race with Kamala Harris when in the end the Republican edged the vice president across battleground states. Trump's win involved surging support in a number of demographics and regions, but experts said pollsters failed to accurately predict races in states where the results differed significantly from the last election in 2020.</p>

<p>"They did fine in battlegrounds, but... they failed to provide the essential information that Trump was surging across the board," said Michael Bailey, a professor of political science at Georgetown University.</p>

<p>More than 90 percent of US counties voted in higher numbers for the Republican billionaire than they did in 2020, according to The New York Times.</p>

<p>Overall, the polls had predicted razor thin margins in races in the seven battleground states that decide close US elections. As of Wednesday, Trump was projected to win five of those states by between one and three percentage points.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The former president was well on his way to sweeping all seven states, according to those projections.</p>

<p>"Trump may have been mildly underestimated but I think the polls ended up doing pretty well, collectively -- this was not a huge miss," said Kyle Kondik, a political analyst at the University of Virginia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The polls suggested Trump had a decent chance to win, and he won."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The pollsters' performance was under the microscope this year, after two big misses in succession: they had failed to anticipate Trump's victory in 2016, and had overestimated the margin by which President Joe Biden won against him in 2020.</p>

<p>"Trump was underestimated by about two points this time around" in key states, said Pedro Azevedo, Head of US polling at AtlasIntel.</p>

<p>In Pennsylvania, the latest polling average from RealClearPolitics put the Republican in the lead by 0.4 percentage points. As of Wednesday, he was ahead by two points.</p>

<p>In North Carolina, polls predicted a 1.2-point margin for Trump, and he won by three points over Harris.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Wisconsin, the vice president was given a 0.4-point lead, but the projected results showed Trump leading the count by 0.9 points.</p>

<p>The main problem has not changed since Trump's arrival on the US political scene about a decade ago: a fringe of his electorate refuses to take part in opinion polls, and firms have failed to be able to accurately gauge their impact.</p>

<p>In the most recent polls conducted by The New York Times with Siena College, "white Democrats were 16 percent likelier to respond than white Republicans," NYT data analyst and polling guru Nate Cohn wrote two days before the election.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That disparity had grown over the course of the 2024 campaign, he added.</p>

<p>Although pollsters like The New York Times/Siena tried to compensate for these flaws with statistical adjustments, it was clearly not enough.</p>

<p>"It is apparent that polls significantly underestimated Trump's growth among Hispanic voters," said Azevedo, pointing to Trump's larger-than-expected victories in Nevada and Florida.</p>

<p>"This is also the case among white voters," he said, adding that while most polls expected Harris to "improve her margins" in this demographic, Trump outperformed the polling and ran up his numbers in rural areas.</p>

<p>Iowa was a prime example of this, with a poll three days before Election Day giving Harris a three-point victory in the solidly Republican state. In the end, Trump won it comfortably by 13 points, Azevedo said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>J. Ann Selzer, the author of that inaccurate Iowa poll, said the difference could have been made by late-deciding voters.</p>

<p>"The late deciders could have opted for Trump in the final days of the campaign after interviewing was complete," she told the Des Moines Register newspaper.</p>

<p>"The people who had already voted but opted not to tell our interviewers for whom they voted could have given Trump an edge."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump has in the past voiced admiration for Vladimir Putin and scoffed at the $175 billion in US assistance committed for Ukraine since Moscow's 2022 invasion.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump's election victory spells immediate doubt for Ukraine in its fight against Russia, with President Joe Biden's administration expected to sprint in its final days to ensure -- insofar as possible -- long-term US support. Trump, who won an overwhelming victory in Tuesday's election, has in the past voiced admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin and scoffed at the $175 billion in US assistance committed for Ukraine since Moscow's 2022 invasion.</p>

<p>The 78-year-old tycoon has repeatedly boasted that he can end the war in 24 hours, without explaining how.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His aides have mused about conditioning aid to Kyiv to force concessions, with Vice President-elect J.D. Vance once bluntly saying he did not care what happened to Ukraine, seeing the country as strategically insignificant compared with the global US rivalry with China.</p>

<p>With 10 weeks to go until Trump takes over, the Biden administration is looking to push out the more than $9 billion of remaining funding appropriated by Congress for weapons and other security assistance to Ukraine, officials said.</p>

<p>The Biden team is also looking for structural ways to put European allies in greater charge of assistance to Ukraine before Trump returns, diplomats said.</p>

<p>In a pre-emptive "Trump-proofing" measure, NATO -- the trans-Atlantic alliance that has been criticized by the president-elect -- has already agreed to take over from the United States in coordinating aid to Ukraine.</p>

<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has also moved quickly with Trump in hopes of preserving ties with Kyiv's top backer.</p>

<p>Zelensky called him Wednesday and offered flattery on his "tremendous victory" as he voiced hope for "strong and unwavering US leadership" to bring a "just peace."</p>

<p>Brian Taylor, a Russia expert at Syracuse University, said that if Trump seeks a direct role in Ukraine-Russia talks, he will "quickly find out that the details and the nuances are not so simple as simply telling everyone to stop shooting at each other."</p>

<p>Even a deal to freeze the grinding conflict raises questions on where to draw battle-lines, with Ukraine's military fighting in regions which Russia says it has annexed.</p>

<p>At the same time, Taylor doubted that Europe could immediately replace US military assistance.</p>

<p>"I'm not sure Europe has the stomach or the institutional capacity to just step up and fill that role instantly, although maybe it will develop that capacity over time," he said.</p>

<p>Olga Kharkova, of the Atlantic Council, said that Biden could lift restrictions on use of Western weapons on Russian soil, a long-running demand of Kyiv, and boost Ukraine's air defenses to protect its energy infrastructure.</p>

<p>Boosting Ukraine could also appeal to Trump by giving him a stronger negotiating hand, she said.</p>

<p>"Much is still unknown, but this offers a unique opportunity to negotiate from a position of strength and decisiveness and boldness," Kharkova said.</p>

<p>Leon Aron, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said Trump could ultimately be disappointed by Putin's refusal to budge on demands, resulting in a deal politically unpalatable even in Trump's Washington.</p>

<p>For now, Trump's victory mostly means uncertainty, said Brian Finucane, a former State Department official now at the International Crisis Group.</p>

<p>"Further substantial US military aid seems doubtful, but Trump himself has been vague about how specifically he would deal with the conflict," Finucane said.</p>

<p>Representative Michael Waltz, a Republican army veteran seen as a contender for a national security position, said in a pre-election interview that Trump could find ways to press Putin, including by tightening enforcement of sanctions on Russian energy exports.</p>

<p>"I think that will get Putin to the table. We have leverage, like taking the handcuffs off of the long-range weapons we provided Ukraine as well," Waltz told National Public Radio.</p>

<p>Trump, he said, is "very focused on ending the war rather than perpetuating it."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The European agency said the world was passing a "new milestone" of temperature records that should serve to accelerate action to cut planet-heating emissions.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year is "virtually certain" to be the hottest in recorded history with warming above 1.5C, EU climate monitor Copernicus said Thursday, days before nations are due to gather for crunch UN climate talks. The European agency said the world was passing a "new milestone" of temperature records that should serve to accelerate action to cut planet-heating emissions at the UN negotiations in Azerbaijan next week.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last month, marked by deadly flooding in Spain and Hurricane Milton in the United States, was the second hottest October on record, with average global temperatures second only to the same period in 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Copernicus said 2024 would likely be more than 1.55 degrees Celsius above the 1850-1900 average -- the period before the industrial-scale burning of fossil fuels. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This does not amount to a breach of the Paris deal, which strives to limit global warming to below 2C and preferably 1.5C, because that is measured over decades and not individual years.</p>

<p>"It is now virtually certain that 2024 will be the warmest year on record and the first year of more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels," said Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) Deputy Director Samantha Burgess.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This marks a new milestone in global temperature records and should serve as a catalyst to raise ambition for the upcoming Climate Change Conference, COP29."</p>

<p><strong>Wild weather</strong></p>

<p>The UN climate negotiations in Azerbaijan, which will set the stage for a new round of crucial carbon-cutting targets, will take place in the wake of the United States election victory by Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Trump, a climate change denier, pulled the US out of the Paris Agreement during his first presidency -- and while his successor Joe Biden took the United States back in, he has threatened to do so again.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, average global temperatures have reached new peaks, as have concentrations of planet-heating gases in the atmosphere. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Scientists say the safer 1.5C limit is rapidly slipping out of reach, while stressing that every tenth of a degree of temperature rise heralds progressively more damaging impacts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last month the UN said the current pace of climate action would result in a catastrophic 3.1C of warming this century, while all current climate pledges taken in full would still amount to a devastating 2.6C temperature rise. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Global warming is not just about rising temperatures, but the knock-on effect of all the extra heat in the atmosphere and seas.</p>

<p>Warmer air can hold more water vapour, and warmer oceans mean greater evaporation, resulting in more intense downpours and storms.</p>

<p>In a month of weather extremes, October saw above-average rainfall across swathes of Europe, as well as parts of China, the US, Brazil and Australia, Copernicus said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The US is also experiencing ongoing drought, which affected record numbers of people, the EU monitor added. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Copernicus said average sea surface temperatures in the area it monitors were the second highest on record for the month of October.&nbsp;</p>

<p>C3S uses billions of measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft and weather stations to aid its calculations.</p>

<p>Copernicus records go back to 1940 but other sources of climate data such as ice cores, tree rings and coral skeletons allow scientists to expand their conclusions using evidence from much deeper in the past.</p>

<p>Climate scientists say the period being lived through right now is likely the warmest the earth has been for the last 100,000 years, back at the start of the last Ice Age.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump won wider margins than before, despite a criminal conviction, two impeachments while in office and warnings from his former chief of staff that he is a fascist.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bagging 295 electoral votes and most swing states, Republican Donald Trump raced towards a victory buoyed by issues like immigration and war. Exit polls showed that voters' top concern was also the economy and inflation that spiked under outgoing President Joe Biden in the wake of the Covid pandemic.</p>

<p>The 78-year-old won wider margins than before, despite a criminal conviction, two impeachments while in office and warnings from his former chief of staff that he is a fascist.</p>

<p>America's views on migration changed drastically, with not just the Republican voters but even Democrats and independents moving right owing to a surge in migration along US's south border. Throughout his campaign, Mr Trump painted migrants as a menace and also proposed invoking the centuries-old Alien Enemies Act, garnering support from 57 percent voters over the deportation of immigrants, as per a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/us/trump-immigration-border.html">New York Times/Siena College poll</a>. Over 50 percent also supported a wall along the Mexico border, one of the prime locations of unprecedented migration during President Biden's term.</p>

<p>During his previous term as President and before it, Mr Trump had introduced the policy of taking migrant children from their parents in an attempt to deter family immigration and even invoked a public health emergency to seal the border. Then Mr Biden assumed office in 2020, when people risked border police and death, crossing rivers, cutting through wires and scaling the border to find their way into the US. Citizens, meanwhile, saw growing resentment over the strain this movement put on resources, including affordable housing and food banks.</p>

<p>Unlawful entries into America soared to the highest single month record of all time, over 300,000 in December, leading Mr Trump to swoop in and galvanise support on the issue.</p>

<p>Inflation too was a major concern in these elections, with the Biden administration attempting desperately to pacify citizens plagued by soaring living costs, unemployment and a general economic downturn. The conditions prevailed amid the Covid pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war, both unexpected events. Too bad for the Democrats because in contrast, Trumps' 2016 term saw flourishing stock markets and historically low unemployment levels.</p>

<p>What also possibly dented the share for Democrats was America's sizeable aid to Ukraine and Israel at a time its own citizens were struggling to afford shelter, food and healthcare. Further, in a country that has an Arab-descent minority, the Biden administration unwavering support to Israel, while thousands died and millions were displaced in Gaza, possibly hit the wrong note. Mr Trump's margin in Arab-descent majority Dearborn in Michigan points to a resentment among the minority towards Democrats.</p>

<p>The rural states, which propelled Mr Trump to a victory in 2016, were supported by swing states this year to give an even more decisive mandate to the Republicans. The section was usually ignored or judged adversely by the Democrats, with Hillary Clinton saying during her 2016 campaign that Hillary Clinton referring to Trump voters are "a basket of deplorables".</p>

<p>Georgia's Baldwin County, with a sizeable chunk of African-American voters, chose a Republican after 2004. Nevada and Arizona, with a considerable Hispanic population also chose the former president. Both metrics indicate that Mr Trump possibly did make inroads with minority communities. "Exit polls showed Trump winning large numbers of Latino men in key battleground states, improving his numbers with that group in Pennsylvania from 27% to 42%. Nationally, Trump's support among Latino men leaped from 36% to 54%," according to TIME magazine.</p>

<p>As per an <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/donald-trump-won-according-nbc-news-exit-poll-rcna178603">NBC Newspoll</a>, Mr Trump garnered the support of a remarkable 1 in 3 voters of color, most likely the best performance of any Republican presidential candidate since George W. Bush in his 2004 re-election effort.</p>

<p>Banking on people's anger towards the Biden administration, their fear of a future under the incumbents and suffering amid a flailing economy brought Trump back to the helm. In his victory speech on Wednesday, he vowed to usher in the "golden age of America".</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An unruly plane passenger who attempted to open the emergency door mid-flight was beaten up and restrained by fellow passengers on a Copa Airlines flight. According to the <em>New York Post,</em> the incident took place on Tuesday on a flight from Brazil to Panama. The flight had been going as planned until 30 minutes before landing a man rushed to the back of the plane with a plastic knife from his food tray and attempted to take a flight attendant hostage with the goal of opening the plane door.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A video of the incident, shared on microblogging site X, shows the unruly passenger being restrained by other passengers after he attempted to open the plane door 30 minutes before landing. Another clip shows authorities boarding the aircraft and leading the man away in handcuffs with his face bloodied.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is when passengers sprang to the rescue and fought the man to stop him from opening the plane's emergency door, the 51-year-old recounted. He said that despite initially struggling due to the man's strength, fellow passengers eventually succeeded in restraining the airhead after beating him bloody.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"They beat him a lot until he almost lost consciousness," Mr Carvalho described.</p>

<p>In a statement, Copa Airlines claimed that after landing in Panama "the national security team entered the aircraft and removed the passenger, taking him to the judicial authorities".&nbsp;</p>

<p>The airlines praised both crewmembers and flyers for coming together to stop the unruly passenger from opening the plane door.

       <description><![CDATA[Allan Lichtman, Nostradamus of US polls, was at a loss for words as his prediction that Kamala Harris would win the presidential election turned wrong.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former President and Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump made a landslide victory with his win over Democratic Party candidate Kamala Harris. Thanking his supporters, Trump described it as a "<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/magnificent-victory-for-american-people-donald-trump-on-us-election-result-6955510">magnificent victory for the American people</a>". But this victory left Allan Lichtman, Nostradamus of US polls, at a loss of words as his prediction that Kamala Harris would win the presidential election turned wrong.</p>

<p>In a six-hour-long YouTube livestream with his son Sam, Allan Lichtman was seen saying “I don't get it” as Donald Trump inched closer to the victory. “This is the first moment of the night where I've lost hope a little bit,” Sam Lichtman said as US networks called battleground Pennsylvania for Trump.</p>

<p>Mr Lichtman was visibly tired, stressed and disappointed. “Good thing I have nothing to do tomorrow. And I'm not doing any interviews,” he said. Holding his head, he added, “The democracy is gone.”</p>

<p>“Once democracy is gone, it's almost impossible to recover. The way to recover is by the dictators losing wars.”</p>

<p>To this, Sam Lichtman hoped Trump would serve his term and “we never have to deal with him again. I just can't wrap my mind around how that many people can just ignore all the shit he did in 2020.”</p>

<p>Mr Lichtman called Trump “too lazy” to govern.</p>

<p>“Democracy is precious, but like all precious things, it can be destroyed. And typically destroyed from within. And throughout the 21st century, democracy has been in decline everywhere around the world, and America has now fallen in step. But never give up hope. Never stop striving. Never stop trying especially you young people,” Mr Lichtman said before signing off. Mr Lichtman, historian, author, and a rare political forecaster with a track record of poll predictions, had predicted Kamala Harris to be the first woman president of the US.</p>

<p>"Consign them (opinion polls) to the flames," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/2024-us-elections-kamala-harris-or-donald-trump-nostradamus-of-us-polls-tells-ndtv-his-pick-6947511">Mr Lichtman told NDTV</a>. "Yes, we are going to have Kamala Harris, a new path-breaking president, the first woman president and the first president of mixed African and Asian descent. It is kind of foreshadowing where America is going. We are rapidly becoming a majority-minority country old white guys like me, we are on the decline,” Mr Lichtman had said.</p>

<p>Mr Lichtman's prediction model focuses on historical patterns, dismissing the idea that polls, campaign strategies, or even election demographics alone can determine outcomes. In 1981, he developed the 13 "Keys to the White House" system, identifying that governance, not campaign tactics, decides the US elections. His model has correctly forecasted the winner of every election since 1984, including some when his conclusions contradicted popular sentiment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Elon Musk contributed at least $119 million to a pro-Trump spending group and tirelessly touted the former president at the critical late stage of his campaign against Kamala Harris.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk's backing of Donald Trump's decisive victory for a second presidency gives the billionaire entrepreneur extraordinary influence to help his companies secure favorable government treatment. Musk contributed at least $119 million to a pro-Trump spending group, federal records show, and tirelessly touted the former president at the critical late stage of his campaign.</p>

<p>Musk's politicking reflects a wider strategy to insulate his companies from regulation or enforcement and boost their government support, according to Reuters interviews with six Musk-company sources familiar with his political and business dealings and two government officials who have extensive interactions with Musk firms. The sources provided a rare view of the strategizing inside Musk's firms to take full advantage of his deepening relationship with Trump.</p>

<p>Musk's business interests - from Tesla electric vehicles to SpaceX rockets and Neuralink brain chips - depend heavily on government regulation, subsidies or policy.</p>

<p>"Elon Musk sees all regulations as getting in the way of his businesses and innovation," said one former top SpaceX official who spoke on condition of anonymity. "He sees the Trump administration as the vehicle for getting rid of as many regulations as he can, so he can do whatever he wants, as fast as he wants."</p>

<p>Musk endorsed Trump on July 13, the day the candidate was shot in the ear in a Pennsylvania assassination attempt. Musk's donations financed an extensive get-out-the-vote effort as Trump faced a stiffer challenge after Vice President Kamala Harris replaced President Joe Biden in July as the Democratic presidential nominee. Musk spent election night with the president-elect at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, and Trump has said he would name Musk as his administration's "efficiency czar."</p>

<p>Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink and Musk did not respond to requests for comment. The Trump campaign called Musk a "once-in-a-generation industry leader" in a statement to Reuters, adding that the "broken federal bureaucracy will certainly benefit from his ideas and efficiency."</p>

<p>Musk once fashioned his image primarily around fighting climate change by building electric cars to reduce pollution and rockets that could one day help humans flee to Mars from a dying Earth. He's now at the forefront of a growing class of Silicon Valley billionaires championing a libertarian movement as a backlash to the California region's historically liberal ideology - which Musk now derides as a "woke mind virus."</p>

<p>His rising political involvement could put his industrial empire in a position that current and former employees likened to the Gilded Age, when industry barons such as JP Morgan and John D. Rockefeller held broad sway over government policy impacting their businesses and wealth.</p>

<p>Musk's growing power excited his backers who view government as an impediment to his high-tech operations, including Shervin Pishevar, a venture capitalist who has invested in SpaceX and advocated for Silicon Valley's shift toward Trump. Cutting regulation, he said, would speed SpaceX's efforts to get to Mars.</p>

<p>"He's going to make America function like a startup," Pishevar said of Musk. "There's no greater entrepreneur in American history than Elon Musk."</p>

<h3><strong>DRIVING AUTO POLICY</strong></h3>

<p>Musk's political ascension comes after perceived slights under the Biden administration that accelerated Musk's embrace of Trump's right-wing populism. For example, Tesla wasn't invited to an August 2021 EV summit at the White House that featured only unionized Detroit automakers that produce a fraction of the EVs Tesla sells.</p>

<p>The fortunes of Tesla could rise or fall depending on Trump's treatment of the diverse array of subsidies, policies and regulatory schemes for electric and autonomous vehicles. Democratic administrations have historically championed many such pro-EV policies, with Tesla's support. Musk could potentially now protect them despite the Republican party's traditional rejection of EVs - and Trump's ridicule of Biden's EV policy on the campaign trail.</p>

<p>For Tesla, Musk's goals include getting the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), its primary federal safety regulator, to hold off on potential enforcement actions involving the safety of Tesla's current driver-assistance systems, called "Autopilot" and "Full Self-Driving," according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>Musk's "primary focus over the next four years," the person said, would be "de-enforcement."</p>

<p>Musk, the source said, could also push for favorable regulation of autonomous vehicles and robotaxis that Tesla plans. For his new artificial intelligence startup xAI, Musk could shape nascent rules or a new agency, the person said.</p>

<p>Musk said last month that he expects to roll out driverless Teslas in California and Texas by next year and start production in 2026 on a fully autonomous "Cybercab" with no steering wheel or pedals. Tesla would need a waiver from NHTSA to produce such a vehicle.</p>

<p>There are no nationwide regulations governing how autonomous vehicles can be deployed. That means operators have to deal with different regulations in each state. Musk bemoaned the challenges of the state-by-state regulatory landscape in a Tesla earnings call last month and advocated for one federal approval process.</p>

<p>Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, a Tesla investor, said a streamlined, uniform set of autonomous-driving regulations may provide Tesla the biggest boost of any policy Musk might influence. A "slimmer, trimmer federal Department of Transportation that gives common-sense guidelines" would give Tesla "room to prove their case" for the technology's safety, he said.</p>

<p>Despite Musk's complaints of stifling bureaucracy, SpaceX currently leads the world in government-financed rocket launches and Tesla sells nearly two million heavily subsidized EVs annually.</p>

<p>Tesla shares closed up about 15% on Wednesday.</p>

<p>At his brain-implant startup Neuralink, Musk has long complained that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval process has slowed the firm from implanting the device in humans. Musk could use his rising clout in a Trump administration to cut through some of the safety-related approvals in that process, according to a source familiar with the company's operations.</p>

<p>Musk has long expressed frustration about the FDA's pace. Some Neuralink employees are considering the prospect that Musk, if he becomes Trump's "efficiency" chief, could get FDA officials he deems inefficient fired, said a person familiar with the matter.</p>

<h3><strong>GROWING POWER</strong></h3>

<p>Musk's designs on setting up a lax regulatory environment come as his companies already face fewer regulatory requirements and softer enforcement of current federal rules, according to the six Musk company sources familiar with his regulatory dealings and political strategy. Some federal agencies already struggle to muster the political will to go after Musk companies for alleged policy violations or safety issues, they said, in part because Musk is the dominant player in highly-regulated and politicized industries such as electric cars and rockets.</p>

<p>NASA, for instance, has relied on SpaceX's know-how in missions such as the expected rescue of Boeing's Starliner astronauts who are still stranded in space.</p>

<p>NASA and other agencies often try to avoid alienating the company, said a federal official who is familiar with the company's government interactions and spoke on condition of anonymity. "NASA needs SpaceX more than SpaceX needs NASA," the official said.</p>

<p>NASA has invested more than $15 billion in SpaceX. SpaceX is also separately developing a network of hundreds of spy satellites with a U.S. intelligence agency, Reuters has reported.</p>

<p>A Reuters investigation last year documented at least 600 worker injuries at SpaceX facilities nationwide and found that Musk's rocket company disregarded safety regulations and standard practices. Worker injury rates at SpaceX facilities also continued to exceed an industry average last year, according to a Reuters review of safety data.</p>

<p>Neither NASA nor OSHA, which regulates worker safety, has taken any significant enforcement action against SpaceX over worker injuries and related reporting violations. NASA declined to comment on Musk's potential influence after Trump's election.</p>

<p>Musk has nonetheless excoriated the government for trying to enforce the rules even as his company has moved faster than competitors. In an interview before the election, he described federal enforcement as overly harsh and said he aimed to get rid of "insane" regulations.</p>

<p>"Eventually, you just can't get anything done," said Musk during an appearance at the All-in Summit, a gathering affiliated with a tech podcast by the same name.</p>

<p>However, the U.S. government does not regulate the safety of participants in private space flights in orbit due to a temporary congressionally imposed ban on the agency's oversight, to encourage innovation in the industry. A Trump administration, influenced by Musk, is expected to push for softer regulations on this front, according to four SpaceX sources familiar with its regulatory strategy.</p>

<p>Musk and SpaceX see the company's dominance as evidence that it can handle less oversight, the sources said, even as an unfettered Musk could have unintended consequences for the industry.</p>

<p>One former SpaceX official cautioned that taking a lax regulatory attitude in a sector as dangerous as rocket-building "could blow up in everyone's face and set back the industry for a decade."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Ottawa last year began reviewing TikTok's plan to invest and expand its business in Canada. ByteDance is TikTok's Chinese parent company.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canada on Wednesday ordered Chinese-owned TikTok's business in the country to be dissolved, citing national-security risks, but added the government was not blocking Canadians' access to the short-video app or their ability to create content.</p>

<p>"The government is taking action to address the specific national security risks related to ByteDance Ltd's operations in Canada through the establishment of TikTok Technology Canada Inc," Innovation Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said in a statement.</p>

<p>Ottawa last year began reviewing TikTok's plan to invest and expand its business in Canada. ByteDance is TikTok's Chinese parent company.</p>

<p>Under Canadian law, the government can assess potential risks to national security from foreign investments, such as the TikTok proposal. The law prevents the government from revealing the details of such investments.</p>

<p>"The decision was based on the information and evidence collected over the course of the review and on the advice of Canada's security and intelligence community and other government partners," Champagne added.</p>

<p>TikTok said it will challenge the order in court.</p>

<p>"Shutting down TikTok's Canadian offices and destroying hundreds of well-paying local jobs is not in anyone's best interest, and today's shutdown order will do just that," a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement.</p>

<p>Canada has banned the TikTok app from government-issued devices, saying it presents an unacceptable level of risk to privacy and security.</p>

<p>TikTok and ByteDance sued in U.S. federal court in May, seeking to block a law signed by President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>The law, signed by Biden on April 24, gives ByteDance until Jan. 19 to sell TikTok or face a ban. The White House has said it wants to see Chinese-based ownership ended on national-security grounds but not a ban on TikTok.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican Donald Trump on Wednesday sealed his historic comeback to the White House and defeated his Democrat rival Kamala Harris despite a criminal conviction and two impeachments while in office. The 78-year-old, who will be the oldest person ever to take the presidential oath when inaugurated on January 20, won wider margins than before to become the 47th president of the United States of America.</p>

<p>After his landslide victory over <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-elections-2024-explained-why-kamala-harriss-historic-white-house-bid-fell-short-6959507#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll" target="_blank">Harris</a>, who would have become America's first woman president if Democrat's bet to replace Joe Biden with her had worked, vowed to fulfil his slogan to "make America great again".</p>

<p>Here's a look at the new Trump administration set to bring a contrarian cast of characters into the White House.</p>

<h3><strong>JD Vance</strong></h3>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/from-donald-trump-s-critic-to-vice-president-jd-vance-signals-new-era-for-republican-party-6957981" target="_blank">JD Vance</a>, who once described Donald Trump as America's "Hitler", is set to enter the White House as Vice President.</p>

<p>The 40-year-old author of the best-selling memoir "Hillbilly Elegy" had repeatedly criticized Trump before joining his team.</p>

<p>He will become the third-youngest vice president in US history.</p>

<h3><strong>Elon Musk</strong></h3>

<p>In 2022, tech billionaire <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-elections-2024-ndtv-analysis-elon-musk-donald-trump-and-worlds-largest-maga-megaphone-6938456" target="_blank">Elon Musk</a> had suggested that Donald Trump "hang up his hat and sail into the sunset."</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2024, he played an unprecedented role in Trump's presidential bid, spending more than $110 million of his personal fortune to get the Republican elected.</p>

<p>Trump has said that he will ask Musk, the boss of SpaceX, Tesla and X (formerly Twitter), to do a complete audit of the US government to drastically cut waste.</p>

<p>Musk, 53, is also likely to be a highly influential adviser on space and business policy.</p>

<h3><strong>Robert Kennedy Jr</strong></h3>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/in-donald-trumps-victory-speech-a-shout-out-to-bobby-kennedy-what-it-could-be-6957529#pfrom=home-ndtv_topstories" target="_blank">Robert Kennedy Jr</a>, the nephew of former US president John F Kennedy, initially ran as an independent in the 2024 US presidential election, but withdrew from the race and endorsed <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trumps-day-1-promise-to-shut-clean-energy-projects-send-stocks-tumbling-6959675#pfrom=home-ndtv_topscroll" target="_blank">Donald Trump</a>.</p>

<p>Trump has pledged during his campaign to give a "big role" in healthcare to RFK Jr, who has said he wants to remove fluoride from the US water supply.</p>

<p>The 70-year-old, who is the son of US's former attorney general and senator Robert F Kennedy, is widely rumoured to be a contender for a cabinet position, with speculation centering on the role of secretary of health and human services.</p>

<p>Kennedy will "make America healthy again," Trump said in his victory speech on Wednesday.</p>

<h3><strong>Who Else May Feature In Trump 2.0</strong></h3>

<p>The name of Richard Grenell, former US ambassador to Germany, is doing rounds for the post of national security advisor or secretary of state in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/magnificent-victory-for-american-people-donald-trump-on-us-election-result-6955510#pfrom=home-uselections_uselexhome" target="_blank">Donald Trump 2.0</a>.</p>

<p>Senior campaign aide Susie Wiles, who many see as the architect of Trump's comeback, could serve as White House chief of staff.</p>

<p>North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum is being considered for the post of Energy Secretary, and Senator Tom Cotton for Defense.</p>

<p>Other Republicans who are reportedly open to serving in the new Trump administration include former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, Elise Stefanik and Lee Zeldin.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 presidential election, several celebrities who had supported Kamala Harris slammed the Republican leader. Among them was Grammy-winning rapper Cardi B, who was seen campaigning for Ms Harris last week. Taking to Instagram, she posted a video of herself watching the election results, exclaiming, "I hate y'all bad". In an Instagram Live, she also vented her frustration with Trump supporters, saying, "I swear to God, I'm gonna f*** you up, get away from me."&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the video, the 32-year-old read aloud a comment from a fan that said, "Cardi we need you at the Trump inauguration." To this, the rapper responded, "I swear to god I'm gonna f-k you up, get away from me. I'm sick of you! Burn you're f***ing hats motherf***er. I'm really sad. I swear to god I'm really sad," per the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/06/entertainment/cardi-b-alec-baldwin-fume-over-2024-election-result-as-trump-emerges-victorious/" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>New York Post</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cardi B, whose real name is Belcalis Cephus, added that she's "proud" of Vice President Kamala Harris. "No matter what, I know that she's probably emotional right now. I know there's probably a lot going on in her mind and I know she's not listening to this, but she will eventually see it," she said.</p>

<p>"I just hope she knows no matter what happens tonight, millions of people are proud of her. Women around the world are proud of her. Women of colour are proud of her," the rapper continued.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"When I look at her face and she was talking to me, I thought she was very genuine and not playing any f***ing games," Cardi B went on. "She had 100 days to do all of this and she woke this nation up. I feel there was a lot of things that went wrong last year and they kept her too much in the background. I'm proud of her and I hope she's proud of herself no matter what happens tonight. This is one of the most unforgettable elections and I love her. I don't say I love a lot of people, y'all know that. Because I hate everybody," she added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Separately, the rapper also posted a long statement on Instagram. "To Vice President Kamala Harris, no matter what they've said to bring you down or belittle your run for presidency they can never say you didn't run your race with honesty and integrity!" she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Several other Hollywood celebrities, including Alex Baldwin, Jamie Lee Curtis and Christina Applegate, also expressed their frustration on social media over the 2024 presidential election results.</p>

<p>Taking to Instagram, Jamie Lee Curtis wrote, "Many, minority groups and young people will be afraid. Gay and trans people will be more afraid. We know that many women will now find it difficult to get the reproductive healthcare that they need and deserve. For all those people there will be those who will help you. Me included," she wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Similarly, Christina Applegate also expressed her anger at the result. "Why? Give me your reasons why????? My child is sobbing because her rights as a woman may be taken away. Why?And if you disagree , please unfollow me," she wrote one X.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Author Stephen King also weighed in on the result, writing on X, "There's a sign you can see in many shops that sell beautiful but fragile items: LOVELY TO LOOK AT, DELIGHTFUL TO HOLD, BUT ONCE YOU BREAK IT, THEN IT'S SOLD. You can say the same about democracy."</p>

<p>Notably, Donald Trump became the 47th President of the United States as he won the electoral college in Wisconsin state and secured the required majority of 270 over Democrat rival Kamala Harris. At 78, he will be the oldest President during his inauguration scheduled on January 20.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Germany entered a major political crisis on Wednesday with the collapse of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's ruling coalition likely paving the way for early elections next year.</p>

<p>The turmoil hits Europe's biggest economy as it grapples with a sustained downturn and as Berlin worries about the impact Donald Trump's return to the White House will have on trade and security ties.</p>

<p>Scholz said he would seek a vote of confidence by January 15 so that MPs "can decide whether to clear the way for early elections" which could be held by late March -- six months earlier than scheduled.</p>

<p>The Social Democrat leader spoke after firing his rebellious Finance Minister Christian Lindner of the Free Democrats in a dramatic night session of what was a three-party coalition, declaring there was no longer any "basis of trust" with Lindner.</p>

<p>The embattled chancellor also said he would seek talks with the conservative Christian Democratic Union's leader Friedrich Merz with the offer to "work together constructively on issues that are crucial for our country".</p>

<p>Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck signalled that his Greens party, the third alliance partner, would stay on in a minority government and "continue to fulfil our obligations".</p>

<p>The Greens' Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the political chaos in Berlin at such a globally volatile time meant that "this is not a good day for Germany and not a good day for Europe".</p>

<p>- Trump's shadow -</p>

<p>Scholz fired Lindner during a crunch meeting of senior figures from all three ideologically disparate parties, which have rowed for months over economic and budget issues.</p>

<p>Lindner had proposed sweeping reforms to jumpstart the troubled German economy that the other two parties opposed.</p>

<p>He had long flirted with bolting the unhappy coalition and repeatedly warned of "an autumn of decisions" as difficult budget talks loomed.</p>

<p>Scholz, after sacking Linder -- who took three other FDP cabinet ministers with him -- bitterly attacked the minister for his "petty political tactics" and accused him of a level of egoism that is "completely incomprehensible".</p>

<p>Scholz cited the re-election of Trump, Germany's economic woes and the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East as reasons for why Europe's top economy now needs political certainty.</p>

<p>"We now need clarity on how we can soundly finance our security and defence in the coming years without jeopardising the cohesion of the country," he said. "With a view to the election in America, this is perhaps more urgent than ever."</p>

<p>With the German economy expected to shrink for the second year in a row, Lindner has demanded corporate tax cuts, eased climate regulations and a reduction of social benefits.</p>

<p>Many of those ideas are anathema to Scholz's SPD, Germany's traditional workers' party and the left-leaning Greens.</p>

<p>The bitter dispute has seen Scholz, Lindner and Habeck present contradictory economic plans and hold rival meetings with business leaders, deepening the sense of dysfunction and weakening Scholz's authority.</p>

<p>- 'Situation is serious' -</p>

<p>Scholz said he had offered Lindner a plan with steps to bring down energy costs and boost investment for companies, secure auto industry jobs and keep up support for Ukraine.</p>

<p>But Linder -- a fiscal hawk and strong opponent of raising new debt -- had shown "no willingness" to accept it, Scholz said, adding that "I no longer want to subject our country to such behaviour".</p>

<p>Scholz and his mutinous coalition partners have drawn withering fire from Merz, who has long demanded early elections in which polls suggest he would be the frontrunner.</p>

<p>"We cannot afford to argue for another year," CDU lawmaker Norbert Roettgen said after Trump's victory. "Germany is important in Europe, and if the government can't live up to that, then it must make way now."</p>

<p>Late Wednesday, the head of the CDU's Bavarian sister party CSU, Markus Soeder, demanded an immediate vote of confidence, warning that "there must be no tactical delays".</p>

<p>Alice Weidel of the far-right Alternative for Germany party, now polling in second place, made the same demand, calling the end of the coalition a long-overdue "liberation for our country".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Of the view that the comeback of president-elect Donald Trump is the American comeback, entrepreneur-turned-politician Vivek Ramaswamy on Wednesday said that the country deserves a "badass commander-in-chief" right now and that's exactly what it got.</p>

<p>Trump, 78, not only won the November 5 presidential elections in both popular votes and electoral college votes but also got the Republican Party control of the House of Representatives and the Senate.</p>

<p>"Here's the reason why Donald Trump won by the largest margin of any president in modern history. He's not an ideologue. He's not a policy wonk. He's an American badass. They tried to DQ him, jail him, kill him (twice). None of it worked. Our self-appointed 'betters' in the media misunderstood him, underestimated him, doubted him," Ramaswamy said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>"But not once during this campaign did Trump misunderstand, underestimate, or doubt himself. As everyone at Mar-a-Lago celebrated around him last night, I watched him unfazed, with full conviction that he was exactly where he was destined to be," he said.</p>

<p>"He's just like our nation in that way. We've always believed it was our manifest destiny to be exceptional, to be the greatest nation on Earth, to show the world what's possible for humanity to achieve, even when other countries doubted us. Some still do today," Ramaswamy said.</p>

<p>"But they're wrong. Trump's comeback is the American comeback. Our nation deserves a badass commander-in-chief right now and that's exactly what we got. Funny how well our democracy actually works," said the former Republican presidential aspirant.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe Biden hoped Kamala Harris would salvage his legacy as the man who saved America from Donald Trump. Instead, it lies in tatters.</p>

<p>The 81-year-old's pride made him resist growing concerns about his age, health and mental acuity until it was too late, and a disastrous debate against Trump forced him to drop his bid for a second term barely three months before Election Day.</p>

<p>Biden cast the decision as a move to "pass the torch" to a new generation of leadership in the form of his vice president, whom he endorsed as the new Democratic nominee.</p>

<p>Had Harris won, the rows over his age and refusal to bow out earlier would have been forgiven by the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>Biden would have been able to celebrate a list of achievements in his one term that included guiding the country out of the Covid crisis, passing historic legislation, building infrastructure and promoting green energy.</p>

<p>On the foreign front he helped Ukraine's fight against Russia's invasion and hoped, against hope, that he could still end Israel's conflict in Gaza.</p>

<p>US presidents famously always have an eye on the way they will be judged by history, and it was therefore in his interest that Harris should win against Trump.</p>

<p>Harris was "very much a legacy project," for Biden, said Frank Sesno, a professor at George Washington University and former White House correspondent.</p>

<p>But Democrats are now likely to judge Biden far more harshly.</p>

<p>His bid for a second term was "perhaps a little bit of arrogance, or over-reaching," Alex Keena, an associate professor of political science at Virginia Commonwealth University, told AFP.</p>

<p>Back in 2020 Biden had run on a promise to be a transitional president, but his decision to seek four more years meant that when he dropped out there was no time for a proper primary to find a replacement.</p>

<p>"It was a missed opportunity for the Democrats to nominate someone with broad appeal," said Keena.</p>

<p>"Granted, they might have nominated Kamala Harris... but as a result, the country didn't get a chance to really know Kamala Harris or see her fight for the Democratic base."</p>

<p>- 'Terrible feeling' -</p>

<p>In fact Biden had convinced himself that having beaten Trump once, he was the only man who could beat him again.</p>

<p>It was in character for a proud and often stubborn man who loved to cite his family's mantra that "when you get knocked down, get back up again."</p>

<p>From playground punch-ups to a stutter to the terrible tragedy of losing his wife and baby daughter in a car crash, Biden had long seen his life as a series of comebacks against impossible odds.</p>

<p>Biden even said Trump's first term was an "aberration."</p>

<p>But now it is Trump making the comeback -- and it is Biden's single term in office that will be the outlier between two Trump terms.</p>

<p>Biden's remaining two and a half months in office will see him try to salvage what he can of the legacy he craves.</p>

<p>The Democrat began the effort within hours of Trump's victory, reaching out to invite him to the White House and promising a peaceful transition of power -- a stark contrast to the Republican's unprecedented refusal to do the same when he lost to Biden.</p>

<p>He will address the nation on Thursday to "discuss the election results and the transition," the White House said.</p>

<p>Biden is seeking to seize the moral high ground over a man who not only wouldn't accept the 2020 election result, but tried to hold onto power, stymied the transition process and refused to attend the incoming Democrat's inauguration.</p>

<p>But it won't come easy.</p>

<p>"That's got to be a terrible feeling," said Keena, adding that Biden would have to "make a decision about how cordial he is."</p>

<p>Biden will also know that Trump is likely to immediately set about dismantling key parts of his achievements, from green energy to his backing of Ukraine.</p>

<p>"Knowing that Trump is going to try very hard to undo his legacy, it has to be that has to be a terrible way to go out for somebody who's served for so many years in public service," Keena added.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australia will move to pass new laws banning children under 16 from social media, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Thursday, vowing to crack down on tech companies failing to protect young users.</p>

<p>"This one is for the mums and dads. Social media is doing real harm to kids and I'm calling time on it," he told reporters.</p>

<p>Albanese first mooted a social media age limit earlier this year, but it is the first time he has put a firm number on it.</p>

<p>Tech giants and social media platforms will bear the responsibility for ensuring users are old enough, Albanese said, rather than parents who were "worried sick about the safety of their kids online".</p>

<p>"The onus will not be on parents or young people. There will be no penalties for users."</p>

<p>Earlier proposals to introduce a social media age limit have enjoyed broad bipartisan support in Australia.</p>

<p>Albanese said the new laws would be presented to state and territory leaders this week, before being introduced to parliament in late November.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former president Barack Obama on Wednesday congratulated Donald Trump on his election victory, noting the importance of a peaceful transfer of power.</p>

<p>Obama's comments stand in stark contrast with Trump's unprecedented refusal four years ago to concede defeat to Joe Biden, culminating with the violent attack by his supporters on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.</p>

<p>"This is obviously not the outcome we had hoped for," Obama said in a statement. "But living in a democracy is about recognizing that our point of view won't always win out, and being willing to accept the peaceful transfer of power."</p>

<p>The ex-president also voiced pride over the efforts of Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate Tim Walz, who were soundly beaten in the election.</p>

<p>Obama called them "two extraordinary public servants who ran a remarkable campaign."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Wednesday fired his rebellious Finance Minister Christian Lindner, spelling doom for the three-party coalition though Scholz could stay on in a minority government.</p>

<p>The move came after weeks of bitter feuding that have rocked the coalition government between Scholz's Social Democrats, Lindner's Free Democrats and the Greens.</p>

<p>Scholz fired his finance minister during a crunch meeting of senior figures from all three ideologically disparate parties at the chancellery, Scholz's spokesman Steffen Hebestreit told AFP.</p>

<p>The chancellery scheduled a press conference for 2015 GMT, and Lindner announced statements to the media shortly after, to be followed by Greens politicians.</p>

<p>Fiscal hawk Lindner had proposed sweeping reforms to jumpstart the troubled German economy that the other two parties opposed, and had long flirted with bolting the unhappy coalition.</p>

<p>He had repeatedly warned of "an autumn of decisions" as difficult budget talks have loomed.</p>

<p>Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck of the Greens had warned that the US presidential election, Germany's economic woes and the Ukraine and Middle East wars make this "the worst time for the government to fail".</p>

<p>The Bild daily reported that on Wednesday he told the other parties that the talks of recent days had shown there was not enough common ground on economic and financial policy.</p>

<p>Lindner had argued that Donald Trump's US presidential election victory had made an economic turnaround even more urgent.</p>

<p>The newspaper added that Lindner had suggested that the parties opt for new elections in early 2025, but that Scholz had rejected the proposal.</p>

<p>If confirmed, this would suggest the Social Democrats and the Greens will seek to stay in power as a minority government until scheduled elections in September 2025.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris conceded the presidential election to Donald Trump after an acrimonious, turbulent and polarising campaign. In her speech, the Democratic leader said though she has conceded the election, she has not conceded "the fight that fuelled this campaign."</p>

<p>"While I concede the election, I do not concede the fight that fuelled this campaign. Fight for freedom, opportunity, dignity for all people," Ms Harris said in a speech that lasted less than 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Her supporters cheered, even though she admitted it was painful to lose. She told them to "keep fighting".</p>

<p>"... I will close with this. Only when it is dark enough, can you see the stars. I know many people feel we are entering a dark time... Let us fill the sky with the light of billions and billions of stars, the light of truth, optimism and service," she said.</p>

<p>"The outcome of this election is not what we wanted, not what we fought for, not what we voted for, but hear me when I say that the light of America's promise will always burn bright as long as we never give up and as long as we keep fighting," she told supporters.</p>

<p>"We must accept the results of this election. Earlier today, I spoke with President-elect Trump and congratulated him on his victory," Ms Harris told supporters in the concession speech at her alma mater Howard University in Washington.</p>

<p>"I also told him that we will help him and his team with their transition, and that we will engage in a peaceful transfer of power," she said.</p>

<p>Mr Trump's victory, following one of the most hostile campaigns in modern US history, was all the more remarkable given an unprecedented criminal conviction, a near-miss assassination attempt, and warnings from a former chief of staff that he is a "fascist."</p>

<p>Mr Trump had never conceded defeat four years ago when his supporters ransacked the US Capitol. He returned to the White House with wider margins than before despite a criminal conviction, two impeachments while last in office and warnings from his former chief of staff that he was a "fascist."</p>

<p>At 78, Mr Trump will be the oldest President during his inauguration scheduled on January 20. Had Ms Harris won, she would have been the first woman president of the US. "It's a political victory that our country has never seen before," Mr Trump said earlier today in his victory speech.</p>

<p>Global leaders swiftly pledged to work with Mr Trump, despite concerns in some parts of the world about his "America First" approach. Among the most worried countries will be Ukraine, which Russia invaded in 2022.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi was among the first leaders who dialled Mr Trump to congratulate him. "Had a great conversation with my friend, President Donald Trump, congratulating him on his spectacular victory. Looking forward to working closely together once again to further strengthen India-US relations across technology, defence, energy, space and several other sectors," PM Modi said in a post on X.</p>

<p>Mr Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance have scoffed at the billions of dollars in US assistance to Ukraine under outgoing President Joe Biden, with their aides musing about forcing Ukraine to make concessions to end the war.</p>

<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky congratulated Trump and said he hoped the new US leader would help Ukraine find a "just peace."</p>

<p>Ms Harris entered the race in July after the visibly ageing Biden dropped out. She ran a centrist campaign that highlighted Mr Trump's inflammatory messaging and use of racist and sexist tropes. But his apocalyptic warnings about immigration found their mark with voters battered by the post-Covid economy and eager for change after the Biden years.</p>]]></content:encoded>

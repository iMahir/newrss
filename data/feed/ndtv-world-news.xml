       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yemen's Houthi rebels conducted drone strikes in Israel's Tel Aviv early this morning, backing the Palestinian and Lebanese wars against Israel. The operation achieved its goals as the drones successfully reached their targets, the Houthis said in a statement.</p>

<p>"The Drone Air Force of the Yemeni Armed Forces carried out a military operation targeting a vital target in the Yaffa area "Tel Aviv" in occupied Palestine using several Yaffa drones. The operation successfully achieved its goals, with the drones reaching their targets without the enemy being able to intercept or down them," said statement read.</p>

<p>The armed forces said the attack, which was part of its fifth phase of the "Battle of the Promised Conquest", was in support of the people of Palestine and Lebanon, and Hamas's "Al-Aqsa Flood".</p>

<p>Houthis rebels, who control most parts of Yemen and consider Israel their enemy, entered the war in support of the Hamas after the conflict started in the Middle East last year. They are part of Iran's "Axis of Resistance" against Israel and the United States.</p>

<p>Houthis have fired multiple missiles at Israeli cities while Israel has been conducting airstrikes in Yemen, targeting crucial infrastructure including power plants. Seaports used by Houthi rebels to transfer Iranian weapons also came under attack in recent times.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Indian-American professor, Shailaja Paik, conducting research on and writing about Dalit women has received a $800,000 "genius" grant from the MacArthur Foundation which gives out awards every year to people with extraordinary achievements or potential.</p>

<p>Announcing her fellowship, the Foundation said, "Through her focus on the multifaceted experiences of Dalit women, Paik elucidates the enduring nature of caste discrimination and the forces that perpetuate untouchability."</p>

<p>Ms Paik is a distinguished research professor of history at the University of Cincinnati, where she is also an affiliate faculty in Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies, and Asian Studies.</p>

<p>"Paik provides new insight into the history of caste domination and traces the ways in which gender and sexuality are used to deny Dalit women dignity and personhood," the Foundation said.</p>

<p>The MacArthur Fellowships, popularly known as "genius" grants, are given to people across a spectrum from academia and science to arts and activism, who according to the Foundation are "extraordinarily talented and creative individuals as an investment in their potential".</p>

<p>The selections are made anonymously based on recommendations received and it does not allow applications or lobbying for the grants, which come without any strings and are spread over five years.</p>

<p>The Foundation said that her recent project focused "on the lives of women performers of Tamasha, a popular form of bawdy folk theatre that has been practised predominantly by Dalits in Maharashtra for centuries".</p>

<p>"Despite the state's efforts to reframe Tamasha as an honourable and quintessentially Marathi cultural practice, ashlil (the mark of vulgarity) sticks to Dalit Tamasha women," it said.</p>

<p>Based on the project, she published a book, "The Vulgarity of Caste: Dalits, Sexuality, and Humanity in Modern India".</p>

<p>It said, "Paik also critiques the narrative of Dr B.R. Ambedkar, the twentieth century's most influential caste abolitionist" and the architect of India's Constitution.</p>

<p>In an interview with National Public Radio (NPR), the US government-subsidised broadcaster, she said that she was herself a member of the Dalit community who grew up in Pune in a slum area and was inspired by her father's dedication to education.</p>

<p>After getting her masters' degree from the Savitribai Phule University in Pune, she went to the University of Warwick in the UK for her PhD.</p>

<p>She did a stint as a visiting assistant professor of South Asian history at Yale University.</p>

<p>Since the programme began in 1981, fellowships have been granted to 1,153 people.</p>

<p>Previous MacArthur Fellows include writers Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, and Ved Mehta, poet A.K. Ramanujam, economists Raj Chetty and Sendhil Mullainathan, mathematician L Mahadevan, computer scientists Subhash Khot and Shwetak Patel, physical biologist Manu Prakash, musician Vijay Gupta, community organiser Raj Jayadev, and lawyer and activist Sujatha Baliga.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The World Economic Forum has launched the Playbook of Solutions, a digital platform that shares 100 successful ways to unlock funding for clean energy in 47 developing countries.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.weforum.org/press/2024/10/new-digital-platform-outlines-100-actionable-solutions-for-unlocking-clean-energy-investment-in-emerging-markets/#:~:text=The%20World%20Economic%20Forum%20launches,energy%20financing%20in%20developing%20economies">World Economic Forum</a> has launched the Playbook of Solutions, a digital platform that shares 100 successful ways to unlock funding for clean energy in 47 developing countries. These solutions aim to speed up the shift to renewable energy by showing how policy changes, financial tools and partnerships can attract investments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To meet the global goal of tripling renewable energy by 2030, investment in clean energy needs to increase significantly, especially in emerging economies, which will account for most of the world's energy demand by 2035. However, these countries currently receive only a small share of global clean energy investments due to risks and regulatory challenges.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Policy measures:</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Energy Policy: </strong>Focus on providing incentives (like feed-in tariffs) and improving licensing processes for renewable energy projects.</li>
	<li><strong>Climate Policy: </strong>Set long-term goals for reducing emissions and adopt carbon pricing strategies.</li>
	<li><strong>Financial Market Policy: </strong>Ensure access to long-term financing and improve credit ratings for renewable energy projects.</li>
	<li><strong>Investment Policy: </strong>Treat foreign and domestic investors equally, protect intellectual property, and enforce contracts to reduce risks.</li>
	<li><strong>Integrated Country Platforms: </strong>Use comprehensive strategies, like Egypt's renewable energy laws and financial packages, to attract investment.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>De-risking Tools:</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Portfolio Approaches:</strong> Diversifying investments to manage risk.</li>
	<li><strong>Blended Finance: </strong>Combining public and private funds to reduce risks.</li>
	<li><strong>Guarantees and Insurances: </strong>Tools like government guarantees to protect investors.</li>
	<li><strong>Refinancing: </strong>Lowering costs through favourable loans or refinancing options.</li>
	<li><strong>Currency Risk Mitigation: </strong>Managing currency fluctuations to protect investments.</li>
	<li><strong>Better Transparency: </strong>Ensuring transparency to build investor confidence.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Finance Mechanisms:</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Equity Financing: </strong>Investors provide capital for a share of profits.</li>
	<li><strong>Debt Financing:</strong> Borrowing funds for clean energy projects.</li>
	<li><strong>Bonds:</strong> Issuing bonds to raise money for renewable energy projects.</li>
	<li><strong>Debt Swaps:</strong> Exchanging debt for investments in clean energy.</li>
	<li><strong>Energy Service Agreements:</strong> Contracts where companies provide energy services in return for payment.</li>
	<li><strong>Purchase Agreements: </strong>Long-term contracts to buy clean energy.</li>
	<li><strong>Carbon Financing: </strong>Earning funds from carbon credits by reducing emissions.</li>
</ul>

<p>India is aiming to add 300 GW of renewable energy by 2030, which presents significant investment opportunities. To attract clean energy investments, the country has implemented integrated policies and financial incentives, including tax benefits. It has also established the Greenhouse Gas Program to monitor emissions effectively. India also started a fossil fuel subsidy swap in 2013 to level the playing field between fossil fuels and renewable energy sources.</p>

<h2><strong>Key concepts related to clean energy financing:</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Counterparty Guarantees: </strong>A party guarantees another will fulfil a third party's obligations.</li>
	<li><strong>Liquidity Facilities: </strong>Short-term funding to cover cash flow gaps.</li>
	<li><strong>Convertible Instruments: </strong>Products that can convert into equity, reducing investment risks.</li>
	<li><strong>Refinancing: </strong>Changing loan terms to improve borrowing conditions.</li>
	<li><strong>All-Equity Bridge Financing: </strong>Temporary funding for short-term expenses until long-term financing is secured.</li>
	<li><strong>Project Preparation Activities: </strong>Steps taken before financial closure to minimise risks.</li>
	<li><strong>Technical Assistance: </strong>Advisory support to reduce transaction risks.</li>
	<li><strong>Project Preparation Facilities (PPFs): </strong>Funding structures for project preparation.</li>
	<li><strong>Currency Risk Mitigation: </strong>Strategies to protect against currency fluctuations.</li>
	<li><strong>Local Currency Financing: </strong>Borrowing in the currency of income to reduce risks.</li>
	<li><strong>Equity Financing: </strong>Investors own shares in projects, providing long-term capital.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists announced on Thursday a milestone in neurobiological research with the mapping of the entire brain of an adult fruit fly, a feat that may provide insight into brains across the animal kingdom, including people.</p>

<p>The research detailed more than 50 million connections between more than 139,000 neurons - brain nerve cells - in the insect, a species whose scientific name is Drosophila melanogaster and is often used in neurobiological studies. The research sought to decipher how brains are wired and the signals underlying healthy brain functions. It also could pave the way for mapping the brains of other species.</p>

<p>"You might be asking why we should care about the brain of a fruit fly. My simple answer is that if we can truly understand how any brain functions, it's bound to tell us something about all brains," said Princeton University professor of neuroscience and computer science Sebastian Seung, one of the co-leaders of the work published in a series of studies in the journal Nature.</p>

<p>While some people may be more interested in swatting flies than studying them, some of the researchers found aesthetic satisfaction in peering at the fruit fly brain, less than 0.04 inches (1 mm) wide.</p>

<p>"It's beautiful," said University of Cambridge neuroscientist and research co-leader Gregory Jefferis.</p>

<p>The map devised by the researchers provided a wiring diagram, known as a connectome, for the brain of an adult fruit fly. Similar research previously was conducted with simpler organisms, such as the worm Caenorhabditis elegans and the fruit fly's larval stage. The adult fruit fly presented more complicated behaviours to study through its brain wiring.</p>

<p>"One of the major questions we're addressing is how the wiring in the brain, its neurons and connections, can give rise to animal behaviour," said Princeton neuroscientist Mala Murthy, another of the co-leaders of the research.</p>

<p>"And flies are an important model system for neurosciences. Their brains solve many of the same problems we do... They're capable of sophisticated behaviours like the execution of walking and flying, learning and memory behaviours, navigation, feeding and even social interactions, which is a behaviour that we studied in my lab at Princeton," Murthy added.</p>

<p>One of the studies analyzed brain circuits underlying walking and discovered how flies halt. Another analyzed the fly's taste network and grooming circuits behind behavior such as when it uses a leg to remove dirt from its antennae. Another looked at the visual system including how the fly's eyes process motion and color information. Still, another one analyzed connectivity through the brain, discovering a large assemblage of "hub neurons" that may speed up information flow.</p>

<p>The researchers fashioned a map tracking the organization of the hemispheres and behavioural circuits inside the fly's brain. They also identified the full set of cell classes in its brain, pinpointing different varieties of neurons and chemical connections - synapses - between these nerve cells, and looked at the types of chemicals secreted by the neurons.</p>

<p>The work was conducted by a large international collaboration of scientists known as the FlyWire Consortium.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A father from Indiana, USA, has been handed the maximum prison sentence of 16 years after his six-month-old baby was severely disfigured in a rat attack inside what prosecutors described as a “house of horrors.”</p>

<p>In September 2023, the infant was found covered in blood with more than 50 rat bites. According to the local Vanderburgh County Prosecutor's Office, David Schonabaum called 911 from his house, saying his infant son in his bassinet was covered in blood. The father told the first responders that there was a rat infestation in the house. "The 6-month-old baby was found in his bassinet in a pool of blood with over 50 bites to his body including his face and extremities. The infant's right hand suffered the most traumatic injuries with all four fingers and the thumb missing flesh and exposing the fingertip bones," the prosecutor's office said.</p>

<p>The rat attack “permanently disfigured” the baby and, as a result, he will “suffer for a lifetime,” it added.</p>

<p>Prosecutor Diana Moers said, “This case is horrific, and we will live with the images of this baby forever. It is completely shocking to the conscience that anyone would live in these conditions, much less allow their children, baby, and animals to live among absolute filth when they cannot help themselves,” adding, “This baby lived in an absolute house of horrors along with his siblings and pet dog.”</p>

<p>Schonabaum was convicted in September 2024 on three felony charges related to the neglect and endangerment of his children. According to a report on Fox 59, he was sentenced to 16 years in prison on October 2, 2024. Angel Schonabaum, the child's mother, entered a plea agreement last week and is set to be sentenced later this month. Meanwhile, Delaina Thurman, the baby's aunt, received a sentence of probation earlier this year for her role in the neglect.</p>

<p>The family's home was found to be in a state of extreme neglect, with authorities describing it as infested with rats, piled high with clutter, and filled with trash, bugs, and rat droppings. According to the Vanderburgh County Prosecutor's Office, “Three children in the home had been bitten by rats before the injuries the 6-month-old had suffered,” prompting involvement from the Indiana Department of Child Services. Despite interventions and warnings, conditions in the home remained unchanged, leaving the children in ongoing danger.</p>

<p>“It is also unimaginable how a rat was able to do such damage to this infant before his father called for help,” added Prosecutor Diana Moers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres underscored Mahatma Gandhi's message of non-violence, peace and equality as he voiced deep concern over a world "bristling with violence" and conflicts raging from Ukraine to the Middle East.</p>

<p>“On the International Day of non-violence, we commemorate the birthday of Mahatma Gandhi and reaffirm the values to which he dedicated his life: equality, respect, peace and justice,” Mr Guterres said in his message for the day, commemorating Gandhi's birthday on October 2.</p>

<p>Voicing concern that the world today is bristling with violence, Mr Guterres said across the globe, conflicts are raging.</p>

<p>“From Ukraine to Sudan, the Middle East and far beyond, war is creating a hellscape of destruction, destitution and fear. Inequality and climate chaos are undermining the foundations of peace. And hate whipped up online is spilling over onto the streets,” he said.</p>

<p>The UN chief underscored that Gandhi believed non-violence was the greatest force available to humanity, more powerful than any weapon. He called on the international community to together build institutions to “support that noble vision.” A special event was planned on Wednesday at the UN headquarters titled 'Gandhian Values and UN Charter', organised by the Permanent Mission of India to the UN to commemorate the International Day of Non-Violence.</p>

<p>During that event, Ivor Fung, Chef de Cabinet of the President of the 79th session of the United Nations General Assembly Philemon Yang, said that Gandhi's life stands as a powerful testament to the effectiveness of peaceful protests, inspiring people across the world, particularly in Asia and Africa.</p>

<p>Delivering a message on behalf of Yang, Mr Fung said that leaders such as Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King Jr were deeply influenced by Gandhi's concept of ‘Satyagraha'.</p>

<p>“As the world endures a turbulent period with conflicts raging in Gaza, Lebanon, Myanmar, Sudan, Ukraine and elsewhere, the Mahatma's message of peace resonates more strongly than ever,” he said.</p>

<p>Mr Fung called on members of the international community to not only honour the values that Gandhi embodied but reaffirm “our commitment to the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.</p>

<p>“Let us resolve to end conflict, halt violence, protect human rights and strive for a more just and equitable world. By doing so, we carry forward the legacy of Gandhi and the founders of the United Nations, shaping a future where peace and justice prevail.”</p>

<p>In his address, India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Parvathaneni Harish said that today when the world grapples with violence, armed conflicts and humanitarian emergencies, the ideals of non-violence, dialogue and tolerance, promulgated by Gandhi continue to “guide our actions in ensuring peace and stability around the world." Earlier in the day, Harish paid floral tribute to the bust of Mahatma Gandhi at the North Lawns of the United Nations.</p>

<p>He said the bust “stands as a reminder to humanity to follow his ideals in letter and spirit and to create a better and peaceful world, which is a fundamental objective of the United Nations.” Harish stressed that the story of India reflects Mahatma Gandhi's belief that strength comes from righteousness, not force; that power comes from truth, not might, and that victory comes from moral courage, not imposed submission.</p>

<p>Harish said that today's commemoration “helps us in reflecting on the life” of Gandhi and reaffirming the universal relevance of the principle of non-violence to secure a culture of peace, of tolerance and understanding around the world.</p>

<p>Addressing the special event, Sri Lanka's Permanent Representative to the United Nations Ambassador Mohan Pieris said that the present-day world is passing through a period of transition.</p>

<p>“Unimaginable changes have been witnessed these past years,” he said.</p>

<p>Pieris drew a comparison between the “highest values that have been prescribed for humanity by one of the greatest of humankind and an entity which has been created by we the people in a Charter with the intention to uphold the highest values of freedom for humankind in the hope of ensuring that we live in peace and in dignity.” Pieris said that the UN Charter's focus on the peaceful resolution of conflicts and the prevention of wars “mirrors Gandhi's lifelong commitment to resolving disputes through dialogue and non-violent means.” He said that Gandhi's principle of ‘Ahimsa', non-violence in thought, word and action is foundational to his worldview.</p>

<p>Non-violence is a way of living in harmony with others.</p>

<p>"Now, when you contrast that with Article 1 of the UN Charter, it stresses the importance of maintaining international peace and security through peaceful means, mirroring, I say, Gandhi's advocacy for non-violent resolution.” Pieris highlighted that Gandhi's philosophy directly has a profound influence on the founding values of the United Nations, and has continued to inspire international movements.</p>

<p>He however noted that while Gandhian values align with the UN Charter, “some critics argue that the global system, including the United Nations, often prioritises Western political and economic interests which may conflict with Gandhian vision of decentralised power and economic independence.” He said that as the UN continues its efforts towards global peace and justice, the principles of nonviolence, truth, and equality as espoused by Gandhi remain crucial in shaping a more just and sustainable future.</p>

<p>The UN observes the International Day of Non-Violence on October 2, the birthday of Mahatma Gandhi.</p>

<p>According to the General Assembly resolution of June 2007, which established the commemoration, the International Day is an occasion to "disseminate the message of non-violence, including through education and public awareness".</p>

<p>The resolution reaffirms "the universal relevance of the principle of non-violence" and the desire "to secure a culture of peace, tolerance, understanding and non-violence".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dozens of tigers and lions in captivity died in the past month in southern Vietnam with tests showing they were positive for bird flu, health ministry and state media said on Thursday.</p>

<p>Two samples taken from dead tigers at Mango Garden Resort in Dong Nai province have tested positive for the H5N1 strain of bird flu, the Ministry of Health said in a statement. Twenty tigers have died at the resort since early last month.</p>

<p>The spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, to mammals including cows, dogs, cats and even dolphins worldwide has raised concerns about potential human-to-human transmission.</p>

<p>In neighbouring Long An province, 27 tigers and three lions died from bird flu at My Quynh Safari from Sept. 6 to 18, state media reported, citing provincial agricultural authorities.</p>

<p>The tigers at Mango Garden Resort had been fed chicken before they died, Phan Van Phuc, an official of Dong Nai province's Centre for Disease Control, said in the health ministry statement.</p>

<p>"It's likely that the tigers had been infected from sick chicken, and the authorities are tracking the source of the chicken to determine the cause," the statement quoted Phan as saying.</p>

<p>On its website, the World Health Organization warns against consuming raw or incompletely cooked meat and eggs from regions experiencing avian influenza outbreaks due to the high risk of infection.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[John McGinty and his wife, Georgia, were involved in an accident in March 2022 when their Uber driver ran a red light and was struck by another vehicle.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A New Jersey couple, severely injured in a car accident during an Uber ride, has been prevented from suing the company after a court ruled they were bound by an arbitration agreement signed while ordering from Uber Eats.</p>

<p>John McGinty&nbsp;and Georgia McGinty were involved in the crash in March 2022, when their Uber driver ran a red light and was struck by another vehicle. The collision left both with significant injuries, including multiple fractures for Georgia and lasting impairment for John.<br />
<br />
According to court filings, they suffered “serious physical, psychological, and financial damages.”<br />
<br />
Despite their injuries, the couple's attempt to take Uber to court for a jury trial was not allowed. The ruling cited the terms and conditions, including a mandatory arbitration clause, of Uber's services. This clause was accepted when the couple's daughter placed a separate order on Uber Eats using Georgia's phone. The court upheld the company's argument that by agreeing to Uber's terms during that transaction, the family waived their right to pursue claims in court.<br />
<br />
The couple argued that it was their minor daughter, using Georgia's phone, who accepted the terms of service for Uber Eats by clicking a button that falsely confirmed she was over 18. However, the court concluded the arbitration agreement, which covers auto accidents and personal injuries, was “valid and enforceable.”<br />
<br />
In response, Uber told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/02/business/uber-eats-accident-lawsuit/index.html" rel="nofollow,noindex">CNN</a> that Georgia “agreed to Uber's terms of use, including the arbitration agreement, on multiple occasions,” and even took rides after agreeing.<br />
<br />
“While the plaintiffs continue to tell the press that it was their daughter who ordered Uber Eats and accepted the terms of use, it's worth noting that in court they could only ‘surmise' that that was the case but could not recall whether ‘their daughter ordered food independently or if Georgia assisted," CNN quoted a spokesperson as saying.<br />
<br />
The couple expressed disappointment in a statement, saying they were “surprised and heartbroken” by the ruling. “We are horrified at what the court's decision suggests: A large corporation like Uber can avoid being sued in a court of law by injured consumers because of contractual language buried in a dozen-page-long user agreement concerning services unrelated to the one that caused the consumers' injuries,” CNN quoted the McGintys as saying.<br />
<br />
Previously, a lower court said that Uber's arbitration clause was not enforceable, arguing the terms of service pop-up did not inform Georgia that she was waiving her right to a judicial trial. However, following an appeal from Uber, the appellate court reversed that decision, siding with the company.<br />
<br />
The McGintys' legal team is considering further action, with their lawyers telling CNN that they will “likely” petition the New Jersey Supreme Court.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sean “Diddy” Combs' famous White Parties in the Hamptons are remembered for their wild, adult-themed antics. However, for one guest, the experience came much earlier than most. Justin Litovsky, now 30, recalls attending the 1999 bash as a six-year-old, unaware that he was walking into one of the summer's most talked-about parties.</p>

<p>Mr Litovsky's parents, David Allen, a photographer, and Maya Litovsky, unknowingly took him to what was billed as a July 3 “afternoon barbecue” hosted by Diddy. However, what they found upon arrival was anything but kid-friendly. The event was packed with bottles of alcohol, scantily clad guests and an atmosphere far removed from what any child might expect at a barbecue.</p>

<p>“I actually wanted to get in,” Mr Litovsky recalled about the pool at the party. “Anytime we went anywhere with a pool, I wanted to swim.” Maya Litovsky told the <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/02/us-news/sean-diddy-combs-party-i-saw-naked-women-when-i-was-6/ ">NY Post</a> that she did not give her son the opportunity to get in there. “There were bottles everywhere and naked women,” she said.</p>

<p>Ms Maya, now an influencer, reflected, “I wasn't sure if this was appropriate or normal. I wondered how kids were allowed into the party to begin with.”</p>

<p>Justin Litovsky admitted he wasn't sure at the time if “t**s were a good thing or a bad thing.”</p>

<p>The guest list included high-profile figures like Jay-Z, Lil' Kim, designer Donna Karan, and model Tyson Beckford.</p>

<p>Though Diddy's parties would later come with a kid curfew, in 1999, Justin Litovsky was the only child at the event. “I don't remember seeing one other child,” he said. “I'm normally the type to want to go play [with other kids].” Despite the unusual circumstances, Mr Litovsky's father managed to capture a picture of his son and Diddy. “I don't look like I have a normal smile in the pic,” he noted.</p>

<p>As the party carried on into the night, Mr Litovsky and his family decided to leave before things could escalate. “We didn't see people having sex, but we left at 9:30 pm,” Ms Maya explained. “The party continued, and nobody was getting out of the pool. So, who knows what happened.”</p>

<p>Diddy was arrested by federal authorities last month. The rapper is facing <a href="http://https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/over-100-people-to-sue-us-rapper-sean-diddy-combs-in-sex-assault-case-6698693#:~:text=Combs%20was%20indicted%20last%20month,parties%20using%20threats%20and%20violence. ">allegations of sexual abuse and exploitation by over 100 people</a>, with lawsuits expected to be filed across multiple states. The accusers will include victims of sexual assault, rape and abuse of minors, attorneys announced. Spanning decades, these allegations&nbsp;include accusations of drugging and raping women, racketeering and sex trafficking and involvement in criminal activities. Now Diddy is awaiting trial at the Metropolitan Detention Centre in Brooklyn and has pleaded not guilty.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Singapore's Indian-origin former transport minister S Iswaran was handed a one-year jail sentence on Thursday after he pleaded guilty to five charges relating to corruption and blocking of justice in the High Court on September 24.</p>

<p>The sentence is more than the six to seven months asked for by the prosecution, which Justice Hoong considers "manifestly inadequate".</p>

<p>The higher the office held by the offender as a public servant, the higher his level of culpability, said Justice Hoong.</p>

<p>The former minister is the first person to be prosecuted under Section 165 in post-independent Singapore, reported The Straits Times.</p>

<p>Judge Vincent Hoong turns to the mitigating factors that the defence has highlighted, including Iswaran's public service to Singapore, his voluntary disgorgement to the benefits and his early plea of guilt.</p>

<p>Given that the rest of the 30 charges that were taken into consideration bear similarities with the proceeded charges where he received gifts, the judge said that these charges revealed the scale and repetition of offending over a significant period of time. This is a culpability-increasing factor, says Judge Hoong.</p>

<p>His public service and contributions to Singapore were at most a neutral factor, adds the judge.</p>

<p>Justice Hoong says he has difficulty believing that Iswaran was remorseful, as the latter had made public statements rejecting the charges as false.</p>

<p>He added that he is unable to accept the defence's submissions. The accused is only eligible for a sentencing discount of up to 10 per cent.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Next week's Nobel Prize announcements will crown achievements that made the world a better place, a glimmer of optimism amid a spiralling Middle East conflict, war in Ukraine, famine in Sudan and a collapsing climate.</p>

<p>The prize winners will be announced between October 7 and 14.</p>

<p>For the Peace Prize, the most prestigious of the six Nobels, experts say it is harder than ever to predict the Norwegian Nobel Committee's pick, to be revealed on October 11.</p>

<p>Swedish philanthropist Alfred Nobel created the prizes in his 1895 will, stipulating that they go to those who have "conferred the greatest benefit on humankind".</p>

<p>But given the bleak state of world affairs, perhaps no one should get the Peace Prize this year, suggested Dan Smith, the head of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.</p>

<p>"Maybe this is the time to say, 'Yes, many people are working very hard, but it's not getting there and we need more people and world leaders to wake up and realise that we are in an extremely dangerous situation,'" he said.</p>

<p>"We have now over 50 armed conflicts around the world. The lethality of those armed conflicts has increased dramatically in the past two decades," he said.</p>

<p><strong>'A worthy candidate'</strong></p>

<p>Not awarding a Peace Prize would be viewed as an acknowledgement of failure by the award committee, and is therefore deemed unlikely.</p>

<p>"I'm confident there will be a worthy candidate for the Peace Prize this year as well," the secretary of the committee, Olav Njolstad, told AFP.</p>

<p>Last year, the award went to jailed Iranian activist Narges Mohammadi for her fight against the oppression of women in Iran.</p>

<p>A total of 286 nominations are known to have been submitted for the Peace Prize this year, though the committee keeps the names sealed for 50 years.</p>

<p>Those entitled to nominate are however allowed to reveal their picks.</p>

<p>Among those known to be on the list are some actors involved in the Middle East, such as the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA; Palestinian human rights group Al-Haq; its Israeli counterpart B'Tselem and the International Court of Justice.</p>

<p>Given the existential risks to humanity posed by weapons systems that can operate autonomously without human control, several Nobel-watchers have cited the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots as a possible laureate.</p>

<p>The Nobel Prize in Literature, to be announced on October 10, likewise generates frenzied speculation every year.</p>

<p>Several pundits believe Chinese author Can Xue will be the Swedish Academy's choice this year -- and she has the lowest odds on several betting sites.</p>

<p>An avant-garde fiction writer often likened to Kafka, her experimental style flips between utopia and dystopia and transforms the mundane into the surreal.</p>

<p>"I think it will be a woman from a language zone outside Europe," Bjorn Wiman, culture editor at Sweden's newspaper of record Dagens Nyheter, told AFP.</p>

<p>The last Chinese author to win was Mo Yan in 2012.</p>

<p><strong>Surprise name for literature?</strong></p>

<p>With no public shortlist, it is always difficult to predict which way the 18-member Swedish Academy is leaning.</p>

<p>Names making the rounds in Stockholm's literary circles include Australian novelist Gerald Murnane, Britain's Salman Rushdie, Antiguan-American writer Jamaica Kincaid, Canadian poet Anne Carson, Hungary's Laszlo Krasznahorkai, Mircea Cartarescu of Romania, Kenya's Ngugi wa Thiong'o and Japan's Haruki Murakami.</p>

<p>Last year, Norwegian playwright Jon Fosse took home the honour.</p>

<p>The Academy often shines a spotlight on relatively unknown writers.</p>

<p>"I think they've gone to great pains to find some writer that will catch the culture commentariat with their pants down," Wiman said.</p>

<p>The Nobel season kicks off on Monday with the Prize in Physiology or Medicine.</p>

<p>Analytics group Clarivate, which monitors potential science laureates, speculated that award could go to research on the genetics of lipid metabolism, which has led to new drugs to treat cardiovascular diseases.</p>

<p>Another candidate could be studies of the basal ganglia, which are parts of the brain associated with motor control and emotions.</p>

<p>Or the prize could go to the discovery of genomic imprinting, which has increased our understanding of epigenetics and mammalian development.</p>

<p>Last year, the Prize in Physiology or Medicine went to researchers Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman for their work on messenger RNA technology that paved the way for groundbreaking Covid-19 vaccines.</p>

<p>The Prize in Physics follows on Tuesday ahead of Wednesday's Prize in Chemistry. The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences then wraps up the 2024 Nobel season on Monday, October 14.</p>

<p>This year's laureates will take home the prized sum of 11 million kronor ($1 million) per discipline, to be shared if there is more than one winner.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A senior adviser to Vice President Kamala Harris met American Muslim and Arab leaders on Wednesday as Harris' presidential campaign seeks to win back voters angry at US support for Israel's wars in Gaza and Lebanon.</p>

<p>Harris' national security adviser, Phil Gordan, told the community leaders in the virtual meeting that the administration supports a ceasefire in Gaza, diplomacy in Lebanon and stability in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, the vice president's office said.</p>

<p>Ali Dagher, a Lebanese-American attorney and community leader, said the outreach from Harris' office was not enough. "It's too little, too late," said Dagher, who did not participate in the meeting.</p>

<p>Harris, a Democrat, faces Republican former President Donald Trump on Nov. 5 in what polls show to be a tight presidential race.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden won most of the 2020 Muslim and Arab votes, but their backing of Democrats has fallen sharply during nearly a year that Israel has been fighting Hamas in Gaza. Activists say Biden and Harris have done too little to stop Israel's military campaign in the Palestinian enclave.</p>

<p>The Israeli military offensive in Gaza has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, Palestinian health authorities say. Israel was responding to an Oct. 7, 2023 incursion by Hamas gunmen, who Israel says killed around 1,200 people and abducted about 250 hostages. Gaza has suffered a humanitarian crisis with nearly all its 2 million people displaced and widespread hunger in the enclave.</p>

<p>In Lebanon, more than 1,900 people have been killed and 9,000 wounded during almost a year of cross-border fighting between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah, with most of the deaths in the past two weeks, according to Lebanese government statistics.</p>

<p>Emgage, a Muslim-American advocacy group, recently endorsed Harris, while others have urged supporters to shun her. While they have not supported Trump, their choice not to vote or to vote for third-party candidates could hurt Harris, analysts say.</p>

<p>US support for Israel has led to large protests, especially in hotly contested swing states like Michigan that could decide the election. Harris has offered no substantive policy differences on Israel from Biden, who stepped aside as presidential candidate in July.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Miyazaki Airport in southwestern Japan resumed operations Thursday morning, a day after its closure due to the explosion of a wartime dud shell that damaged a section of its taxiway, local media reported.</p>

<p>A <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/japan-airport-shut-after-world-war-ii-bomb-explodes-near-runway-87-flights-cancelled-6701776">Japan Airlines plane to Fukuoka</a> departed at around 7:40 a.m. local time in the first flight since the airport was shut for safety checks on Wednesday, Xinhua news agency reported, citing Kyodo News.</p>

<p>The transport ministry office at Miyazaki Airport said Wednesday that a blast was heard on a taxiway shortly before 8 a.m. local time as air traffic controllers saw smoke rising from the site.</p>

<p>The airport office said the explosion created an oval-shaped hole measuring about 7 meters long, 4 meters wide and 1 meter deep on asphalt pavement near the taxiway.</p>

<p>No one was injured and a total of 87 flights to and from the airport were cancelled as of 2 p.m. local time as the runway was closed for the day.</p>

<p>Japan's Self-Defense Forces and authorities investigating the site have determined that the explosion was from a 500-pound that was dropped during World War II.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are entering the final one-month sprint to the most dramatic US presidential election in modern history, with both candidates warning the fate of a divided nation hangs on a result that is still too close to call.</p>

<p>The 2024 race has seen more twists than a Hollywood blockbuster, from the vice president's shock replacement of Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee, to the Republican former president riding out two assassination attempts as he eyes a sensational comeback to the White House.</p>

<p>Now the United States is bracing for a cliffhanger ending with Trump, 78, and Harris, 59, neck-and-neck in the polls -- and the Republican warning darkly of a repeat of the chaos that followed the 2020 election if he does not win this time around.</p>

<p>The world is meanwhile waiting with bated breath to see who ends up in the Oval Office, at a time when the Middle East slips ever closer to all-out war and Ukraine's fight for survival against Russia hinges on the US support that Trump has previously criticized.</p>

<p>"This is a tremendously important election," Peter Loge, director of George Washington University's School of Media and Public Affairs, told AFP.</p>

<p>"They (Trump and Harris) have both cast it in apocalyptic terms."</p>

<p><strong>Stark contrast -</strong></p>

<p>One thing is for sure: the next four weeks will see Harris and Trump -- along with their running mates, Democratic Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Republican Ohio Senator J.D. Vance -- relentlessly hitting the campaign trail.</p>

<p>America's idiosyncratic electoral college means they will end up fighting for a few thousand votes in seven key swing states that are expected to decide the election -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p>

<p>And as America decides, Harris and Trump will be offering voters two starkly different visions.</p>

<p>With her slogan "We're Not Going Back," Harris promises to turn the page on an era of divisive politics. Trump pledges to "Make America Great Again" as he paints a picture of a dystopian nation that only he can fix.</p>

<p>In Harris, Democrats have a candidate who has smashed glass ceilings as America's first female, Black and South Asian vice president, and who promises to fight for abortion rights and what she calls an "opportunity economy."</p>

<p>But her meteoric rise means her character and policies remain an unknown quantity to many voters.</p>

<p>Trump is the first convicted felon to run for president, but one whose right-wing base laps up his insults of "Comrade Kamala," and his promises to boost the economy and lock up his political opponents.</p>

<p>Above all, he is hoping that the explosive issue of migration will help him win, with the billionaire doubling down on harsh rhetoric accusing migrants of "poisoning" American blood.</p>

<p>"Vice President Harris and Governor Walz are saying the American story is complicated, but we can make this right," said Loge.</p>

<p>Trump meanwhile had a "very compelling story... give the strongman a chance, let him clear the deck, we'll come back to democracy later. The problem is we can never come back to democracy."</p>

<h3><strong>'Pass the torch'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>US voters have also had to get their heads around a completely upended race.</p>

<p>Less than three months ago, they still faced a deeply unpopular rematch between Trump and the 81-year-old Biden for the title of America's oldest president.</p>

<p>Everything changed in the space of 90 stunning minutes as Biden imploded in his debate against Trump, crystallizing years of Democratic fears about his age.</p>

<p>A month later, Biden dropped out, saying it was time to "pass the torch" to Harris.</p>

<p>With dizzying speed, Harris wiped out Trump's lead in the polls, fired up huge rallies and raised piles of cash.</p>

<p>The Republican suddenly found himself facing a much younger -- and female -- candidate.</p>

<p>The turnaround was especially abrupt for Trump, coming just eight days after gunman opened fire at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, wounding the Republican in the ear.</p>

<p>Harris however insists she remains the "underdog" and the polls predict a nail-biting race.</p>

<p>A result could also take days or weeks if there are disputed counts or legal challenges as expected -- meaning the US election cliffhanger could last into January.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Melania Trump writes in her upcoming memoir that a woman has the right to an abortion, The Guardian newspaper reported on Wednesday, while her husband, Donald Trump, backs the ability for US states to restrict the procedure.</p>

<p>"Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body?" Melania Trump writes in her memoir that is due to be published four weeks before the Nov. 5 election, in which her husband faces Democrat Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>"Restricting a woman's right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life," she was reported as writing in the memoir.</p>

<p>The Guardian said it has obtained a copy of the book, titled "Melania," that is due to be published on Oct. 8. A spokesperson for the former first lady did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.</p>

<p>Donald Trump, a Republican, had previously signaled support for a national ban beyond 15 weeks of pregnancy but in April said political considerations were paramount in the first presidential election since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, ending a nearly 50-year federal right to the procedure.</p>

<p>Trump says abortion laws should be decided by the states and backs exceptions to a ban on abortion in the case of rape, incest and to protect the mother's life.</p>

<p>Polls show the presidential election is a tight race with seven battleground states likely to decide the outcome.</p>

<p>Democrats see abortion rights as a popular issue for Harris to use against Trump. A Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted from August 21-28 found a majority of voters, including 34% of Republicans, want the next president to protect or increase abortion access.</p>

<p>“Sadly for the women across America, Mrs. Trump's husband firmly disagrees with her and is the reason that more than one in three American women live under a Trump Abortion Ban that threatens their health, their freedom, and their lives," a Harris campaign spokesperson said in an emailed statement.</p>

<p>Trump takes credit for the Supreme Court overturning the Roe v. Wade decision in 2022, which had protected a right to abortion at up to around 24 to 28 weeks, because justices appointed by Trump swung the vote.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Consulate General of India in Seattle said in a statement that a bust of Mahatma Gandhi was unveiled at the Seattle Centre. In a post on X, India's Consulate in Seattle said, "Gandhi ji Bust adorns iconic Seattle Center! The first bust of Mahatma Gandhi ji was unveiled in Seattle today. Located at base of Space Needle, which receives 12 million visitors annually, Gandhi ji's life and message now resonates in the US Pacific North West."</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="und">(2/2) <a href="https://t.co/1bAdqVq6BG">pic.twitter.com/1bAdqVq6BG</a></p>
— India In Seattle (@IndiainSeattle) <a href="https://twitter.com/IndiainSeattle/status/1841620741764342055?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 2, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>In a unique addition to the city of Seattle landscape, a bust of Mahatma Gandhi was unveiled today at the iconic Seattle Centre, just below the base of the Space Needle and adjacent to the Chihuly Garden and Glass Museum. The unveiling marks the first installation of Gandhi's bust in a city known for its vibrant cultural landscape, the statement said.</p>

<p>The unveiling ceremony was attended by notable dignitaries, including Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell, Congressman Adam Smith, Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, Lt. Gen. Xavier Brunson, Commander of the US First Corps in Pacific Northwest, and Eddie Rye, Chair of the Martin Luther King-Gandhi Initiative, along with the Consul General of India, Prakash Gupta. It was also attended by eminent members of the Indian American community who offered their respects on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti, the statement added.</p>

<p>October 2, which is Gandhi ji's birthday, is also recognised as the International Day of Non-Violence by the United Nations, the statement said. All dignitaries who spoke at the Gandhi Jayanti ceremony underscored the values of Ahimsa (Non-Violence), Satyagraha (truth force), and Sarvodaya (welfare for all) as being the defining need in contemporary times.</p>

<p>The Consulate General of India and the City of Seattle had worked in partnership to identify an appropriate venue for locating the bust of Mahatma Gandhi, and the iconic location of Seattle Centre, which draws more than 12 million visitors each year, was considered appropriate, given its location, accessibility, and commitment to promoting the values of peace and non-violence.</p>

<p>To mark the occasion, Governor of the State of Washington, Jay Inslee, issued an official proclamation acknowledging the Gandhi ji Bust as a lasting tribute to Gandhi's teachings and a powerful reminder of the impact of non-violence in driving change. Another special proclamation was also issued by the King County designating 2nd October as Mahatma Gandhi Day across all 73 cities of the Greater Seattle area, the statement said.</p>

<p>It may be recalled that the first Indian Consulate in Seattle commenced its operations in November 2023 with a consular jurisdiction in the US Pacific Northwest, covering the nine states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Alaska. The installation of the Mahatma Gandhi ji bust in Seattle (Washington) is one in a series of such initiatives that is gradually being implemented across its consular jurisdiction, as per the statement.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

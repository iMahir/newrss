       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The moon blotted out most of the sun across the Pacific Ocean on Wednesday afternoon, giving just a few specks of land an impressive annular "ring of fire" eclipse.</p>

<p>Only Easter Island and a small area near the southern tip of Chile and Argentina witnessed an annular eclipse, lasting just a few minutes.</p>

<p>"The ring of fire is a once-in-a-lifetime experience," Rocio Garcia, a tourist on Easter Island told Reuters on Tuesday. "Especially here in Rapa Nui with the Moai in the background it will be spectacular."</p>

<p>An annular eclipse happens when the moon is too far away from Earth to completely blot out the sun, like a total eclipse, creating a dark silhouette surrounded by a bright ring of light called an antumbra, or more casually, a "ring of fire".</p>

<p>As the sun darkened over the island on Wednesday afternoon, people gathered outdoors, chanted, played music, and wore special eyewear to catch a glimpse of the eclipse.</p>

<p>"I got excited when people were shouting. Everybody's fervor made it more exciting," said Alejandra Astudillo, an Easter Island resident.</p>

<p>An estimated 175,000 people live in the path of the eclipse's annularity, giving far-flung residents and eclipse-chasing tourists a stunning view.</p>

<p>"It was an extraordinary phenomenon that's not often seen," said Esteban Sanchez in Las Horquetas, Argentina, one of the few towns in the eclipse's direct path. "This is the first time I've seen that and it was really good."</p>

<p>The southern half of South America, along with parts of Antarctica and Hawaii, saw a partial eclipse according to a map plotted out by NASA.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A month ahead of the US election, with campaigning at a peak, former President Donald Trump's automated messages have sparked a viral reaction with an Indian user receiving an update today.</p>

<p>The tweet, from the former President's X (formerly Twitter) handle, was directed at Roshan Rai, who describes himself as an Indian first and "cricketoholic" in his bio.</p>

<p>"I'll send you IMPORTANT ELECTION UPDATES for North Carolina. Make sure you are ready to VOTE FOR DONALD J. TRUMP by November 5th. Reply #stop to opt-out" it read.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<br />

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>To this, Roshan Rai quipped, "Thanks, but you will never be my President. Kamala Harris will never be my President either. &nbsp;Actually, I am from India."</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Mr Rai's retort has drawn the attention of several Internet users. It also shows the unexpected reach of Trump's automated messaging system beyond American borders, thereby highlighting the impact of Trump's social media strategy, which has been a hallmark of his political approach since 2015.</p>

<p>The X exchange raises questions about the appropriateness of such outreach to international audiences. A study by the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w24631">National Bureau of Economic Research</a> in 2018, indicated that bots played a critical role in swaying votes during the 2016 elections and Twitter bots may have boosted Donald Trump's votes by a good 3.23%.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As Trump gears up for the upcoming election next month after having survived not one, but two assassination attempts, his reliance on social media continues to draw both criticism and amusement from users worldwide. Earlier this year, in August, Trump had taken to social media to express his approval for pop star Taylor Swift's faux endorsement of himself, using AI-generated images. However, this soon turned into an &nbsp;"I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT" post on social media following Swift's actual endorsement of Trump's rival Kamala Harris.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Months after US Vice President Kamala Harris' husband Douglas Emhoff admitted to having an extra-marital affair during his first marriage, a report has claimed that he allegedly slapped his ex-girlfriend for "flirting" with a valet worker.</p>

<p>The report, published by a British tabloid on Wednesday, said that Second Gentleman allegedly struck the woman, a New York attorney, in the face while waiting in a valet line late at night after the Cannes Film Festival event in France in May 2012.</p>

<p>The report, citing the woman's friends, said the woman had been dating Emhoff, a lawyer, for three months when the incident took place.</p>

<p>Earlier in August, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/kamala-harris-husband-admits-to-cheating-on-1st-wife-with-childs-teacher-6258995" target="_blank">Emhoff</a>, 59, acknowledged that he had an affair during his first marriage (with Kerstin) after the alleged details of the relationship were published by a British tabloid.</p>

<p>"During my first marriage, Kerstin and I went through some tough times on account of my actions. I took responsibility, and in the years since, we worked through things as a family and have come out stronger on the other side," Emhoff said in a statement provided exclusively to CNN.</p>

<p>His acknowledgment came after a British tabloid reported that <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-presidential-election-2024-kamala-harris-husband-says-hes-never-won-a-debate-against-his-wife-6509524" target="_blank">Emhoff</a> had an affair with a teacher who worked at a school his children attended and that resulted in the end of his first marriage.</p>

<p>It was reported that the woman became pregnant and that, according to a close friend, she "did not keep the child."</p>

<p>Emhoff and Kerstin ended their marriage in 2009 and have two children - Cole and Ella.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[After Iran's missile attack on Israel on Tuesday, there is speculation that Israel could strike Iran's nuclear facilities as it has long threatened to do.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After Iran's missile attack on Israel on Tuesday, there is speculation that Israel could strike Iran's nuclear facilities as it has long threatened to do.</p>

<p>Below are some of Iran's main nuclear facilities.</p>

<h3><strong>URANIUM ENRICHMENT AT ITS HEART</strong></h3>

<p>Iran's nuclear programme is spread over many locations. While the threat of Israeli airstrikes has loomed for decades, only some of the sites have been built underground.</p>

<p>The United States and the UN nuclear watchdog believe Iran had a coordinated, secret nuclear weapons programme that it halted in 2003. The Islamic Republic denies ever having had one or planning to have one.</p>

<p>Iran agreed to restrictions on its nuclear activities in exchange for relief from international sanctions under a 2015 deal with world powers. That pact fell apart after then-President Donald Trump pulled out of the United States in 2018 and Iran started abandoning the restrictions the next year.</p>

<p>Iran has been expanding its uranium enrichment programme ever since, reducing the so-called "breakout time" it would need to produce enough weapons-grade uranium for a nuclear bomb to a matter of weeks from at least a year under the 2015 accord.</p>

<p>Actually making a bomb with that material would take longer. How long is less clear and the subject of debate.</p>

<p>Iran is now enriching uranium to up to 60% fissile purity, close to 90% of weapons-grade, at two sites, and in theory, it has enough material enriched to that level, if enriched further, for almost four bombs, according to a yardstick of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the U.N. watchdog.</p>

<h3><strong>NATANZ</strong></h3>

<p>A complex at the heart of Iran's enrichment programme on a plain abutting mountain outside the Shi'ite Muslim holy city of Qom, south of Tehran. Natanz houses facilities including two enrichment plants: the vast, underground Fuel Enrichment Plant (FEP) and the above-ground Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant (PFEP).</p>

<p>An exiled Iranian opposition group revealed in 2002 that Iran was secretly building Natanz, igniting a diplomatic standoff between the West and Iran over its nuclear intentions that continues today.</p>

<p>The FEP was built for enrichment on a commercial scale, able to house 50,000 centrifuges. Around 14,000 centrifuges are currently installed there, roughly 11,000 of which are in operation, refining uranium to up to 5% purity.</p>

<p>Diplomats with knowledge of Natanz describe the FEP as being about three floors below ground. There has long been debate about how much damage Israeli airstrikes could do to it.</p>

<p>Damage has been done to centrifuges at the FEP by other means, including an explosion and power cut in April 2021 that Iran said was an attack by Israel.</p>

<p>The above-ground PFEP houses only a few hundred centrifuges but Iran is enriching to up to 60% purity there.</p>

<h3><strong>FORDOW</strong></h3>

<p>On the opposite side of Qom, Fordow is an enrichment site dug into a mountain and therefore probably better protected from potential bombardment than the FEP.</p>

<p>The 2015 deal with major powers did not allow Iran to enrich Fordow at all. It now has more than 1,000 centrifuges operating there, a fraction of them advanced IR-6 machines enriching to up to 60%.</p>

<p>In addition, Iran recently doubled the number of centrifuges installed at Fordow, with all the new ones being IR-6 machines.</p>

<p>The United States, Britain and France announced in 2009 that Iran had been secretly building Fordow for years and had failed to inform the IAEA. US President Barack Obama said then: "The size and configuration of this facility is inconsistent with a peaceful programme."</p>

<h3><strong>ISFAHAN</strong></h3>

<p>Iran has a large nuclear technology centre on the outskirts of Isfahan, its second-largest city.</p>

<p>It includes the Fuel Plate Fabrication Plant (FPFP) and the uranium conversion facility (UCF) that can process uranium into the uranium hexafluoride that is fed into centrifuges.</p>

<p>There is equipment at Isfahan to make uranium metal, a process that is particularly proliferation-sensitive since it can be used to devise the core of a nuclear bomb.</p>

<p>The IAEA has said there are machines for making centrifuge parts at Isfahan, describing it in 2022 as a "new location".</p>

<h3><strong>KHONDAB</strong></h3>

<p>Iran has a partially built heavy-water research reactor originally called Arak and now Khondab. Heavy-water reactors pose a nuclear proliferation risk because they can easily produce plutonium which, like enriched uranium, can be used to make the core of an atom bomb.</p>

<p>Under the 2015 deal, construction was halted, and the reactor's core was removed and filled with concrete to make it unusable. The reactor was to be redesigned "to minimise the production of plutonium and not to produce weapon-grade plutonium in normal operation". Iran has informed the IAEA that it plans to bring the reactor online in 2026.</p>

<h3><strong>TEHRAN RESEARCH CENTRE</strong></h3>

<p>Iran's nuclear research facilities in Tehran include a research reactor.</p>

<h3><strong>BUSHEHR</strong></h3>

<p>Iran's only operating nuclear power plant, on the Gulf Coast, uses Russian fuel that Russia then takes back when it is spent, reducing the proliferation risk.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Iran has an 'execution list' of 'Israeli terrorists' - including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as the commanders of the Israel's Army, Navy, and Air Force - according to a poster circulated on X.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/iran" target="_blank">Iran</a> has an 'execution list' of 'Israeli terrorists' - including Prime Minister <a class="sp_lnk2" href="http://www.ndtv.com/topic/benjamin-netanyahu" target="_blank">Benjamin Netanyahu</a> and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as the commanders of the Israel's Army, Navy, and Air Force - according to a poster circulated on X, one version of which was shared by @Revenge_is_near.</p>

<p>Neither government has yet responded to this poster so far, although whispers from within Iranian military intelligence suggest senior Israeli leaders, if not Netanyahu himself, may be targeted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other high-ranking military leaders on the list are Chief of General Staff Herzi Halevi and his deputy, Amir Baram, and the heads of the Northern, Southern, and Central Command - Major Generals Ori Gordin, Yehuda Fox, and Eliezer Toledani. Military intelligence chief Aharon Haliva is also named.</p>

<p>If the list is genuine, it would appear that Iran targeting Benjamin Netanyahu is a direct response to reports that Israel is looking to press its advantage - after crippling the leadership structure of Iran-backed Hezbollah - by executing Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, that country's Supreme Leader.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">???? Just like Israel, now Iran publishes it's own terrorist list that Iran will love to kill <a href="https://t.co/mDL32HGapa">pic.twitter.com/mDL32HGapa</a></p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>And, if genuine, it mirrors a (pre-attack) list released by Israel last month that said it had eliminated top commanders of the Hezbollah's elite Radwan Force, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/hezbollah-confirms-death-two-top-commanders-14-other-members-in-idf-beirut-airstrike/" target="_blank">The Times of Israel</a> reported. Israeli forces named 11 Hezbollah commanders killed and shared a poster on Instagram of the broken command structure.</p>

<p>In the aftermath of the attack Tuesday <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-pm-benjamin-netanyahu-says-iran-made-a-big-mistake-and-will-pay-for-it-6696140" target="_blank">Netanyahu told Iran it had made "a big mistake"</a>.</p>

<p>Targeting Defence Minister Gallant would also be a significant move. In October last year - ordering a complete blockade on the Gaza Strip that left millions of civilians starving, before Israeli fighter jets' merciless bombing - Gallant infamously described Palestinians as "animals".</p>

<p>And eliminating the raft of senior Israeli military leaders will be seen as payback for Tel Aviv killing at least eight top Hezbollah leaders, as well as those from Palestinian terror group Hamas and other associated Islamic groups.</p>

<p>Tension between Tel Aviv and Tehran escalated sharply - as have fears of an all-out war in West Asia - after Tuesday's large-scale missile offensive, the second against Israel in seven months.</p>

<p>The first - in which around 200 ballistic missile and explosive drones were fired at Israel in April - was in retaliation for an airstrike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus in Syria.</p>

<p>Tuesday's missile strike, Iran has said, was its response to Israel's killing Friday of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. Nasrallah, 64, was killed in airstrikes targeting dozens of sites - that Tel Aviv claims were linked to the Hezbollah - in eastern and southern Lebanon.</p>

<p>Israel also claims last week's strikes dealt heavy blows to Hezbollah's command structure.</p>

<p>Two days later - on Monday - Hamas said an Israeli strike had also killed one of its senior commanders in Lebanon - <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hamas-leader-lebanon-israeli-airstrike-seventh-hezbollah-commander/" target="_blank">Fatah Sharif and his family died in airstrikes</a> in the southern port city of Tyre. Yet another - on a residential building in central Beirut - killed a member of an Islamic group allied with Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Over the past 10 days Israel has reportedly targeted and executed at least eight senior Hezbollah leaders, including founding members. The group on Sunday said Nabil Kaouk, the deputy chief of its Central County and a veteran of the 2006 war with Israel, had also died in an airstrike.</p>

<p>Later that day Hezbollah said Ali Karaki, another senior commander, had also died.</p>

<p>These strikes have been seen by many as signs Israel is following ex Prime Minister&nbsp;Naftali Bennett's 'Octopus Doctrine', which calls for&nbsp;a direct fight with Iran instead of dealing with Hezbollah or Hamas.</p>

<p>Israel, after the terror attack by Hamas in October last year, had vowed to wipe out the Palestinian group, and similar declarations have been made by Tel Aviv as it opens this second front.</p>

<p>Iran's missile strikes have left diplomats in the region and in the West scrambling to avoid a full-blown war, and Tehran has warned of "crushing attacks" if Israel retaliates, which it has said it will do.</p>

<p>Guy Nir, spokesperson for the Israeli embassy in India, told NDTV Tehran would get an appropriate response. "If he (the Ayatollah) plans to initiate a full-scale war with Israel, it will be a mistake for them. Israel's response is going to be strategic and pin-pointed... not a full-scale war."</p>

<p>Less than a year ago, tech billionaire Elon Musk was Britain's star guest at a conference, with the then Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, playing the role of a fawning interviewer to the world's richest man. A year on, things have changed in Britain. The Labour government, which came to power in July, has decided not to invite Musk to a mega investment summit to be held in London on October 14.</p>

<p>The Tesla and X boss ostensibly did not like the snub and hit back at the UK government with full force, urging the guests not to go to the UK. "I don't think anyone should go to the UK when they're releasing convicted paedophiles in order to imprison people for social media posts," he said when he learnt he was not invited.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Origin Story</strong></h2>

<p>It is true that many prisoners have been released recently under a government scheme to decongest overcrowded British jails. But there is no evidence to suggest that sex offenders or paedophiles were let out. Musk's tweets have sparked controversy and raised concerns about the spread of misinformation, with the British media reminding the tech billionaire of his recent acts of "spreading disinformation" about the UK. A few weeks ago, Musk shared a baseless report that the UK was building internment camps in the Falkland Islands for rioters, though he swiftly deleted the tweet after facing backlash.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer addressed Musk's latest provocative comments during his recent visit to the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in New York. Dismissing them as being vastly different from the positive feedback received from investors, Starmer claimed that the latter have expressed strong interest in attending and that they praised their meeting with the UK government as the best they've had.</p>

<h2><strong>Why The Summit Is Important</strong></h2>

<p>The summit - in its third edition since 2021 - aims to attract significant investment to drive economic growth, a top priority for the Labour government. According to a government release, last year's meeting generated a promise of nearly £30 billion of investment. This year, as Chancellor (finance minister) Rachel Reeves and Business and Trade Secretary (minister) Jonathan Reynolds join Starmer in showcasing the UK's potential, the government hopes to secure an investment commitment worth around 60 billion pounds in sectors like technology, green energy and artificial intelligence (AI).</p>

<p>But the elephant in the room is the government's cold shoulder to Musk. It has ignited debate about the UK's true commitment to openness and whether it's willing to engage with influential business leaders who are critical of the Labour government. As the government seeks to reset relations with global trading partners and promote innovation, Musk supporters and the opposition Conservative Party have raised questions about Starmer's willingness to walk the talk. Despite the tech billionaire's inflammatory comments, the Labour government's decision to ignore him smacks of vindictiveness and pettiness. Musk is no ordinary man. His influence on modern business, technology, and society is undeniable. I rate him alongside the Israeli historian and thinker Yuval Noah Harari -- both being the visionaries of our time, but with distinct approaches. I would like to say that while Harari focuses on the bigger picture, encouraging introspection and societal evolution, Musk actively shapes the future through groundbreaking technologies. There is no doubt that both visionaries inspire and challenge our understanding of human potential.</p>

<h2><strong>Musk, Agent Provocateur</strong></h2>

<p>The relationship between Musk and Starmer has been frosty at best since the Labour Party came to power in July. Starmer, many believe, and justifiably, is upset with the American billionaire for his unsavoury remarks on how the Labour government handled the nationwide riots in August. Following the horrific Southport stabbing that claimed the lives of three children, Musk donned the role of an agent provocateur as he unleashed a barrage of criticism against Starmer and his new government. In one of his tweets, he ominously forecast a 'civil war' in the UK. Musk has 193 million followers on X, which means whatever he says on the platform gets amplified across the world in seconds. There is no doubt that as violence and riots spread across the country, fueled by misinformation and far-right extremism, Musk's misleading tweets added fuel to the fire.</p>

<p>The response from Labour MPs was swift and stinging. Leading voices within the party accused Musk of deliberately spreading disinformation and seeking to sow division within British society. One Labour MP described Musk's intervention as "grossly irresponsible", suggesting that his comments were intended to play into existing societal fractures for personal or ideological reasons.</p>

<h2><strong>But It's Not Easy To Just Dismiss Musk</strong></h2>

<p>Starmer's office, too, condemned Musk's "civil war is inevitable" comment and said there was no justification for such remarks. But it's not easy to silence Musk, who is seen in many right-wing circles as a defender of free speech. He doubled down on Starmer and posted a series of provocative tweets, even accusing the British police of being harsher on White protesters during the riots.</p>

<p>To Starmer's comment on X that "We will not tolerate attacks on mosques and on Muslim communities", Musk replied, "Shouldn't you be concerned about attacks on 'all' communities?" In another post, he claimed the UK was censoring online content, and asked "Is this Britain or the Soviet Union?"</p>

<h2><strong>Governments And Businessmen Have Clashed Often</strong></h2>

<p>The clash between Musk and the UK government is not an isolated incident. Throughout history, influential industrialists and businessmen have challenged governments, often sparking tensions and drama. Indian-born British industrialists, the Hinduja brothers, were embroiled in the "Hinduja Affair" during Tony Blair's premiership. The brothers were accused of bribing Indian officials to secure defense contracts. Blair's government faced allegations of improperly granting the Hindujas British passports. But an investigation cleared them. However, the scandal led to the resignation of Blair's minister, Peter Mandelson. The episode underlined the complex relationships between business, politics, and national interest.</p>

<p>Media mogul Rupert Murdoch's showdown with the Margret Thatcher government began when he acquired The Times and The Sunday Times newspapers. Murdoch's media empire was investigated for unexplained business dealings, which eventually led him to sell The Times.</p>

<p>It is a widely known fact that billionaire investor George Soros has long been a thorn in the side of Hungary's nationalist government, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. Soros's Open Society Foundation (OSF) promoted democratic values and human rights, which Orbán saw as a threat to his rule. His government launched a campaign against Soros, accusing him of promoting immigration and undermining Hungarian culture. The government also passed laws restricting NGOs, allegedly targeting OSF. Soros ultimately closed the OSF's Budapest office, citing "unprecedented" government harassment.</p>

<h2><strong>Can Regulation Tame X?</strong></h2>

<p>Under the Online Safety Act, social media platforms are required to proactively remove illegal content, including inflammatory material, and prevent it from appearing in the first place. The UK's communications regulator, Ofcom, has the power to punish non-compliant platforms with fines up to &amp;#163;18 million or 10% of their global annual turnover. It is believed the new act, passed last year, gives the government enough power to tame social platforms if they were found to be spreading falsehood in society.</p>

<p>It is reported that some Labour MPs have quietly suggested that action must be taken against Elon Musk for his inflammatory tweets during the riots in August and he should be summoned by Parliament to face questions from MPs. But there are no strong indications of that happening. Not as yet.&nbsp;</p>

       <description><![CDATA[A video of a newlywed couple in Jerusalem dancing in an underground bunker as Iran strikes missiles has gone viral on the internet.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Love conquers all and a video of a newlywed couple dancing in an underground bunker is a testimony of that. The video shows a couple in Jerusalem, dancing hand-in-hand, for the first time after the wedding ceremonies, while Iran rained missiles on Israel. Shared on the micro-blogging website X (formerly known as Twitter), the couple is seen decked up in wedding attire.</p>

<p>The beautiful moment was captured and shared on the internet by a social media user Saul Sadka. They captioned the video “Iran couldn't stop the joy at this Jerusalem wedding even for a moment.”</p>

<p>Watch it here:</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p></p>

<p>According to the New York Post, the couple was forced to take shelter when Iran attacked Israel with a barrage of 181 ballistic missiles, each having a warhead payload of between 700-1,000 kilograms, which can destroy entire buildings.</p>

<p>The clip was filmed in an underground shelter near one of Jerusalem's biggest hotels, the Notre Dam Hotel, according to a comment by Bible scholar and author Saul Sadka.</p>

<p>The video caught netizen's attention, pushing them to share their emotions. One user wrote, “Nice to see a good story come out of all this mayhem. We all need to hold onto stories like this to keep our perspective and balance in an unbalanced world.”</p>

<p>Another user wished the best for the couple and wrote, “May they have many happy years together.”</p>

<p>Another said, “Bless them and their reunion, it's not fair on them.”</p>

<p>“They will remember this moment forever,” wrote another. To which, Saul Sadka replied, “So will I! And I don't know them.”</p>

<p>Iran launched a barrage of 181 ballistic missiles at Israel on Tuesday (October 1) night, triggering nationwide air raid sirens and forcing nearly 10 million Israelis into bomb shelters. Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) claimed responsibility for the missile assault, targeting three Israeli military bases near Tel Aviv.</p>

<p>Although the majority of missiles were intercepted, there were scattered reports of damage and injuries. In Tel Aviv, two civilians were lightly injured by shrapnel, while in the West Bank city of Jericho, a Palestinian civilian was killed by debris from one of the missiles, news agency AFP reported. The Israeli military quickly announced that the immediate threat had passed, and civilians were allowed to leave bomb shelters after an hour.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yemen's Houthi rebels conducted drone strikes in Israel's Tel Aviv early this morning, backing the Palestinian and Lebanese wars against Israel. The operation achieved its goals as the drones successfully reached their targets, the Houthis said in a statement.</p>

<p>"The Drone Air Force of the Yemeni Armed Forces carried out a military operation targeting a vital target in the Yaffa area "Tel Aviv" in occupied Palestine using several Yaffa drones. The operation successfully achieved its goals, with the drones reaching their targets without the enemy being able to intercept or down them," said statement read.</p>

<p>The armed forces said the attack, which was part of its fifth phase of the "Battle of the Promised Conquest", was in support of the people of Palestine and Lebanon, and Hamas's "Al-Aqsa Flood".</p>

<p>Houthis rebels, who control most parts of Yemen and consider Israel their enemy, entered the war in support of the Hamas after the conflict started in the Middle East last year. They are part of Iran's "Axis of Resistance" against Israel and the United States.</p>

<p>Houthis have fired multiple missiles at Israeli cities while Israel has been conducting airstrikes in Yemen, targeting crucial infrastructure including power plants. Seaports used by Houthi rebels to transfer Iranian weapons also came under attack in recent times.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Indian-American professor, Shailaja Paik, conducting research on and writing about Dalit women has received a $800,000 "genius" grant from the MacArthur Foundation which gives out awards every year to people with extraordinary achievements or potential.</p>

<p>Announcing her fellowship, the Foundation said, "Through her focus on the multifaceted experiences of Dalit women, Paik elucidates the enduring nature of caste discrimination and the forces that perpetuate untouchability."</p>

<p>Ms Paik is a distinguished research professor of history at the University of Cincinnati, where she is also an affiliate faculty in Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies, and Asian Studies.</p>

<p>"Paik provides new insight into the history of caste domination and traces the ways in which gender and sexuality are used to deny Dalit women dignity and personhood," the Foundation said.</p>

<p>The MacArthur Fellowships, popularly known as "genius" grants, are given to people across a spectrum from academia and science to arts and activism, who according to the Foundation are "extraordinarily talented and creative individuals as an investment in their potential".</p>

<p>The selections are made anonymously based on recommendations received and it does not allow applications or lobbying for the grants, which come without any strings and are spread over five years.</p>

<p>The Foundation said that her recent project focused "on the lives of women performers of Tamasha, a popular form of bawdy folk theatre that has been practised predominantly by Dalits in Maharashtra for centuries".</p>

<p>"Despite the state's efforts to reframe Tamasha as an honourable and quintessentially Marathi cultural practice, ashlil (the mark of vulgarity) sticks to Dalit Tamasha women," it said.</p>

<p>Based on the project, she published a book, "The Vulgarity of Caste: Dalits, Sexuality, and Humanity in Modern India".</p>

<p>It said, "Paik also critiques the narrative of Dr B.R. Ambedkar, the twentieth century's most influential caste abolitionist" and the architect of India's Constitution.</p>

<p>In an interview with National Public Radio (NPR), the US government-subsidised broadcaster, she said that she was herself a member of the Dalit community who grew up in Pune in a slum area and was inspired by her father's dedication to education.</p>

<p>After getting her masters' degree from the Savitribai Phule University in Pune, she went to the University of Warwick in the UK for her PhD.</p>

<p>She did a stint as a visiting assistant professor of South Asian history at Yale University.</p>

<p>Since the programme began in 1981, fellowships have been granted to 1,153 people.</p>

<p>Previous MacArthur Fellows include writers Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, and Ved Mehta, poet A.K. Ramanujam, economists Raj Chetty and Sendhil Mullainathan, mathematician L Mahadevan, computer scientists Subhash Khot and Shwetak Patel, physical biologist Manu Prakash, musician Vijay Gupta, community organiser Raj Jayadev, and lawyer and activist Sujatha Baliga.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The World Economic Forum has launched the Playbook of Solutions, a digital platform that shares 100 successful ways to unlock funding for clean energy in 47 developing countries.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.weforum.org/press/2024/10/new-digital-platform-outlines-100-actionable-solutions-for-unlocking-clean-energy-investment-in-emerging-markets/#:~:text=The%20World%20Economic%20Forum%20launches,energy%20financing%20in%20developing%20economies">World Economic Forum</a> has launched the Playbook of Solutions, a digital platform that shares 100 successful ways to unlock funding for clean energy in 47 developing countries. These solutions aim to speed up the shift to renewable energy by showing how policy changes, financial tools and partnerships can attract investments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To meet the global goal of tripling renewable energy by 2030, investment in clean energy needs to increase significantly, especially in emerging economies, which will account for most of the world's energy demand by 2035. However, these countries currently receive only a small share of global clean energy investments due to risks and regulatory challenges.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Policy measures:</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Energy Policy: </strong>Focus on providing incentives (like feed-in tariffs) and improving licensing processes for renewable energy projects.</li>
	<li><strong>Climate Policy: </strong>Set long-term goals for reducing emissions and adopt carbon pricing strategies.</li>
	<li><strong>Financial Market Policy: </strong>Ensure access to long-term financing and improve credit ratings for renewable energy projects.</li>
	<li><strong>Investment Policy: </strong>Treat foreign and domestic investors equally, protect intellectual property, and enforce contracts to reduce risks.</li>
	<li><strong>Integrated Country Platforms: </strong>Use comprehensive strategies, like Egypt's renewable energy laws and financial packages, to attract investment.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>De-risking Tools:</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Portfolio Approaches:</strong> Diversifying investments to manage risk.</li>
	<li><strong>Blended Finance: </strong>Combining public and private funds to reduce risks.</li>
	<li><strong>Guarantees and Insurances: </strong>Tools like government guarantees to protect investors.</li>
	<li><strong>Refinancing: </strong>Lowering costs through favourable loans or refinancing options.</li>
	<li><strong>Currency Risk Mitigation: </strong>Managing currency fluctuations to protect investments.</li>
	<li><strong>Better Transparency: </strong>Ensuring transparency to build investor confidence.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Finance Mechanisms:</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Equity Financing: </strong>Investors provide capital for a share of profits.</li>
	<li><strong>Debt Financing:</strong> Borrowing funds for clean energy projects.</li>
	<li><strong>Bonds:</strong> Issuing bonds to raise money for renewable energy projects.</li>
	<li><strong>Debt Swaps:</strong> Exchanging debt for investments in clean energy.</li>
	<li><strong>Energy Service Agreements:</strong> Contracts where companies provide energy services in return for payment.</li>
	<li><strong>Purchase Agreements: </strong>Long-term contracts to buy clean energy.</li>
	<li><strong>Carbon Financing: </strong>Earning funds from carbon credits by reducing emissions.</li>
</ul>

<p>India is aiming to add 300 GW of renewable energy by 2030, which presents significant investment opportunities. To attract clean energy investments, the country has implemented integrated policies and financial incentives, including tax benefits. It has also established the Greenhouse Gas Program to monitor emissions effectively. India also started a fossil fuel subsidy swap in 2013 to level the playing field between fossil fuels and renewable energy sources.</p>

<h2><strong>Key concepts related to clean energy financing:</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Counterparty Guarantees: </strong>A party guarantees another will fulfil a third party's obligations.</li>
	<li><strong>Liquidity Facilities: </strong>Short-term funding to cover cash flow gaps.</li>
	<li><strong>Convertible Instruments: </strong>Products that can convert into equity, reducing investment risks.</li>
	<li><strong>Refinancing: </strong>Changing loan terms to improve borrowing conditions.</li>
	<li><strong>All-Equity Bridge Financing: </strong>Temporary funding for short-term expenses until long-term financing is secured.</li>
	<li><strong>Project Preparation Activities: </strong>Steps taken before financial closure to minimise risks.</li>
	<li><strong>Technical Assistance: </strong>Advisory support to reduce transaction risks.</li>
	<li><strong>Project Preparation Facilities (PPFs): </strong>Funding structures for project preparation.</li>
	<li><strong>Currency Risk Mitigation: </strong>Strategies to protect against currency fluctuations.</li>
	<li><strong>Local Currency Financing: </strong>Borrowing in the currency of income to reduce risks.</li>
	<li><strong>Equity Financing: </strong>Investors own shares in projects, providing long-term capital.</li>
	<li><strong>Debt Financing: </strong>Raising money by selling debt instruments.</li>
	<li><strong>Concessional Loans: </strong>Loans with favourable terms for accessible financing.</li>
	<li><strong>Revolving Credit Facilities (RCFs): </strong>Flexible borrowing options.</li>
	<li><strong>Securitisation: </strong>Pooling debts to create securities for investors.</li>
	<li><strong>Microfinance Loans: </strong>Small loans for individuals or small businesses lacking access to traditional banking.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists announced on Thursday a milestone in neurobiological research with the mapping of the entire brain of an adult fruit fly, a feat that may provide insight into brains across the animal kingdom, including people.</p>

<p>The research detailed more than 50 million connections between more than 139,000 neurons - brain nerve cells - in the insect, a species whose scientific name is Drosophila melanogaster and is often used in neurobiological studies. The research sought to decipher how brains are wired and the signals underlying healthy brain functions. It also could pave the way for mapping the brains of other species.</p>

<p>"You might be asking why we should care about the brain of a fruit fly. My simple answer is that if we can truly understand how any brain functions, it's bound to tell us something about all brains," said Princeton University professor of neuroscience and computer science Sebastian Seung, one of the co-leaders of the work published in a series of studies in the journal Nature.</p>

<p>While some people may be more interested in swatting flies than studying them, some of the researchers found aesthetic satisfaction in peering at the fruit fly brain, less than 0.04 inches (1 mm) wide.</p>

<p>"It's beautiful," said University of Cambridge neuroscientist and research co-leader Gregory Jefferis.</p>

<p>The map devised by the researchers provided a wiring diagram, known as a connectome, for the brain of an adult fruit fly. Similar research previously was conducted with simpler organisms, such as the worm Caenorhabditis elegans and the fruit fly's larval stage. The adult fruit fly presented more complicated behaviours to study through its brain wiring.</p>

<p>"One of the major questions we're addressing is how the wiring in the brain, its neurons and connections, can give rise to animal behaviour," said Princeton neuroscientist Mala Murthy, another of the co-leaders of the research.</p>

<p>"And flies are an important model system for neurosciences. Their brains solve many of the same problems we do... They're capable of sophisticated behaviours like the execution of walking and flying, learning and memory behaviours, navigation, feeding and even social interactions, which is a behaviour that we studied in my lab at Princeton," Murthy added.</p>

<p>One of the studies analyzed brain circuits underlying walking and discovered how flies halt. Another analyzed the fly's taste network and grooming circuits behind behavior such as when it uses a leg to remove dirt from its antennae. Another looked at the visual system including how the fly's eyes process motion and color information. Still, another one analyzed connectivity through the brain, discovering a large assemblage of "hub neurons" that may speed up information flow.</p>

<p>The researchers fashioned a map tracking the organization of the hemispheres and behavioural circuits inside the fly's brain. They also identified the full set of cell classes in its brain, pinpointing different varieties of neurons and chemical connections - synapses - between these nerve cells, and looked at the types of chemicals secreted by the neurons.</p>

<p>The work was conducted by a large international collaboration of scientists known as the FlyWire Consortium.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A father from Indiana, USA, has been handed the maximum prison sentence of 16 years after his six-month-old baby was severely disfigured in a rat attack inside what prosecutors described as a “house of horrors.”</p>

<p>In September 2023, the infant was found covered in blood with more than 50 rat bites. According to the local Vanderburgh County Prosecutor's Office, David Schonabaum called 911 from his house, saying his infant son in his bassinet was covered in blood. The father told the first responders that there was a rat infestation in the house. "The 6-month-old baby was found in his bassinet in a pool of blood with over 50 bites to his body including his face and extremities. The infant's right hand suffered the most traumatic injuries with all four fingers and the thumb missing flesh and exposing the fingertip bones," the prosecutor's office said.</p>

<p>The rat attack “permanently disfigured” the baby and, as a result, he will “suffer for a lifetime,” it added.</p>

<p><br />

<p>Prosecutor Diana Moers said, “This case is horrific, and we will live with the images of this baby forever. It is completely shocking to the conscience that anyone would live in these conditions, much less allow their children, baby, and animals to live among absolute filth when they cannot help themselves,” adding, “This baby lived in an absolute house of horrors along with his siblings and pet dog.”</p>

<p>Schonabaum was convicted in September 2024 on three felony charges related to the neglect and endangerment of his children. According to a report on Fox 59, he was sentenced to 16 years in prison on October 2, 2024. Angel Schonabaum, the child's mother, entered a plea agreement last week and is set to be sentenced later this month. Meanwhile, Delaina Thurman, the baby's aunt, received a sentence of probation earlier this year for her role in the neglect.</p>

<p>The family's home was found to be in a state of extreme neglect, with authorities describing it as infested with rats, piled high with clutter, and filled with trash, bugs, and rat droppings. According to the Vanderburgh County Prosecutor's Office, “Three children in the home had been bitten by rats before the injuries the 6-month-old had suffered,” prompting involvement from the Indiana Department of Child Services. Despite interventions and warnings, conditions in the home remained unchanged, leaving the children in ongoing danger.</p>

<p>“It is also unimaginable how a rat was able to do such damage to this infant before his father called for help,” added Prosecutor Diana Moers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres underscored Mahatma Gandhi's message of non-violence, peace and equality as he voiced deep concern over a world "bristling with violence" and conflicts raging from Ukraine to the Middle East.</p>

<p>“On the International Day of non-violence, we commemorate the birthday of Mahatma Gandhi and reaffirm the values to which he dedicated his life: equality, respect, peace and justice,” Mr Guterres said in his message for the day, commemorating Gandhi's birthday on October 2.</p>

<p>Voicing concern that the world today is bristling with violence, Mr Guterres said across the globe, conflicts are raging.</p>

<p>“From Ukraine to Sudan, the Middle East and far beyond, war is creating a hellscape of destruction, destitution and fear. Inequality and climate chaos are undermining the foundations of peace. And hate whipped up online is spilling over onto the streets,” he said.</p>

<p>The UN chief underscored that Gandhi believed non-violence was the greatest force available to humanity, more powerful than any weapon. He called on the international community to together build institutions to “support that noble vision.” A special event was planned on Wednesday at the UN headquarters titled 'Gandhian Values and UN Charter', organised by the Permanent Mission of India to the UN to commemorate the International Day of Non-Violence.</p>

<p>During that event, Ivor Fung, Chef de Cabinet of the President of the 79th session of the United Nations General Assembly Philemon Yang, said that Gandhi's life stands as a powerful testament to the effectiveness of peaceful protests, inspiring people across the world, particularly in Asia and Africa.</p>

<p>Delivering a message on behalf of Yang, Mr Fung said that leaders such as Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King Jr were deeply influenced by Gandhi's concept of ‘Satyagraha'.</p>

<p>“As the world endures a turbulent period with conflicts raging in Gaza, Lebanon, Myanmar, Sudan, Ukraine and elsewhere, the Mahatma's message of peace resonates more strongly than ever,” he said.</p>

<p>Mr Fung called on members of the international community to not only honour the values that Gandhi embodied but reaffirm “our commitment to the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.</p>

<p>“Let us resolve to end conflict, halt violence, protect human rights and strive for a more just and equitable world. By doing so, we carry forward the legacy of Gandhi and the founders of the United Nations, shaping a future where peace and justice prevail.”</p>

<p>In his address, India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Parvathaneni Harish said that today when the world grapples with violence, armed conflicts and humanitarian emergencies, the ideals of non-violence, dialogue and tolerance, promulgated by Gandhi continue to “guide our actions in ensuring peace and stability around the world." Earlier in the day, Harish paid floral tribute to the bust of Mahatma Gandhi at the North Lawns of the United Nations.</p>

<p>He said the bust “stands as a reminder to humanity to follow his ideals in letter and spirit and to create a better and peaceful world, which is a fundamental objective of the United Nations.” Harish stressed that the story of India reflects Mahatma Gandhi's belief that strength comes from righteousness, not force; that power comes from truth, not might, and that victory comes from moral courage, not imposed submission.</p>

<p>Harish said that today's commemoration “helps us in reflecting on the life” of Gandhi and reaffirming the universal relevance of the principle of non-violence to secure a culture of peace, of tolerance and understanding around the world.</p>

<p>Addressing the special event, Sri Lanka's Permanent Representative to the United Nations Ambassador Mohan Pieris said that the present-day world is passing through a period of transition.</p>

<p>“Unimaginable changes have been witnessed these past years,” he said.</p>

<p>Pieris drew a comparison between the “highest values that have been prescribed for humanity by one of the greatest of humankind and an entity which has been created by we the people in a Charter with the intention to uphold the highest values of freedom for humankind in the hope of ensuring that we live in peace and in dignity.” Pieris said that the UN Charter's focus on the peaceful resolution of conflicts and the prevention of wars “mirrors Gandhi's lifelong commitment to resolving disputes through dialogue and non-violent means.” He said that Gandhi's principle of ‘Ahimsa', non-violence in thought, word and action is foundational to his worldview.</p>

<p>Non-violence is a way of living in harmony with others.</p>

<p>"Now, when you contrast that with Article 1 of the UN Charter, it stresses the importance of maintaining international peace and security through peaceful means, mirroring, I say, Gandhi's advocacy for non-violent resolution.” Pieris highlighted that Gandhi's philosophy directly has a profound influence on the founding values of the United Nations, and has continued to inspire international movements.</p>

<p>He however noted that while Gandhian values align with the UN Charter, “some critics argue that the global system, including the United Nations, often prioritises Western political and economic interests which may conflict with Gandhian vision of decentralised power and economic independence.” He said that as the UN continues its efforts towards global peace and justice, the principles of nonviolence, truth, and equality as espoused by Gandhi remain crucial in shaping a more just and sustainable future.</p>

<p>The UN observes the International Day of Non-Violence on October 2, the birthday of Mahatma Gandhi.</p>

<p>According to the General Assembly resolution of June 2007, which established the commemoration, the International Day is an occasion to "disseminate the message of non-violence, including through education and public awareness".</p>

<p>The resolution reaffirms "the universal relevance of the principle of non-violence" and the desire "to secure a culture of peace, tolerance, understanding and non-violence".</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dozens of tigers and lions in captivity died in the past month in southern Vietnam with tests showing they were positive for bird flu, health ministry and state media said on Thursday.</p>

<p>Two samples taken from dead tigers at Mango Garden Resort in Dong Nai province have tested positive for the H5N1 strain of bird flu, the Ministry of Health said in a statement. Twenty tigers have died at the resort since early last month.</p>

<p>The spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, to mammals including cows, dogs, cats and even dolphins worldwide has raised concerns about potential human-to-human transmission.</p>

<p>In neighbouring Long An province, 27 tigers and three lions died from bird flu at My Quynh Safari from Sept. 6 to 18, state media reported, citing provincial agricultural authorities.</p>

<p>The tigers at Mango Garden Resort had been fed chicken before they died, Phan Van Phuc, an official of Dong Nai province's Centre for Disease Control, said in the health ministry statement.</p>

<p>"It's likely that the tigers had been infected from sick chicken, and the authorities are tracking the source of the chicken to determine the cause," the statement quoted Phan as saying.</p>

<p>On its website, the World Health Organization warns against consuming raw or incompletely cooked meat and eggs from regions experiencing avian influenza outbreaks due to the high risk of infection.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[John McGinty and his wife, Georgia, were involved in an accident in March 2022 when their Uber driver ran a red light and was struck by another vehicle.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A New Jersey couple, severely injured in a car accident during an Uber ride, has been prevented from suing the company after a court ruled they were bound by an arbitration agreement signed while ordering from Uber Eats.</p>

<p>John McGinty&nbsp;and Georgia McGinty were involved in the crash in March 2022, when their Uber driver ran a red light and was struck by another vehicle. The collision left both with significant injuries, including multiple fractures for Georgia and lasting impairment for John.<br />
<br />
According to court filings, they suffered “serious physical, psychological, and financial damages.”<br />
<br />
Despite their injuries, the couple's attempt to take Uber to court for a jury trial was not allowed. The ruling cited the terms and conditions, including a mandatory arbitration clause, of Uber's services. This clause was accepted when the couple's daughter placed a separate order on Uber Eats using Georgia's phone. The court upheld the company's argument that by agreeing to Uber's terms during that transaction, the family waived their right to pursue claims in court.<br />
<br />
The couple argued that it was their minor daughter, using Georgia's phone, who accepted the terms of service for Uber Eats by clicking a button that falsely confirmed she was over 18. However, the court concluded the arbitration agreement, which covers auto accidents and personal injuries, was “valid and enforceable.”<br />
<br />
In response, Uber told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/02/business/uber-eats-accident-lawsuit/index.html" rel="nofollow,noindex">CNN</a> that Georgia “agreed to Uber's terms of use, including the arbitration agreement, on multiple occasions,” and even took rides after agreeing.<br />
<br />
“While the plaintiffs continue to tell the press that it was their daughter who ordered Uber Eats and accepted the terms of use, it's worth noting that in court they could only ‘surmise' that that was the case but could not recall whether ‘their daughter ordered food independently or if Georgia assisted," CNN quoted a spokesperson as saying.<br />
<br />
The couple expressed disappointment in a statement, saying they were “surprised and heartbroken” by the ruling. “We are horrified at what the court's decision suggests: A large corporation like Uber can avoid being sued in a court of law by injured consumers because of contractual language buried in a dozen-page-long user agreement concerning services unrelated to the one that caused the consumers' injuries,” CNN quoted the McGintys as saying.<br />
<br />
Previously, a lower court said that Uber's arbitration clause was not enforceable, arguing the terms of service pop-up did not inform Georgia that she was waiving her right to a judicial trial. However, following an appeal from Uber, the appellate court reversed that decision, siding with the company.<br />
<br />
The McGintys' legal team is considering further action, with their lawyers telling CNN that they will “likely” petition the New Jersey Supreme Court.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sean “Diddy” Combs' famous White Parties in the Hamptons are remembered for their wild, adult-themed antics. However, for one guest, the experience came much earlier than most. Justin Litovsky, now 30, recalls attending the 1999 bash as a six-year-old, unaware that he was walking into one of the summer's most talked-about parties.</p>

<p>Mr Litovsky's parents, David Allen, a photographer, and Maya Litovsky, unknowingly took him to what was billed as a July 3 “afternoon barbecue” hosted by Diddy. However, what they found upon arrival was anything but kid-friendly. The event was packed with bottles of alcohol, scantily clad guests and an atmosphere far removed from what any child might expect at a barbecue.</p>

<p>“I actually wanted to get in,” Mr Litovsky recalled about the pool at the party. “Anytime we went anywhere with a pool, I wanted to swim.” Maya Litovsky told the <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/02/us-news/sean-diddy-combs-party-i-saw-naked-women-when-i-was-6/ ">NY Post</a> that she did not give her son the opportunity to get in there. “There were bottles everywhere and naked women,” she said.</p>

<p>Ms Maya, now an influencer, reflected, “I wasn't sure if this was appropriate or normal. I wondered how kids were allowed into the party to begin with.”</p>

<p>Justin Litovsky admitted he wasn't sure at the time if “t**s were a good thing or a bad thing.”</p>

<p>The guest list included high-profile figures like Jay-Z, Lil' Kim, designer Donna Karan, and model Tyson Beckford.</p>

<p>Though Diddy's parties would later come with a kid curfew, in 1999, Justin Litovsky was the only child at the event. “I don't remember seeing one other child,” he said. “I'm normally the type to want to go play [with other kids].” Despite the unusual circumstances, Mr Litovsky's father managed to capture a picture of his son and Diddy. “I don't look like I have a normal smile in the pic,” he noted.</p>

<p>As the party carried on into the night, Mr Litovsky and his family decided to leave before things could escalate. “We didn't see people having sex, but we left at 9:30 pm,” Ms Maya explained. “The party continued, and nobody was getting out of the pool. So, who knows what happened.”</p>

<p>Diddy was arrested by federal authorities last month. The rapper is facing <a href="http://https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/over-100-people-to-sue-us-rapper-sean-diddy-combs-in-sex-assault-case-6698693#:~:text=Combs%20was%20indicted%20last%20month,parties%20using%20threats%20and%20violence. ">allegations of sexual abuse and exploitation by over 100 people</a>, with lawsuits expected to be filed across multiple states. The accusers will include victims of sexual assault, rape and abuse of minors, attorneys announced. Spanning decades, these allegations&nbsp;include accusations of drugging and raping women, racketeering and sex trafficking and involvement in criminal activities. Now Diddy is awaiting trial at the Metropolitan Detention Centre in Brooklyn and has pleaded not guilty.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Singapore's Indian-origin former transport minister S Iswaran was handed a one-year jail sentence on Thursday after he pleaded guilty to five charges relating to corruption and blocking of justice in the High Court on September 24.</p>

<p>The sentence is more than the six to seven months asked for by the prosecution, which Justice Hoong considers "manifestly inadequate".</p>

<p>The higher the office held by the offender as a public servant, the higher his level of culpability, said Justice Hoong.</p>

<p>The former minister is the first person to be prosecuted under Section 165 in post-independent Singapore, reported The Straits Times.</p>

<p>Judge Vincent Hoong turns to the mitigating factors that the defence has highlighted, including Iswaran's public service to Singapore, his voluntary disgorgement to the benefits and his early plea of guilt.</p>

<p>Given that the rest of the 30 charges that were taken into consideration bear similarities with the proceeded charges where he received gifts, the judge said that these charges revealed the scale and repetition of offending over a significant period of time. This is a culpability-increasing factor, says Judge Hoong.</p>

<p>His public service and contributions to Singapore were at most a neutral factor, adds the judge.</p>

<p>Justice Hoong says he has difficulty believing that Iswaran was remorseful, as the latter had made public statements rejecting the charges as false.</p>

<p>He added that he is unable to accept the defence's submissions. The accused is only eligible for a sentencing discount of up to 10 per cent.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Next week's Nobel Prize announcements will crown achievements that made the world a better place, a glimmer of optimism amid a spiralling Middle East conflict, war in Ukraine, famine in Sudan and a collapsing climate.</p>

<p>The prize winners will be announced between October 7 and 14.</p>

<p>For the Peace Prize, the most prestigious of the six Nobels, experts say it is harder than ever to predict the Norwegian Nobel Committee's pick, to be revealed on October 11.</p>

<p>Swedish philanthropist Alfred Nobel created the prizes in his 1895 will, stipulating that they go to those who have "conferred the greatest benefit on humankind".</p>

<p>But given the bleak state of world affairs, perhaps no one should get the Peace Prize this year, suggested Dan Smith, the head of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.</p>

<p>"Maybe this is the time to say, 'Yes, many people are working very hard, but it's not getting there and we need more people and world leaders to wake up and realise that we are in an extremely dangerous situation,'" he said.</p>

<p>"We have now over 50 armed conflicts around the world. The lethality of those armed conflicts has increased dramatically in the past two decades," he said.</p>

<p><strong>'A worthy candidate'</strong></p>

<p>Not awarding a Peace Prize would be viewed as an acknowledgement of failure by the award committee, and is therefore deemed unlikely.</p>

<p>"I'm confident there will be a worthy candidate for the Peace Prize this year as well," the secretary of the committee, Olav Njolstad, told AFP.</p>

<p>Last year, the award went to jailed Iranian activist Narges Mohammadi for her fight against the oppression of women in Iran.</p>

<p>A total of 286 nominations are known to have been submitted for the Peace Prize this year, though the committee keeps the names sealed for 50 years.</p>

<p>Those entitled to nominate are however allowed to reveal their picks.</p>

<p>Among those known to be on the list are some actors involved in the Middle East, such as the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA; Palestinian human rights group Al-Haq; its Israeli counterpart B'Tselem and the International Court of Justice.</p>

<p>Given the existential risks to humanity posed by weapons systems that can operate autonomously without human control, several Nobel-watchers have cited the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots as a possible laureate.</p>

<p>The Nobel Prize in Literature, to be announced on October 10, likewise generates frenzied speculation every year.</p>

<p>Several pundits believe Chinese author Can Xue will be the Swedish Academy's choice this year -- and she has the lowest odds on several betting sites.</p>

<p>An avant-garde fiction writer often likened to Kafka, her experimental style flips between utopia and dystopia and transforms the mundane into the surreal.</p>

<p>"I think it will be a woman from a language zone outside Europe," Bjorn Wiman, culture editor at Sweden's newspaper of record Dagens Nyheter, told AFP.</p>

<p>The last Chinese author to win was Mo Yan in 2012.</p>

<p><strong>Surprise name for literature?</strong></p>

<p>With no public shortlist, it is always difficult to predict which way the 18-member Swedish Academy is leaning.</p>

<p>Names making the rounds in Stockholm's literary circles include Australian novelist Gerald Murnane, Britain's Salman Rushdie, Antiguan-American writer Jamaica Kincaid, Canadian poet Anne Carson, Hungary's Laszlo Krasznahorkai, Mircea Cartarescu of Romania, Kenya's Ngugi wa Thiong'o and Japan's Haruki Murakami.</p>

<p>Last year, Norwegian playwright Jon Fosse took home the honour.</p>

<p>The Academy often shines a spotlight on relatively unknown writers.</p>

<p>"I think they've gone to great pains to find some writer that will catch the culture commentariat with their pants down," Wiman said.</p>

<p>The Nobel season kicks off on Monday with the Prize in Physiology or Medicine.</p>

<p>Analytics group Clarivate, which monitors potential science laureates, speculated that award could go to research on the genetics of lipid metabolism, which has led to new drugs to treat cardiovascular diseases.</p>

<p>Another candidate could be studies of the basal ganglia, which are parts of the brain associated with motor control and emotions.</p>

<p>Or the prize could go to the discovery of genomic imprinting, which has increased our understanding of epigenetics and mammalian development.</p>

<p>Last year, the Prize in Physiology or Medicine went to researchers Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman for their work on messenger RNA technology that paved the way for groundbreaking Covid-19 vaccines.</p>

<p>The Prize in Physics follows on Tuesday ahead of Wednesday's Prize in Chemistry. The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences then wraps up the 2024 Nobel season on Monday, October 14.</p>

<p>This year's laureates will take home the prized sum of 11 million kronor ($1 million) per discipline, to be shared if there is more than one winner.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A senior adviser to Vice President Kamala Harris met American Muslim and Arab leaders on Wednesday as Harris' presidential campaign seeks to win back voters angry at US support for Israel's wars in Gaza and Lebanon.</p>

<p>Harris' national security adviser, Phil Gordan, told the community leaders in the virtual meeting that the administration supports a ceasefire in Gaza, diplomacy in Lebanon and stability in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, the vice president's office said.</p>

<p>Ali Dagher, a Lebanese-American attorney and community leader, said the outreach from Harris' office was not enough. "It's too little, too late," said Dagher, who did not participate in the meeting.</p>

<p>Harris, a Democrat, faces Republican former President Donald Trump on Nov. 5 in what polls show to be a tight presidential race.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden won most of the 2020 Muslim and Arab votes, but their backing of Democrats has fallen sharply during nearly a year that Israel has been fighting Hamas in Gaza. Activists say Biden and Harris have done too little to stop Israel's military campaign in the Palestinian enclave.</p>

<p>The Israeli military offensive in Gaza has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, Palestinian health authorities say. Israel was responding to an Oct. 7, 2023 incursion by Hamas gunmen, who Israel says killed around 1,200 people and abducted about 250 hostages. Gaza has suffered a humanitarian crisis with nearly all its 2 million people displaced and widespread hunger in the enclave.</p>

<p>In Lebanon, more than 1,900 people have been killed and 9,000 wounded during almost a year of cross-border fighting between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah, with most of the deaths in the past two weeks, according to Lebanese government statistics.</p>

<p>Emgage, a Muslim-American advocacy group, recently endorsed Harris, while others have urged supporters to shun her. While they have not supported Trump, their choice not to vote or to vote for third-party candidates could hurt Harris, analysts say.</p>

<p>US support for Israel has led to large protests, especially in hotly contested swing states like Michigan that could decide the election. Harris has offered no substantive policy differences on Israel from Biden, who stepped aside as presidential candidate in July.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

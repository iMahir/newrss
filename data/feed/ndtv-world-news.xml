       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Five days after narrowly escaping assassination, Donald Trump will accept his presidential nomination on Thursday before an adoring crowd of supporters, the final act in his transformation of the Republican Party into the party of Trump.</p>

<p>His brush with death has fueled the growing quasi-religious fervor among the party faithful, elevating him from political leader to a man they believe is protected by God.</p>

<p>"Trump, Trump, Trump," attendees roared at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee when he appeared each night this week, his right ear bandaged, to listen to speaker after speaker intone reverentially about him and reference God's hand in his survival from a would-be assassin's bullet.</p>

<p>Republicans are uniting behind him this week. With most dissent quelled and his grip on the party never tighter, Trump will be in a much stronger position than in his 2017-2021 term to follow through on his agenda if he wins the Nov. 5 election.</p>

<p>Untrammeled by the internal divisions that sometimes stymied him in his first term, Trump would be freer to pursue hard-edged policies that include mass deportations as part of a crackdown on illegal migration, aggressive trade policies, and dismissing government officials seen as insufficiently loyal.</p>

<p>Even if Trump retakes the White House, Republicans take control of both houses of Congress, and conservatives go on holding a Supreme Court super majority, there would still be institutional checks on a second Trump term.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>He could be kept in check by Congress, the courts, and a public that elects a new Congress every two years and a president every four years, constitutional experts say.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, many Trump supporters want to see a powerful president.</p>

<p>"You need a strong leader at the top," said Bill Dowd, a 79-year-old lumber business owner who was a guest of the Colorado delegation in Milwaukee.</p>

<p>"I'm a very, very big Ronald Reagan fan. Ronald Reagan pulled the party together also," Dowd said.</p>

<p>Dowd acknowledged that some of his Republican friends feared that Trump might try to abuse his power. He said while he did not share that fear he believed that dissent should not be stifled in any party.</p>

<p>For Trump's critics and political opponents, this is a dark and disturbing moment: they see the modern Republican Party as a cult of personality, a base from which Trump could pursue extreme policies and create America's first truly imperial presidency, threatening the future of its democratic norms.</p>

<p>"Donald Trump has called for the 'termination' of the Constitution, promised to be a 'dictator' 'on day one,' and now his Supreme Court justices say he can rule without any checks on his power," said Ammar Moussa, campaign spokesman for incumbent President Joe Biden, Trump's Democratic rival.</p>

<p>"Trump is a liar, but we believe him when he says he will rule as a dictator," Moussa said.</p>

<p>Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said Democratic assertions that Trump threatens American democracy and could become an autocrat if reelected were "fear-mongering" and a "blatant effort to deceive the American people."</p>

<p><strong>An Unrestricted Trump</strong></p>

<p>In Milwaukee, nearly all of the 30 delegates, guests, and elected Republicans interviewed by Reuters for this story acknowledged that their party had become the party of Trump but dismissed any suggestion that it had become cult-like.</p>

<p>"I believe that President Trump is a transformational figure, a man of destiny who God providentially saved from death on Saturday," Louisiana delegate Ed Tarpley said. "He's been given a special mission in our country. God's providential hand has elevated Donald Trump to a different status."</p>

<p>Those interviewed said they wanted a President Trump who was not constrained by bureaucracy or Congress to execute his agenda. They were in favor of a more expansive use of executive action - decisions made by a president that do not need congressional approval.</p>

<p>They want nothing to stand in the way of his plans to deport millions of people in the country illegally and to reduce the size of the federal bureaucracy. In his first term Trump often complained of "deep state" bureaucrats he said were seeking to thwart him.</p>

<p>"The president... must be allowed to implement his policies free of a bureaucracy resistant to them and unelected officials who do not agree with them," Tarpley said.</p>

<p>There are constitutional limits to what Trump can do through the power of his office, however, and any policies could still face lawsuits.</p>

<p>"I think the fears of critics are overblown, in the sense that they're more worried about the substance of his likely policies than the possibility that they'll be adopted through unilateral executive action," Stewart Baker, a former general counsel for the U.S. National Security Agency, said.</p>

<p>If Trump goes too far, his opponents say, they may still be able to count on federal courts to check him.</p>

<p>"We are mindful of the fact that we have a very conservative Supreme Court. But what we have found is that even Trump-appointed judges have ruled against his policies and found them illegal," said Kica Matos, president of the National Immigration Law Center.</p>

<p>Half of Republican respondents to a Reuters/Ipsos poll this week said they agreed with the statement that "the country is in a crisis and needs a strong president who should be allowed to rule without too much interference from the courts and Congress."</p>

<p>That was substantially higher than the 35% of Democrats and 33% of independents who agreed with the sentiment.</p>

<p>Only one convention attendee interviewed by Reuters, a senior Republican from a southern state, said he was worried about a second Trump administration. He said he feared Trump would become an autocrat, fill government agencies with yes men, and seek revenge on his political enemies.</p>

<p>Referring to Trump's pledge to supporters that he will be their "retribution," the Republican, who asked to remain anonymous, said: "That effort will be horrendous."</p>

<p>Trump was widely criticized for saying during the campaign that should he win, he will be a "dictator" - if only for a day, a comment he later said was a joke.</p>

<p>Democrats have rebuked him for promising to pardon his supporters imprisoned for the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol that was triggered by his refusal to accept his 2020 election loss.</p>

<p>Trump, who was convicted of making hush money payments to a former porn star and faces charges related to his efforts to overturn Biden's victory, has threatened to use the Justice Department to pursue opponents, including Biden. Trump has pleaded not guilty to the charges.</p>

<p>Former Republican presidential candidate Asa Hutchinson said he was concerned about the lack of constraints on Trump in a second term.</p>

<p>"The Department of Justice is probably the perfect example of that. Clearly, a President Trump would have a close hand at directing the activities of the Justice Department," Hutchinson, a former governor of Arkansas, told Reuters.</p>

<p><strong>Making 'Nixon Blush'</strong></p>

<p>The implications of a second Trump term are profoundly disturbing for America and the world, said presidential historian Timothy Naftali, a former director at the presidential library of Richard Nixon, who resigned from office in disgrace in 1974 after the Watergate scandal.</p>

<p>Naftali said a recent Supreme Court decision granting sweeping immunity to a president for most acts while in office, combined with a pliant Republican Party, means there are limited constraints on Trump should he act maliciously and exploit the office for his own personal power and political retribution.</p>

<p>"He can gut the Justice Department and engage in a revenge tour that would make Nixon blush," Naftali said.</p>

<p>To be sure, Trump would not be the first president to test the limits of executive power. Leaders including former Democratic presidents Franklin Roosevelt and Barack Obama have taken an expansive view of their authority.</p>

<p>Even with the July 1 ruling by the high court on presidential immunity, Trump ostensibly would still be bound by the U.S. Constitution's separation of powers that reserves key functions to Congress and the judiciary.</p>

<p>Lara Trump, the Republican National Committee co-chair, and Trump's daughter-in-law acknowledged this week that governance by executive action - which can be overturned in the courts or by a successor - was not ideal. That's why it was crucial for Republicans to hold onto the House of Representatives in November and take the Senate from Democrats, she said, "so we don't have to rely on executive actions and we can actually see some lasting change."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Trump has appeared at the convention wearing a large bandage where a would-be assassin's bullet grazed his right ear at a rally on Saturday.</p>

<p>"We're helping President Trump set a new fashion statement," said Arizona delegate Susan Ellsworth. "We're standing in solidarity with him for his wound. And we just want him to know how much we love him."</p>

<p>The four-day convention will culminate with a prime-time address by Trump on Thursday when he formally accepts the party's nomination to face Democrat Joe Biden in a rematch of their 2020 race.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US president Barack Obama has told allies that Joe Biden needs to reconsider his reelection bid, the Washington Post reported on Thursday.</p>

<p>Obama believes that Biden's path to victory has diminished and that the 81-year-old should "seriously consider the viability of his candidacy," the newspaper said, citing people briefed on his thinking.</p>

<p>It said there was no immediate comment from Obama, who was in office while Biden was vice president from 2009 to 2017 and who remains hugely influential in the Democratic party.</p>

<p>Obama would be the most heavyweight Democrat so far to join a growing chorus in the party calling for Biden to drop out, following a disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Biden, who is isolating with Covid at his beach house, has rejected concerns about his age and fitness and insisted that he is staying in the race for the White House.</p>

<p>Pressure is mounting, though, with Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries also both reportedly meeting with Biden in recent days to warn that his candidacy threatens his party's prospects in November's election.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>James Michael Cline, the finance executive who launched the Fandango movie ticketing business in 2000, died by suicide at the age of 64 in Manhattan on Tuesday morning after jumping from the Kimberly Hotel's 20th floor, as per a report in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/j-michael-cline-dead-fandango-founder-jumped-off-hotel-1236076223/"><em>Variety</em></a>.</p>

<p>According to a statement by the New York Police Department, the officials reached the hotel at 10:19 am and found "an unconscious and unresponsive male with injuries indicative of a fall from an elevated position. The investigation remains ongoing."</p>

<p>According to <em>TMZ</em>, he left a suicide note in his room.</p>

<p>After leaving Fandango, which is now owned by NBC Universal and Warner Bros, in 2011, Mr Cline founded Accumen, Insureon, and Accolade through his Accretive company, which had also made an investment in Fandango. He also ran a number of tech companies and venture capital businesses, including the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He was the executive chairman of Juxtapose, a company incubator that has helped establish firms such as Orchard, Tend, Earned, Great Jones, and Nectar. He was also an advocate of animal protection and served as the chairman of the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation.</p>

<p>Mr Cline obtained his MBA from Harvard Business School after graduating from Cornell University.</p>

<p>He is survived by his wife Pamela B Cline and their six children. According to the outlet, they over $20 million for their 5-bedroom lakefront Palm Beach house in late 2020.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ChatGPT maker OpenAI said on Thursday it was launching GPT-4o mini, a cost-efficient small AI model, aimed at making its technology more affordable and less energy-intensive, allowing the startup to target a broader pool of customers.</p>

<p>Microsoft-backed OpenAI, which is the market leader in the AI software space, has been working to make it cheaper and faster for developers to build applications based on its model, at a time when deep-pocketed rivals like Meta and Google rush to grab a bigger share in the market.</p>

<p>Priced at 15 cents per million input tokens and 60 cents per million output tokens, the GPT-4o mini is more than 60% cheaper than the GPT-3.5 Turbo, OpenAI said.</p>

<p>It currently outperforms the GPT-4 model on chat preferences and scored 82% on Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU), OpenAI said.</p>

<p>MMLU is a textual intelligence and reasoning benchmark used to evaluate the capabilities of language models. A higher MMLU score signifies it can understand and use language better across a variety of domains, enhancing real-world usage.</p>

<p>The GPT-4o mini model's score compared with 77.9% for Google's Gemini Flash and 73.8% for Anthropic's Claude Haiku, according to OpenAI.</p>

<p>Smaller language models require less computational power to run, making them a more affordable option for companies with limited resources looking to deploy generative AI in their operations.</p>

<p>ChatGPT's Free, Plus, and Team users will be able to access GPT-4o mini starting Thursday, in place of GPT-3.5 Turbo, with enterprise users gaining access starting next week, OpenAI said.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A 60-year-old German man is likely the seventh person to be effectively cured of HIV after receiving a stem cell transplant, doctors announced on Thursday.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 60-year-old German man is likely the seventh person to be effectively cured of HIV after receiving a stem cell transplant, doctors announced on Thursday.</p>

<p>The painful and risky procedure is for people who have both HIV and aggressive leukaemia, so is not an option for almost all of the nearly 40 million people living with the deadly virus across the world.</p>

<p>The German man, who wished to remain anonymous, was dubbed the "next Berlin patient".</p>

<p>The original Berlin patient, Timothy Ray Brown, was the first person declared cured of HIV back in 2008. Brown died from cancer in 2020.</p>

<p>The second man from Berlin to achieve long-term HIV remission was announced ahead of the 25th International AIDS Conference being held in the German city of Munich next week.</p>

<p>He was first diagnosed with HIV in 2009, according to the research abstract being presented at the conference.</p>

<p>The man received a bone marrow transplant for his leukaemia in 2015. The procedure, which has a 10 percent risk of death, essentially replaces a person's immune system.</p>

<p>Then he stopped taking anti-retroviral drugs -- which reduce the amount of HIV in the blood -- in late 2018.</p>

<p>Nearly six years later, he appears to be both HIV and cancer-free, the medical researchers said.</p>

<p>Christian Gaebler, a doctor-researcher at Berlin's Charite University Hospital treating the patient, told AFP that the team cannot be "absolutely certain" every last trace of HIV has been eradicated.</p>

<p>But "the patient's case is highly suggestive of an HIV cure," Gaebler added. "He feels well and is enthusiastic about contributing to our research efforts."</p>

<p><strong>"Promising" For Wider Cure</strong></p>

<p>International AIDS Society President Sharon Lewin said researchers hesitate to use the word "cure" because it is not clear how long they need to follow up on such cases.</p>

<p>But more than five years in remission means the man "would be close" to being considered cured, she told a press conference.</p>

<p>There is an important difference between the man's case and the other HIV patients who have reached long-term remission, she said.</p>

<p>All but one of the other patients received stem cells from donors with a rare mutation in which part of their CCR5 gene was missing, blocking HIV from entering their body's cells.</p>

<p>Those donors had inherited two copies of the mutated CCR5 gene -- one from each parent -- making them "essentially immune" to HIV, Lewin said.</p>

<p>But the new Berlin patient is the first to have received stem cells from a donor who had inherited only one copy of the mutated gene.</p>

<p>Around 15 percent of people of European origin have one mutated copy, compared to one percent for both.</p>

<p>Researchers hope the latest success means there will be a much larger potential donor pool in the future.</p>

<p>The new case is also "promising" for the wider search for an HIV cure that works for all patients, Lewin said.</p>

<p>This is "because it suggests that you don't actually have to get rid of every single piece of CCR5 for gene therapy to work," she added.</p>

<p>The Geneva patient, whose case was announced at last year's AIDS conference, is the other exception among the seven. He received a transplant from a donor without any CCR5 mutations -- yet still achieved long-term remission.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden said Thursday he was extending his student loan forgiveness program by canceling the loans of an additional 35,000 Americans as he seeks reelection.</p>

<p>The latest move - amounting to $1.2 billion in student debt - brings to 4.76 million the number of people "who benefitted from our various debt relief actions", he said in a statement.</p>

<p>The borrowers, who will get an average of $35,000 in debt cancellation, include teachers, nurses, police officials, and first responders.</p>

<p>The announcement came on the final day of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where Donald Trump will accept the Republican nomination for the November election.</p>

<p>Biden vowed Thursday to "never stop working to make higher education affordable -- no matter how many times Republican elected officials try to stop us."</p>

<p>Earlier this year Biden unveiled fresh plans to reduce student loan debt for tens of millions of Americans, in his bid to win over young voters.</p>

<p>That was after the conservative-dominated US Supreme Court last year struck down the Democrat's earlier proposals to cancel several hundred billion dollars of debt.</p>

<p>Last month he cancelled debt owed by 160,000 people, while earlier in the year he announced student debt relief for 150,000 others.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladeshi students set fire to the country's state broadcaster on Thursday, a day after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina appeared on the network seeking to calm escalating clashes that have killed at least 32 people.</p>

<p>Hundreds of protesters demanding reform of civil service hiring rules fought back and overwhelmed riot police who had fired at them with rubber bullets.</p>

<p>The incensed crowd chased the retreating officers to BTV's headquarters in the capital Dhaka, then set ablaze the network's reception building and dozens of vehicles parked outside.</p>

<p>"Many people" were trapped inside as the fire spread, the broadcaster said in a Facebook post, but an official from the station later told AFP that they had safely evacuated the building.</p>

<p>"The fire is still going on," the official said. "We have come out to the main gate. Our broadcast has been shut down for now."</p>

<p>Hasina's government has ordered schools and universities to close indefinitely as police step up efforts to bring the country's deteriorating law and order situation under control.</p>

<p>The premier appeared on the broadcaster on Wednesday night to condemn the "murder" of protesters and vow that those responsible will be punished regardless of their political affiliation.</p>

<p>But violence worsened on the streets despite her appeal for calm as police again attempted to break up demonstrations with rubber bullets and tear gas volleys.</p>

<p>"Our first demand is that the prime minister must apologise to us," protester Bidisha Rimjhim, 18, told AFP.</p>

<p>"Secondly, justice must be ensured for our killed brothers," she added.</p>

<p>At least 25 people were killed on Thursday in addition to seven killed earlier in the week, according to a tally of casualty figures from hospitals compiled by AFP, with hundreds more wounded.</p>

<p>Police weaponry was the cause of at least two-thirds of those deaths, based on descriptions given to AFP by hospital figures.</p>

<p>"We've got seven dead here," an official at Uttara Crescent Hospital in the capital Dhaka, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisal, told AFP.</p>

<p>"The first two were students with rubber bullet injuries. The other five had gunshot injuries."</p>

<p>Nearly 1,000 others had been treated at the hospital for injuries sustained during clashes with police, the official said, adding many had rubber bullet wounds.</p>

<p>Didar Malekin of the online news outlet Dhaka Times told AFP that Mehedi Hasan, one of his reporters, had been killed while covering clashes in Dhaka.</p>

<p>Several cities across Bangladesh saw violence throughout the day as riot police marched on protesters who had begun another round of human blockades on roads and highways.</p>

<p>Helicopters rescued 60 police officers who were trapped on the roof of a campus building at Canadian University, the scene of some of Dhaka's fiercest clashes on Thursday, the elite Rapid Action Battalion police force said in a statement.</p>

<p><strong>"Calling Her A Dictator"</strong></p>

<p>Near-daily marches this month have demanded an end to a quota system that reserves more than half of civil service posts for specific groups, including children of veterans from the country's 1971 liberation war against Pakistan.</p>

<p>Critics say the scheme benefits children of pro-government groups that back Hasina, 76, who has ruled the country since 2009 and won her fourth consecutive election in January after a vote without genuine opposition.</p>

<p>Her administration is accused by rights groups of capturing state institutions and stamping out dissent, including by the extrajudicial killing of opposition activists.</p>

<p>Mubashar Hasan, a Bangladesh expert at the University of Oslo in Norway, said the protests had grown into a wider expression of discontent with Hasina's autocratic rule.</p>

<p>"They are protesting against the repressive nature of the state," he told AFP.</p>

<p>"Protesters are questioning Hasina's leadership, accusing her of clinging onto power by force," he added. "The students are in fact calling her a dictator."</p>

<p><strong>Mobile Internet Down</strong></p>

<p>Bangladeshis reported widespread mobile internet outages around the country on Thursday, two days after internet providers cut off access to Facebook -- the protest campaign's key organising platform.</p>

<p>Junior telecommunications minister Zunaid Ahmed Palak told reporters that social media had been "weaponised as a tool to spread rumours, lies and disinformation", forcing the government to restrict access.</p>

<p>Along with police crackdowns, demonstrators and students allied to the premier's ruling Awami League have also battled each other on the streets with hurled bricks and bamboo rods.</p>

<p>Rights group Amnesty International said video evidence from clashes this week showed that Bangladeshi security forces had used unlawful force.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Success rates of freezing eggs are comparable to those obtained by normal in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and are subject to the same variables of female age and embryo quality, according to a study.</p>

<p>When compared to other similar large-scale research conducted on egg freezing in other countries, the findings of this 15-year-long study based on nearly 30,000 frozen eggs revealed an overall live birth rate of 26 per cent per embryo transfer, as per the study published in the peer-reviewed journal Reproductive Biomedicine Online.</p>

<p>This varied depending on the age at which the eggs were frozen, with a lower rate in the over-35s and only 5 per cent in the over-40s.</p>

<p>After transferring all embryos developed from thawed eggs, the total live birth rate was 34 per cent, which increased to 45 per cent in women who had frozen their eggs before the age of 36, according to the study.</p>

<p>"These are results comparable with those nationally recorded in routine IVF," said Professor Nick Macklon, senior author of the study and Medical Director of the London Women's Clinic.</p>

<p>The number of women seeking egg-freezing treatment has increased from 150 in 2015 to over 800 in 2022, yet only 14 per cent return to thaw their eggs. Out of 2,171 patients, 299 returned, completing 332 thaw cycles.</p>

<p>The cumulative live birth rate is 36 per cent, rising to 57 per cent for those who froze eggs under age 35. "Freeze-all" cycles had a 30 per cent live birth rate, improving to 40 per cent with chromosomal screening (PGT-A). All live births in women aged 40 were from screened embryos.</p>

<p>Despite some scepticism, these results indicate that egg freezing and thawing offer a viable path to pregnancy, akin to IVF.</p>

<p>The study noted that "egg freezing and thawing can provide a very real opportunity for women to achieve pregnancy and live birth."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was elected for a second term on Thursday after pledging to create a continental "defence union" and stay the course on Europe's green transition while cushioning its burden on industry.</p>

<p>Members of the European Parliament backed von der Leyen's bid for another five-year term at the helm of the European Union's powerful executive body with 401 votes in her favour and 284 against in a secret ballot in the 720-member chamber.</p>

<p>In an address to the Parliament in Strasbourg earlier in the day, von der Leyen laid out a programme focused on prosperity and security, shaped by the challenges of Russia's war in Ukraine, global economic competition and climate change.</p>

<p>"The next five years will define Europe's place in the world for the next five decades. It will decide whether we shape our own future or let it be shaped by events or by others," von der Leyen said ahead of a secret ballot on her candidacy.</p>

<p>She stressed the need not to backtrack on the "Green Deal" transformation of the EU economy to fight climate change - a key pledge for Green lawmakers, who joined centre-right, centre-left and liberal groups in backing her for the post.</p>

<p>After pledging to support Ukraine for as long as it takes in its fight against Russia, von der Leyen said Europe's liberty was at stake and it must invest more in defence.</p>

<p>Von der Leyen, a centre-right former German defence minister, pledged to create "a true European Defence Union", with flagship projects on air and cyber defence.</p>

<p>The plan sparked criticism from the Kremlin, which said it</p>

<p>reflected an attitude of "militarisation (and) confrontation".</p>

<p>Von der Leyen blasted Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's recent visit to Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow as an "appeasement mission", winning broad applause from lawmakers.</p>

<p>Defence policy in Europe has traditionally been the domain of national governments and NATO.</p>

<p>But following Russia's attack on Ukraine and amid uncertainty over how much Europe will be able to rely on the United States for its protection should Donald Trump win the U.S. presidential election in November, the European Commission is seeking to push more joint European defence projects.</p>

<p>Von der Leyen also promised a raft of climate policies including a legally-binding EU target to cut emissions by 90% by 2040, compared to 1990 levels.</p>

<p>She also pledged new measures to help European industries stay competitive while they invest in curbing emissions.</p>

<p><strong>Green Support</strong></p>

<p>The Greens' decision to join the informal alliance of parties that supports von der Leyen ensured her margin of victory was fairly comfortable. She needed 361 votes to secure a majority in the chamber.</p>

<p>Her own coalition of the centre-right, centre-left and liberals has 401 seats, but some of its members were expected to vote against her in the secret vote.</p>

<p>She might also promise tighter EU border controls and stronger police cooperation against crime.</p>

<p>Von der Leyen's re-election provides continuity in the European Union's key institution at a time of external and internal challenges - including mounting support for far-right and eurosceptic political parties in the 27-nation bloc.</p>

<p>In the coming weeks, she will propose her team of commissioners, who will face individual hearings from lawmakers before a final vote on the whole Commission later in the year.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain let down its citizens by leaving the nation ill-prepared for the COVID-19 pandemic because of significantly flawed planning and failures by ministers and scientific experts, a public inquiry concluded in a scathing report on Thursday.</p>

<p>Britain recorded one of the world's highest number of fatalities from COVID with more than 230,000 deaths reported by December 2023, while the nation's finances are still suffering from the economic consequences.</p>

<p>Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered an inquiry in May 2021, and its first report, which examined the nation's preparedness for an outbreak, was damning.</p>

<p>"Had the UK been better prepared for and more resilient to the pandemic, some of the financial and human cost may have been avoided," the report by the inquiry chair, former judge Heather Hallett, said in the report.</p>

<p>"The inquiry has no hesitation in concluding that the processes, planning, and policy of the civil contingency structures within the UK government and devolved administrations and civil service failed their citizens."</p>

<p>The inquiry found there had been a "lack of adequate leadership" with "groupthink" clouding expert advice. Ministers had not been given a broad enough range of opinions and then had failed to sufficiently challenge what they did receive.</p>

<p>A flawed 2011 strategy, which had underpinned the nation's preparations for such an emergency, had prepared for only one type of pandemic - influenza.</p>

<p>It was outdated, had focused on dealing with the impact of an outbreak rather than trying to prevent its spread, and had not taken into account the economic and social impact, the report said. That strategy was virtually abandoned on its first encounter with COVID.</p>

<p>"The Secretaries of State for Health ... who adhered to the strategy, the experts and officials who advised them to do so, and the governments of the devolved nations that adopted it, all bear responsibility for failing to have these flaws examined and rectified," the report said.</p>

<p><strong>Radical Reform</strong></p>

<p>Hallett made 10 recommendations, saying preparation for a civil emergency should be treated the same way as a threat from a hostile state.</p>

<p>"There must be radical reform. Never again can a disease be allowed to lead to so many deaths and so much suffering," she said in her introduction to the report.</p>

<p>Her inquiry's first module has only examined Britain's preparedness, and later reports will provide assessments of the more politically charged issues of decision-making during the pandemic against a backdrop of widespread accusations of government incompetence.</p>

<p>Johnson himself was forced from office in July 2022, with revelations of parties during COVID lockdowns among the many scandals that ended his premiership. A parliamentary committee later concluded he had misled lawmakers over the parties.</p>

<p>Rishi Sunak, the finance minister during the pandemic who later became prime minister, was also fined for breaking lockdown rules at the time.</p>

<p>"We know that for lives to be saved in the future, lessons must be learnt from the mistakes of the past," Brenda Doherty said on behalf of the campaign group COVID-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK ahead of the report's release.</p>

<p>"Sadly, nobody knows the true cost of the government's failure to prepare as we do."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli archaeologists working in the Judean Desert found the earliest evidence of Biblical scarlet dye, the Israel Antiquities Authority announced on Thursday.</p>

<p>The rare textile, 3,800-years-old and less than two cm in size, was uncovered in the "Cave of Skulls" northeast of Jerusalem during excavations aimed at preserving heritage finds and preventing antiquities theft. The woolen weft threads were dyed red, while the linen warp threads remained uncolored.</p>

<p>Carbon-14 analysis dated the textile to the Middle Bronze Age (1767-1954 BCE).</p>

<p>According to a new joint study of the Israel Antiquities Authority, Bar-Ilan University and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, the textile's scarlet color was produced from the oak scale insects, which the researchers identify with the Biblical scarlet worm Tola'at Hashani.</p>

<p>The scarlet-red color, mentioned in the Bible alongside royal blue tekheilet and purple argaman, is considered one of the ancient world's most precious and expensive dyes, which were used -- according to the biblical commandment -- to dye the fabrics of the Tabernacle and the priestly garments.</p>

<p>Using advanced analytical methods, including High-Performance Liquid Chromatography to identify the dye's origin, the researchers concluded that the red hue came from the Kermes vermilio species, known for producing kermesic acid, which imparts the distinctive red color.</p>

<p>The findings were recently published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports.</p>

<p>"In ancient times, the dye was produced from the female scale insect, which lives on the kermes oak tree (Quercus coccifera)," explained Dr. Na'ama Sukenik, Curator of the Organic Material Collection at the Israel Antiquities Authority.</p>

<p>"Collecting these kermes was done in a very short window of time - one month out of the year, in the summer, after the female laid her eggs but before they hatched-- when the amount of dye was greatest. The short period in which the kermes could be collected, the difficulty in finding them due to their small size, between 3-8 mm, and their camouflage colours -- that make it difficult to locate them," Sukenik added.</p>

<p>The amount of dye that could be produced from the eggs was limited, she explained, but "the beautiful scarlet hue that can be produced from them for dyeing textiles made their use highly prestigious."</p>

<p>The discovery also underscores the interconnectedness of ancient societies. Despite the presence of a native species of a scale insect in Israel capable of producing a red-orange colour, the researchers found that the textile's dye came from a species common in the central and eastern Mediterranean region, indicating extensive trade networks, the researchers said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new video with a graphical reticule shows US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's head in the middle of what would have been the sniper's crosshair.</p>

<p>The video shows Mr Trump's tilting his head to look at a screen graphic and leaning into the microphone saved his life, according to a post on X by US journalist Mario Nawfal, whose 'The Roundtable Show' is billed as the biggest example of citizen journalism.</p>

<p>"New footage shows Trump dodging a perfectly aimed shot. Close-up footage reveals Thomas Crook's shot was perfectly centred on Trump's head... The footage was captured just seconds before the shot," Mr Nawfal said in the post.</p>

<p>The US Department of Homeland Security is investigating the Secret Service's handling of security at the campaign rally where the gunman tried to assassinate Mr Trump.</p>

<p>The Secret Service has faced intense scrutiny since Saturday's shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania, during which a gunman opened fire on the Republican presidential candidate from an exposed rooftop some 150 metres away from the stage where Mr Trump was speaking.</p>

<p>Mr Trump was wounded in the ear and a rally attendee was killed. The 20-year-old gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks, was shot dead by Secret Service snipers.</p>

<p>President Joe Biden has ordered an independent review of the Secret Service's handling of the assassination attempt, which is also being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) as a case of potential domestic terrorism.</p>

<p>The Secret Service is responsible for the safety of the US president, vice president and former presidents, and their families, as well as major election candidates and visiting foreign heads of state.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Russian court on Thursday sentenced U.S. citizen Michael Travis Leake to 13 years in prison on drug smuggling charges, Moscow's court service said in a statement.</p>

<p>Leake, a musician and former U.S. paratrooper who was arrested in June 2023, was found guilty of selling drugs on a large scale, the court service said.</p>

<p>It was not clear how he pleaded and Reuters was not able to contact his lawyer.</p>

<p>Leake is one of about a dozen Americans currently held in Russian detention. Washington urges its citizens to leave Russia immediately, citing the threat of arrest and harassment amid the highest tensions between the two countries since the Cold War.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the U.S. embassy in Moscow did not immediately reply to a request for comment on his conviction.</p>

<p>Another American, Robert Romanov Woodland, was sentenced by a Russian court to 12-1/2 years for drug smuggling earlier this month.</p>

<p>Leake was convicted alongside another defendant, a woman. The pair were shown standing in a court cage in brief videos published by the court service. Leake listened to the proceedings with a grim expression, at one point shaking his head.</p>

<p>Leake, who is in his early 50's, is a former songwriter in the rock band "Lovi Noch" ("Catch the Night"). He also previously worked as an English teacher in Moscow and helped translate songs for Russian bands.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of 60 rare Siamese crocodiles have hatched in Cambodia, boosting hopes for one of the world's most endangered reptiles, conservationists said Thursday.</p>

<p>Five Siamese crocodile nests were discovered in Cambodia's Cardamom National Park in mid-May, the country's environment and agriculture ministry said in a joint statement with conservation group Fauna and Flora.</p>

<p>The nests contained 106 eggs, of which 66 were fertilised, and a total of 60 Siamese crocodile eggs successfully hatched between June 27 and 30, the ministry said.</p>

<p>"This discovery indicates that the area is a key habitat for natural crocodiles, providing hope for the species' recovery," they said in the statement.</p>

<p>Researchers say there are approximately 1,000 Siamese crocodiles worldwide, including around 300 individuals in the wild in Cambodia.</p>

<p>Their survival is threatened by poachers who supply eggs and adult reptiles to crocodile farms around the region, where their skins are turned into luxury belts, shoes, and handbags.</p>

<p>Cambodian environment minister Eang Sophalleth said it was a source of "pride" that the country is home to some of the world's rarest species, pledging continued efforts to "preserve biodiversity."</p>

<p>Deforestation and poaching have devastated many species in Cambodia, one of Asia's poorest and most corrupt nations.</p>

<p>In its haste to develop, the government has been criticised for allowing firms to clear hundreds of thousands of hectares of forest land -- including in protected zones -- for everything from rubber and sugar cane plantations to hydropower dams.</p>

<p>The successful mass hatching shows the vital importance" of protecting the Cardamom National Park, said Pablo Sinovas, country director of the Fauna &amp; Flora Cambodia programme.</p>

<p>"With only a few hundred individuals estimated in the wild, the hatching of 60 new crocodiles is a tremendous boost," Sinovas added.</p>

<p>Siamese crocodiles grow up to three metres in length and the Mekong River basin and wetlands in Cambodia appear to hold the only remaining wild populations, according to conservation group WWF.</p>

<p>They are listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>United States President Joe Biden has made numerous verbal stumbles and gaffes over the years. From verbal slip-ups to near-fall incidents, Mr Biden, whose age is often targeted by opposition leaders and remains a concern for voters, has had all. With US elections just around the corner, questions about the US President's fitness to serve four more years - or win November's election - continue to swirl. Amid this, a video of Mr Biden appearing to have difficulty getting into his vehicle after exiting Air Force One on Wednesday is <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://x.com/JordanUhl/status/1813784758201332150">going viral on social media</a>.</p>

<p>The incident occurred after Mr Biden said that he would be "isolating as I recover" after testing positive for coronavirus. He previously cancelled a scheduled appearance at the UnidosUS Annual Conference in Las Vegas. The President also gave the media the thumbs up from his limousine and said "I feel good" following the diagnosis.</p>

<p>The <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/07/17/statement-from-press-secretary-karine-jean-pierre-3/">White House</a> said he was suffering from a runny nose, cough and "general malaise," was taking Covid medication, and was flying straight to isolation at his beach house in Rehoboth, Delaware. "He is vaccinated and boosted and he is experiencing mild symptoms. He will be returning to Delaware where he will self-isolate and will continue to carry out all of his duties fully during that time," spokesperson Jean-Pierre said.</p>

<p>Further, his doctor also stated that he was suffering from a runny nose and a "non-productive cough" along with "general malaise. "His symptoms remain mild, his respiratory rate is normal at 16, his temperature is normal at 97.8 and his pulse oximetry is normal at 97 per cent," the White House note added.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the 81-year-old said that he would consider dropping his troubled re-election bid if he was diagnosed with a serious medical condition. He told the media outlet BET, "If I had some medical condition that emerged, if somebody, if the doctors came and said 'you've got this problem, that problem'."<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thomas Matthew Crooks had posted a chilling online message foreshadowing his plans before attacking former President Donald Trump at his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>"July 13 will be my premiere, watch as it unfolds,"&nbsp;the 20-year-old would-be assassin, allegedly wrote on Steam, a popular online platform for gamers, reported <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/trump-rally-shooting-fbi-investigation-attempted-assassination-july-17# ">Fox News</a>.</p>

<p>Crooks reportedly also had images of both Donald Trump and President Biden on his phone and had searched the dates for the Democratic National Convention and Trump's Pennsylvania rally, The<a href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/18/us-news/trumps-would-be-assassin-thomas-crooks-wrote-chilling-online-post-foreshadowing-rally-shooting-report/ "> NYPost </a>reported.</p>

<p>Investigators are analysing the shooter's phones and computer to determine the motive behind the assassination attempt. While they have explored the gunman's search history, they have not yet determined his political affiliation, despite his registration as a Republican.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The shooter reportedly had two cell phones, one found near his body and another at his home with only 27 contacts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Law enforcement sources report that snipers spotted Crooks on a roof with a rifle at 5:52 pm, but he didn't start firing until 6:12 pm. This means a 20-minute delay occurred between the time Crooks was first seen and the start of the shooting.</p>

<p>After Crooks fired at Donald Trump, the Secret Service shot him dead within 26 seconds. The former president survived with just a minor injury to his ear.</p>

<p>The gunshots, fired by an AR-style rifle, killed a 50-year-old father of two girls and injured two others.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sources told the NYPost that&nbsp;Crooks was identified as a person of interest a full hour before the shooting occurred. He had driven to&nbsp;Trump's rally on Saturday with a bunch of suspicious items in his car – a remote control transmitter, a detonator and an improvised metal explosive device connected to a receiver in his trunk – which suggested that he may have planned to cause a distraction or a diversion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the days leading up to the attack, Crooks visited a <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/trump-shooter-went-to-shooting-range-day-before-assassination-attempt-report-6126076 ">shooting</a> range, and also stopped at Home Depot and a gun store, where he purchased 50 rounds of ammunition and a 5-foot ladder.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The bill, called Content Origin Protection and Integrity from Edited and Deepfaked Media Act (COPIED ACT), has strong support across the US political spectrum.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States has introduced a bill aimed at tackling AI deepfakes and protecting original content from being used for AI training last week.</p>

<p>The bill, called Content Origin Protection and Integrity from Edited and Deepfaked Media Act (COPIED ACT), has strong support across the US political spectrum.</p>

<p>Last Month, another senate bill dubbed "Take It Down Act '' was tabled, advocating the removal of AI deepfakes specific to non-consensual intimate imagery.</p>

<p>Notably, several controversies including Taylor Swift's AI generated deepfake nude images went viral on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, and Instagram in January, sparking a nationwide debate on the ills of AI technology.</p>

<p>Apart from addressing deepfakes, COPIED Act will also address the concerns of content creators, journalists, artists and musicians that AI has been profiting off of their work, without acknowledgement or paying deserved compensation.</p>

<p>Last month, a report from Forbes accused Perplexity AI - an AI enabled search engine- of stealing its content. This was followed by an investigation by a New York based technology magazine called Wired that found Perplexity was summarising its articles despite the Robot Exclusion Protocol being in place, trespassing into areas of their website designated as off-limits to search bots.</p>

<h3><strong>How will the COPIED Act work?</strong></h3>

<p>The COPIED act will enable a mechanism whereby provisions will be made for a digital document called "content provenance information" that is akin to a logbook for all content- news articles, artistic expressions, images or videos- which will ensure authentication and detection of all AI generated content.</p>

<p>It also seeks provisions for making it illegal to tamper with this information, helping journalists and creative artists to safeguard their work from AI. Additionally, the bill would empower state officials to enforce the bill, creating an avenue to sue AI companies for removing the watermark or using the content without consent and compensation.</p>

<h3><strong>How are other countries regulating AI?</strong></h3>

<p>The European Union (EU) has one of the most comprehensive legislations in place for regulating AI. In contrast to the US approach, the EU Artificial Intelligence Act requires European states to take a proactive role and classify each AI system into four categories based on risk levels- Unacceptable Risk, High-Risk AI, Limited-Risk AI, and Minimal-Risk AI.</p>

<p>AI systems like those used in China for ascribing a social score to each citizen have been identified to be unacceptable risk levels and prohibited under the act.</p>

<p>In India, although a specific AI regulatory law has not been made yet, a Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology directive in March had mandated AI systems labelled as "under-tested" or "unreliable" to seek government approval before deploying. The directive was later overridden by another one, reversing the mandate, in a move that signalled caution to not affect innovation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Arrested in Moldova, Chkhikvishvili recruited others for violent acts and disseminated a manifesto promoting terrorism and ethnic cleansing.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Michail Chkhikvishvili, a neo-Nazi leader from Georgia, was indicted this week on charges of soliciting hate crimes and planning acts of mass violence in New York City. He intended to carry out a New Year's Eve attack involving Santa Claus distributing poisoned candy to racial minorities and Jewish children in Brooklyn.</p>

<p>As per a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/georgian-national-charged-soliciting-hate-crimes-and-mass-casualty-attack-new-york">US government release</a>, Chkhikvishvili was arrested in Chisinau, Moldova, on July 6, 2024, pursuant to an Interpol Wanted Person Diffusion, which was issued based on a criminal complaint. Chkhikvishvili is alleged to be a leader of the Maniac Murder Cult, also known as "Maniacs Murder Cult," "Maniacs: Cult of Killing," "MKY," "MMC," and "MKU," an international racially or ethnically motivated violent extremist group.</p>

<p>Chkhikvishvili allegedly recruited others for violent acts, including planning a mass attack in NYC with an undercover officer posing as a recruit. US Attorney Breon Peace, Assistant AG Matthew Olsen, and FBI's Christie Curtis announced the charges.</p>

<p>"As alleged, the defendant sought to recruit others to commit violent attacks and killings in furtherance of his Neo-Nazi ideologies," stated United States Attorney Peace. "His goal was to spread hatred, fear, and destruction by encouraging bombings, arson, and even poisoning children for the purpose of harming racial minorities, the Jewish community, and homeless individuals. We will not hesitate to find and prosecute those who threaten the safety and freedoms of all members of our community, including members of minority communities, no matter where in the world these criminals might be hiding."</p>

<p>The government report stated Chkhikvishvili led MKY, an international extremist group with a Neo-Nazi ideology promoting violence against minorities. MKY aims to disrupt social order through terrorism, with members in the United States and abroad.</p>

<p>Since September 2021, Chkhikvishvili has distributed the "Hater's Handbook" to MKY members, promoting MKY's principles and urging mass violence. The manifesto includes Chkhikvishvili's claims of killing for the white race and encourages school shootings, using children for suicide bombings, and other attacks against racial minorities. It outlines strategies for terror attacks, such as targeting large events and crowded streets, specifically in the United States.</p>]]></content:encoded>

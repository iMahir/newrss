<p>London is known for its open intellectual climate, where no idea is off-limits. But even in this dynamic city - and indeed in Washington too - it's almost blasphemous to suggest that Russia and the West can be partners, or that the US and China can coexist as global powers. Recently, Nigel Farage, the Reform Party leader in the UK, faced a storm for urging the West to negotiate sensibly with <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/topic/russia-ukraine-live-updates">Russia over Ukraine</a>, calling the war a 'complete stalemate'. People accused him of "echoing Russian propaganda".</p>

<p>In India, we often hear that we don't cultivate a society where all ideas are welcome. But let's hope that suggesting a new chapter of "<em>Hindi-Cheeni bhai-bhai</em>" (<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/great-positive-progress-made-on-resolving-border-row-with-india-china-5427103">India-China</a> brotherhood) isn't seen as blasphemy. The strong anti-China sentiment after the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/topic/india-china-clash-galwan-valley">Galwan Valley clash in 2020</a> seems to have subsided. We're buying more Chinese goods now than ever. In 2023, our bilateral trade hit over $136 billion. Hopefully, even those who burnt Chinese products in Gujarat and Delhi following the border skirmishes are more open to the idea now.</p>

<p><span>Sure, it might sound crazy to suggest that India and China should become trusted partners like the US and India, or Russia and China. But, it's not entirely out of the question.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Major Geopolitical Shifts</strong></h2>

<p>India's rise to become a global power is unstoppable; even China knows that. Talking to Chinese academics and journalists, you get the sense that they're open to establishing long-term ties based on mutual respect. They like India, they want more people-to-people interactions, and one of them even wondered recently why India does not try to cast its spell over the dragon through its soft power of Bollywood &nbsp;</p>

<p>Both countries have the responsibility to lift millions of their combined 2.8 billion people out of poverty. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has pledged to make India a developed country by 2047, which is a huge task. There are challenges, but if India and China team up and leverage each other's strengths, it could be a major geopolitical shift, with far-reaching implications for global politics.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/opinion/modi-hasina-should-worry-about-china-but-not-too-much-5959266">Read | Modi-Hasina Should Worry About China, But Not Too Much</a></strong></p>

<p>The US and its allies might be shocked and deeply concerned by a close India-China partnership. The West has benefited from the rivalry between the two countries as it aligns with their strategy of counterbalancing China's rise. A partnership between these two Asian giants could undermine the West's strategic interests in the region. Kishore Mahbubani, former Singaporean ambassador to the UN, has often said that most of Asia would cheer if this were to happen.</p>

<p>So, can India and China find common ground despite tensions over their disputed border? Prof. Mahbubani believes that while the two may never be best friends, they can have a good working relationship. He even says the 21st century belongs to the CIA (China, India, and ASEAN) countries. With US power on the decline, these countries will drive the world's economic growth.</p>

<h2><strong>A Rollercoaster Ride</strong></h2>

<p>The idea of India and China being close friends isn't new. Historically, they've acted like quarrelsome neighbours who fight and make up repeatedly. They share a long history of cultural and economic exchange dating back over two millennia. The Silk Road facilitated trade, and Buddhism, which started in India, found a significant following in China. These ancient ties laid a foundation of mutual respect and cultural affinity. During the colonial era, both countries faced subjugation by Western powers, fostering a sense of shared struggle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After gaining independence from the British, India faced border issues with China, and they continue to strain their relationship. In the early 1950s, the relationship was marked by camaraderie, epitomised by the slogan "<em>Hindi-Chini Bhai-Bhai</em>". However, this period of cooperation was short-lived. The border dispute escalated into a full-scale war in 1962, leaving a lasting scar on bilateral relations. The disputed borders, particularly in the Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh regions, remain contentious issues.</p>

<span>The rivalry between the US and China will continue, and India will remain under US pressure in its effort to manage China. However, India's strategic positioning between the US and China can work to its advantage.</span></div>

<p>Before the Galwan incident, Prime Minister Narendra Modi naturally leaned towards engaging with China. As Gujarat's Chief Minister, he made four trips to the country to attract investment. As Prime Minister, he has visited China twice, and President Xi Jinping reciprocated with two visits to India. Both countries have emerged as major global economic powers, engaging in significant economic competition and areas of cooperation within multilateral frameworks like BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO).</p>

<h2><strong>Strategic Rivalry</strong></h2>

<p>Strategically, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/blog/blog-india-china-ties-through-the-eyes-of-a-student-4381793">India and China view each other with suspicion</a>. The latter's close ties with Pakistan, its infrastructure projects in South Asia under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and its military presence in the Indian Ocean have heightened India's security concerns.</p>

<p>Conversely, India's growing partnership with the US and its participation in the Quad (Quadrilateral Security Dialogue) is viewed warily by China. The 2020 Galwan Valley clash exacerbated tensions and highlighted the fragility of the relationship. Despite several rounds of military and diplomatic talks, a comprehensive resolution to the border disputes remains elusive.</p>

<h2><strong>Mumbai's Shanghai Dreams</strong></h2>

<p>Many youth in India might not know that not too long ago, India used to compare itself with Pakistan in all spheres. This attitude changed around the turn of the millennium, when the Maharashtra government launched a mega project to revamp Mumbai in 2004, based on the "Vision Mumbai" report by Bombay First, an organisation comprising some of Mumbai's super-rich stakeholders. The report outlined strategies for transforming Mumbai into "another Shanghai". While the project to transform Mumbai is still a "work in progress", it marked the beginning of India's comparisons with China. Today, China sees India as its great rival, at least in Asia.</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/opinion/china-is-revamping-its-military-and-india-must-not-take-it-lightly-5571658">Read | China Is Revamping Its Military, And India Must Not Take It Lightly</a></strong></p>

<p>Projections show that the Indian economy will surpass Germany and Japan's to become the world's third-largest one by 2027. Currently, however, India's economy is only 19% the size of China's, even though it feeds nearly the same number of people. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), India's nominal GDP in 2023 stood at $3.5 trillion, compared to China's $18.2 trillion. India's per capita income was $2,411, while China's was $12,720. China's exports last year exceeded $3.38 trillion, while India's exports were $778 billion.</p>

<h2><strong>Collaboration Possibilities</strong></h2>

<p>Since China opened its economy in 1978, it has lifted 800 million people out of poverty - a feat that hasn't been matched by any regime in history. India has also succeeded in reducing poverty significantly. Both nations have many more millions to help. Collaborating in economic development, technology, infrastructure, environmental initiatives, healthcare, cultural exchange, and geopolitical stability can benefit both countries and the world. Overcoming historical tensions and building trust through consistent dialogue will be crucial.</p>

<p>The intense rivalry between the US and China will continue, and India will remain under pressure from the US to stay a reliable partner in its effort to manage China. However, India's strategic positioning between the US and China can work to its advantage. Ultimately, New Delhi's strategic interests are best served by a balanced approach that navigates the complex dynamics of US-China relations while advancing its own national objectives.&nbsp;</p>

<p>India knows that neighbours with shared borders may fight at times, but they can still continue to believe in the 'love thy neighbour' dictum.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Tyrese Haspil's scheme to steal from his former boss, Fahim Saleh, began in 2018, but it wasn't until July 2020 that his plan turned deadly.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tyrese Haspil, a former assistant of tech mogul Fahim Saleh, has been convicted of murdering his former boss in his Manhattan apartment back in 2020.&nbsp;Prosecutors said that Tyrese Haspil killed his former boss to cover up his theft of $400,000 from the 33-year-old businessman.</p>

<p>Mr Saleh was a successful tech entrepreneur and the CEO of Gokada, a Nigeria-based scooter startup.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The 25-year-old was found <a href="https://manhattanda.org/d-a-bragg-announces-all-count-trial-conviction-of-tyrese-haspil-in-murder-of-tech-ceo-fahim-saleh/ ">guilty of multiple charges</a>, including murder in the first degree, grand larceny, burglary, tampering with physical evidence and concealment of a human corpse. He faces up to 25 years to life in prison and will be sentenced on September 10.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said, “Tyrese Haspil tragically cut Mr Saleh's life short – a man who came from a close-knit immigrant family and followed his passions to become a successful entrepreneur. I hope the accountability delivered by today's verdict can provide a measure of comfort to Mr Saleh's loved ones as they continue to mourn his loss.”<br />
<br />
Mr Saleh was found murdered in his $2.4 million 7th-floor high-rise condo on East Houston Street, reported the <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/24/us-news/tech-ceo-fahim-salehs-ex-assistant-convicted-in-grisly-dismemberment-murder/ ">NY Post</a>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Planning the murder</strong><br />
<br />
Tyrese Haspil's scheme to steal from his former boss, Fahim Saleh, began in 2018, but it wasn't until July 2020 that his plan turned deadly.&nbsp;He embezzled money from Mr Saleh's companies to purchase lavish gifts for his girlfriend, The NYT reported.<br />
<br />
Haspil created a bogus corporate entity and bank account to funnel the stolen money. When Mr Saleh discovered the theft in January 2020, Haspil agreed to a repayment plan but continued to steal more money through a fraudulent PayPal account.<br />
<br />
Concerned that Mr Saleh would discover the more lucrative theft, Haspil began plotting to kill him.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Tyrese Haspil's online activity showed that he searched for "Fahim Saleh" and "murder of tech CEO in New York", as well as "dismembered body" and "anatomy of the human neck". He also looked up building plans and searched for contractor-grade trash bags, weapons and cleaning supplies, as per the NYT.<br />
<br />
Haspil also tracked Mr Saleh's whereabouts on social media and purchased clothes to conceal his identity.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Execution of the murder</strong><br />
<br />
On July 13, 2020, Tyrese Haspil entered an elevator with Mr Saleh in the latter's apartment building wearing a dark plastic face shield, a baseball cap and sunglasses. Mr Saleh, unaware of the impending danger, joked with Haspil about taking Covid precautions seriously. However, as soon as the elevator doors opened, Haspil's demeanour turned deadly.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
According to his testimony, Tyrese Haspil tased Fahim Saleh in the back, rendering him immobile, and then pulled out a knife. With a targeted strike, Haspil aimed for Mr Saleh's neck, delivering a fatal blow, reported the NYT.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He then left the apartment and returned the next day to dismember Mr Saleh's body with an electric saw. He stuffed the body parts in plastic bags, which were later found strewn across the apartment.<br />
<br />
However, before completing the task, he left again to purchase a battery charger, and it was during this time that Fahim Saleh's cousin discovered the scene when he went to check up on him.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Tyrese Haspil was arrested four days later at an Airbnb he booked for his girlfriend's birthday celebration.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
His public defenders argued that he murdered his ex-boss due to “extreme emotional disturbance” and “unconditional love” for his girlfriend. He feared she would leave him if she found out he had been embezzling money from his boss, as per <a href="http://https://nypost.com/2024/06/24/us-news/tech-ceo-fahim-salehs-ex-assistant-convicted-in-grisly-dismemberment-murder/">reports</a>.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A New Zealand judge on Wednesday sentenced a woman to 18 years imprisonment for murdering her three young daughters in 2021.</p>

<p>Lauren Dickason will begin her sentence at a mental health hospital in the custody of the state, a court official at Christchurch High Court told AFP, for the triple killings.</p>

<p>In a statement to local media after her sentencing, Dickason said she had "failed" her children and her husband, who has since moved back to South Africa.</p>

<p>"I take responsibility for taking our three beautiful girls from this world," she said.</p>

<p>"I would like to take this opportunity to convey the deepest and most sincere remorse for the extreme pain and hurt caused to my children and my family by my actions."</p>

<p>Justice Cameron Mander did not impose a minimum non-parole period in sentencing Dickason, who escaped life imprisonment which is the usual penalty for murder in New Zealand.</p>

<p>Dickason was found guilty last August on three counts of murder having smothered her two-year-old twins Maya and Karla and first daughter Liane, six.</p>

<p>The killings took place in September 2021 at their home in Timaru while her husband was out to dinner with colleagues. He found the bodies of his children when he returned home.</p>

<p>The family had moved to New Zealand from South Africa just weeks before.</p>

<p>During last year's trial, Dickason admitted killing the girls but had argued a defence of insanity and infanticide, triggered by the stress of the move.</p>

<p>Under New Zealand law, infanticide is a defence for a mother who causes the death of her child when, "at the time of the offence, the balance of her mind was disturbed".</p>

<p>Dickason's lawyer had argued that a mental health unit was the most appropriate place for her, according to local media reports.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Takeoffs and landings at South Korea's Incheon International Airport were disrupted on Wednesday for about three hours before dawn because of balloons launched by North Korea filled with refuse, an airport spokesperson said.</p>

<p>One balloon landed on the tarmac near passenger Terminal 2 and the three runways at Incheon were temporarily shut down, the spokesperson said.</p>

<p>North Korea has flown balloons carrying trash into South Korea since late May, with hundreds landing in South Korea.</p>

<p>Several balloons were spotted in and around the airport boundaries, the spokesperson said, adding that this was not the first time operations at the airport - which is about 40km from the North Korean border - had been disrupted by balloons nearby.</p>

<p>The disruption to domestic and international flights occurred between 1:46 a.m. and 4:44 a.m., and the runways have re-opened since then, Incheon International Airport Corporation said.</p>

<p>Flight volume at that time of day is usually low. FlightRadar24 showed shows eight arriving cargo and passenger flights were diverted to South Korea's Cheongju or Jeju airports during that time, and one China Cargo freighter from Shanghai was diverted to Yantai, China.</p>

<p>Several more landings were delayed, and departures were delayed by several hours.</p>

<p>North Korea has said the balloons are retaliation for a propaganda campaign by North Korean defectors and activists in the South who regularly send over balloons carrying food, medicine, money and leaflets criticising the North's leaders.</p>

<p>Among the items carried by the North Korean balloons have been articles printed with Hello Kitty characters, badly worn clothing, and soil containing traces of human faeces and parasites, South Korea has said.</p>

<p>South Korea's military on Wednesday said about 100 balloons had fallen to the ground between Tuesday and Wednesday, mostly in the capital, Seoul, and the surrounding Gyeonggi province. Most of carried just scraps of paper.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An 18-year-old woman in the United States has been arrested for calling 911 to avoid going on a date with a man she met on a dating app. According to <em>The Independent</em>, the woman, identified as Sumaya Thomas, was arrested after cops said she told a dispatcher that her abusive ex-boyfriend of two years was outside her home and sending her threatening text messages. She told the police that the man told her that he wanted to hit, kick, punch and stab her.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Thomas was arrested on June 16 on two false reporting charges, both of which were misdemeanour crimes, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/date-iowa-false-reporting-arrest-b2568044.html"><em>The Independent</em></a> reported. The 18-year-old even told the police that she was pregnant with her ex-boyfriend's baby. The majority of their conversations took place over Snapchat, she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, upon arriving at the scene, the cops spotted the man leaving the residence. He reportedly told the officers that he started speaking to the woman a week ago on a dating app. The two then moved their conversations off the platform and started to text. The man also showed the cops the text and dating app conversations, following which the officers confirmed that the messages were sent to the woman's phone number.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The man was detained for over an hour due to the false accusations. It was during a third interview that Ms Thomas admitted to making the false report because she got "cold feet on meeting him and no longer wanted to".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"She advised she didn't think officers would help so she made up this call and the events that she described," the police complaint stated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Thomas was arrested last week and later released from the Johnson County Jail in Iowa.&nbsp;<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was freed by a court on the US Pacific island territory of Saipan on Wednesday after pleading guilty to violating US espionage law, in a deal that will see him return home to Australia.</p>

<p>During the three-hour hearing, Assange pled guilty to one criminal count of conspiring to obtain and disclose classified U.S. national defence documents but said he had believed the Constitution's First Amendment, which protects free speech, shielded his activities.</p>

<p>"Working as a journalist I encouraged my source to provide information that was said to be classified in order to publish that information," he told the court.</p>

<p>"I believed the First Amendment protected that activity but I accept that it was ... a violation of the espionage statute."</p>

<p>Chief U.S. District Judge Ramona V. Manglona accepted his guilty plea and released him due to time already served in a British jail.</p>

<p>Assange, 52, has left Saipan on a private jet accompanied by Australia's ambassadors to the US and UK, according to flight logs. They will then travel to Canberra, landing just before 7 pm (0900 GMT).</p>

<p>Assange had agreed to plead guilty to a single criminal count, according to filings in the U.S. District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands.</p>

<p>The U.S. territory in the western Pacific was chosen due to his opposition to travelling to the mainland U.S. and for its proximity to Australia, prosecutors said.</p>

<p>Dozens of media from around the world attended the hearing, with more gathered outside the courtroom to cover the proceedings. Media were not allowed inside the courtroom to film the hearing.</p>

<p>"I watch this and think how overloaded his senses must be, walking through the press scrum after years of sensory depravation and the four walls of his high-security Belmarsh prison cell," Stella Assange, the wife of WikiLeaks founder said on social media platform X.</p>

<h3><strong>LONG SAGA</strong></h3>

<p>Australian-born Assange spent more than five years in a British high-security jail and seven holed up in the Ecuadorean embassy in London as he fought accusations of sex crimes in Sweden and battled extradition to the U.S., where he faced 18 criminal charges.</p>

<p>Assange's supporters view him as a victim because he exposed U.S. wrongdoing and potential crimes, including in conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. Washington has said the release of the secret documents put lives in danger.</p>

<p>The Australian government has been advocating for his release and has raised the issue with the United States several times.</p>

<p>"This isn't something that has happened in the last 24 hours," Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told a news conference on Wednesday.</p>

<p>"This is something that has been considered, patient, worked through in a calibrated way, which is how Australia conducts ourselves."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A controversial spiritual leader known as ''Buddha Boy''&nbsp;was convicted by a court in Nepal on charges of sexually assaulting a minor. The leader whose real name is Ram Bahadur Bomjan was <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/nepal-spiritual-leader-ram-bahadur-bomjan-buddha-boy-arrested-over-alleged-rape-of-a-minor-4836676">arrested in January </a>for the sexual assault of a minor as well as suspicion of involvement in the disappearance of at least four of his devotees.</p>

<p>A judge at the Sarlahi District Court found him guilty of sexually assaulting an underage girl and said sentencing would be on July 1. He could face at least 12 years in jail but can still appeal against his conviction.</p>

<p><a id="more-section-display-name"></a></p>

<aside>
<p>The 33-year-old guru, whom his followers believe to be the reincarnation of Gautam Buddha, became famous as a teenager after followers said he could meditate motionless for months without water, food, or sleep. However, some reporters filmed him eating, and he was also spotted sleeping when his followers said he was meditating in private.</p>
</aside>

<p>Accusations of abuse and misconduct against Bomjan stretch back more than a decade. Dozens of assault complaints were filed against him in 2010. At the time he said he had beaten followers because they had disturbed his meditation.</p>

<p>On the run for years, the 33-year-old was arrested by officials from Nepal's Central Investigation Bureau this January on the outskirts of Kathmandu in January this year. During the arrest, police also seized Nepalese banknotes worth $227,000 and other foreign currencies amounting to $23,000.</p>

<p>Before he went on the run, Bomjan still commanded a legion of followers as the allegations against him mounted. At one point tens of thousands of people had gathered to witness his reputed miracles of meditation deep in the jungle.</p>

<p>While aged 16, Bomjan disappeared for nine months to wander the wilderness of eastern Nepal, prompting a round-the-clock vigil by Buddhist monks who prayed for his safe return.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australia's prime minister hailed WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange's US plea deal hearing Wednesday as a "welcome development".</p>

<p>Assange, 52, pleaded guilty to a single count of conspiracy to obtain and disseminate US national defence information at a court in the US Pacific territory of the Northern Mariana Islands.</p>

<p>The plea is part of an agreement that is expected to free Assange to return to his native Australia within hours.</p>

<p>"This is a welcome development, but we recognise as well that these proceedings are sensitive and should be respected," Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters in Canberra.</p>

<p>"Given those proceedings that are happening literally in real-time, it isn't appropriate to provide further commentary," Albanese said.</p>

<p>Australia had used "all appropriate channels" to support a "positive outcome" in the case, he said, noting that Australia's ambassador to the United States, Kevin Rudd, was accompanying Assange.</p>

<p>"Regardless of your views about Mr Assange, his case has dragged on for too long. There is nothing to be gained from his continued incarceration and we want him brought home to Australia," the Australian leader said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The biggest auction of Diana memorabilia since the late British princess sold dozens of outfits months before her death gets underway in California this week, featuring a midnight blue tulle dress and a flamenco-style lace-up number.</p>

<p>Nearly fifty pieces, including gowns, shoes, handbags and hats, will go under the hammer in Beverly Hills.</p>

<p>"Princess Diana's Elegance &amp; A Royal Collection," brings together some of the style maven's favourite designers, including Victor Edelstein, Murray Arbeid and Catherine Walker.</p>

<p>Highlights include Arbeid's blue diamante ball gown, which the princess wore in 1986 to the London premiere of Andrew Lloyd Webber's "The Phantom of the Opera," and a magenta lace dress by Edelstein.</p>

<p>Both pieces are expected to fetch up to $400,000, according to Julien's Auctions, which is running the sale.</p>

<p>"We are here celebrating Princess Diana's elegance," said Gabriela Schwartz, of the auction house.</p>

<p>"We have some really standout pieces... that Diana wore with a lot of pride and (which are) really emblematic of her style."</p>

<p>Diana married Britain's now-King Charles in 1981 in an opulent ceremony watched by tens of millions around the globe.</p>

<p>The fairy tale soured over the following years and their tempestuous relationship became fodder for newspapers and gossip magazines, feeding a growing celebrity culture that exploded in the 1990s.</p>

<p>The couple had two children -- Princes William and Harry -- but divorced in 1996 in a tabloid frenzy and amid mutual infidelities.</p>

<p>Diana died in a car crash in Paris the following year as she and her lover tried to outrun paparazzi.</p>

<p>More than a quarter of a century on, the woman dubbed "The People's Princess" remains unmatched as a celebrity and style icon, whose allure continues to fascinate millions.</p>

<p>A dress worn by the princess that was auctioned last year fetched a staggering $1.14 million.</p>

<p>The collection, which has toured the globe for months, is expected to generate huge interest by the time bidding closes on Thursday.</p>

<p>As well as items of high couture, the sale will also include shoes by Salvatore Ferragamo, Kurt Geiger and Rayne, as well as letters in Diana's own handwriting, along with a number of other items connected to the British royal family.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel will "soon" roll out a plan to replace Hamas governance in northern Gaza, Israeli National Security Advisor Tzachi Hanegbi said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Speaking at Reichman University's annual Herzliya Conference, Hanegbi said that the collapse of Hamas's military ability to rule will open opportunities "for countries that want to see a governing alternative to Hamas in Gaza, with local leadership in Gaza, to join this process."</p>

<p>He explained that Gaza's new leadership will include Israel's Abraham Accords partners, the United States, the European Union and the United Nations, while the Israeli military continues "cleansing the area" of Hamas's presence.</p>

<p>"We've been talking about this notion of 'the day after' for many months and the main thing that we've tried to emphasize throughout is that it's mainly the day after Hamas in the sense that we don't need to wait for it to disappear, because that process could take a long time."</p>

<p>"The idea is, and this is what the Americans agree on, including in the conversations this week and also in the conversation that the minister of defense [Yoav Gallant] is conducting right now [in Washington], is that there will be a so-called top-down leadership, and not only bottom-up," he continued.</p>

<p>Said Hanegbi, "You cannot completely get Hamas to disappear because it's an idea, a concept."</p>

<p>The US has pressed Israeli officials to clarify a vision for Gaza's governance after the war. The Biden administration opposes Israel occupying Gaza or allowing the Strip to descend into chaos. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stressed that Israel's three war aims are the destruction of Hamas's military and governing capabilities, the return of all hostages, and ensuring that Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel.</p>

<p>In an interview with the US-based Punchbowl News on Friday, Netanyahu said a demilitarized post-war Gaza will be overseen by a civilian-run administration with the assistance of Arab countries. He also referred to a "deradicalization process."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant at the Pentagon on Tuesday, warning that a conflict between Israel and Hezbollah could spark a regional war and urging a diplomatic solution.</p>

<p>More than eight months of war in Gaza has heightened tensions across the region, with Israeli forces and Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah exchanging fire on a near-daily basis.</p>

<p>"Another war between Israel and Hezbollah could easily become a regional war, with terrible consequences for the Middle East," Austin said. "Diplomacy is by far the best way to prevent more escalation."</p>

<p>Gallant, speaking at the opening of the meeting with Austin, said "we are working closely together to achieve an agreement but we must also discuss readiness on every possible scenario.</p>

<p>The Israeli army said last week that plans for an offensive in Lebanon were "approved and validated" amid escalating cross-border clashes, but Washington is seeking to lower the temperature and head off another major conflict in the Middle East.</p>

<p>Gallant is on a visit to Washington seeking to reaffirm the value of ties with Israel's top ally after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly chastised the United States for what he said was a delay in weapons deliveries.</p>

<p>The US government insists that only one shipment of bombs has been held up over concerns about their use in populated areas and that other arms deliveries are proceeding as usual.</p>

<p>The United States is Israel's main supplier of weapons but the growing death count from the Gaza conflict has piled pressure on President Joe Biden to take action and fueled tensions between his administration and Netanyahu.</p>

<p>Gallant met with Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Washington the previous day, with the top US diplomat calling on Israel to avoid escalation in Lebanon.</p>

<p>The Israeli minister also held talks with CIA chief Bill Burns, the key US point man in negotiations to free hostages from Hamas, which launched an unprecedented attack on Israel in October that sparked a devastating conflict in Gaza.</p>

<p>Netanyahu has said Israeli forces are winding up the most intense part of the Gaza war and will redeploy to the northern border, although he has cast the move as defensive.</p>

<p>Israel and Hezbollah last fought a full-scale war in 2006 when a cross-border Hezbollah attack sparked 34 days of fighting that took a heavy toll on Lebanon, especially the country's south.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>several years of fast-rising consumer prices, though inflation has slowed considerably in recent months and the jobless rate has been below 4% for more than two years.</p>

<p>The Republican had a more significant edge - 44% to 31% - on immigration. Immigrants made up 13.9% of the country in 2022, the highest share in over a century. Trump has taken aim at immigrants in the country illegally. Trump was favored 40% to 35% on foreign conflicts and terrorism.</p>

<p>But Biden had the edge over Trump on responding to political extremism and threats to democracy, respondents' No. 2 concern, with registered voters picking the Democrat over Trump by 39% to 33%.</p>

<p>Trump, who was convicted last month on criminal charges he falsified business records, is awaiting three more criminal trials, two of which are tied to his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to Biden. Trump, who falsely claims his 2020 election defeat resulted from fraud, included the claim in a fiery speech shortly before hundreds of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.</p>

<p>Biden also had an edge over Trump on healthcare policy - 40% to 29%. Biden was vice president in 2010 when then-President Barack Obama pushed a landmark health reform through Congress that dramatically increased access to health insurance.</p>

<p>Previous Reuters/Ipsos polls have shown Biden and Trump neck-and-neck in the presidential race, though a number of polls in battleground states have shown Trump ahead in recent months.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[A plea bargain hearing for Julian Assange began at a US court in Saipan on Wednesday, AFP reporters said, in a final legal step expected to leave the WikiLeaks founder a free man.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange pleaded guilty in a US court in Saipan on Wednesday, AFP reporters said, in a plea bargain that will leave him a free man after years of legal drama.</p>

<p>The 52-year-old admitted to a single count of conspiracy to obtain and disseminate national defence information in the courtroom in the Northern Mariana Islands, a Pacific US territory.</p>

<p>"Guilty to the information," Assange said, later joking to the judge during the proceedings that whether he is satisfied "depends on the outcome of the hearing".</p>

<p>Assange has long been wanted by Washington for releasing hundreds of thousands of secret US documents from 2010 as head of the whistleblowing website WikiLeaks.</p>

<p>He was released Monday from a high-security British prison where he had been held for five years while he fought extradition to the United States.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, he is expected to be sentenced to five years and two months in prison, with credit for the same amount of time he spent behind bars in Britain.</p>

<p>Assange's wife Stella said he would be a "free man", thanking supporters who have campaigned for his release.</p>

<p>"We weren't really sure until the last 24 hours that it was actually happening," she told BBC radio, saying she was "just elated".</p>

<p>The Northern Mariana Islands was chosen because of Assange's unwillingness to go to the continental United States and because of its proximity to Australia, a court filing said.</p>

<p>After the hearing is done, Assange will fly to Canberra in Australia, WikiLeaks said on social media platform X, adding that the plea bargain "should never have had to happen."</p>

<p>The Australian government said his case had "dragged on for too long" and there was "nothing to be gained by his continued incarceration".</p>

<p><strong>- End of an ordeal -</strong></p>

<p>Since 2010 Assange has become a hero to free speech campaigners and a villain to those who thought he had endangered US security and intelligence sources.</p>

<p>US authorities wanted to put Assange on trial for divulging military secrets about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>

<p>He was indicted by a US federal grand jury in 2019 on 18 counts stemming from WikiLeaks' publication of a trove of national security documents.</p>

<p>The United Nations hailed Assange's release, saying the case had raised "a series of human rights concerns".</p>

<p>Assange's mother Christine Assange said in a statement carried by Australian media that she was "grateful that my son's ordeal is finally coming to an end."</p>

<p>But former US vice president Mike Pence slammed the plea deal on X as a "miscarriage of justice" that "dishonors the service and sacrifice of the men and women of our Armed Forces."</p>

<p>The announcement of the deal came two weeks before Assange was scheduled to appear in court in Britain to appeal against a ruling that approved his extradition to the United States.</p>

<p><strong>- Extradition battle -</strong></p>

<p>Assange had been detained in the high-security Belmarsh prison in London since April 2019.</p>

<p>He was arrested after spending seven years in Ecuador's London embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he faced accusations of sexual assault that were eventually dropped.</p>

<p>The material he released through WikiLeaks included video showing civilians being killed by fire from a US helicopter gunship in Iraq in 2007. The victims included a photographer and a driver from Reuters.</p>

<p>The United States accused Assange under the 1917 Espionage Act and supporters warned he risked being sentenced to 175 years in prison.</p>

<p>The British government approved his extradition in June 2022 but, in a recent twist, two British judges said in May that he could appeal against the transfer.</p>

<p>The plea deal was not entirely unexpected. US President Joe Biden had been under growing pressure to drop the long-running case against Assange.</p>

<p>The Australian government made an official request to that effect in February and Biden said he would consider it, raising hopes among Assange supporters that his ordeal might end.</p>

<p>In the first official US reax to the plea deal, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said that as the case is about to go before a judge, "I think it's appropriate for me to not comment on the matter at this time."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ukraine and Russia have exchanged 90 prisoners of war each in the biggest swap between the two warring sides in almost five months, officials said Tuesday.</p>

<p>Moscow and Kyiv have carried out over 50 prisoner exchanges since Russia invaded Ukraine more than two years ago, despite ongoing hostilities and both sides accusing each other of derailing talks.</p>

<p>The United Arab Emirates mediated the deal announced on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"Today, 90 more of our people have returned home from Russian captivity," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on social media.</p>

<p>"We remember all our people in Russian captivity. We continue to work for the release of each and every one of them," he said.</p>

<p>Russia said that 90 of its servicemen "who were in mortal danger in captivity have been returned from territory controlled by the Kyiv regime."</p>

<p>The freed servicemen will be airlifted to Moscow "for treatment and rehabilitation," its defence ministry said, confirming it had released 90 Ukrainian soldiers in return</p>

<p>The last swap between the two warring sides was at the end of May, when they exchanged 75 prisoners each, also with the UAE's mediation.</p>

<p>In February, both sides said they swapped 100 prisoners each, their first exchange since Moscow accused Kyiv of downing a plane carrying captured Ukrainian soldiers.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[A New York judge partially lifted a gag order imposed on former President Donald Trump in his hush money criminal case on Tuesday, The Hill reported.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A judge eased a gag order on Tuesday that was imposed on Donald Trump during his criminal trial which saw him convicted of 34 counts, according to a court filing.</p>

<p>Judge Juan Merchan imposed the limited gag order ahead of the trial, restricting Trump from commenting publicly on jurors, witnesses, prosecutors and court staff, later expanding it to include his own family and that of the prosecutor.</p>

<p>Merchan, who will sentence the presidential hopeful on July 11, said that "circumstances have now changed. The trial portion of these proceedings ended when the verdict was rendered, and the jury discharged."</p>

<p>The order means Trump, the first ever former US president to be convicted of a felony, can now comment publicly about witnesses who testified at his trial, as well as discuss the jury and their verdict.</p>

<p>But Merchan said that measures barring the disclosure of jurors' identities would remain in place.</p>

<p>Trump was fined $10,000 by the Manhattan court for breaking the order on 10 occasions -- and threatened with jail for openly flouting the judge's ruling.</p>

<p>Before the gag order was imposed ahead of Trump's trial, the ex-president repeatedly attacked likely witnesses and the prosecutors via posts on his Truth Social platform.</p>

<p>On May 30 jurors found Trump, who is seeking to retake the presidency in this year's election, guilty of falsifying business records to cover up a sex scandal in the final stages of the 2016 presidential campaign.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korea fired a ballistic missile toward the sea on Wednesday, the South Korean military said, according to the Yonhap news agency.</p>

<p>South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said it detected the launch but gave no details, saying an analysis is under way.</p>

<p>The office of Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida confirmed on X that North Korea launched a suspected ballistic missile.</p>

<p>"The suspected ballistic missile from North Korea is not expected to reach Japan," it said of the projectile filed toward the East Sea, also known as the Sea of Japan.</p>

<p>This launch came amid increased cross-border tension as the reclusive communist state has been sending balloons carrying garbage into South Korea.</p>

<p>North Korea's last missile launch prior to this one came on May 30, when Seoul accused Pyongyang of firing a volley of around 10 short-range ballistic missiles.</p>

<p>One day later North Korean state media released images of leader Kim Jong Un supervising tests of a multiple rocket launcher system.</p>

<p>Analysts have suggested the nuclear-armed North could be testing and ramping up production of artillery and cruise missiles before sending them to Russia for use in Ukraine.</p>

<p>In a report last month the Pentagon said it had confirmed this behaviour.</p>

<p>North Korea has sent more trash-filled balloons southward this week, Seoul's military said Tuesday, the latest in a series of border barrages that have sparked a tit-for-tat propaganda campaign.</p>

<p>Pyongyang has already sent more than a thousand balloons carrying trash in what it says is retaliation for balloons carrying propaganda criticising Kim's rule floated north by activists.</p>

<p>In response, Seoul has fully suspended a tension-reducing military deal and restarted some propaganda broadcasts from loudspeakers along the border.</p>

<p>Kim Jong Un's sister and key government spokeswoman Kim Yo Jong warned this month that Seoul would "undoubtedly witness the new counteraction of the DPRK" if the leaflet drops and loudspeaker broadcasts continued.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;A majority of the justices on Brazil's Supreme Court are in favor of decriminalizing the possession of marijuana for personal consumption, following a crucial vote on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"The position is clear that no user of any drug can be considered a criminal," said Justice Dias Toffoli, the sixth judge on the 11-member top court to vote for decriminalization.</p>

<p>So far, three justices have opposed a decision to no longer make possession of cannabis a crime, including its most recent member, Cristiano Zanin, who was appointed by leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.</p>

<p>The consumption of marijuana in public will continue to be prohibited and cannabis remains illegal in Brazil.</p>

<p>Decriminalizing its use has been discussed by the Supreme Court since 2015 and the justices reached a majority at a time when politicians are proposing a constitutional ban on the use of illegal drugs.</p>

<p>A bill advancing in Congress, with the support of conservative and evangelical lawmakers, proposes amending the Constitution to make the use and possession of any kind of narcotics a criminal offense.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Record floods that killed over 170 people and displaced half a million in southern Brazil are a warning sign of more disasters to come throughout the Americas because of climate change, an official at the United Nations' refugee agency said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Roughly 389,000 people in the state of Rio Grande do Sul remain displaced from their homes because of the intense rain and flooding, which local officials say was the worst disaster in the region's history. Scientists say climate change made the flooding twice as likely to happen.</p>

<p>Andrew Harper, special advisor on climate action to the refugee agency UNHCR, visited a flooded neighborhood in state capital Porto Alegre over the weekend and called it "a ghost town."</p>

<p>"It was underwater for almost 40 days. There wasn't even any rats running around. Everything had died," Harper said in an interview on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Even after the flood waters subsided, residents have not returned to the neighborhood where streets are piled high with water-logged garbage and debris. Many are still living in shelters, including Venezuelan refugees who had resettled in Porto Alegre.</p>

<p>UNHCR is helping the local government to build temporary housing.</p>

<p>Residents of some hard hit areas may never return, having been forced to move by repeated flooding, Harper said. But how many would become so-called climate migrants will only be known years after the disaster.</p>

<p>The floods surpassed all expectations that local authorities had for climate disasters, and governments need to do more to prepare for these events, Harper said.</p>

<p>"We're seeing the emergence in Brazil of what we may be seeing throughout the Americas. So to ignore this, they do it at their own peril," Harper said.</p>

<p>Governments need to understand where the people most vulnerable to climate change live, like the neighborhood he visited in Porto Alegre, and include those people in their climate plans, he said.</p>

<p>"It's a warning signal, but we've been seeing warning signals now for five, ten years," Harper added. "At what point do you basically have to slap somebody in the face and say, 'Wake up, you're not going to ignore this.'"</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

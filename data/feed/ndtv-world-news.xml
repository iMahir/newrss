       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When he was a witch doctor, Moussa Diallo would regularly smear himself in a lotion made from a clitoris cut from a girl subjected to female genital mutilation.</p>

<p>"I wanted to be a big chief, I wanted to dominate," said the small but charismatic fiftysomething from northwest Ivory Coast.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I put it on my face and body" every three months or so "for about three years", said Diallo, who asked AFP not to use his real name.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Genitalia cut from girls in illegal "circumcision" ceremonies is used in several regions of the West African country to "make love potions" or magic ointments that some believe will help them "make money or reach high political office", said Labe Gneble, head of the National Organisation for Women, Children and the Family (ONEF).</p>

<p>A ground-down clitoris can sell for up to around $170 (152 euros), the equivalent of what many in Ivory Coast earn in a month.</p>

<p>Diallo stopped using the functions a decade ago, but regional police chief Lieutenant N'Guessan Yosso confirmed to AFP that dried clitorises are still "very sought after for mystical practices".</p>

<p>And it is clear from extensive interviews AFP conducted with former faith healers, circumcisers, social workers, researchers and NGOs, that there is a thriving traffic in female genitalia for the powers they supposedly impart.</p>

<p>Many are convinced the trade is hampering the fight against female genital mutilation (FGM), which has been banned in the religiously diverse nation for more than a quarter of a century.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite that, one in five Ivorian women are still being cut, according to the OECD, with one in two being mutilated in parts of the north.</p>

<h3><strong>Cut and mixed with plants&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Before he had a crisis of conscience and decided to campaign against FGM, Diallo said he was often asked by the women who performed excisions around the small town of Touba to use his powers to protect them from evil spells.</p>

<p>Female circumcision has been practised by different religions in West Africa for centuries, with most girls cut between childhood and adolescence. Many families consider it a rite of passage or a way to control and repress female sexuality, according to the UN Children's agency UNICEF, which condemns cutting as a dangerous violation of girls' fundamental rights.</p>

<p>Beyond the physical and psychological pain, cutting can be fatal, and lead to sterility, birth complications, chronic infections and bleeding, not to mention the loss of sexual pleasure.</p>

<p>Diallo would often accompany the women who do the cutting out into the forest or to a home where dozens of girls would be circumcised, often surrounded by fetishes and sacred objects. So it was relatively easy for the former faith healer to obtain the precious powder.</p>

<p>"When they would cut the clitorises they would dry them for a month or two then pound them with stones," he said.</p>

<p>The result was a "black powder" which was then sometimes mixed with "leaves, roots and bark" or shea butter that is often used in cosmetics.</p>

<p>They could then sell it for around "100,000 CFA Francs (152 euros) if the girl was a virgin" or "65,000 (99 euros) if she already had a child" or barter it for goods and services, Diallo added.</p>

<p>The ex-witch doctor said he was able to get some of the powder recently -- a mix of human flesh and plants, he believes -- from a cutter in his village.</p>

<p>AFP was shown the powder but was unable to analyse it without buying it.</p>

<h3><strong>'Organ trafficking'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Former circumcisers interviewed by AFP insisted that clitorises cut from girls are either buried, thrown into a river or given to the parents, depending on local custom.</p>

<p>But one in the west of the country admitted some end up being used for magic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Some people pretend they are the girls' parents and go off with the clitoris," she said.</p>

<p>Witch doctors use them for "incantations" and sell them afterwards, she claimed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another circumciser said some of her colleagues were complicit in the trade, "giving (genitalia) to people who are up to no good" for occult purposes. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Mutilated when she was still a child, one victim told AFP that her mother warned her to bring home the flesh that had been cut.</p>

<p>The trade is regarded as "organ trafficking" in Ivorian law and is punishable -- like FGM -- with fines and several years in prison, said lawyer Marie Laurence Didier Zeze.</p>

<p>But police in Odienne, who are in charge of five regions in the country's northwest, said no one has ever been indicted for trafficking.</p>

<p>"People won't say anything about sacred practices," lamented Lieutenant N'Guessan Yosso.</p>

<p>The cutters themselves are both feared and respected, locals told AFP, often seen as prisoners of evil spirits.</p>

<h3><strong>'Just nuts'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>"A clitoris cannot give you magical powers, it's just nuts," said gynaecologist Jacqueline Chanine based in the country's commercial capital Abidjan.</p>

<p>Even so, the practice is still stubbornly widespread in some parts of the country, according to researchers.</p>

<p>Dieudonne Kouadio, an anthropologist specialising in health, was presented with a box of the powder in the town of Odienne, 150 kilometres north of Touba.</p>

<p>"It contained a dried cut organ in the form of a blackish powder," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His discovery was included in a 2021 report for the Djigui Foundation, whose conclusions were accepted by the Ministry for Women.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Farmers in Denguele district, of which Odienne is a part, "buy clitorises and mix the powder with their seeds to increase the fertility of their fields", said Nouho Konate, a Djigui foundation member who has been fighting FGM in the area for 16 years.</p>

<p>He said parents of young girls were "gutted" when he told them of the trafficking.</p>

<p>Further south and in the centre west of the country, women use clitoris powder as an aphrodisiac, hoping to prevent their husbands from straying, said criminologist Safie Roseline N'da, author of a 2023 study on FGM which also pointed to the trade.</p>

<p>She and her two co-authors discovered that blood from cut women was also being used to honour traditional gods.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They are far from the only Ivorian folk remedies that use body parts, according to lawyer Didier Zeze.</p>

<h3><strong>Mystic beliefs keep it going&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>"The mystic has a central place in daily life" in the Ivory Coast -- where Islam, Christianity and traditional animist beliefs co-exist -- said the Canadian anthropologist Boris Koenig, a specialist in occult practices there. "It touches every sphere of people's social, professional, family and love lives," he said, and there is generally nothing illegal about it.</p>

<p>The trade, however, is "one of the reasons that FGM survives" in the Ivory Coast, NGOs argue, where the rate of cutting is generally falling and is below the West African average of 28 per cent, according to the OECD.</p>

<p>Back near Touba, the former witch doctor Diallo recalled how up to 30 women would be cut in a day in the places his magic protected.</p>

<p>The dry season between January to March was the favoured period for circumcisions when the hot Harmattan wind from the Sahara helps scars heal, he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Staff at the region's only social work centre say the cutting is still going on but is hard to quantify because it never happens in the open.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Instead, it goes on in secret, hidden behind traditional festivals which have nothing to do with the practice, kept going they say by circumcisers from neighbouring Guinea -- only a few kilometres away -- where FGM rates are over 90 per cent.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On June 28, shortly after Joe Biden and Donald Trump faced off in a Presidential debate for the high-stakes US election, many concluded that the fight was over even before it began. As the 81-year-old US President lost his train of thought multiple times while speaking on critical subjects, his 78-year-old predecessor and opponent mocked his confusion.</p>

<p>Cut to September 11, Trump faced a different Democrat presidential candidate. And this time, he was the older one and by a much larger margin. At 59, Vice-President Kamala Harris is nearly two decades younger and she did not miss an opportunity to drive this point home, albeit in a subtle manner. "What I do offer is a new generation of leadership for our country," she said.</p>

<p>In US Presidential debates, televised and followed closely on social media, optics matter. Where Biden had appeared pale and confused, Harris was confident and focused. Harris started by walking up to Trump and shaking his hand, "Hi, Kamala Harris, let's have a good debate," she said. This was the first handshake on the US Presidential debate stage after eight years. It was underlined that this was the first time the two leaders met.</p>

<p>As the debate began, the vice president of Indian origin pulled no punches. On multiple occasions, she managed to get under Trump's skin, setting him off on rants his team would not be happy about. She targeted him over his convictions in criminal cases, his administration's handling of the Covid pandemic and his image on the global scene. The tables had turned. In the earlier debate, Biden had struggled to counter Trump's attacks on his policies, this time Harris' messaging was crisp and Trump appeared to be defensive.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the debate, responding to a question on US economy and cost of living, Ms Harris spoke of her middle-class background and plans to support families and small businesses if elected to the top post. Targeting Trump, she said he would provide tax cuts to "billionaires and big corporations". "Donald Trump has no plan for you," she said.</p>

<p>Trump responded with a personal attack. "She's a Marxist - everybody knows she's a Marxist. Her father's a Marxist professor in economics, and he taught her well," he said.</p>

<p>As Trump targeted Harris over Biden administration's immigration policies, she responded sharply, "You're going to hear from the same old tired playbook, a bunch of lies, grievances and name-calling." A key moment in the debate was when Trump rattled out a social media conspiracy theory that immigrants are eating pets.</p>

<p>"In Springfield, they're eating the dogs, the people that came in, they're eating the cats. They're eating the pets of the people that live there. And this is what's happening in our country," he said. Harris' microphone was off, but she was seen laughing and mouthing "what?".</p>

<p>Another sharp response was when Harris, speaking about the Ukraine war, said that "Putin would be sitting in Kyiv with his eyes on the rest of Europe" if Trump was President. She also said Putin "would eat you for lunch".</p>

<p>Compare these exchanges to the ones during the Biden vs Trump debate. The older President appeared to be putting up a relatively muted performance and struggling to articulate himself as Trump put out fireworks. The debate was still underway when the White House said Biden was suffering from a cold. The US President's performance did not help his attempts to convince the nation that he could serve in what is among the world's most powerful positions till 86.</p>

<p><strong>"You are not running against Biden"</strong></p>

<p>A key challenge Harris faced going into this debate was Team Trump's push to tie her to the Biden administration's failure. Harris, however, responded by stressing that she represents a new generation of leadership and that it's time to "turn the page".</p>

<p>"I'm clearly not Joe Biden and certainly not Donald Trump. And what I do offer is a new generation of leadership for our country, one who believes in what is possible. One who brings a sense of optimism about what we can do instead of always disparaging the American people," she said.</p>

<p>At another point, she said, "You have heard tonight, two very different visions for this country. One that is focused on the future and one that is focused on the past."</p>

<p>She also managed to irk Trump by saying that world leaders laughed at him and said, "You are a disgrace". Trump responded by citing close ties with Hungary Prime Minister Viktor Orban and that he has said Trump should return as President. The reference to Orban, known for restrictions on immigration and gay rights, was widely seen as Trump's continuing admiration of autocratic leaders.</p>

<p>While there was no specific mic drop moment, the debate did see several of Harris' punches land well. The November election is still likely to be a close contest -- ABC poll tracker shows a 2.8 percentage points -- but the Democrats have without doubt made a comeback from where they were during the June 28 Biden vs Trump debate.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Taylor Swift announced her endorsement of Kamala Harris on Tuesday night, minutes after the Democratic presidential nominee wrapped up her first debate against Republican rival Donald Trump.</p>

<p>The endorsement aligns Harris with a singular force in the world of music, offering to bolster her support among younger and female voters.</p>

<p>Calling herself a "Childless Cat Lady," a term used by Trump's running mate, JD Vance, to disparage women without children, Swift announced her support in an Instagram post featuring a photo of her posing with a cat in her arms.</p>

<p>Swift is voting for Harris "because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them," she wrote. "I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos."</p>

<p>The pop superstar's obsessive fans have been closely scrutinizing her social media accounts and public appearances for signs of her allegiance in the election. Swift backed President Joe Biden and Harris in 2020 and has over the course of her career made a handful of other public statements in favor of Democratic politicians.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris and Donald Trump participated in the US Presidential Debate today, exactly eight weeks before the United States goes to polls. In a fierce debate that saw both candidates indulge in a verbal duel, there were claims and counter-claims.</p>

<p>The debate, which is the first such debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris will most likely also be the only debate they take part in with just over 50 days to go for the election. The debate was televised on US' ABC News.</p>

<p>Tens of millions of Americans tuned in to understand better what each presidential candidate had to offer and what their respective visions are to steer their nation forward. US, being a country of immigrants and a major global power, also invokes interest of people living in other countries, millions of whom tuned in earlier today to witness the closely-contested debate.</p>

<p>Both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris traded claims about each other's record in office, as well as their plans if they emerge victorious in the election. Some of these claims required fact-checks to give a clear picture.</p>

<p><strong>FACT-CHECK 1 - THE ECONOMY</strong></p>

<p>Asked if Americans were better off than they were four years ago, Kamala Harris did not give a direct answer. She accused Trump of leaving Democrats "the worst unemployment since the Great Depression." This can be seen as misleading. Joblessness spiked at 14.8 per cent in April 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the US. By the time Trump left office unemployment was 6.4 percent.</p>

<p><strong>FACT-CHECK 2 - INFLATION</strong></p>

<p>Kamala Harris said she would offer families a tax credit of up to $6,000 for each eligible child, as well as a $50,000 tax deduction for small businesses, if elected president. She claimed that Donald Trump would favor billionaires and corporations over anyone else, and said the former president planned a sales tax that would hurt ordinary Americans.</p>

<p>Trump countered this claim by saying President Joe Biden's administration ushered in the highest inflation in US history, quoting figures of 21 per cent and as high as 60 per cent on some goods. This is false. Inflation currently stands at 2.9 percent. Inflation did hit a high of 9.1 percent under Biden in 2022. This was well below a historic high of 23.7 percent in 1920.</p>

<p><strong>FACT-CHECK 3 - IMMIGRATION AND 'MIGRANT CRIME'</strong></p>

<p>Donald Trump falsely claimed that "millions and millions" of people from countries such as Venezuela "from mental institutions and insane asylums" are entering the US and committing crimes. He also re-aired a baseless viral claim that migrants are eating pets in places including Springfield, Ohio.</p>

<p>"In Springfield, they're eating the dogs, the people that came in, they're eating the cats. They're eating the pets of the people that live there. And this is what's happening in our country."</p>

<p>Police and local authorities say there are no credible reports of any such animal killings.</p>

<p>Violent and property crimes in the US are near their lowest levels in decades, according to FBI data from 2022, the most recent year for which figures are available.</p>

<p>A June 2023 study found a decline in incarceration rates among immigrants from all regions since 1960. Other research has found migrants commit fewer violent crimes than US citizens.</p>

<p>FBI statistics from the first three months of 2024 also show a 15 percent decrease in violent and property crime year-over-year.</p>

<p>Illegal immigration during Donald Trump's administration was higher than under President Barack Obama's two terms. Earlier this year, during the Biden administration, illegal immigration reached a historic high. It has fallen since an executive order signed in July.</p>

<p>Kamala Harris said Donald Trump put politics above policy by ordering Republican lawmakers this summer to kill a bipartisan bill that would have toughened policies at the southern US border.</p>

<p><strong>FACT-CHECK 4 - ABORTION</strong></p>

<p>Donald Trump, who appointed three conservative judges to a Supreme Court that overturned Roe vs Wade, the precedent that guaranteed abortion access, called Democrats "radical" on the issue, claiming vice presidential candidate Tim Walz supports "execution after birth - it's execution, no longer abortion - because the baby is born is okay, and that's not okay with me."</p>

<p>This is false. No state allows a baby to be killed after it is born. This is infanticide, which is illegal across the US.</p>

<p>Debate moderator Linsey Davis corrected Donald Trump, saying: "There is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it's born." Ms Harris added: "Nowhere in America is a woman carrying a pregnancy to term and asking for an abortion. That is not happening."</p>

<p>Kamala Harris claimed: "If Donald Trump were to be reelected, he will sign a national abortion ban." But the former president immediately replied: "I'm not signing a ban," saying that the issue is with the states.</p>

<p><strong>FACT-CHECK 5 - ON AFGHANISTAN</strong></p>

<p>Donald Trump claimed that the United States "left $85 billion" worth of equipment in Afghanistan. This is False. The actual figure is much lower than what Trump claimed in the debate. When the Taliban toppled Afghanistan's civilian government in 2021, it inherited US's military hardware given to the then government. The US Congress was briefed that about $7 billion of US military equipment remained in Afghanistan and in the Taliban's hands.</p>

<p>Speaking about Afghanistan, Kamala Harris said when he was president, Donald Trump had "invited the Taliban to Camp David." This is true, reported independent fact-checking agency <em>PolitiFact</em>. In September, 2019, Donald Trump had said he was canceling a planned, secret meeting for peace talks with the Taliban at Camp David. In February 2020, the US government and the Taliban signed a deal to end the war in Afghanistan within 14 months.</p>

<p>Kamala Harris said that Donald Trump "negotiated directly with a terrorist organisation called the Taliban. The negotiation involved the Taliban getting 5,000 terrorists released."</p>

<p>This is True. A 2020 agreement between the United States and the Taliban called for the release of up to 5,000 Taliban prisoners who were jailed by the Afghan government.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2024/sep/10/presidential-debate-live-fact-check-harris-trump/" rel="No follow, no index" target="_blank">PolitiFact</a>, news reports and statements from Afghanistan's president indicated that the release happened. Afghanistan officials said they freed the prisoners at the request of the US.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wednesday marks the 23rd anniversary of the devastating 9/11 terrorist attacks that shook the United States to its core. The 2001 attack on New York City's iconic World Trade Center had far-reaching global consequences, serving as a stark reminder of the vulnerability of even the most powerful nations.</p>

<p>On that fateful day, planes crashed into the Twin Towers, the Pentagon, and a field in Pennsylvania, claiming the lives of nearly 3,000 people. The attacks were the deadliest on US soil since the Pearl Harbor bombing, which had precipitated America's entry into World War II.</p>

<p>Among those who witnessed the horrific events firsthand was photojournalist Bill Biggart. Bravely documenting the chaos and destruction, Mr Biggart captured a haunting image of the collapsing remains of Tower Two. Tragically, this final frame would prove to be his last.</p>

<p></p>

<p>A seasoned press photographer, Mr Biggart was known for his passion for capturing conflict and social movements both domestically and internationally. His work often took him into dangerous situations, where he fearlessly documented the realities of war and injustice.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://petapixel.com/2020/09/11/bill-biggart-the-hero-photographer-who-died-capturing-9-11/" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>PetaPixel</em></a> reported that during the attack, Bill Biggart's wife called him on his cellphone to inform him it was an act of terrorism, not an accident. "I'm O.K.," he reassured her. "I'm with the firemen."</p>

<p>Bolivar Arellano, a photographer for the New York Post who was also covering the tragic event, recalled seeing his colleague, Bill Biggart, at the scene. According to Arellano, Biggart was closer to the towers than any other photographer, and even closer than many of the firefighters.</p>

<p>At 10:28:22 a.m., the weakened support beneath the impact zone of the North Tower finally gave way, causing the massive structure to collapse.</p>

<p>At 10:28:24 a.m., Bill Biggart captured a striking photograph of the South Tower's ruins alongside the still-standing base of the North Tower. The scene was a sombre tapestry of repetitive industrial lines, softened and fractured by dust and smoke. The image was nearly devoid of colour, reflecting the solemnity and grimness of the day.</p>

<p>Bill was likely still looking through the viewfinder of his Canon D30 when 500,000 tons of glass, concrete, and steel suddenly collapsed on him at 120 miles per hour.</p>

<p>Four days after the tragedy, rescue crews finally recovered Biggart's body from beneath the dense rubble that once was the World Trade Center. Biggart was the only professional photographer covering 9/11 who did not make it out alive.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ahead of a game-changing presidential debate, US Vice President and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris walked over to her Republican rival Donald Trump and shook hands with him. This was the first time two US presidential candidates have shaken hands since 2016.</p>

<p>The debate also marks the first time the two candidates have met each other face-to-face.</p>

<p>As the two rivals entered the debate stage, Trump headed to his podium on the left to take his place. Kamala Harris, on the other hand, crossed the stage, walked up to him and held out her hand.</p>

<p>"Kamala Harris, Let's have a good debate," she said as she introduced herself to the former president.</p>

<p>"Nice to see you, let's have fun," Trump replied and the two shook hands.</p>

<p>"Thank you," Harris said.</p>

<p></p>

<p>While there is no rule that require the two candidates to shake hand, it does mark a gesture of civility ahead of what is usually a politically brutal face-off.</p>

<p>The high-stakes debate began with a fiery jab by the 78-year-old Republican who called Harris a "Marxist" and claimed that she and President Joe Biden had allowed "millions of people pouring into our country from prisons and jails, from mental institutions and insane asylums."</p>

<p>Harris jibed the former US president several time by calling him a "convicted felon", "friend of dictators" and saying that he used "race to divide the American people."</p>

<p>She said Trump's own former White House security officials have called him a "disgrace." "World leaders are laughing at Donald Trump," she added.</p>

<p>The crucial debate comes only 56 days before the election in what has been a narrow race to the White house.</p>

<p>The last presidential debate in June resulted in Joe Biden pulling out of his reelection campaign and nominating Harris to take his place instead.</p>

<p>Almost all polls have shown the two candidates in a tight neck-and-neck contest.</p>

<p>The debate proved to be a critical chance for the two rivals to battle it out before the US goes to vote on November 5.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said his Tuesday showdown with Democrat Kamala Harris was his "best debate ever," and accused the ABC network moderators of working against him.</p>

<p>"I thought that was my best Debate, EVER, especially since it was THREE ON ONE!" Trump posted on social media.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kamala Harris savaged Donald Trump as "extreme" and the friend of dictators, while the Republican branded her a "Marxist" in a bitter televised debate Tuesday that poured fuel on an already explosive US presidential election.</p>

<p>On hot-button issues ranging from abortion and race to the fate of US democracy, the two held their first -- and possibly only -- debate ahead of the November 5 election, with each hoping for a breakthrough in an agonizingly close race.</p>

<p>Trump, who only a few weeks ago had believed himself to be cruising to victory, reacted to pressure from Harris by raising his voice and resorting to the kinds of colorful invective and often meandering insults that he uses at his rallies.</p>

<p>Harris, 59, responded by looking on in amusement, then clearly got under his skin, declaring that she represents a fresh start after the "mess" of the Trump presidency -- and saying: "We're not going back."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democratic Presidential nominee Kamala Harris presented herself as the face of a new generation of leadership as she reminded her Republican rival Donald Trump that he was contesting against her, and not President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>"It's important to remind the former president you're not running against Joe Biden, you're running against me," she said as Trump focussed most of criticism on Biden at the heated ABC debate.</p>

<p>The Republican criticism has hinged mostly on the unpopular president who dropped out of race midway after a dismal debate performance against Trump in July. Trump used the same playbook in today's debate, trying to attack Harris with criticism against Biden.</p>

<p>The debate began with a formal handshake as Trump and Harris met for the first time, but turned bitter soon. Trump called Biden the worst president in US history and Harris the worst vice president. He further claimed Harris "hates" Biden and is trying to get away from him.</p>

<p>Harris, on the other hand, tried to evoke confidence after a lack of enthusiasm over the Trump-Biden rematch.</p>

<p>"I'm clearly not Joe Biden and certainly not Donald Trump. And what I do offer is a new generation of leadership for our country, one who believes in what is possible. One who brings a sense of optimism about what we can do instead of always disparaging the American people," she said.</p>

<p>Trump criticised Biden over the Russia-Ukraine war, asserting he will get it ended if he wins the elections, but did not answer if Ukraine should win. In response, Kamala Harris said Trump would "give up" Ukraine to Russia as she called Vladimir Putin "a dictator who would eat you (Trump) for lunch."</p>

<p>On the Middle East crisis, Harris voiced support for a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine. Trump said the Democrats hate Israel, but had no specific answer on what he would do to end the war if he gets elected.</p>

<p>Trump also labelled Harris as a "Marxist"; the Vice President laughed it off.</p>

<p>The 2024 election was supposed to be a 2020 rematch. But Harris was passed the baton after President Joe Biden opted out of his re-election bid. If she wins the November polls, Harris will become the first woman president of the US.</p>

<p>Trump was initially leading in national polls, but the entry of Harris changed the game. Latest polls suggest the two leaders are neck and neck with the Democrat maintaining a marginal lead over her Republican rival.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"I'm voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos."</p>

<p>She signed off her Instagram post by dubbing herself a "childless cat lady," a swipe at a much-mocked sentiment expressed by Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance which he had wielded in a bid to insult Democratic women.</p>

<p>Until Tuesday, Swift had been conspicuously quiet on the subject, even as many of her fans began organizing under the banner "Swifties for Kamala" and raising tens of thousands of dollars for the Democratic hopeful.</p>

<p>But the 34-year-old said that discovering that AI-generated images of her falsely endorsing Trump, which "conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation," had inspired her to speak up.</p>

<p>"It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter," she said. "The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth."</p>

<p>She encouraged her legions of loyal fans to "do your research."</p>

<p>Swift, fresh off the European leg of her blockbuster "Eras" tour, balked at explicitly telling her ardent supporters to vote for Harris, instead saying "I've done my research, and I've made my choice."</p>

<p>"Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make."</p>

<p>The artist did voice special support for Harris's choice of a running mate, Tim Walz, praising the Minnesota governor for "standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman's right to her own body for decades."</p>

<h3><strong>'With love and hope"</strong></h3>

<p>A global celebrity with hundreds of millions of social media followers and a wildly loyal -- and chronically online -- fan base, Swift can move any needle with the tiniest of efforts.</p>

<p>The right and the left have long wanted to count the "Blank Space" singer as their own -- but for years Swift stayed conspicuously out of politics, including in 2016 when Donald Trump won the presidency.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speculation abounded that the superstar was a closet Republican until 2018, when she broke both her silence and the internet by endorsing the Democratic opponent of far-right politician Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Blackburn won anyway, but it ushered in a new chapter for Swift.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She later explained that handlers had urged her against wading into politics, telling her it could damage her career -- particularly in the country music industry, which despite its complexities is often associated with conservatism.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Swift endorsed Joe Biden in 2020 and has conveyed pro-LGBTQ messages through her songs and music videos.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She also condemned the Supreme Court's reversal of the federal right to abortion and has encouraged droves of her fans to register to vote.</p>

<p>But Swift's massive popularity has also meant she's a regular target for political misinformation and right-wing conspiracy theories, often fueled by AI and amplified by the likes of Trump.</p>

<p>Speaking out on her own terms gripped the news cycle within seconds of going live, and her post notched more than two million "likes" after just 30 minutes.</p>

<p>"With love and hope, Taylor Swift," she concluded her message.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump took the stage on Tuesday night for their first and only scheduled presidential debate before the Nov. 5 election.</p>

<p>Here are some key quotes:</p>

<h3><strong>ECONOMY</strong></h3>

<p>"Look, we've had a terrible economy, because of inflation, which is really known as a country buster," said Trump.</p>

<p>"People can't go out and buy cereal or bacon or eggs or anything else. The people of our country are absolutely dying with what they've done. They've destroyed the economy," said Trump.</p>

<p>"I believe in the ambition, the aspirations, the dreams of the American people, and that is why I imagine and have actually a plan to build what I call an opportunity economy," said Harris.</p>

<p>"My opponent, on the other hand, his plan is to do what he has done before, which is to provide a tax cut for billionaires and big corporations," said Harris.</p>

<h3><strong>ISRAEL-GAZA CONFLICT</strong></h3>

<p>"It must end immediately, and the way it will end is we need a ceasefire deal, and we need the hostages out," said Harris.</p>

<p>"She hates Israel. If she's president, I believe that Israel will not exist within two years from now," said Trump to which Harris responded: "That's absolutely not true. I have my entire career and life supported Israel and the Israeli people."</p>

<h3><strong>WORLD LEADERS</strong></h3>

<p>"World leaders are laughing at Donald Trump," said Harris.</p>

<p>"(Hungarian Prime Minister) Viktor Orban said the most respected, most feared person is Donald Trump. We had no problems when Trump was president," said Trump.</p>

<h3><strong>UKRAINE</strong></h3>

<p>"I want the war to stop. I want to save lives," Trump said when asked if he wanted Ukraine to win the war with Russia.</p>

<p>"If Donald Trump were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now," said Harris.</p>

<h3><strong>JABS</strong></h3>

<p>"Wait a minute, I'm talking now, if you don't mind, please, does that sound familiar?" said Trump, appearing to refer to Harris' use of "I'm speaking" during the 2020 vice presidential debate against former Vice President Mike Pence.</p>

<p>"It's important to remind the former president, you're not running against Joe Biden, you are running against me," said Harris.</p>

<p>"So she just started by saying she's going to do this, she's going to do that, she's going to do all these wonderful things. Why hasn't she done it? She's been there for three and a half years," said Trump following Harris' closing remarks.</p>

<h3><strong>ABORTION</strong></h3>

<p>"I pledge to you, when Congress passes a bill to put back in place the protections of Roe v Wade as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law," said Harris.</p>

<p>"Now, I believe in the exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother. ... Now states are voting on it. ... Each individual state is voting. It's the vote of the people. Now it's not tied up in the federal government," said Trump.</p>

<h3><strong>IMMIGRATION</strong></h3>

<p>"I'll tell you something, he's going to talk about immigration a lot tonight, even when it's not the subject that is being raised," said Harris.</p>

<p>"Our country is being lost, we're a failing nation," Trump said, referring to people crossing into the country illegally.</p>

<h3><strong>ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT</strong></h3>

<p>"I probably took a bullet to the head for the things they say about me," said Trump.</p>

<h3><strong>TRUTHFULNESS</strong></h3>

<p>"As I said, you're gonna hear a bunch of lies, and that's not actually a surprising fact," said Harris.</p>

<p>"There she goes again. It's a lie," said Trump after Harris said he would sign a national abortion ban were he to win office.</p>

<h3><strong>JOE BIDEN</strong></h3>

<p>"Remember this, she is Biden. She's trying to get away from Biden," said Trump, referring to Harris.</p>

<p>"Clearly, I am not Joe Biden, and certainly not Donald Trump, and what I do offer is a new generation of leadership for our country," said Harris.</p>

<h3><strong>GUNS</strong></h3>

<p>"She has a plan to confiscate everybody's gun," said Trump.</p>

<p>"(Democratic Vice Presidential nominee) Tim Walz and I are both gun owners. We're not taking anybody's guns away," said Harris.</p>

<h3><strong>JAN. 6, 2021, CAPITOL ATTACK</strong></h3>

<p>"I had nothing to do with that, other than they asked me to make a speech," said Trump, when asked if he regretted anything that day.</p>

<p>"I was at the Capitol. I was the vice president-elect. I was also a senator and on that day, the president of the United States incited a violent mob to attack our nation's capital, to desecrate our nation's capital," said Harris.</p>

<h3><strong>COVID-19</strong></h3>

<p>"But what Donald Trump did, let's talk about this, with COVID, is he actually thanked President Xi for what he did during COVID," said Harris.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump met on Tuesday for their first and perhaps only debate, a square-off that could have a significant impact on the Nov. 5 election as polls show a tight race.</p>

<p>Here are the takeaways from the debate:</p>

<h3><strong>RILING HER RIVAL</strong></h3>

<p>Harris made a point to get under Trump's skin, as her campaign had forecast.</p>

<p>She urged viewers to attend a Trump rally, where she said Trump would say bizarre things such as windmills cause cancer (something he has, in fact, said) and where, she taunted, attendees would leave out of exhaustion and boredom.</p>

<p>Trump, who prides himself on the crowds he draws, was clearly riled.</p>

<p>"My rallies, we have the biggest rallies, the most incredible rallies in the history of politics," he said. He accused Harris of busing in attendees to her rallies.</p>

<p>Trump then falsely claimed that immigrants in the country illegally were killing and eating people's pets in the city of Springfield, Ohio, an unsubstantiated claim that has circulated on social media and been amplified by Trump's vice presidential running mate JD Vance.</p>

<p>"In Springfield, they're eating the dogs! The people that came in, they're eating the cats!" Trump said. "They're eating the pets of the people that live there."</p>

<p>City officials in Springfield have said those reports are untrue, which the ABC moderators pointed out after Trump's comments.</p>

<p>"Talk about extreme," Harris responded, laughing.</p>

<h3><strong>PLAYING DEFENSE</strong></h3>

<p>Another of Harris' goals, as a former California prosecutor, was to call Trump out for his past actions, particularly his efforts to overturn the 2020 election.</p>

<p>An hour into the debate, her strategy appeared to be paying off. Trump was continually on the defensive.</p>

<p>Asked about the Jan. 6, 2021, siege of the U.S. Capitol, he insisted he "had nothing to do with that, other than they asked me to make a speech." He also maintained, falsely, that he had won the 2020 election.</p>

<p>Harris used Trump's actions as an argument for the country to turn the page.</p>

<p>"Donald Trump was fired by 81 million people, so let's be clear about that, and clearly he is having a very difficult time processing that, but we cannot afford to have a president of the United States who attempts as he did in the past to upend the will of the voters in a free and fair election," Harris said.</p>

<p>The vice president dug at Trump a little more, saying world leaders were "laughing" at him and calling him a disgrace - language that Trump has employed himself at rallies in reference to how he says other countries view President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, Trump erupted, claiming Harris had received "no votes" in claiming the Democratic nomination and suggesting she replaced Biden as part of some sort of coup.</p>

<p>"He hates her," Trump said of Biden. "He can't stand her."</p>

<p>The exchanges may have aided Harris' argument that Trump, as she put it, lacks the "temperament" to be president.</p>

<h3><strong>HANDSHAKE</strong></h3>

<p>Heading into the debate, there was a question as to how Harris and Trump, who have never met, would greet each other.</p>

<p>Harris settled the issue, definitively. She walked over to Trump at his podium, extended her hand and introduced herself as "Kamala Harris."</p>

<p>It was a disarming way for Harris to approach a man who had spent weeks insulting her race and gender.</p>

<p>After that, the debate quickly settled into an expected groove. Harris swiftly painted herself as a forward-looking candidate. She predicted Trump at the debate would pull from the "same tired playbook."</p>

<p>"A bunch of lies, grievances and name-calling," Harris said.</p>

<h3><strong>SPARRING ON THE ECONOMY</strong></h3>

<p>In the debate's opening minutes, Trump and Harris went to battle on one of the issues that are top of mind for voters: the economy.</p>

<p>Harris detailed the economic policies she has rolled out in recent weeks, which include a substantial tax credit for small start-ups. Trump focused his comments on tariffs, saying he would protect the American economy from unfair foreign competition.</p>

<p>While both sides got their jabs in, Harris got to speak first on a topic where she trails Trump in terms of voter trust. She appeared to force the former president onto his back foot, and Trump essentially played defence on one of his strongest issues.</p>

<p>"She doesn't have a plan" Trump said, after Harris' opening comments. "It's like Run, Spot, Run."</p>

<h3><strong>A SCHISM ON ABORTION</strong></h3>

<p>The two candidates also engaged in a fractious debate about abortion, an issue where polls show Harris has the upper hand.</p>

<p>Trump defended the U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 ruling that ended constitutional protection for abortion and sent the issue back to individual states, arguing, incorrectly, that it was an outcome desired by both Republicans and Democrats. Democrats have long supported a constitutional right to abortion.</p>

<p>"I did a great service in doing it. It took courage to do it," Trump said.</p>

<p>Trump also contended that some states allow babies to be aborted after birth, a point corrected by ABC News moderator, Linsey Davis.</p>

<p>Harris flashed some outrage at Trump's assertion that abortion becoming a states-rights issue was a popular result, referring to states that have passed restrictive bans.</p>

<p>"This is what people wanted?" Harris asked. "People being denied care in an emergency room because healthcare providers are being afraid of being hauled off to jail?"</p>

<p>Trump was asked whether he would veto a federal abortion ban if one were passed by Congress. He insisted it would never happen, but refused to answer the question definitively.</p>

<h3><strong>'WEAPONIZED' JUSTICE</strong></h3>

<p>In one heated exchange, Trump and Harris accused each other of conspiring to "weaponize" the Justice Department in a bid to go after their enemies.</p>

<p>Trump said the indictments he faces for conspiring to overturn his 2020 election loss and for his mishandling of classified documents - as well as his conviction for forging documents related to hush money payments to a porn star - are all the result of a conspiracy cooked up by Harris and Biden. There is no evidence for that assertion.</p>

<p>Harris shot back by pointing out that Trump has promised to prosecute his enemies if he wins a second term.</p>

<p>"Understand this is someone who has openly said he would terminate, I'm quoting, terminate the Constitution," Harris said.</p>

<p>The exchange underlined how Harris and Trump see the stakes of this election as existential. Both see their opponent as a threat to democracy itself.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A comprehensive catalogue of clouds observed on Mars has unveiled the planet's stunning array of atmospheric phenomena, many of which are unlike anything seen on Earth. Despite its thin atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide, Mars can produce striking cloud formations when conditions are right, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2447266-cloud-atlas-of-mars-reveals-an-atmosphere-unlike-our-own/" rel="nofollow, noindex"><em>New Scientist </em></a>reported.</p>

<p>Daniela Tirsch and her colleagues at the German Aerospace Center have compiled a "cloud atlas" using images captured by the European Space Agency's Mars Express probe over two decades to better understand these patterns and their impact on the Martian climate.</p>

<p>Some of the clouds observed resemble their Earthly counterparts, such as gravity wave clouds and cloud streets. These clouds form due to atmospheric disturbances caused by Martian surface features or chaotic currents within the atmosphere. However, Mars' unique atmospheric conditions give rise to clouds that have no terrestrial analogues.</p>

<p>Elongated dust clouds, for instance, are a distinctive feature of the Martian atmosphere. These clouds can stretch for hundreds of kilometres and have a striking reddish hue due to the vast quantities of Martian dust they contain. Additionally, orographic clouds form as air is forced upward by mountains and volcanoes, sometimes mixing with dust or dust storms to create features that mimic volcanic eruptions.</p>

<p>Twilight clouds, which appear near the horizon as the sun rises or sets on Mars, are particularly intriguing. These clouds can take on a variety of forms, from wispy cirrus-like structures to strange, clustered blobs. Their appearance and behaviour are influenced by a combination of factors, including the angle of sunlight, the composition of the atmosphere, and the presence of dust or other particles.</p>

<p>The diversity of cloud formations observed on Mars highlights the complexity of the planet's atmospheric dynamics. By studying these clouds, scientists can gain valuable insights into the Martian climate, the circulation of the atmosphere, and the role of dust in shaping the planet's environment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Blood on the ground of a dark, cramped tunnel sealed by an iron door, bullets and a chess set are seen in a video released by the Israeli military of the passageway deep underground where it said six slain hostages were held and killed by Hamas.</p>

<p>The video was filmed by the military last Friday, its spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said, as a forensic team investigated the hostage deaths. It was released to the public on Tuesday after it had been viewed by their families and the Israeli security cabinet.</p>

<p>The six hostages were killed on the night of Aug. 29, Hagari said. Their bodies were found and retrieved by Israeli soldiers in the southern Gaza area of Rafah around two days later.</p>

<p>Hagari said at least two Hamas gunmen shot them dead in the tunnel, which is 20 metres (66 ft) below ground, less than 170 centimetres (5.6 ft) high and about 80 centimetres (32 inches) wide. It has an exit shaft used by the militants, below a children's room in a house.</p>

<p>The hostages had likely been held in the dank tunnel, where it is hard to breathe and to stand up straight, for some time, possibly weeks, Hagari said.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">????????? ???????: IDF Spokesperson, RAdm. Daniel Hagari, reveals the underground terrorist tunnel where Hersh, Eden, Carmel, Ori, Alex and Almog were held in brutal conditions and murdered by Hamas. <a href="https://t.co/edlfi4lR8U">pic.twitter.com/edlfi4lR8U</a></p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>A version of the video with English narration shows Kalashnikov rifle magazines, bags containing plastic bottles filled with urine and a bucket in a hole that served as a toilet. Women's clothing is strewn on the ground. The Hebrew version, broadcast live on Israeli television channels, also shows a chess set.</p>

<p>Reuters was not able to independently verify the location or the date when the video was filmed.</p>

<p>Israeli troops were in the area, fighting Hamas militants above ground when the hostages were killed, Hagari said, adding that the soldiers had not been attempting a rescue operation. The military did not have precise verified intelligence about the hostages' presence in the area, he said.</p>

<p>The six dead hostages were two women and four men aged between 23 and 40, five of whom were taken from the Nova dance festival attacked by militants on Oct. 7 last year. One of them was a father whose baby was born after he was taken hostage. The killings have sparked outrage and an outpouring of grief in Israel.</p>

<p>Efforts to secure a ceasefire in Gaza that would include a hostage release deal have faltered, with Israel and Hamas trading blame for the deadlock. Mass protests last week demanded Israeli leaders do more for their release.</p>

<p>Hamas-led fighters took around 250 foreign and Israeli hostages when they burst into Israel on Oct. 7 and killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies. Israel's offensive in Gaza has killed more than 40,000 Palestinians since.</p>

<p>Around 100 hostages remain in Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed dead. More than 100 hostages were released in return for Palestinian prisoners in November and eight have been rescued by Israeli forces.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Vice President and Democrat presidential candidate Kamala Harris today clashed with former President and Republican rival Donald Trump over several issues faced by Americans.</p>

<p>Ms Harris took on Donald Trump, accusing him of the "worst unemployment crisis in the US, since the Great Depression", adding that the former President had left the United States in a "mess", which her administration has since cleaned up.</p>

<p>She went on to charge Donald Trump for the "worst public health epidemic in a century".</p>

<p>Ms Harris went on a no-holds-barred attack on Donald Trump putting him in a corner over what she called "the worst attack on US's democracy since the Civil War". She slammed the former US President for constantly indulging in "divide and distract tactics".</p>

<p>The United States today is severely polarised on several issues, from immigration and race, to religious intolerance and hate crimes, and Ms Harris blamed Donald Trump for creating such divide in American society.</p>

<p>She targeted him over the 2020 attack on the US Capitol in which thousands of people stormed one of the top institutions of the United States.</p>

<p>The two candidates are facing off today in a closely contested Presidential debate being hosted by ABC News. Tens of thousands of people in the United States and several million more across the world have tuned in to the televised debate.</p>

<p>The timing of the debate is crucial as many states go to early votes days after today's contest. The US Presidential election is exactly eight weeks from today.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democratic Presidential nominee Kamala Harris has claimed that his Republican rival Donald Trump would sign the national abortion ban if he becomes the President, as the two leaders faced off in the first televised debate in Philadelphia. Trump denied the claim and accused the Democrats of supporting abortions after birth.</p>

<p>"In over 20 years, there are trump abortion bans. They don't make exception even in rape and incest...if Trump becomes president, he will sign the national abortion ban," said Harris.</p>

<p><strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-presidential-debate-live-donald-trump-and-kamala-harris-to-face-off-in-1st-televised-debate-6537144">Follow live updates here</a></strong></p>

<p>"She is lying. I'm not signing the ban. There is no reason to sign the ban," responded Trump.</p>

<p>Harris accused him of lying over efforts to end federal protections for abortion and called his policies on reproductive rights "insulting to the women of America."</p>

<p>"Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v Wade, and they did exactly as he intended," said the Vice President.</p>

<p><strong>Read |&nbsp;</strong><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-kamala-harris-debate-us-elections-2024-donald-trump-repeats-debunked-story-on-migrants-eating-cats-of-residents-6537649">Trump Repeats De-Bunked Migrants Eating "Dogs, Cats" Story. Harris Laughs</a></p>

<p>In 2022, the US Supreme Court ended the constitutional right to abortion that was established by the landmark Roe vs Wade ruling. The 1973 ruling had legalised abortion across the country.</p>

<p>Trump further said the Democrats were radicals who find abortion in the ninth month was alright.</p>

<p>"Democrats are radicals. Her vice-presidential pick - which I believe is a horrible pick - says abortion in the ninth month is absolutely fine. This is an issue that has torn our country apart for 52 years," said the former president.</p>

<p>He further claimed the Democrats supported abortions after birth: "In other words, we'll execute the baby." This was fact-checked as false by the ABC Networks, which is hosting the high-stakes debate. Killing a baby after birth is illegal in all 50 states, it pointed out.</p>

<p>The 2024 election was supposed to be a 2020 rematch. But Harris was passed the baton after President Joe Biden opted out of his re-election bid following a dismal debate performance against Trump in July. If she wins the November polls, Harris will become the first woman president of the US.</p>

<p>Trump was initially leading in national polls, but the entry of Harris changed the game. Latest polls suggest the two leaders are neck and neck with the Democrat maintaining a marginal lead over her Republican rival.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US jury has awarded $50 million in damages to a man who spent nearly 10 years in prison after being wrongfully convicted of murder, his lawyers said Tuesday.</p>

<p>A federal jury in Chicago on Monday ruled in favour of Marcel Brown, 34, giving the largest award to a single wrongful-conviction plaintiff in US history, Loevy &amp; Loevy, the law firm representing him said.</p>

<p>Brown was arrested and sentenced to 35 years in prison after he was convicted of being an accomplice in the 2008 murder of a 19-year-old man.</p>

<p>But in 2018 the case against him was dropped and he was released after his lawyers presented evidence that the confession had been obtained from him illegally.</p>

<p>According to Loevy &amp; Loevy, "Chicago police officers locked (Brown) in an interrogation room for more than 30 hours, interrogated him relentlessly, deprived him of food, denied his repeated requests for a phone call, and prevented him from sleeping."</p>

<p>After a two-week trial in Chicago, the jury unanimously agreed with Brown's defence team "that the police coerced his statement and fabricated evidence," the law firm said in its statement.</p>

<p>The jury awarded Brown $10 million in compensatory damages for the time between his arrest and conviction, and $40 million in damages for his time in prison and after.</p>

<p>"Justice was finally served for me and my family today," &nbsp;Brown said outside the court, according to his lawyers.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

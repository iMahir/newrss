       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About 600 people were killed within a few hours by members affiliated with Al-Qaeda in an August attack on the town of Barsalogho in Burkina Faso, a report claimed on Friday. The residents of Barsalogho were shot dead on August 24 as they dug protective trenches.</p>

<p>The attack, in which most of the victims were women and children, was <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/170-people-executed-in-attacks-on-3-villages-in-burkina-faso-report-5167872" target="_blank">one of the worst in the West African country's history</a>, which has been grappling with a jihadist insurgency waged by rebels affiliated with Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group that spilled over from neighbouring Mali in 2015.</p>

<p>The members of Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), an Al-Qaeda affiliate based in Mali and active in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/browns-not-greens-how-an-arid-africa-country-is-reimagining-golf-courses-3876165" target="_blank">Burkina Faso</a>, shot down villagers as they swept into the outskirts of Barsalogho on bikes.</p>

<p>While the United Nations estimated a death count of around 200, JNIM said it had killed nearly 300 "fighters". However, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/04/africa/burkina-faso-massacre-600-dead-french-intel-intl/index.html" rel="nofollow,noindex">CNN</a>, citing a French government security assessment, reported that up to 600 people were shot dead in the attack.</p>

<p>A man, who said he was one of dozens of men told to dig the trenches by the army, told CNN that he was 4 kilometers from the town at about 11 am, in a trench, when he heard the first gunshots.</p>

<p>“I started to crawl into the trench to escape.&nbsp;But it seemed that the attackers were following the trenches. So, I crawled out and came across the first bloodied victim. There was blood everywhere on my way. There was screaming everywhere. I got down on my stomach under a bush, until later in the afternoon, hiding,” he said.</p>

<p>Another survivor, who lost two members of her family in the attack, said JNIM killed people "all day long".</p>

<p>"For three days we were collecting bodies - scattered everywhere. Fear got into our hearts. At the burial time, there are so many bodies lying on the ground that burying was hard," she said.</p>

<p>The military reportedly ordered the locals to dig a vast trench network around the town to protect it from jihadists circulating nearby.</p>

<p>JNIM has warned civilians against endorsing the army in its fight against the insurgency.</p>

<p>According to the ACLED analysis group, which tracks global conflict, members affiliated with Al-Qaeda - which was founded by Osama bin Laden and carried out the 9/11 attacks in the US - and the Islamic State group have killed about 3,800 this year.</p>

<p>Since the start of the conflict in 2015, more than 20,000 people have been killed and over two million displaced in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/burkina-faso-army-announces-overthrow-of-military-government-amid-violence-3393970" target="_blank">Burkina Faso</a>, one of the world's poorest countries situated in the Sahel, a region wracked by instability.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[Israeli airstrikes continued to pound Beirut on Saturday after Iran's supreme leader declared the country's allies won't back down in the war in West Asia that threatens severe global ramifications.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="CetSht_cn">
<ol class="CetSht_ol">
	<li class="CetSht_li">The Israeli army issued fresh evacuation orders in Beirut's southern suburbs last evening, after which a series of loud blasts were heard in the area near the airport.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Hezbollah is also engaged in ongoing clashes with Israeli troops in the Lebanon border area during ground raids. It said in a statement that Israeli soldiers tried to approach the village of Adaysseh when their operatives confronted them.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Three hospitals in Lebanon were forced to suspend work after damages due to Israeli strikes as the Lebanese Prime Minister urged the global community to pressure Israel to allow rescuers to reach bombed sites.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Israel is now fighting both Palestine and Lebanon, which are part of the Iran-backed 'Axis of Resistance' group, in a war that started with the October 7 attack by Hamas and has now widened to a regional conflict.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The Palestinian Hamas group's October 7, 2023 attack, called the 'Al-Aqsa Flood', had targeted Israeli border towns, sparking a fierce West Asia showdown that continues till date. The Lebanese Hezbollah group - also backed by Iran-later entered the war in support of Hamas.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei yesterday said its allies won't back down and defended his country's missile strikes on Israel. In a rare public sermon, he asserted after leading the Friday prayers that Israel would "not last long".</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The Israeli Defence Forces, which has been conducting ground raids inside Lebanon, claimed in their latest update they have eliminated over 2,000 military targets and 250 Hezbollah operatives, including over a dozen commanders.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The Israeli Air Force has also been pounding Beirut and its suburbs with airstrikes over the past few weeks. Former Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah was killed in one such strike a week, dealing a major blow to the Lebanese group.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Iran's missile salvo on Israel on Tuesday marked a massive escalation in the West Asia war as Israel vowed to hit back stronger. It is feared that Israel may target oil and nuclear infrastructure in the country. Fears of oil supply disruptions have already sparked a rise in oil prices.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">US President Joe Biden has advised Israel against striking oil facilities in Iran. But his predecessor Donald Trump, who is contesting November polls to return to the White House, has said that he believes Israel should strike Iran's nuclear facilities in response to the missile barrage.</li>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk's X has paid millions of dollars in fines in Brazil to settle a row with a judge who banned the platform in its biggest Latin American market over disinformation.</p>

<p>But the platform transferred the money into the wrong account, Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who ordered the shutdown of X in August, said Friday (October 4).</p>

<p>X, formerly known as Twitter, racked up $5.2 million in fines for failing to comply with a series of court orders.</p>

<p>Moraes confirmed that the social network had paid the full amount but into a different account from the one on the court order and said it had ordered that the funds be immediately redirected.</p>

<p>Moraes blocked X on August 31 after Musk refused to remove dozens of right-wing accounts accused of spreading disinformation and failed to name a new legal representative in the country as ordered.</p>

<p>X, which had 22 million users in Brazil before Moraes blocked it, hopes that payment of the penalties will settle the dispute.</p>

<p>Last week it said it had complied with the court's other demands, including the appointment of a legal representative in Brazil.</p>

<p>The clash between Musk and Moraes morphed into a high-stakes battle which was closely followed around the globe as a test of both freedom of expression and the fight against disinformation.</p>

<p>A furious Musk hit out at Moraes over the ban calling him an "evil dictator" and dubbing him "Voldemort" after the villain from the "Harry Potter" series.</p>

<p>But in recent days he had been notably more muted on the subject and X has appeared eager to do whatever necessary to have the ban lifted.</p>

<p>The platform had briefly resumed service in Brazil in mid-September after a technical workaround which it claimed was "inadvertent."</p>

<p>But it went back offline again after Moraes threatened it with further fines.</p>

<p>X's fight with Moraes began during Brazil's 2022 presidential election campaign, when Moraes ordered the company to deactivate accounts of followers of failed far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro.</p>

<p>The standoff escalated following attacks by Bolsonaro supporters on federal buildings in Brasilia after the inauguration of Bolsonaro's leftist rival Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva as president in January 2023.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican White House hopeful Donald Trump said Friday he believes Israel should strike Iran's nuclear facilities in response to the Islamic republic's recent missile barrage.</p>

<p>The former president, speaking at a campaign event in North Carolina, referred to a question posed to Democratic President Joe Biden this week about the possibility of Israel targeting Iran's nuclear program.</p>

<p>"They asked him, what do you think about Iran, would you hit Iran? And he goes, 'As long as they don't hit the nuclear stuff.' That's the thing you want to hit, right?" Trump told a town hall style event in Fayetteville, near a major US military base.</p>

<p>Biden was asked on Wednesday whether he would support strikes against Iranian nuclear sites and the US president told reporters: "The answer is no."</p>

<p>"I think he's got that one wrong," Trump said Friday, in response to a participant's question about the issue. "Isn't that what you're supposed to hit? I mean, it's the biggest risk we have, nuclear weapons," he said.</p>

<p>"When they asked him that question, the answer should have been, hit the nuclear first, and worry about the rest later," Trump added.</p>

<p>"If they're going to do it, they're going to do it. But we'll find out whatever their plans are."</p>

<p>Biden on Wednesday expressed his opposition to such strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities, in response to the firing of nearly 200 Iranian missiles towards Israel.</p>

<p>"We'll be discussing with the Israelis what they're going to do," he said, adding that all G7 members agree Israel has "a right to respond, but they should respond in proportion."</p>

<p>Trump, locked in a tooth-and-nail presidential election battle with US Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, has spoken little about the recent escalation in tensions in the Middle East.</p>

<p>He issued a scathing statement this week, holding Biden and Harris responsible for the crisis.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump on Friday promoted a fake endorsement from JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, who has not taken a side in the US presidential election.</p>

<p>Trump posted to his Truth Social platform a photograph of Dimon with the headline: "New: Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, has endorsed Trump for President."</p>

<p>The item, posted by Trump around 1800 GMT, appeared to be a repost of another social media item.</p>

<p>But a JPMorgan spokesman said the longtime bank head has not taken a side in the race.</p>

<p>"That report was false," said JPMorgan spokesman Joe Evangelisti in an email to AFP. "Jamie has not endorsed a candidate."</p>

<p>Trump in August shared doctored images that purported to show superstar singer Taylor Swift supporting his presidential campaign.</p>

<p>But Swift last month delivered a sweeping endorsement to Trump's opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. The doctored images shared by Trump "conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation," she wrote in a September 11 Instagram post.</p>

<p>"The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth," Swift said.</p>

<p>At 1700 GMT, the fake Dimon endorsement was still posted to Trump's page on Truth Social.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US forces on Friday hit 15 targets in Huthi-controlled areas of Yemen, the US military said.</p>

<p>Four provinces were struck, the Iran-backed rebels' Al Masirah television network reported.</p>

<p>The United States and Britain have repeatedly carried out strikes aimed at curbing the Huthis' ability to target shipping, but the rebels' attacks on merchant vessels transiting the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden have persisted.</p>

<p>"US Central Command (CENTCOM) forces conducted strikes on 15 Huthi targets in Iranian-backed Huthi-controlled areas of Yemen today," the military command responsible for US forces in the Middle East said on social media.</p>

<p>"These targets included Huthi offensive military capabilities," CENTCOM said, adding that the strikes were carried out "to protect freedom of navigation and make international waters safer and more secure for US, coalition, and &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; merchant vessels."</p>

<p>Al Masirah -- which said both the United States and Britain struck Yemen on Friday -- had earlier reported four strikes on Sanaa and seven on Hodeida. AFP correspondents heard loud explosions in both cities.</p>

<p>At least one strike each hit Dhamar, south of the capital, and Mukayras, southeast of Sanaa, Al Masirah said.</p>

<p>The Huthis have been hitting shipping since November, saying that attacks, which have disrupted maritime traffic in a globally important waterway, target vessels linked to Israel and are intended to signal solidarity with Palestinians during the Gaza war.</p>

<p>- Huthi attacks on Israel -</p>

<p>Israel has also struck Yemen in response to Huthi attacks. Israeli strikes on Hodeida last month killed at least five people after the rebels said they had targeted Israel's Ben Gurion Airport with a missile.</p>

<p>The US strikes took place a day after the rebels said they carried out a drone attack on Tel Aviv. The Israeli military said it had intercepted "a suspicious aerial target" overnight off central Israel, without giving further details.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the Huthis said they had fired cruise missiles at Israel, following Iran's massive bombardment of the country.</p>

<p>The day before, the Huthis damaged two ships in separate attacks off Yemen's coast.</p>

<p>One ship was hit by a marine drone, puncturing a ballast tank, while a second vessel was damaged by a missile less than three hours later, the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) said.</p>

<p>The Huthis, who have controlled large swaths of war-torn Yemen for a decade, are part of the "axis of resistance" of Iran-linked groups arrayed against Israel and the United States.</p>

<p>The latest strikes came as thousands of people took to the streets of the capital Sanaa to express solidarity with Palestinians and Lebanese amid attacks by Israel.</p>

<p>"The aggression on the capital and Yemeni governorates after the...solidarity marches with Lebanon and Gaza is a desperate attempt to terrorize our people," Huthi official Hashem Sharaf al-Din told Al Masirah.</p>

<p>"Yemen will not be deterred by these attacks and will continue its steadfastness in confronting the enemies with all its strength," he said.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[President Joe Biden on Friday urged Israel against striking Iran's oil facilities, a day after he said the United States was discussing the possibility of such strikes with its ally.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;President Joe Biden said on Friday he would think about alternatives to striking Iranian oil fields if he were in Israel's shoes, adding he thinks Israel has not yet concluded how to respond to Iran.</p>

<p>"The Israelis have not concluded what they are going to do in terms of a strike. That's under discussion," Biden said in remarks to reporters at a White House press briefing.</p>

<p>"If I were in their shoes, I'd be thinking about other alternatives than striking oilfields," the president added.</p>

<p>Tensions between Iran and Israel have been high as Israel has been weighing options to respond to Tehran's ballistic missile attack on Tuesday, which Iran had carried out in response to Israel's military action in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Biden was also asked if he thought that by not engaging in diplomacy, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was trying to influence the Nov. 5 U.S. election in which Republican former President Donald Trump faces Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>"Whether he is trying to influence the election, I don't know but I am not counting on that," Biden said in response. "No administration has done more to help Israel than I have."</p>

<p>The latest bloodshed in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict was triggered by Palestinian Hamas militants' Oct. 7, 2023, attack that killed 1,200 and in which about 250 were taken as hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>

<p>Israel's subsequent assault on Hamas-governed Gaza has killed over 41,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's health ministry, and displaced nearly Gaza's entire population, caused a hunger crisis and led to genocide allegations that Israel denies.</p>

<p>Israel's recent military action in Lebanon has killed hundreds, wounded thousands and displaced over a million. Israel says it is targeting Lebanese Iran-backed Hezbollah militants.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A court trying a French man charged with enlisting dozens of strangers to rape his heavily drugged wife ruled on Friday that the public could be present when video evidence is screened, reversing an earlier decision.</p>

<p>Lawyers for the victim, Gisele Pelicot -- ex-wife of the main accused, Dominique Pelicot -- hailed as a "victory" the ruling announced by judge Roger Arata.</p>

<p>The screening of images will be preceded by an "announcement allowing people of a sensitive disposition and minors to leave the courtroom," the judge added.</p>

<p>Since the trial started on September 2, the court in the southern city of Avignon has been reserved for members of the court, the parties and the press.</p>

<p>The public has been assigned to an adjoining room where proceedings are screened live.</p>

<p>The screening of video evidence will, however, "not be systematic" and will only take place when it is "strictly necessary for exposing the truth" at the request of one of the parties, added Arata.</p>

<p>Dominque Pelicot filmed much of the abuse against his wife and also took meticulous records of the strangers visiting the family home, unwittingly helping police uncover the crimes.</p>

<p>He was intially investigated when he was caught taking pictures up women's skirts in a supermarket in 2020.</p>

<p>Last month the judge banned the broadcast of images in the presence of the public and the press, saying: "Considering that these images are indecent and shocking, this will only be done in the presence of the parties to the trial and the court."</p>

<p>But lawyers for Gisele Pelicot -- who has insisted on the trial being open to the public to draw attention to the use of drugs to commit sexual abuse -- called for the lifting of the restrictions.</p>

<p>- 'Find meaning in suffering' -</p>

<p>The ruling is a "victory" but "a victory in a fight that should not have been fought," said lawyer Stephane Babonneau, arguing that French law has granted rape victims for over 40 years the right to decide whether or not the proceedings should be public.</p>

<p>Gisele Pelicot's willingness to highlight her suffering has won widespread praise and made her a feminist icon in France.</p>

<p>"For Gisele Pelicot, it is too late. The harm is done," said Babonneau.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"But if these same hearings, through their publicity, help prevent other women from having to go through this, then she will find meaning in her suffering.".</p>

<p>The trial, which is due to last until December, is currently hearing testimony from the other men facing charges of responding to Dominique Pelicot's call and raping Gisele Pelicot.</p>

<p>Forty-nine other men are accused of raping or attempting to rape Gisele Pelicot. Another has admitted to sedating his own spouse so that he and Dominique Pelicot could sexually assault her.</p>

<p>Some lawyers for the other 50 accused strongly opposed the screening of video evidence.</p>

<p>"Justice does not need that in order to proceed, what is the point of these revolting screenings?" said lawyer Olivier Lantelme.</p>

<p>"We do not have to move from a popular tribunal in the name of the French people to a tribunal of the crowd," added Paul-Roger Gontard.</p>

<p>But for Antoine Camus, another lawyer in Gisele Pelicot's team, these videos "cause the argument of accidental rape to collapse".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"They show that these were opportunistic rapes and, beyond that, it was a question of degrading, humiliating, and sullying, it was in reality a question of hatred of women.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"No one (among the defendants) denounced what was happening, each contributed in their own small way to this banality of rape, to this banality of evil", he added.</p>

<p>Beatrice Zavarro, Dominique Pelicot's lawyer, who had previously backed the screening of the videos, did not express an opinion on the issue on Friday.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Israel's invasion of Lebanon this week and Iran's missile attack on its regional foe, all while war rages on in Gaza, have heightened the risk of a high-intensity conflict across the Middle East.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's invasion of Lebanon this week and Iran's missile attack on its regional foe, all while war rages on in Gaza, have heightened the risk of a high-intensity conflict across the Middle East.</p>

<p>The spiralling violence now threatens to engulf more and more of the region despite diplomatic efforts to calm tensions, with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warning of a "sickening cycle of escalation after escalation".</p>

<p>AFP spoke to analysts to assess what could happen next:</p>

<p><strong>- Will Israel retaliate? -</strong></p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu swiftly condemned the launch of some 200 missiles at his country on Tuesday, declaring: "Iran made a big mistake tonight and will pay for it."</p>

<p>David Khalfa, a Middle East expert at the Jean-Jaures Foundation, a Paris-based think-tank, said Israel has little choice but to respond to the Iranian attack "because of the scale and the fact that the nature of the targets has changed" to include sensitive military sites.</p>

<p>It was the second time Iran directly attacked Israel. In April, a barrage of around 300 drones and missiles triggered a measured Israeli retaliation that saw a single Iranian air defence radar installation destroyed.</p>

<p>The response this time is expected to be of far greater magnitude, according to analysts.</p>

<p>With many Israelis celebrating the Jewish New Year this week, the holidays may "not be a good time to retaliate", said Danny Citrinowicz, an Iran specialist at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) in Tel Aviv.</p>

<p>"But I don't think it will take much time," he said.</p>

<p><strong>- What are Israel's options? -</strong></p>

<p>Since the Iranian attack, Israeli officials have argued there was a potential "historic opportunity to decisively deal with the Iranian regime", according to Khalfa.</p>

<p>Former prime minister, Naftali Bennett, was one of the first to call for an attack on Iranian nuclear facilities, which Israel regards as an existential threat.</p>

<p>But the most sensitive equipment is believed to be buried deep underground where Israel may be unable to hit.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden has advised against even trying, urging Israel to respond "in proportion" -- although Netanyahu has often ignored his guidance in the past.</p>

<p>Other possible Israeli responses include targeted assassinations, strikes on Iranian industrial sites or cyberattacks, according to experts and Israeli media reports.</p>

<p>Biden has also mentioned ongoing discussions about potential strikes on Iranian oil infrastructure, which sent prices for crude spiking on Thursday.</p>

<p>Khalfa said that after decades of tension, Israel and Iran are now "no longer in a low-intensity confrontation but an open war", which could evolve into a "regional war of attrition".</p>

<p><strong>- Do Iran and Israel want war? -&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Iran has "already thought things through, to some extent at least. They are ready," said Citrinowicz, suggesting that Tehran's response to any Israeli retaliation would be "swift".</p>

<p>Sima Shine, another Iran expert at the INSS, said that the Islamic republic possessed "undeniable" destructive capabilities.</p>

<p>"They can launch more than 200, or even 300 missiles, and they also have drones," she said, while also warning about "terrorist operations abroad" that could include attacks on Israeli diplomatic missions or Jewish community centres.</p>

<p>"Everything right now hinges on Israel's response, whether it escalates into a regional war," said Sina Toossi, a senior fellow at the Center for International Policy in Washington.</p>

<p>Both Netanyahu and Iran were "taking huge gambles", he said.</p>

<p>And with each escalation, the risks increase.</p>

<p>However, both Iran and Israel have repeatedly insisted that they do not want to be drawn into a spiral of retaliatory violence.</p>

<p>Israel is already engaged on several military fronts.</p>

<p>In the Gaza Strip, the military is fighting Hamas, aiming to rescue the 97 hostages taken on October 7 who are still held there.</p>

<p>In Lebanon, after days of air strikes against Hezbollah, troops are now battling the Iran-backed militants on the ground.</p>

<p>And elsewhere in the region, Israel confronts armed groups like Yemen's Huthi rebels who have increased their missile and drone attacks.</p>

<p>Ultimately, Citrinowicz said, both Iran and Israel "will look for a political solution" that may be supported by the United States and France, whose influence particularly in Lebanon could play a critical role in restoring calm.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alphabet's Google is testing showing check marks next to certain companies on its search results, a company spokesperson said on Friday, in a move aimed at helping users identify verified sources and steer clear of fake websites.</p>

<p>Fraudulent websites impersonating official businesses or services could creep up in online search results, leading users to view false information about the business, deceiving users and potentially harming the brand.</p>

<p>"We regularly experiment with features that help shoppers identify trustworthy businesses online, and we are currently running a small experiment showing checkmarks next to certain businesses on Google," the spokesperson said.</p>

<p>Google already uses automated systems to identify pages with "scammy" or fraudulent content and prevent them from showing up in the search results.</p>

<p>The Verge reported the development earlier on Friday, adding that it spotted blue verified checkmarks next to official site links for companies including Microsoft, Meta and Apple on search results.</p>

<p>Only some users were able to see the feature, the Verge said, indicating Google has not rolled out the test widely yet.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli army on Friday said a drone launched "from the east" killed two soldiers, with a public broadcaster reporting the strike originated from Iraq and hit a base in the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights.</p>

<p>The military said the two soldiers died in northern Israel. When asked by AFP for details it said the soldiers were killed in a drone strike launched from the east, without specifying from where.</p>

<p>Israeli army radio said the strike was launched from Iraq overnight Thursday.</p>

<p>Two UAVs were launched from Iraq and crossed into Israeli territory in the Golan Heights area, the radio said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"One UAV was intercepted by the air force, while the second exploded at a military camp north of the Golan Heights," it said.</p>

<p>"As a result of the explosion two soldiers were killed," it said, adding 24 others were wounded.</p>

<p>Public broadcaster Kan also reported the strike originated from Iraq and hit the Golan Heights.</p>

<p>The Islamic Resistance in Iraq group, which is pro-Iran, said it launched a series of drone strikes targeting Israel this week, including three attacks on three different targets in the Golan and Tiberias early Friday.</p>

<p>The Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, triggered by the Palestinian group's October 7 attack on Israel, has also drawn in Iran-backed militants in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli couple Leron and Zoli Mor have identical tattoos on their arms showing a procession of eight elephants, their tails and trunks intertwined.</p>

<p>The first two are the parents and the six smaller ones behind them are the calves. The last three are even smaller than the rest and are depicted in fresher ink because they were added later.</p>

<p>The eight elephants represent the Mor family. Leron and Zoli Mor have three children of their own and have adopted three others whose parents - one of them Leron's sister - were killed in the attack by Hamas gunmen on Israel on Oct. 7 last year.</p>

<p>"They were five," Leron Mor said at the family's new home in the northern Israeli village of Bnei Dror, pointing to that tattoo on her arm. "And they were joined by three more."</p>

<p>One of the three who were adopted, Avigail Idan, was among more than 250 people taken hostage during the attack led by the Palestinian militant group. She was released last November though about 100 people are still in captivity as the Israel-Hamas war triggered by the attack rages on.</p>

<p>She was aged three at the time of the attack, in which her parents were among 1,200 people killed. Her older siblings, Michael and Amalia, hid in a cabinet at their home in a kibbutz, their mother lying lifeless on the floor nearby.</p>

<p>The Mors were also living in the kibbutz in southern Israel at the time and were rescued from their home the day after the attack. They now live far away in Bnei Dror, an agricultural village near the Mediterranean coast.</p>

<p>"The conversation here in the house is very open. We talk about their parents. We do not forget about them for one moment," said Leron Mor. "We look at pictures together. And they are present in our lives."</p>

<p>Avigail also has U.S. citizenship, and she and the family met U.S. President Joe Biden at the White House in April.</p>

<p>"He was simply compassionate and warm and caring," Leron Mor said. "We spoke to him about the people, our friends, who are still there and all the hostages. We asked him to make every effort to get them out because that's the only important thing right now. There is nothing more important than that."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Army is testing robot dogs mounted with AI-enabled guns at a military facility in the Middle East, according to <em>Military.com</em>. Photos shared by the Defense Visual Information Distribution Service (DVIDS) show one such robot dog undergoing "rehearsals" at the Red Sands Integrated Experimentation Center in Saudi Arabia in mid-September as part of a recent counter-unmanned aerial system exercise. The four-legged robot can be seen mounted with what appears to be an AR-15/M16 pattern rifle on a rotating turret and resembles the robot system that the US Army tested at Fort Drum, New York in August.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The US Army describes the robot dog as a four-legged unmanned ground vehicle (UGVs) armed with an artificial intelligence-enabled rifle - contributing to innovative unmanned capabilities. Notably, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.dvidshub.net/image/8663734/centcom-and-saudi-arabian-armed-forces-conduct-third-iteration-red-sands-counter-s-uas-exercise">DVIDS </a>is an operation run by the US Department of Defence to provide media on its activities across the world.</p>

<p>Speaking to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/10/01/army-has-sent-armed-robot-dog-middle-east-testing.html" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>Military.com</em></a>, a US Army Central spokesman said that the armed robot dog was one of several "non-counter-sUAS" systems tested alongside 15 counter-drone platforms at Red Sands during the September test. The gun engaged several static ground targets, the official said without elaborating on its potential applications.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the US Defence Department has been incorporating robot dogs and other autonomous ground vehicles in its formations over the last few years. Additionally, the Pentagon has increasingly experimented with mounting weapons systems on robot dogs.&nbsp;</p>

Here's What Happened</a></strong></p>

<p>The Marine Corps, in particular, has tested quadrupedal robots outfitted with both Onyx Industries' SENTRY remote weapon system and the M72 LAW anti-tank rocket launcher, while the Army has considered outfitting mechanized canines with the new 6.8mm XM7 rifle the service recently fielded under its Next Generation Squad Weapon program to replace the M4 carbine, the outlet reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, the US military isn't the only country pursuing four-legged weapon combat robots. In May, the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/chinese-military-unveils-rifle-mounted-robot-dog-5764449">Chinese military</a> debuted its own robot dog armed with an assault rifle during a training exercise in Cambodia.

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Travel tech platform EaseMyTrip - which suspended flight bookings to Maldives in January after a diplomatic row with India - on Friday said it has resumed bookings to the island nation after "improved bilateral ties" between both governments.</p>

<p>In June, EaseMyTrip CEO Nishant Pitti responded to the controversy around the resumption of flight bookings to Maldives through the platform, admitting that "some bookings did occur" between May 16-26 but the company acted swiftly and removed them.</p>

<p>The response came after Kerala Congress questioned EaseMyTrip on social media platform X, highlighting the company's earlier decision to remove Maldives from its platform as a show of support for Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p>

<p>In a statement on Friday, EaseMyTrip co-founder and CEO Pitti said, "Basis positive developments in mending India-Maldives bilateral ties, by both governments, we are resuming bookings to the Maldives. This decision comes after careful consideration and follows a constructive dialogue with the Ministry of Tourism of Maldives delegation during their recent visit to India and our office".</p>

<p>"Being a nation-first company we are always in alignment with our government and support their vision. It is a progressive step towards the renewed friendship and mutual goals of enhancing tourism."&nbsp;</p>

<p>EaseMyTrip had initially halted bookings to Maldives in January after three Maldivian ministers made derogatory comments about Prime Minister Modi following his visit to Lakshadweep.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Spanish Air Force pilot died when an F18 fighter plane crashed Friday in eastern Spain, officials said.</p>

<p>The pilot was the only person on the jet when it crashed at around 12:30 pm (1030 GMT) near Peralejos in the province of Teruel, the Air Force said on social network X.</p>

<p>"We regret to inform you that the death of our colleague, Lieutenant Colonel Pablo Estrada Martin, assigned to Wing 12, has been confirmed in the F-18 accident. We share in the grief of his family and friends. Rest in peace, comrade," the Spanish Air Force said in a post.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A father in Malaysia set his son's motorbike ablaze in a desperate attempt to protect him from potentially deadly accidents. According to the <em>South China Morning Post</em>, the father, whose identity has been revealed, initially bought the motorcycle for his son because he thought it would be more convenient for him to ride it to school. However, after discovering that his son had become dangerously addicted to riding the motorcycle, the father made the drastic decision to burn the two-wheeler, believing it was a better fate than his son dying in an accident.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The father discovered that his son, whose age has not been disclosed, began participating in illegal motorbike races, often returning home late at night, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/article/3280310/malaysia-dad-sets-sons-motorbike-fire-driven-concern-his-safety-late-night-races" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>SCMP </em></a>reported. This reckless behaviour raised serious safety concerns for the father, who repeatedly attempted to dissuade his son from engaging in such perilous activities. But his advice fell on deaf ears, leaving him feeling increasingly helpless and desperate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Therefore, faced with the possibility of his son sustaining injuries or worse, the father took the drastic decision of destroying the motorcycle. "I don't want to lose my son forever," the father said in a TikTok video of himself burning the two-wheeler. "I also do not want to receive a call from police officers that my son has been detained for racing the motorcycle," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The father stated that the motorcycle had become the primary source of conflict between him and his son so he felt he had no choice but to destroy it. He defended his action as a desperate measure for his son's well-being. "I did this for the sake of my child. Burning the motorbike is the best medicine for my son before I lose him. With this motorbike, my son is a monster," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The outlet did not disclose the son's reaction to his father burning his vehicle. However, on social media, the incident has sparked discussion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I agree with this father. He did it out of genuine concern for his son's safety. He saved his son's life, and after all, a life cannot be bought with money," wrote one person, per SCMP. &nbsp;"I hope the son can understand his father's love," said another.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, some social media users did see the positive side of the father's action.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"His method is violent. You should treat your kid as a friend, not an enemy. You should discuss it with your child. Your behaviour has not solved the problem and will only worsen the relationship between you and your son," commented one user.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Why not sell it? You could make some money from the sale," said another.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>S Jaishankar will visit Pakistan later this month to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, becoming the first External Affairs Minister to do so in nine years. The last visit was by Sushma Swaraj in 2015.&nbsp;</p>

<p>External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said on Friday that Mr Jaishankar will lead a delegation to Pakistan to attend a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Council of Heads of Government meeting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The External Affairs Minister will lead our delegation to Pakistan to participate in the SCO summit which will be held in Islamabad on October 15 and 16," Mr Jaiswal said, emphasising that the visit will be limited to attending the summit. Pakistan had invited Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the meeting in August.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The decision to send Mr Jaishankar to Pakistan for the summit is being seen as a major one by the Union government given the chill in ties between the two countries since the Pulwama terrorist attack in February 2019, which was followed by the Balakot air strikes, in which India targeted a Jaish-e-Mohammed training camp. The relationship got even more strained after Pakistan vociferously opposed India's removal of Article 370, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir.&nbsp;</p>

<p>India has repeatedly slammed Pakistan's interference on the issue and reiterated that it is an internal matter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Addressing the United Nations General Assembly last week, Mr Jaishankar had warned Pakistan that its policy of cross-border terrorism could never succeed and also alluded to its economic crisis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Many countries get left behind due to circumstances beyond their control. But some make conscious choices with disastrous consequences. A premier example is our neighbour, Pakistan. Unfortunately, their misdeeds affect others as well, especially the neighbourhood," the minister said.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Display Of Commitment</strong></p>

<p>Given all of this, the fact that Mr Jaishankar will attend the summit in the country is being seen as a display of India's commitment to the SCO which, it believes, has been playing a vital role in boosting regional security cooperation. Sushma Swaraj had visited Pakistan in 2015 to attend a conference on Afghanistan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Apart from India, the SCO has China, Russia, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan as member countries and is an influential economic and security bloc as well as one of the largest transregional international organisations.</p>

<p>The SCO was founded at a summit in Shanghai in 2001 by the presidents of Russia, China, the Kyrgyz Republic, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan and India was an observer country for the first time in 2005. It became a permanent member, along with Pakistan, in 2017.&nbsp;</p>

<p>India was the chair of the organisation in 2023 and hosted the SCO summit in the virtual format in July of that year.</p>

<p>The SCO Council of Heads of Government conclave, which Mr Jaishankar will be attending, is the second-highest platform in the grouping while the Heads of State Summit is the top-most forum and is generally attended by the Prime Minister.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Boeing Starliner lifted off the International Space Station in June with NASA's veteran astronauts, Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore, the mission was intended to last for eight days but a technical failure delayed the astronauts' return, extending the mission by eight more months.</p>

<p>The Boeing Starliner capsule faced propulsion issues including a Helium leak which resulted in aborting the return. The spacecraft's service module reported several tiny helium leaks making it unsafe for travel. <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/explained-why-helium-leaks-delayed-boeing-starliner-astronauts-return-6509846">Helium </a>is essential to preserving the spacecraft's structural integrity and manoeuvrability. Along with Helium leaks, the spacecraft detected problems in its thrusters and valves.</p>

<p>The mission aimed to demonstrate the Boeing Starliner's capability to take humans to the ISS. Boeing needed to tap into the space Elon Musk's SpaceX has entered to provide crew transportation services to NASA.</p>

<p>Transporting Ms Williams and Mr Bilmore was Starliner's first crewed flight.</p>

<h2><b>SpaceX To The Rescue</b></h2>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/space-x-to-bring-back-sunita-williams-on-way-to-international-space-station-6676224">The NASA-SpaceX spacecraft, carrying Crew-9</a> members NASA astronaut Nick Hague (commander) and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov (mission specialist), docked at the International Space Station (ISS) last month to bring back Ms Williams and Mr Wilmore.</p>

<p>The Crew-9 members will have two empty seats for NASA astronauts Barry Wilmore and Sunita Williams will fill when the spacecraft returns next year.</p>

<p>The astronauts will now return home in February next year.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the Starliner returned to Earth after weeks of extensive testing but without the crew. The return of Starliner delayed the launch of Crew-9 from mid-August to September since NASA wanted more time to evaluate the reliability of the Starliner.</p>

<p>Hague and Gorbunov will stay in space for five months before coming back home.</p>

<h2><b>Surviving In Space</b></h2>

<p>The extended stay of Williams and Bilmore raised concerns about their survival, particularly regarding food and oxygen supply.</p>

<p>NASA assured that there is no immediate danger to the astronauts and the ISS has sufficient provisions to support the crew for the additional time.</p>

<p>"The space station is well-stocked with everything the crew needs, including food, water, clothing and oxygen," NASA stated. The agency stressed that regular resupply missions will ensure the astronauts' needs are met, citing regular arrivals of cargo spacecraft carrying food, fuel and supplies.</p>

<p>The space station revealed that two spacecraft - one carrying "8,200 pounds of food, fuel, supplies" and another carrying "three tons of cargo" - arrived at the ISS recently.</p>

<p>Living in space for an extended period requires unique arrangements. On the ISS, astronauts can sleep anywhere - floor, ceiling or walls - thanks to zero gravity. They use sleeping stations, similar to phone booths, with sleeping bags and pillows attached to the floor, wall, or ceiling. Astronauts can also make video calls, audio calls or send emails through NASA.</p>

<p>Aboard the ISS, Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore also have access to the Vegetable Production System (Veggie garden) which allows them to grow fresh produce and even flowers in space. During their extended stay, the duo has been experimenting with various techniques to improve crop growth in space.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi today spoke about India's rise globally at the NDTV World Summit. He spoke about why the 21st Century is 'The India Century' and how the country is growing rapidly and how investors from around the world are excited about India being the fastest growing major economy.</p>

<p>Launching NDTV World, PM Modi spoke about the pace and momentum with which India is growing. The prime minister said, "Looking at India's rapid growth, several global ratings agencies have upgraded India's growth forecast." He went on to say that "Investors from around the world are keenly tracking India's growth and are excited about investing in the rapidly growing market."</p>

<p>Mentioning global investor Mark Mobius, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that he "advises global fund managers that they should invest at least 50 per cent of their funds in the Indian stock market." He said that this shows how closely investors liek him are following the India growth story.</p>

<p>"Today, India is a nation that is developing at a record pace as well as an emerging global power," PM Modi said, adding that "India knows how to move towards eradicating poverty while also knowing how to build a road to progress."</p>

<p>In the last ten years, India's stock market has gone from 22,300 to over 81,000, while India's economy took 63 years, from Independence to 2010, to reach a GDP of $1 trillion, it took just seven years to reached $2 trillion - in 2017, and by 2020 it reached $3 trillion. India has gone from being the 11th largest economy to now being the 5th largest economy in the world in less than 10 years.</p>

<p>"I meet many people who tell me, 'India is now the fifth largest economy in the world, so many milestones have been achieved, reforms implemented, then why are you working so hard?' In the last 10 years, 12 crore toilets have been built, and 16 crore homes have gas connections... is this enough? My answer is no. This is not enough. Today India is among the youngest countries in the world. This youth potential can take us to the skies," the Prime Minister said.</p>

<p>"The dreams we have seen, the pledge we have made, there is no rest, no relaxation," he added.</p>

<p>PM Modi also said that when India grows, the world grows. There is no negativity around India's growth story. That, he said, is because India has friendly ties with almost all nations in the world.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Victory in the April-June general election was a "message of stability" and victory in this month's Haryana Assembly election - have reinforced that sentiment, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Monday at the NDTV World Summit. "Stability, sustainability, and solutions... these are the most important conditions for a better future of humanity," he said.</p>

<p>Delivering the inaugural speech, Mr Modi underlined the importance of the 21st century and the many challenges facing the world, and said stable governance - in India and abroad - is needed to encourage growth and to address common concerns like climate change and global warming.</p>

<p>"This period is the most important in the 21st century. We need stability... and sustenance for growth... and India is working on it," he said, "Our third term gives this message of stability."</p>

<p>Expanding on the common concerns and India's possible contribution to solution, the Prime Minister said, "Climate change is a problem and we are trying take the lead in that fight..."</p>

<p>Acknowledging India's contribution in this fight as "insignificant" for now, Mr Modi said his government is "working on reducing carbon emissions and (other) solutions", such as the India - West Asia global corridor to improve trade and connectivity and a global solar alliance.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister also spoke extensively about India being a "beacon of hope" amid global crises over economic growth, unemployment, and public health that have been caused by the coronavirus and military tension in Ukraine and West Asia.</p>

<p>"During the coronavirus pandemic people were stressed about dealing with the virus. When that was controlled then people were worried about the economy... then climate change, the wars (in Ukraine and West Asia), global supply chains (for industries) ... these have become global worries."</p>

<p>"There are the challenges in front of India, but we feel a sense of positivity and that is why are here today - to discuss the 'India century'," the Prime Minister said.</p>

<p>Mr Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party had won the Lok Sabha election - boosted by 53 seats from its allies that helped it cross the finish line - and then, on October 8, defeated the Congress in Haryana, despite trailing in early rounds of counting.</p>

<p>In both cases the BJP recorded a hat-trick - Mr Modi became a three-time Prime Minister and the saffron party became the first to win the Haryana Assembly election three times in a row.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former UK Prime Minister David Cameron, speaking at the NDTV World Summit today, said that India can play a key role in scaling down the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"India has the credibility to be a mediator in the Ukraine war," Mr Cameron said at the NDTV World Summit.</p>

<p>More than two and a half years into the war, the Russia-Ukraine conflict has shown no signs of any breakthrough in ceasefire talks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"India might be in a position to mediate but it has to ensure that Russian President Vladimir Putin cannot be allowed to take territory by force," Mr Cameron added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>President Putin on Friday said it is difficult to specify a timeline for ending the prolonged war in Ukraine but claimed that his country will win, as he appreciated Prime Minister Narendra Modi's concern over the situation.</p>

<p>Both Russia and Ukraine have denied targeting civilians in the 2-1/2-year war that Russia launched against its smaller neighbour with a full-scale invasion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Days ahead of the 16th BRICS Summit to be hosted by Moscow, President Putin endorsed PM Modi's description of the grouping, saying the Indian leader had "aptly" noted that it is "not an anti-western one but a non-western one".</p>

<p>He also made it clear the grouping, which has since been expanded from five initial members to include five more countries, should not be seen as a "bloc-style organisation".</p>

<p>PM Modi is due to visit Kazan to attend the BRICS summit on October 22-23.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world needs India's perspective on the challenges it faces and the country should get a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, former UK prime minister David Cameron has said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speaking at the NDTV World Summit on Monday, Lord David Cameron said the world needs strong economic growth, more democracy and a green transition to deal with climate change and India is a shining example of all of those things.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Cameron's session at the Summit was after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's keynote speech and the former UK prime minister began by commenting on that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It was great to hear PM Modi's speech. To have that energy level at the start of your third term is truly impressive... I made it into a second term (as UK prime minister) but since then we have had quite a number of prime ministers. We have not had anyone having three terms since Tony Blair and Margaret Thatcher before him. It's very impressive because it means you have the ability to get real change, real things done in a very consistent way, which is what we are seeing in India," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the India Century, Mr Cameron said there is a need for a reset because the world has changed "hugely" since the institutions were set up after the Second World War.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"You see the rise of India, which will probably become the world's largest economy at some stage in this century. So, obviously, we need a reset and countries like India should be at its heart," he said.&nbsp;<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump made an appearance at Sunday night's NFL game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and New York Jets at Acrisure Stadium.</p>

<p>The former US president was spotted in the luxury box, waving to fans and soaking in the atmosphere as chants of “USA” rang out across the stadium.</p>

<p>Fresh off a campaign stop in Pennsylvania that included a stint <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-turns-chef-at-mcdonalds-ahead-of-us-presidential-elections-2024-says-worked-more-than-kamala-harris-6835696 ">working at a local McDonald's</a>, Donald Trump's presence at the game capped a busy weekend of election rallies in the swing state.<br />
<br />
Earlier in the day, Trump was joined by two controversial ex-Steelers, Antonio Brown and Le'Veon Bell, who endorsed the GOP candidate. Before kickoff, Brown and Bell distributed Trump-Vance rally towels outside the stadium and encouraged people to register to vote. The two former football stars have a complicated history with the Steelers, having left the team under tense circumstances in 2019.<br />
<br />
Antonio Brown, in particular, is remembered for his tumultuous exit from the Steelers after a series of public incidents. His behaviour has since alienated him from the NFL, though he did win a Super Bowl with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers before being let go.<br />
<br />
Before the lead-up to Sunday's game, Donald Trump shared an AI-generated image of himself in a Steelers jersey on his social media account. The altered photo was posted ahead of the Week 7 matchup.</p>

<p>When he arrived at the game, Donald Trump was greeted by supporters outside the stadium, including fans sporting Pittsburgh jerseys and holding a banner that read “Trump Nation.” The energy in the stands was palpable when a female fan ran onto the field in the third quarter, carrying a pro-Trump sign before being escorted off by security.<br />

The Steelers organisation remained neutral regarding Trump's attendance, with a spokesperson confirming that the former president was invited by a private suite holder and not the team itself.&nbsp;<br />

Meanwhile, other Steelers icons, including Hall of Famers Joe Greene and Jerome Bettis, have endorsed Democratic nominee Kamala Harris ahead of the November 5 presidential elections.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA["Digital Innovation, Democratic Values Can Co-Exist": PM Modi At NDTV World Summit]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India showed the world that digital innovation and democratic values can co-exist, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in his keynote address at the NDTV World Summit today.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister said India's Digital Public Infrastructure is a key talking point at global summits. "Paul Romer (Nobel laureate and former Chief Economist of the World Bank) is here. We have had many discussions. Paul has praised India's digital infrastructure, including Aadhaar and DigiLocker. In world summits, people are surprised at how India developed such a digital public infrastructure."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Prime Minister said India did not have the first-mover advantage during the Internet era. "In the countries that had this advantage, private companies led the digital push. A revolution came, but its benefit was limited. India gave a new model to the world. India democratised technology and showed the world the way to digital public infrastructure," the Prime Minister said.</p>

<p>In India, he said, the government creates a platform and it undergoes several rounds of innovations. "Jandhan, Aadhaar and mobile connectivity have become a seamless system of fast and leakage-free service delivery. "Look at UPI, it has led to an expansion of fintech in India. More than 500 million digital transactions are happening through UPI daily. And this is not driven by big corporates, but by small shopowners and street vendors."</p>

<p>Mentioning the government's PM Gati Shakti and ONDC initiatives, the Prime Minister said, "India has shown digital innovation and democratic values can co-exist. India has shown that technology is a tool for inclusion, transparency and empowerment, not for control and division."</p>

<p>This is the most important time in the 21st century, he said. "We need stability and sustenance for growth and India is working on it. This is the first time in six decades that the people of India have given a government a mandate for the third term. This is a message of stability.</p>

<p>"Climate change is now a global problem and India is trying to take a lead in this fight too. Our contribution is negligible in global climate change, but we have made green transmission the fuel for growth," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kirat Assi, a London resident and radio presenter, thought she was finally going to meet the man she'd fallen in love with. They had texted each other for nine years. However, when the two came face-to-face, Ms Assi found someone she never expected. In a shocking twist, her entire relationship had been an elaborate catfishing scheme, orchestrated not by a stranger but by someone much closer — a female cousin, Simran. Now, Netflix has released a documentary, <em>Sweet Bobby: My Catfish Nightmare,</em> retelling this story of betrayal.</p>

<p>It all began in 2009 when Ms Assi&nbsp;got a friend request from ‘Bobby,' a supposed cardiologist from west London. Soon, it evolved into a long-distance relationship. The two shared connections within their Sikh community, which made the relationship seem genuine.</p>

<p>Over time, their online conversations deepened, but as years passed, their connection remained virtual, with Bobby continually giving bizarre reasons for why they couldn't meet in person. The excuses were nothing short of dramatic — claims of being shot, suffering a stroke and even entering witness protection — according to a report in <a href="http://https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20m3g1kdpvo">BBC</a>. However, what made these lies convincing to Ms Assi&nbsp;were the people she believed were corroborating his stories. They were always someone close to Bobby, or that's what she thought.</p>

<p>After nine years of emotional manipulation, Ms Assi&nbsp;finally confronted the truth — this entire thing was a hoax, and the man she thought she was in love with didn't even exist. She had been a victim of a catfishing scheme and the person behind the messages wasn't Bobby but her female cousin, Simran.</p>

<p>According to an article in Birmingham Live, throughout the ordeal, Ms Assi, in fact, leaned on Simran for support. However, one day, Simran dropped the bombshell, revealing to a devastated Ms Assi&nbsp;that she hadn't been communicating with Bobby all along — she had been speaking to Simran herself.</p>

<p>The discovery left Ms Assi&nbsp;devastated and questioning her judgement. “How could you have been so stupid?” she reflects now, according to a&nbsp;<a href="http://https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20m3g1kdpvo">BBC</a> report.</p>

<p>Kirat Assi's experience was first shared in a popular 2021 podcast by Tortoise, but the story has since gained renewed attention with the release of the Netflix documentary, Sweet Bobby: My Catfish Nightmare.</p>

<p>Ms Assi says she has faced criticism and questions, with many asking how she could fall for such a scheme. “For people who might still think I'm stupid, that's fine, you're allowed your opinion,” she told BBC Asian Network News, adding, “I'm not stupid, I'm not dumb. I'm the one that's chosen to speak. I'm the one that's put myself out in the firing line and I hope others will come forward.”</p>

<p>Ms Assi feels it was important to publicly tell her story, especially given the stigmas surrounding such issues in the South Asian community in the UK. Explaining how the fear of judgement often silences victims, she said, “We are so scared to open up about these issues. Because of how a community will be seen by wider society, the victims in our communities keep suffering.”</p>

<p>This reluctance to address uncomfortable topics was evident even in her own family. Speaking of her father's experience with the situation, Kirat Assi said, “He doesn't want to know what happened. Because to face up to what happened, and how horrific it was, it's going to be painful.”</p>

<p>Despite the traumatic experience, Kirat Assi remains open to having conversations about her experience, encouraging people to approach her if they have questions.</p>

<p>Simran, however, has not faced criminal charges for the catfishing, but Ms Assi took civil action against her, resulting in compensation and an apology. In the Netflix documentary, a statement from Simran was included where she said she views the situation as a “private matter,” rejecting the accusations made against her.</p>

<p>Although Kirat Assi has sought closure, she says the motivation behind Simran's deceit remains a mystery. “I think I've long given up. The extent to which that person went, you can't ever justify it. I can't understand why you didn't stop,” Ms Assi&nbsp;said.</p>

<p>Despite this, she is determined to move forward, rebuilding her life and even starting to date again. “I'm going to carry on working towards goals and dreams,” she said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Prime Minister Narendra Modi, speaking at the NDTV World Summit, said India is a "ray of hope" for the world amid several global crises such as declining economies, unemployment and climate change, among others.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol class="CetSht_ol">
	<li class="CetSht_li">If we look at the discussions in the last four or five years, one thing is common: tension about the future. During the coronavirus pandemic, there was stress over economy, unemployment, and health, among other issues.&nbsp;</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">In India, we are discussing the 'India Century'. India is the ray of hope amid global crisis. India giving hope to the world engulfed in various concerns, it is working on unprecedented scale and speed in every field.&nbsp;</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">There are challenges in front of India but we are feeling a sense of positivity here and that is why we are discussing the 'India Century'. India's speed and scale are unprecedented.&nbsp;</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">We have completed 125 days of our term. Around 3 crore new homes for the poor were built, infra projects worth Rs 9 lakh crore infrastructure projects have started, 15 new Vande Bharat trains are running, 8 new airports are in operation, Rs 2 lakh crore package for youth have announced, 5 lakh health insurance for those above 70 - all of these things happened in just 125 days.&nbsp;</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">Several agencies have revised upward India's growth forecast due to speed of work in our third term. In 125 days, we have approved 12 new industrial dots. BSE Indices have grown by 7 per cent.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">India's list of achievements is long and I am just discussing the first 125 days of our third term. The world has come to India to discuss various issues in the first 125 days. This shows India's vision and hope and these issues will decide the future of the world.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">A lot is happening in India. India has picked up the pace of growth in our third term. Our government is taking quick decisions and making reforms. I meet a lot of people in my public life who ask, "Why are you working so hard? India is doing well." But my answer is always, "With the dreams and goals that we have, we can't be at rest."</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">In the last ten years, 12 crore toilets have been built, and 16 crore homes have gas connections. Is it enough? My answer is no. This is not enough. India is a country with a young population and we have to do a lot for the country. There has been a change in India's vision.&nbsp;</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">There's a tradition that every government compares its work with the previous one. We used to walk this path but from now on we can't compare the past and present and be happy with it.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">The metric of success from now on would be 'What we want to achieve' - India has a forward-looking approach. A vision for a developed India by 2047 is a part of the mindset.</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">
	<p>140 Crore people are driving the 'Viksit Bharat' vision. When the government started working on the idea, lakhs of people gave their suggestions, and based on that, India made its goals for the next 25 years.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">
	<p>This is the era of artificial intelligence (AI) and the future of the world is linked with AI. For the world, AI is artificial intelligence but for India, it is Aspirational India. India has started the AI mission this year. We are increasing the use of AI in every sector.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">
	<p>We are making decisions after considering everyone's aspirations. It is important to connect aspirations in India. We have focused on air travel and started the UDAAN scheme. We worked on two pillars - building airports in tier 2 and 3 cities and making air travel affordable. Over 3 lakh flights have taken off under the UDAAN scheme. Many flights connect the small cities. Now there are over 150 airports in India.&nbsp;</p>

	<p>In the last 8-9 years, the participation of Indian universities has increased. Patent applications are at an all-time high. Over 2,500 research centres of companies across the world are located in India. We are taking the lead in giving a vision for the global future.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">
	<p>During Covid, we could have earned millions of dollars by selling drugs, but we did not do that. It is not a part of our tradition. We chose to help the countries and supplied medicines and vaccines to nations, which helped many. We don't make "taken-for-granted" relations with nations.</p>
	</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">
	<p>The world celebrated the Chandrayaan mission. When India grows, the world feels happy. India's growth will benefit the world. India drove the world's growth in the past but during colonialism, we could not. Now, we are independent and are ready to drive the growth.</p>

	<li class="CetSht_li">
	<p>I met Paul Romer several times. He has appreciated India's digital infrastructure. The world is amazed to see India's DPI. We didn't have the first-mover advantage. We have democratised tech and given DPI a new path. India has shown the world that digital innovation and democracy can coexist.</p>
	</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">
	<p>This period is the most important in the 21st century. We need stability, and sustenance for growth and India is working on it. Our third term gives a message of stability.&nbsp;</p>

	<li class="CetSht_li">
	<p>Climate change is a problem in the world and we are trying to take a lead in that. In the world's fight against global warming, our contribution is insignificant but we are working on reducing carbon emissions and green energy. We are also working on solutions.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li class="CetSht_li">
	<p>Like the India-Middle East global corridor, mission millets, and global solar alliance. Initiatives taken by India are a solution to problems. We would aim to ensure that India's century is the world's century.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the era of Artificial Intelligence, India is powered by another AI&nbsp;— Aspirational India&nbsp;— which accelerates the country's growth, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Monday at the NDTV World Summit.</p>

<p>PM Modi said that in the Artificial Intelligence mission started this year, India will increase the use of the technology in every sector.</p>

<p>"This is the era of AI and the future of the world is linked with it. India is powered by two AIs. For the world, it is Artificial Intelligence but in India, it's Aspirational India plus Artificial Intelligence. When the two meet, it accelerates India's growth," he said.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister said there is <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/na-chain-na-araam-pm-modi-at-ndtv-world-summit-on-hard-work-6836565">no scope for rest</a> as his government works to make India's dreams come true.

India giving hope to the world engulfed in various concerns, it is working on unprecedented scale and speed in every field," he said.</p>

We used to walk this path but, from now on, we cannot compare past and present and be happy. The metric of success from now on will be what we want to achieve... and that is a 'developed India' by 2047," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Addressing the NDTV World Summit this morning, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said there is no scope for rest as his government works to make India's dreams come true and fulfill its pledge.</p>

<p>"I meet many people who tell me, 'India is now the fifth largest economy in the world, so many milestones have been achieved, reforms implemented, then why are you working so hard?'&nbsp;In the last 10 years, 12 crore toilets have been built, and 16 crore homes have gas connections... is this enough? My answer is no. This is not enough. Today India is among the youngest countries in the world. This youth potential can take us to the skies," the Prime Minister said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The dreams we have seen, the pledge we have made, there is no rest, no relaxation," he added.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister said India is now moving ahead with a 'look forward' approach. "There's a tradition that every government compares its work with that of the previous government. We used to walk this path too, but from now on we can't compare the past and the present and be happy with it. The metric of success from now on would be 'What we want to achieve'. India now has a forward-looking approach. The vision for a developed India by 2047 is a part of this mindset," he said.</p>

<p>At the beginning of his address, the Prime Minister said the developments in the last five years have been a cause for global concern. These include the Covid pandemic that resulted in the disruption of economies, price rise and unemployment, followed by wars in Ukraine and West Asia. Amid this turmoil, India has emerged as a beacon of hope, the Prime Minister said. "In India, we are discussing the India Century. India is the ray of hope amid the global crisis. There are challenges in front of India but we feel a sense of positivity here," he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>India, he said, showed the world that digital innovation and democratic values can co-exist. The Prime Minister said India did not have the first-mover advantage during the Internet era. "In the countries that had this advantage, private companies led the digital push. A revolution came, but its benefit was limited. India gave a new model to the world. India democratised technology and showed the world the way to digital public infrastructure," the Prime Minister said.</p>

<p>In India, he said, the government creates a platform and it undergoes several rounds of innovations. "Jandhan, Aadhaar and mobile connectivity have become a seamless system of fast and leakage-free service delivery. "Look at UPI, it has led to an expansion of fintech in India. More than 500 million digital transactions are happening through UPI daily. And this is not driven by big corporates, but by small shopowners and street vendors."</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India is a beacon of hope amid global crises over economic growth, unemployment, health, and geopolitical tension over disruptions caused by COVID-19 and military conflict, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Monday at the NDTV World Summit. "In this summit you will discuss numerous topics but, if we look at the last four or five years... one thing is common - stress about the future."</p>

<p>"During the coronavirus pandemic people were stressed about dealing with the virus. When that was controlled then people were worried about the economy... then climate change, the wars (in Ukraine and West Asia), global supply chains (for industries) ... these have become global worries."</p>

<p>"There are the challenges in front of India, but we feel a sense of positivity and that is why are here today - to discuss the 'India century'," the Prime Minister said as he delivered the inaugural address and welcomed speakers - including global heads of state - at the NDTV World Summit.</p>

<p>Referring to the strides India has made, the Prime Minister - who began a third term in June, after the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance won the April-June general election - called the speed and scale of that development "unprecedented".</p>

<p>He also listed welfare and infrastructural schemes - three crore new homes for the poor, Rs 9 lakh crore in infra projects, Rs 2 lakh crore for jobs for young people - announced by his government.</p>

<p>Mr Modi also pointed to a stock market that has soared seven per cent in his third term and to the country's forex reserves, which he said had now crossed the $700 billion mark.</p>

<p>"A lot is happening in India... India has picked up growth in our third term and global financial ratings companies have increased India's growth outlook," the Prime Minister said, as he also claimed dissatisfaction with the progress so far. "People ask me... 'Why are you working so hard? India is doing well.' Many people ask me this... but for the goals we have, we cannot be at rest."</p>

<p>"So, is this (what India has achieved so far) enough? My answer is no. It is not. India is a country with a young population and we have a lot to do," the PM said, haling a "change in India's vision".</p>

<p>In his speech the PM also seemed to take a swipe at his political opposition.</p>

<p>"There is a tradition... every government compares its work to the previous. We used to walk this path but, from now on, we cannot compare past and present and be happy. The metric of success from now on will be what we want to achieve... and that is a 'developed India' by 2047," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Florida couple is facing charges of stealing properties through a simple scam that costs less than a dollar to execute. Victor Rodriguez, 50, and his wife Michelle Cherry, 33, allegedly forged “quitclaim deeds” to illegally transfer ownership of homes, including a property owned by Rodriguez's ex-father-in-law, in Tampa and Miami-Dade County, <a href="https://www.fox13news.com/news/property-fraud-investigation-extends-from-bay-area-south-florida-court-documents ">Fox News</a> reported.</p>

<p>Caroline Sauer, Rodriguez's ex-wife, discovered the scam when she found that her father's properties had changed ownership through quitclaim deeds. “We questioned, how did this happen?” Ms Sauer said. “Who forges a deceased person's signature? Who does that?”</p>

<p>According to authorities, the scam involved forging signatures on quitclaim deeds – a legal document that transfers property ownership with the owner's consent. These documents, however, can be easily manipulated. Fraudsters only need a notary and two signatures to process the transaction, often for as little as 70 cents in Florida.</p>

<p>Rodriguez and Cherry allegedly used the same scam on another Tampa property belonging to Larry and Dreama Bilby. The Bilbys were stunned when they learned in February that someone forged their signatures and transferred ownership of their home, which was unoccupied and under construction at the time.</p>

<p>“I was so angry, I almost couldn't talk,” Dreama Bilby told Fox13.</p>

<p>Hillsborough County Clerk Cindy Stuart explained how easy it was to commit the fraud. “It only requires a notary and two signatures with an address listed next to them,” she said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Caroline Sauer and her family are battling her ex-husband in court. “The hardest thing for us emotionally has been, we've just tried to protect my father and his legacy,” she told the outlet.</p>

<p>To prove the forgery, Ms Sauer's family hired a handwriting expert and incurred significant legal fees.</p>

<p>Rodriguez and Cherry were arrested in March and pleaded not guilty. Rodriguez's legal team maintains his innocence. “Mr. Rodriguez maintains his innocence, and our office is entrusted with the responsibility of protecting his rights,” his lawyers said in a statement, adding that they are committed to ensuring “justice and fairness in legal proceedings.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indigenous senator Lidia Thorpe shouted anti-colonial slogans at King Charles during his visit to the Australian parliament on Monday, shocking assembled lawmakers and other dignitaries.</p>

<p>"Give us our land back! Give us what you stole from us!" Thorpe screamed in an almost minute-long diatribe, after the 75-year-old king's speech.</p>

<p>"This is not your land, you are not my king," the independent lawmaker said, decrying what she described as a "genocide" of Indigenous Australians by European settlers.</p>

<p>Australia was a British colony for more than 100 years, during which time thousands of Aboriginal Australians were killed and entire communities displaced.</p>

<p>The country gained de facto independence in 1901, but has never become a fully fledged republic. King Charles is the current head of state.</p>

<p>Charles is on a nine-day jaunt through Australia and Samoa, the first major foreign tour since his life-changing cancer diagnosis earlier this year.</p>

<p>Thorpe is known for her attention-grabbing political stunts and fierce opposition to the monarchy.</p>

<p>When she was sworn into office in 2022, Thorpe raised her right fist as she begrudgingly swore to serve Queen Elisabeth II, who was then Australia's head of state.</p>

<p>"I sovereign, Lidia Thorpe, do solemnly and sincerely swear that I will be faithful and I bear true allegiance to the colonising Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II," she said before being rebuked by a Senate official.</p>

<p>"Senator Thorpe, Senator Thorpe, you are required to recite the oath as printed on the card," said the chamber's president Sue Lines.</p>

<p>In 1999, Australians narrowly voted against removing the queen, amid a row over whether her replacement would be chosen by members of parliament, not the public.</p>

<p>In 2023 Australians overwhelmingly rejected measures to recognise Indigenous Australians in the constitution and to create an Indigenous consultative assembly.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Israeli military has released footage of what it claims to be the bunker of ex Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar, which he occupied during the first half of the ongoing Gaza conflict. Sinwar, known as the mastermind behind the brutal October 7 attacks, was allegedly prepared to ride out the war with a stash of cash, cologne, and personal comforts in a fully-stocked bunker under the ravaged city of Khan Younis.</p>

<p>The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) shared video footage that details the inside of Sinwar's underground hideout. The video shows a well-equipped bunker, complete with modern showers, several bathrooms, and a fully functional kitchen, stocked with food rations labelled with the United Nations Palestinian Refugee Agency (UNRWA) logo.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sinwar, 61, had taken refuge in the bunker with his guards and close associates as the war above ground escalated. The footage shows a bag of UNRWA-supplied food, reinforcing Israel's longstanding accusation that Hamas steals from international agencies, exacerbating the already dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The IDF has released footage showing their entry into Sinwar's bunker, where UNWRA bags and millions of shekels were found.<br />

<p>The bunker contained multiple bottles of cologne, hygiene supplies, and even a private shower. According to an IDF soldier giving the tour of the bunker, Sinwar's personal quarters included a large safe filled with millions of Israeli shekels.</p>

<p>Next to the door of the bunker, soldiers found lockers filled with a cache of weapons, ammunition, and explosives.</p>

<p>Sinwar had fled the bunker before the IDF could capture him. Reports suggest that Sinwar initially stayed in Khan Younis before being forced to flee further south to Rafah as the Israeli military closed in on his position. It was in Rafah, where Sinwar's luck finally ran out. Last Thursday, Israeli soldiers killed him in a strike during what they described as a "routine operation". The IDF initially believed they had encountered just another Hamas fighter before later identifying Sinwar as one of the casualties.</p>

<p>According to Israeli sources, Sinwar had spent much of the war hiding underground, directing Hamas operations and attempting to evade capture. Sinwar's wife, Abu Zamar, was reportedly carrying a Rs 28 lakh ($32,000) Hermes Birkin bag during their escape.</p>

<p>After months of searching, Sinwar's fate was sealed when an IDF patrol stumbled upon him in Rafah. Sinwar, cornered and injured in a demolished building, was caught on drone footage in his final moments. The video showed Sinwar, covered in dust and with one hand severely injured, hurling an object-believed to be a stick-at an approaching Israeli drone.</p>

<p>An Israeli autopsy confirmed that Sinwar died from a gunshot wound to the head.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Brazilian PresidentLuizInacioLuladaSilva, 78, will now participate in the BRICS meeting in Russia via videoconference.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brazilian President&nbsp;Luiz&nbsp;Inacio&nbsp;Lula&nbsp;da&nbsp;Silva&nbsp;on Sunday canceled his trip to Russia for the BRICS summit, following medical advice to temporarily avoid long-haul flights after a head injury at home that caused a minor brain hemorrhage. In a statement, the presidential office said&nbsp;Lula, 78, will now participate in the BRICS meeting via videoconference. He was initially scheduled to depart at 5 p.m. on Sunday.</p>

<p>Lula's doctor, Roberto Kalil, said in an interview with GloboNews TV channel that the president suffered a fall that caused "great" trauma to the back of his head, requiring stitches for the injury and resulting in a "small brain hemorrhage" in the temporal-frontal region.</p>

<p>"It's a condition that will require repeat tests throughout the week. Any brain hemorrhage, theoretically, can worsen in the following&nbsp;days, so observation is important," he said.</p>

<p>Kalil added that&nbsp;Lula&nbsp;is doing well and can engage in normal activities.</p>

<p>According to a medical report issued earlier on Sunday by the Sirio Libanes Hospital in Brasilia,&nbsp;Lula&nbsp;suffered a laceration to the "occipital region" in the back of his head on Saturday.</p>

<p>The report said&nbsp;Lula&nbsp;"was advised to avoid long-distance air travel but is otherwise able to carry out his regular duties."</p>

<p>The government said in a post on X that Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira has been designated to lead the Brazilian delegation in the BRICS summit, departing later on Sunday.</p>

<p>The diplomatic forum founded 15 years ago by major emerging markets Brazil, Russia, India, China has since expanding to include South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates.</p>

<p>Congresswoman Gleisi Hoffmann, president of&nbsp;Lula's Workers Party, posted on social media that she had spoken with the president and that "he is doing very well, just avoiding a long trip."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar, who was killed in an Israeli operation in southern Gaza last week, was seen moving inside a tunnel with his wife and children, hours before the deadly October 7 attack on Israel last year. The now-dead Hamas leader was carrying pillows, mattresses, television, and bags inside the tunnel located under their family in Khan Younis, a CCTV footage showed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, his wife was seen carrying a Hermes bag, which Israel claims is worth $32,000.</p>

<p>Israel said, "<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/who-is-yahya-sinwar-the-hamas-leader-killed-by-israel-6819037">Yahya Sinwar</a>'s wife was caught sneaking to the tunnels the night before the October 7 attack," claiming she was carrying a Hermes Birkin bag worth $32,000 (Rs 26.88 lakh).&nbsp;</p>

<p>"While Gazans endured hardship under Hamas, Sinwar and his family were shamelessly living in luxury, indulging while sending others to die," Israel said.</p>

<p>Israel shared a screengrab from the video, where Sinwar's wife holds a bag. In the hazy picture, the design on the bag 'appears to be similar' to the Hermes Birkin 40 Black Togo Gold Hardware edition. The Palestinian militant group is yet to contest Israel's claim.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-releases-footage-showing-yahya-sinwar-hours-ahead-of-hamas-oct-7-attack-6829387">The footage was released</a> following Sinwar's death in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, in an armour-infantry assault. Israel's 828th Brigade conducted "intelligence-based targeted raids and operations," the Israel Defence Forces said, giving details of the damage assessment, where they found assault rifles and snipers in the hideout and Sinwar's body.</p>

<p>Israeli army spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari showed photos of the underground compound with toilets, showers, and a kitchen. Food, cash, and documents were also found there.</p>

<p>Hamas, meanwhile, said Sinwar died heroically engaging in battle, calling Hagar's remarks "blatant lies".</p>

<p>Drone footage from earlier this week showed Sinwar critically wounded in his last moments, throwing an object at the drone. The autopsy found that Sinwar was <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/bullet-in-head-finger-cut-off-chilling-details-of-yahya-sinwars-autopsy-6822817">killed by a gunshot to the head</a>, and also found one of his fingers was cut off.</p>

<p>During a year of the Israel-Hamas conflict, the Israel Defence Forces had often closed in on Sinwar, but the latter managed to escape. Israel had identified Sinwar's final hiding after the military found "his DNA sample on a tissue with which he blew his nose," said Hagari.</p>

<p>Yahya Sinwar was the mastermind of the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel in which over 1,200 people were killed, resulting in a year-long Israeli operation in Gaza, killing over 40,000 including children.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just a month ago, south Beirut's bustling streets were packed with traffic, families strolling about and youths in cafes, but now silence dominates the abandoned Hezbollah bastion, interrupted only by the sound of Israeli bombs.</p>

<p>Escalating Israeli attacks since late September, after nearly a year of low-intensity cross-border exchanges, have reduced much of the Lebanese capital's once densely-packed southern suburbs to rubble and sent many of its residents fleeing.</p>

<p>Braving the smell of rotting flesh that reeks from razed buildings, a few young men stood guard, dressed in black civilian clothes and occasionally driving around the ruins on their motorbikes.</p>

<p>They observed the odd car and the handful of displaced residents who come on foot, hastily checking on their apartment or collecting some belongings before heading back to safety.</p>

<p>"The young people told me not to stay too long because drones were constantly flying over and could strike at any time," said 32-year-old Mohammed, on a brief visit home to get more clothes.</p>

<p>Giving his first name only for security concerns, he said he first left on September 27, days into Israel's intense air campaign on Lebanon.</p>

<p>That day, massive Israeli strikes killed Hezbollah's elusive leader Hassan Nasrallah in the heart of the Iran-backed group's south Beirut stronghold, toppling several apartment buildings and spreading fear of even greater violence.</p>

<p>"We left in a hurry and thought we would never see our house again," said Mohammed, adding that his neighbours had also fled.</p>

<p>The building was still standing, but many others have been damaged or destroyed.</p>

<p><strong>Attacks on infrastructure</strong></p>

<p>Cracks snaked down nearby buildings as torn-off asphalt and burst pipes leaked sewage and tap water.</p>

<p>Generators that long made up for daily power cuts after five years of economic crisis had also been blown to bits.</p>

<p>"About 320 buildings were destroyed in Beirut and its suburbs" in less than a month of war, Mona Fawaz of the Beirut Urban Lab told AFP.</p>

<p>The devastation has surpassed the damage caused by Israel's last war with Hezbollah in 2006, said Fawaz, who records cases of "urbicide", the destruction of cities in conflict, focusing now on Lebanon and the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>She accused Israel of "deliberate targeting of what allows life to continue," including vital infrastructure unrelated to Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Hezbollah had completely rebuilt Beirut's south based on the existing urban plans from before the 2006 war, which had displaced about 100,000 people from the area.</p>

<p>During that 33-day war, "surveys list 1,332 severely damaged multi-storey apartment buildings, of which 281 were completely razed to the ground" in an area of about 20 square kilometres (eight square miles), said Fawaz.</p>

<p>The Burj al-Barajneh neighbourhood, unscathed in 2006, has been heavily damaged in the bombardment this time around.</p>

<p><strong>Childhood memories</strong></p>

<p>Once again, families from south Beirut are forced to seek refuge elsewhere in the country or abroad.</p>

<p>Many live in rented apartments or with relatives, while others are crammed in schools-turned-shelters.</p>

<p>Hassan, 37, grew up in the Mraijeh district of Beirut's south, where Israeli jets targeted Hashem Safieddine, widely seen as Nasrallah's most likely successor.</p>

<p>Despite the bloodshed, he said Mraijeh will always remind him of his "friends, the games we used to play as children, the smell of freshly-baked bread in the morning, neighbours chatting and Ramadan festivities".</p>

<p>The supermarket he used to shop at is in ruins, with nearby shops, schools and buildings also reduced to rubble.</p>

<p>Hassan, who also asked to be identified by first name only, was told his favourite record store was no more.</p>

<p>As the war shows no signs of abating, greater losses are all but certain.</p>

<p>"We are afraid to return after the war only to discover how many of our friends have died, like in 2006," said Hassan with a sigh.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

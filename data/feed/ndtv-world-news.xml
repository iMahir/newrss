       <description><![CDATA[Analyzing data from over 1,500 participants aged 13 to 77, researchers found that individuals with a positive outlook are more driven and determined to achieve their goals.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two professors from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) conducted a study that looked at the characteristics that enable people to succeed in their ambitions. According to their research, people who have more willpower frequently have one crucial characteristic in common: a "growth mindset."</p>

<p>The large-scale study found that this mindset-which is defined as the belief in personal progress and improvement-is associated with higher levels of enthusiasm, determination, and success.</p>

<p>The research included over 1,500 participants aged 13 to 77, with an average age of 26. They completed questionnaires measuring traits such as grit, passion, and mindset. The data revealed that individuals with a positive outlook not only had more willpower but were also more driven to achieve their goals.A new article about the test has been published in <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0732118X24000394"><em>New Ideas in Psychology.</em></a></p>

<p>The findings highlight the importance of fostering a belief in growth to unlock one's potential. Adopting a growth mindset could be the key to developing resilience and passion in various areas of life.</p>

<p>"An individual's belief in growth is important. Individuals can change and increase their development through training. People with growth mindsets see challenges as opportunities for learning," <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1062439">said Professor Hermundur Sigmundsson</a> at the Department of Psychology at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We find large differences in passion and determination when we compare the five percent who have the most positive attitude with the five percent who are the most negative," Sigmundsson said.</p>

<p>"Our results can help us better understand the connections between different factors. These are in turn related to how satisfied people are with their lives, how they feel, what they have already achieved, and learning," Sigmundsson said.</p>

<p>When we know more about what characterises people with different attitudes, we can also better understand how we can motivate different groups. We can thus get people to set long-term goals and make an effort to achieve these goals. This is what Sigmundsson calls "getting the I CAN feeling.".</p>

<p>"The belief in growth is important for large parts of our society. This is true for school, sports, work, and family life," he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Health experts have been sounding the alarm about the potential pandemic threat posed by bird flu, which has been showing signs of mutating.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Health experts have been sounding the alarm about the potential pandemic threat posed by bird flu, which has been showing signs of mutating as it spreads among cows and infects people in the United States.</p>

<p>There is no guarantee that bird flu will ever begin transmitting between humans, and US health authorities have emphasised that the risk to the general public remains low.</p>

<p>The deadly bird flu variant H5N1 first emerged in China in 1996, but over the last four years it has spread more widely than ever before, reaching previously untouched regions such as penguin-haven Antarctica.</p>

<p>More than 300 million poultry birds have been killed or culled since October 2021, while 315 different species of wild birds have died across 79 countries, the World Organisation for Animal Health told AFP.</p>

<p>Mammals that ate the infected birds, such as seals, have also experienced mass-die offs.</p>

<p>The situation changed again in March, when the virus began spreading among dairy cows across the United States in another first.</p>

<p>Fifty-eight people have tested positive for bird flu in the US this year, including two who had no known exposure to infected animals, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>

<p>There are also fears that some human cases are going undetected. Researchers said last month that eight out of 115 dairy workers tested in Michigan and Colorado had antibodies for bird flu, suggesting an infection rate of seven percent.</p>

<p>Meg Schaeffer, an epidemiologist at the US-based SAS Institute, told AFP there were now several factors suggesting that "avian flu is knocking on our door and could start a new pandemic any day".</p>

<p>"A bird flu pandemic would be one of the most foreseeable catastrophes in history," read the headline of a New York Times opinion article late last month.</p>

<p><strong>'Simple Step' Away</strong></p>

<p>There are still several barriers stopping H5N1 from spreading easily between people, including that the virus would have to mutate to become better at infecting human lungs.</p>

<p>But research published in the journal Science on Thursday demonstrated that the version of bird flu infecting US cows is now just a single mutation away from being able to spread more effectively among humans.</p>

<p>Virologist Ed Hutchinson of the University of Glasgow said this suggests that H5N1 is just "a simple step" away from becoming "more dangerous for us".</p>

<p>And last month, genetic sequencing of a Canadian teenager who was very sick with bird flu "implied that the virus had begun to evolve to explore ways of binding more effectively to the cells in their body," Hutchinson said.</p>

<p>"We do not yet know whether H5N1 influenza viruses will evolve to become a disease of humans," and other barriers remain, Hutchinson emphasised.</p>

<p>But the more animals and different species the virus is allowed to infect, the "more likely it is to adapt to better infect people," Schaeffer said.</p>

<p>And if a bird flu pandemic was to break out, it would be "remarkably severe" in humans because we have no built-up immunity, she added.</p>

<p>The US farm worker cases have been relatively mild so far. But nearly half of the 904 human cases of H5N1 recorded since 2003 have been fatal, according to the World Health Organization.</p>

<p><strong>Raw Milk: 'Terrible Idea'</strong></p>

<p>Tom Peacock, a virologist at the Imperial College London, told AFP there are several reasons to be "less pessimistic about the possibility of a pandemic".</p>

<p>Antiviral treatments and vaccines are already available for bird flu, marking a big difference from Covid-19 in 2020, he pointed out.</p>

<p>To avoid the worst-case scenario, many health researchers have called on the US government to ramp up testing and ensure information is shared between agencies and countries.</p>

<p>On Friday, the US Department of Agriculture announced plans to test the country's milk supply for bird flu.</p>

<p>Of particular concern is raw, or unpasteurised, milk, which has repeatedly been found to be contaminated with bird flu.</p>

<p>Vaccine sceptic and conspiracy theorist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is US President-elect Donald Trump's pick for health secretary, is known to be a fan of raw milk.</p>

<p>California raw milk producer Mark McAfee, whose products have repeatedly been recalled due to bird flu, told The Guardian last week that Kennedy's team had approached him to guide the upcoming administration's raw milk policy.</p>

<p>Schaeffer said that any suggestion of lifting restrictions on raw milk was "unequivocally a terrible idea and definitely jeopardises the health of humans".</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday tapped Andrew Ferguson, a board member at the Federal Trade Commission and Big Tech critic, to run this major US antitrust and competition agency.</p>

<p>Ferguson will replace Lina Khan, whose antitrust lawsuits galvanized progressive Democrats and even some Republicans, but also received pushback from the business community, notably the tech industry.</p>

<p>Signaling his incoming administration's priorities, Trump said in a post on his Truth Social website that Ferguson "has a proven record of standing up to Big Tech censorship."</p>

<p>While Republicans are generally considered more business friendly than Democrats, conservatives also allege that their voices have been censored online in anti-disinformation campaigns, auguring a potential clash between Big Tech and the Trump administration.</p>

<p>Ferguson has also said that companies that pulled out of advertising on X (formerly Twitter) -- which many did after new owner Elon Musk loosened rules on hate speech -- might be doing so in violation of antitrust law.</p>

<p>Musk himself has become close with Trump, donating millions to support his election campaign. The billionaire is set to spearhead a government cost-cutting initiative under the new administration.</p>

<p>Trump has also tapped Gail Slater to lead the Justice Department's antitrust division, meaning she would take over ongoing government legal battles against Google and Apple, accused of acting like monopolies.</p>

<p>"Andrew has a proven record of standing up to Big Tech censorship, and protecting Freedom of Speech in our Great Country," Trump said in his Truth Social post.</p>

<p>The incoming Republican president has been using the platform to make a slew of incoming announcements on major staffing decisions, often written late at night with words capitalized throughout.</p>

<p>Trump will take office on January 20.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[South Korean police said that security guards were blocking a raid on President Yoon Suk Yeol's offices to investigate his imposition of martial law.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korean police said Wednesday that security guards were blocking a raid on President Yoon Suk Yeol's offices to investigate his brief imposition of martial law.</p>

<p>Yoon is already banned from foreign travel as part of an "insurrection" probe into his inner circle over the dramatic events of December 3-4 that stunned South Korea's allies.</p>

<p>Police said earlier that a Special Investigation Team "has conducted a raid" on the presidential office, on different police agencies and on the National Assembly Security Service.</p>

<p>But later a spokesperson said that investigators had "gained access to its civil services office. However, we are currently unable to enter the main building due to access restrictions imposed by the presidential security guards."</p>

<p>The president's office was not immediately available for comment on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Prison authorities, meanwhile, said that former defence minister Kim Yong-hyun tried to kill himself shortly before his formal arrest late Tuesday.</p>

<p>Kim, who is accused of suggesting to Yoon to impose martial law, was first detained on Sunday, and later formally arrested on charges of "engaging in critical duties during an insurrection" and "abuse of authority to obstruct the exercise of rights".</p>

<p>He had said through his lawyers that his subordinates were "following my orders".</p>

<p>The justice ministry and a prison official said he was in good health on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The former interior minister and the general in charge of the martial law operation are also barred from foreign travel. Two senior police officials were arrested early Wednesday.</p>

<p><strong>'Fascist Dictatorship'</strong></p>

<p>North Korean state media on Wednesday made its first comments.</p>

<p>"The shocking incident of the puppet Yoon Suk Yeol, who is facing impeachment and a governance crisis, suddenly declaring a martial law decree and unhesitatingly wielding the guns and knives of its fascist dictatorship wrought chaos across South Korea," a commentary said.</p>

<p>Yoon had said his declaration of martial law was intended, in part, to safeguard South Korea "from the threats posed by North Korea's communist forces and eliminate anti-state elements".</p>

<p>Relations between the two Koreas have been at one of their lowest points in years, with the North launching a flurry of ballistic missiles in violation of UN sanctions.</p>

<p>Former defence minister Kim had been accused by opposition lawmakers of calling for strikes on sites from which North Korea was launching trash-carrying balloons, an order reportedly refused by his subordinates.</p>

<p>He also allegedly ordered drones sent to Pyongyang in an apparent attempt to provoke a conflict as a pretext for declaring martial law.</p>

<p>US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in Tokyo on Tuesday that Washington's deterrence commitment to South Korea -- where it has around 28,500 troops -- and to Japan remained "ironclad".</p>

<p><strong>Task Force</strong></p>

<p>Yoon survived an impeachment motion in parliament on Saturday even as tens of thousands of South Koreans braved freezing temperatures to demand his ouster.</p>

<p>Further smaller protests have continued every evening since, with polls showing record-low public support for Yoon.</p>

<p>A special task force within Yoon's People Power Party (PPP) on Tuesday proposed a plan for the president to resign in February or March, followed by fresh elections in April or May.</p>

<p>But the proposal has not yet been adopted by the party as a whole.</p>

<p>Even if approved, the roadmap is unlikely to head off another opposition attempt to impeach Yoon on Saturday.</p>

<p>Jo Seung-lae, a lawmaker from the main opposition Democratic Party (DP), told AFP that the new vote would take place around 5:00 pm (0800 GMT).</p>

<p>The motion only needs eight members of Yoon's People Power Party (PPP) to secure the necessary two-thirds majority.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last week, two PPP lawmakers -- Ahn Cheol-soo and Kim Yea-ji -- voted in favour, and since Tuesday three have said they would support the motion this time.</p>

<p>The PPP has said that pending Yoon's resignation, he has agreed to hand power to Prime Minister Han Duck-soo and party chief Han Dong-hoon.</p>

<p>The opposition have said this contravenes the constitution, calling it a "second coup".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Prime Minister Han on Wednesday said he had opposed the martial law declaration, apologising for being "ultimately unable to prevent it."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US president-elect Donald Trump defended his choice of Charles Kushner for US ambassador to France, describing him as a "family member" and a "very successful man" in an interview released Wednesday.</p>

<p>"It's a great thing because he's in our family," Trump told the French magazine Paris Match in the interview conducted Saturday.</p>

<p>"Essentially a family member of mine is coming to France, I am not sure it's happening anywhere else. We have a lot of ambassadorships."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump nominated Kushner, the father of his son-in-law Jared Kushner, as the US envoy to France in November.</p>

<p>The choice is in keeping with Trump's pattern of selecting people, often wealthy, who are close to his family or have proven their loyalty.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The elder Kushner, 70, is a multimillionaire real estate executive and former attorney.</p>

<p>He was handed a two-year sentence -- most of it served in a federal prison -- after pleading guilty in 2004 to 18 counts of tax evasion, witness tampering and illegal campaign contributions.</p>

<p>But in 2020 he was granted a presidential pardon by Trump during his first term in office.</p>

<p>Trump described Kushner as a "very successful man".</p>

<p>"And he's a very good friend of mine, too. And it's something he really wanted to do. He feels so strongly about it. This was his first choice, by far."</p>

<p>Trump visited Paris for Saturday's re-opening of Notre Dame cathedral on his first international trip since his re-election.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trump described France as "a friend and an ally" and said he had "always" had a good relationship with President Emmanuel Macron.</p>

<p>"It's a beautiful country, it's an elegant country," he added.</p>

<p>Trump said trade and military issues would be a priority in the two countries' relations.</p>

<p>"We are going to do a lot of business with France," he said. "You already do a wonderful business with your wines and champagnes."</p>

<p>He said he wanted to stay in France "much longer" but added that he had to prepare for Inauguration Day on January 20.</p>

<p>"January 20 will be a good day for France."</p>

<p>He praised French people and Macron for rebuilding Notre Dame, describing the 2019 blaze that nearly burned it down as a "terrible thing to watch".</p>

<p>"I've never seen anything quite like it, other than the World Trade Center, of course," he added.</p>

<p>"It was a very tough reconstruction," he said. "I know so much about construction."</p>

<p>He drew parallels between the resilience of Notre Dame and his own political fate.</p>

<p>"It's resilience, getting it done, getting it built," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh I know all about it," he chuckled. "I became president again. I guess it's pretty resilient also."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Malaria mortality has fallen back to levels seen before the Covid-19 crisis, the WHO said, but called for faster progress against the disease.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Malaria mortality has fallen back to levels seen before the Covid-19 crisis, the WHO said Wednesday, but called for faster progress against the disease that killed nearly some 597,000 people last year.</p>

<p>In a new report, the World Health Organization estimated that there were 263 million cases of malaria worldwide in 2023 -- 11 million more than a year earlier -- while the number of deaths remained relatively stable.</p>

<p>But in terms of the mortality rate, "we have come back to pre-pandemic numbers", Arnaud Le Menach, of the WHO's Global Malaria Programme, told reporters.</p>

<p>In 2020, disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic led to a sharp increase in malaria-related mortality, with an additional 55,000 deaths counted that year.</p>

<p>Since then the total number of deaths from malaria, which is caused by a mosquito-borne parasite, has gradually shrunk, as has the mortality rate.</p>

<p>The estimated 2023 mortality rate in Africa of 52.4 deaths per 100,000 population at risk meanwhile still remains more than double the target level set by a global strategy for combatting malaria through 2030, WHO said, insisting "progress must be accelerated".</p>

<p><strong>Vaccine Promise</strong></p>

<p>WHO pointed to the wider rollout of malaria vaccines as a promising development, expected to save tens of thousands of young lives each year.</p>

<p>The two jabs currently in use, RTS,S and R21/Matrix-M, hold the promise of significantly easing the burden in Africa, which accounts for up to 95 percent of all malaria deaths.</p>

<p>Malaria vaccines were first introduced in April 2019, first in Malawi, with Kenya and Ghana following suit.</p>

<p>Through the end of 2023, nearly two million children in those three countries received jabs of the RTS,S vaccine, WHO said.</p>

<p>"We saw in those three pilot countries... a 13-percent drop in mortality during the four years of the pilot programme," said Mary Hamel, who heads WHO's malaria vaccine team.</p>

<p>The WHO now looked forward to seeing a similar drop in other countries introducing the vaccines, she told reporters, pointing out that countries that began introducing the jabs early this year were "following a similar trajectory".</p>

<p>So far, 17 nations across sub-Saharan Africa have included the jabs in their routine immunisation programmes, she said</p>

<p>Another eight countries had been approved to receive funding towards introducing the vaccines through the vaccine alliance GAVI, WHO said.</p>

<p><strong>'Curb The Threat'</strong></p>

<p>In another promising development, new-generation dual-insecticide nets nets are becoming more widely available.</p>

<p>These nets, which are coated in a new generation pyrrole insecticide in combination with the standard pyrethroid insecticide, have been shown to offer far better protection against malaria.</p>

<p>The WHO estimated earlier this year that such nets had averted 13 million malaria cases and nearly 25,000 deaths over three years.</p>

<p>Despite the successes, the WHO highlighted a number of factors slowing the battle against malaria, including a lack of funds and insufficient stocks of vaccines, as well as climate change, which is allowing a greater spread of the mosquitos that carry the parasite that causes malaria.</p>

<p>"Stepped-up investments and action in high-burden African countries are needed to curb the threat," WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement.</p>

<p>The Global Fund, a partnership set up to battle AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, agreed.</p>

<p>"Progress has stagnated for several years," its executive director Peter Sands warned in a statement.</p>

<p>"To overcome this, we must accelerate our efforts through a dual approach: investing in new technologies while simultaneously easing the strain that climate change places on healthcare systems," he said.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A video being shared on social media (<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DDHQtyMJb9X" target="_blank">here</a>, and <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.instagram.com/mq_motivational_quotes/reel/DDFSsCzTObr/" target="_blank">here</a>) shows Hindu devotional songs being performed at a concert in Saudi Arabia. Let's verify the truth behind the video in this article.</p>

<p><strong>Claim</strong>: A video shows Hindu devotional songs being performed at a concert in Saudi Arabia.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Fact:</strong>&nbsp;The audio in the viral video is edited to include a Hindu devotional song. Further, the video is not from Saudi Arabia, it is from Kuwait. It was filmed in May 2024 during Abdul Majeed Abdullah's concert, where he was singing an Arabic song. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.</p>

<p>A reverse image search of keyframes from the viral video led us to an <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C78crSyo3gf/" target="_blank">Instagram post</a> (<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://mvau.lt/media/e52370a0-07e8-42f5-ac6b-7fa511d25cfd" target="_blank">archived</a>) dated 08 June 2024, featuring the same video. The song performed in the video was not a Hindu devotional song but an Arabic song. The caption revealed that it was a concert by 62-year-old Abdul Majeed Abdullah. Further review of the comments section indicated that the concert took place in Kuwait.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Outgoing US President Joe Biden on Tuesday branded his successor Donald Trump's economic plans a "disaster," in a speech hailing his own legacy.</p>

<p>Biden said Trump's threats to slap huge tariffs on imports were a "major mistake" and challenged Trump to build on what he said were the successes of his own administration.</p>

<p>The lame-duck president's speech comes after Trump won a second term largely on the back of US voters' anger at high costs of living under Democrats.</p>

<p>"I pray to God the president-elect throws away Project 2025. I think it'd be an economic disaster for us and the region," Biden said at the Brookings Institution in Washington, referring to a conservative blueprint for a second Trump administration.</p>

<p>Coughing frequently because of a cold, Biden said US consumers would pay the price for the tariffs that Trump has vowed to slap on US neighbors Mexico and Canada and on Asia-Pacific rival China.</p>

<p>Together they are the three biggest US trading partners.</p>

<p>"I believe this approach is a major mistake," Biden added.</p>

<p>At a separate event Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Trump's tariffs could "derail the progress that we've made on inflation, and have adverse consequences on growth."</p>

<p>She warned at the Wall Street Journal's CEO Council Summit that sweeping tariffs could raise prices significantly for US consumers and pile pressure on companies which rely on imports.</p>

<p><strong>Shadow President</strong></p>

<p>The White House touted Biden's speech as a "major address on his economic legacy" as the 82-year-old looks to the history books with fewer than six weeks left in office.</p>

<p>Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race against Trump in July due to concerns about his age and passed the torch to Vice President Kamala Harris, whom Trump comfortably defeated at the November polls.</p>

<p>Trump's inauguration is not until January 20, but he has already become something of a shadow president, making pronouncements on the economy and foreign policy and being feted by world leaders.</p>

<p>Biden has kept a relatively low profile, but he came out swinging in defense of his own record before an audience of economists.</p>

<p>He contrasted his "middle-out, bottom-up economic playbook" with what he called Trump's failed promise of "trickle-down economics" in which tax cuts for the wealthy are supposed to boost incomes.</p>

<p>Biden also touted achievements including the US economy's recovery from the Covid pandemic and his huge investments in green technology and industry.</p>

<p>"President-elect Trump is receiving the strongest economy in modern history," said Biden.</p>

<p>But the departing president said he regretted not signing his name to Covid stimulus checks sent out to Americans, like Trump had done.</p>

<p>Biden ended his speech with a broader plea for US leadership in a troubled world, even as Trump has repeatedly signaled his intention to take a more isolationist stance.</p>

<p>"If we do not lead the world, what nation leads the world?" he said.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Syrian blogger Tal al-Mallouhi has been released 15 years after she was swept away into deposed president Bashar al-Assad's notorious prison system at the age of 19, her mother said.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Syrian blogger Tal al-Mallouhi has been released 15 years after she was swept away into deposed president Bashar al-Assad's notorious prison system at the age of 19, her mother told AFP on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Mallouhi, now 33, was a blogger who wrote poetry and social commentary before she was detained in December 2009, just over a year before pro-democracy protests broke out across Syria.</p>

<p>In 2011, she was sentenced to five years in prison on charges of working with the CIA -- accusations her family insists are false. Her sentencing drew international condemnation at the time.</p>

<p>Authorities never released her after her sentence elapsed.</p>

<p>She was freed last week along with thousands of others during the 11-day lightning offensive led by Islamist rebels, who seized key cities before reaching Damascus and forcing Assad to flee.</p>

<p>"I was overwhelmed with an indescribable feeling, a great joy" after holding her daughter for the first time after she was freed, her mother Ahd al-Mallouhi told AFP.</p>

<p>But after more than a decade in Assad's notorious prison system, her daughter, like many others newly released, needs time just "to realise she got out, she's ok now and that the fear and terror is gone", she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the core of the system of rule that Assad inherited from his father Hafez was a brutal complex of prisons and detention centres used to eliminate dissent by jailing those suspected of stepping out of the ruling Baath party's line.</p>

<p>"I used to see her for half an hour during visits, and our every word was watched," she told AFP.</p>

<p>She said the family needed time to heal, "to talk with each other again and open up".</p>

<p>Yet despite the challenges, she said she had faith the country was now headed towards better days.</p>

<p>The rebel takeover that freed Mallouhi and others came nearly 14 years after Syrian government forces cracked down on peaceful protesters, triggering a complex war that has left more than 500,000 dead and forced millions to flee.</p>

<p>Up to 100,000 of those killed died in government-run prisons, according to Britain-based monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.</p>

<p>"Syria was freed first, then my daughter was released along with all the others," she said.</p>

<p>"Maybe if my daughter had been released alone, I would still fear for her, still be scared they could take her at any moment."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A French prosecutor demanded two years of house arrest for a filmmaker accused of sexually assaulting an actor when she was a child.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A French prosecutor Tuesday demanded two years of house arrest for a filmmaker accused of sexually assaulting an actor when she was a child, after an outburst from the plaintiff over his denying the allegations.</p>

<p>Adele Haenel, 35, has accused filmmaker Christophe Ruggia, 59, of assaulting her in the early 2000s when she was between 12 and 14 and he was in his late 30s, accusations he has called "pure lies".</p>

<p>The landmark #MeToo trial since Monday comes as France's film industry is rocked by allegations of sexual abuse.</p>

<p>On the second and last day of the trial, Haenel told Ruggia to "shut up" and briefly stormed out of courtroom over him seeking to portray himself as a protector.</p>

<p>Haenel, who starred in 2019 drama "Portrait of a Lady on Fire" before quitting cinema, was the first prominent actor to accuse the French film industry of turning a blind eye to the ill treatment.</p>

<p>The prosecutor on Tuesday requested two years detention with an electronic bracelet plus a three-year suspended sentence against the director.</p>

<p>The verdict is set for February 3.</p>

<p>Ruggia directed Haenel in the 2002 movie "The Devils", a tale of an incestuous relationship between a boy and his autistic sister. It was her first film role.</p>

<p>The film contains sex scenes between the children and close-ups of Haenel's naked body.</p>

<p>Investigators said before the trial that members of the film crew had told them of their "unease" with Ruggia's behaviour on set.</p>

<p>Between 2001 and 2004, after shooting the film, the teenager went to see Ruggia nearly every Saturday.</p>

<p>During these visits, she has accused him of caressing her thighs and touching her genitals and breasts.</p>

<p>"He chose to sexually assault her. He had his whole conscience as a man -- as an adult -- to behave otherwise," prosecutor Camille Poch said.</p>

<p>She asked that Ruggia also be listed as a sex offender, forbidden from contacting Haenel and made to pay her damages.</p>

<p><strong>'It's Grooming'</strong></p>

<p>"It was normality that shifted by degrees" into abuse, Haenel said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"Who was there to say, 'It's not your fault. It's grooming. It's violence'?" she said.</p>

<p>"You can't abuse children like that. There are consequences. No one helped that child," she said, speaking of her younger self.</p>

<p>But Ruggia has rejected the claims.</p>

<p>He told the court he had in fact sought to protect Haenel from mockery in school over the sex scenes in "The Devils".</p>

<p>This caused her to be outraged.</p>

<p>"Would you just shut up?" she shouted, banging her hands on the table in front of her.</p>

<p>Haenel marched out and only returned half an hour later with her lawyer, refusing to look at Ruggia.</p>

<p>In 2019, Haenel went public about the assaults, stunning the French film industry, which had been slower than Hollywood to react to the #MeToo movement.</p>

<p><strong>'Unfortunate Gesture'</strong></p>

<p>Ruggia's former partner Mona Achache, 43, told the court about the filmmaker confessing to a single "unfortunate gesture" on one of the Saturday visits.</p>

<p>She said Ruggia told her he had been "madly in love" with the young actress.</p>

<p>"He told me they were watching a film on the sofa, she had rested her head on his lap, and his hand moved onto her breast," she said.</p>

<p>"It was a version of the story that highlighted his virtue in removing his hand."</p>

<p>The filmmaker had also said something to his sister.</p>

<p>"I got the impression he felt guilty," Veronique Ruggia said.</p>

<p>In 2020, Haenel stormed out of the industry's Cesars award ceremony in protest against a prize awarded to veteran director Roman Polanski, who is wanted in the United States for statutory rape.</p>

<p>Last year, she quit cinema over what she called the French film industry turning a blind eye towards sexual abusers.</p>

<p>Several other allegations have rocked the film sector over the past few years.</p>

<p>Cinema legend Gerard Depardieu, 75, is to stand trial in March accused of sexually assaulting two women. He denies the accusations.</p>

<p>Actor Judith Godreche said this year two French directors -- Benoit Jacquot and Jacques Doillon -- had both sexually abused her when she was a teenager. Both deny the charges.</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Utah car dealership was the target of a customer's fury when he deliberately rammed his recently purchased vehicle into the showroom, <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.9news.com.au/world/angry-customer-drives-car-into-sandy-dealership-after-return-denied/ff6616b8-d01d-4cf4-8c97-cd041c24d609" rel="noindex,nofollow">9 News </a></em>reported.</p>

<p>Michael Murray, 35, purchased a Subaru Outback from Tim Dahle Mazda Southtowne, but his excitement quickly turned to frustration when he encountered unexpected mechanical problems. Convinced he had been sold a "lemon," he returned to the dealership demanding a full refund. However, the dealership, citing the "as-is" condition of the sale, firmly denied his request, leaving Murray feeling both disappointed and potentially facing significant repair costs.</p>

<p>"We even make the document hot pink so they truly understand this is a vehicle that is, 'as is.' It hasn't been inspected. But if it fits your budget we will let you take it," the dealership's platform manager, Tyler Slade told local media.</p>

<p>Enraged by the situation, Murray warned that he would drive his car through the dealership's front door if his refund was not issued. Around 4 pm, he followed through on his threat, crashing the vehicle into the dealership's main entrance. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In a video filmed inside the dealership, the car is seen smashing through the glass doors and slamming into a front kiosk, sending shards of glass flying. As stunned employees scream, Murray steps out of the car, shouting, "I told you." &nbsp;</p>

<p>The dealership reported that the incident caused approximately $10,000 in damages. Although seven employees were near the entrance at the time, no one was injured. Murray was subsequently arrested and charged with felony criminal mischief and reckless endangerment."What would've happened? Who knows - it could've been fatal. He came back, but with a rage... without thinking, he just acted out in rage," an employee of the dealership said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A signed portrait of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, dated 2002, was among the treasures inside Bashar al-Assad's New Shaab Palace in Damascus, now overrun by rebel forces. The portrait, a relic of the Syrian president's diplomatic visit to Buckingham Palace with his British-born wife Asma, was discovered in a room stuffed with prized possessions and diplomatic gifts.<br />
<br />
The room, now widely photographed, featured gold-encrusted chests, paintings, pottery, and mementoes of Assad's rule, including a rug with his face, a gold FIFA award from 2005, and a silver shield, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/world/middleeast/assad-presidential-palace.html " rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">NYT</a> reported. The 2002 portrait takes us back to the time Assad courted global leaders, striving to rehabilitate Syria's image following his father's brutal regime.<br />
<br />
Bashar al-Assad, who once projected an image of reform, saw his rule crumble under the weight of a brutal civil war that began in 2011. He and his family <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/syrians-take-over-assads-presidential-palaces-click-pictures-loot-furniture-7201567">fled Damascus</a> on December 8 in haste, seeking asylum in Moscow, as rebel forces swept through the capital after a 12-day offensive. Evidence of their abrupt departure was visible in the palace, with military maps left scattered on Assad's desk. Hours later, civilians posed for selfies at the once heavily guarded workspace – the collapse of his long-standing rule.<br />
<br />
As the palace doors were thrown open, footage showed civilians and fighters <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/bashar-al-assad-luxury-cars-bunker-guns-rebels-loot-abandoned-presidential-palace-in-syria-7205164 ">looting items</a> ranging from Louis Vuitton bags to chandeliers. Outside, Assad's fleet of luxury vehicles, including Ferraris, Aston Martins, Rolls-Royces, and a Bugatti Veyron, became a spectacle for the crowds.<br />
<br />
Rebels now guard the palace gates, preventing looting while using the grand reception rooms as resting spots. Inside, remnants of a hastily abandoned regime – shredded documents, half-finished coffee cups, and scattered luxury items – paint a vivid picture of how the Assad dynasty fell.<br />
<br />
The scene echoes the fall of other autocratic leaders. In 2011, Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi's compound revealed jewel-encrusted pistols and a bizarre portrait of Condoleezza Rice, alongside a golden dagger worth $10 million, later recovered in 2016.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[US President-elect Donald Trump has said he plans to end birthright citizenship in America as soon as he gets into office.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump has said he plans to end birthright citizenship in America as soon as he gets into office. Birthright citizenship, guaranteed under the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution, means that anyone born within American borders automatically becomes a citizen of the United States. This includes children of tourists, students studying in American colleges on short-term visas and undocumented immigrants.</p>

<p>If the incoming President were to try and change the law using "executive action" after he takes office, it would undo 150 years of how the US treated the issue.</p>

<h3><strong>What did Donald Trump Say?</strong></h3>

<p>In his first formal television interview on Sunday since the Presidential election, Mr Trump was asked if he was planning to go ahead with his poll promise of ending birthright citizenship, to which he said, "Yeah, absolutely."</p>

<p>"We're going to end that because it's ridiculous," he said during an interview on NBC's "Meet the Press".&nbsp;</p>

<p>The President-elect said he's planning on changing the practice using executive action, noting that there are other options.</p>

<p>In a small olive branch offering to those advocating for allowing some undocumented migrants -- a key source of labour for much of the US economy -- to stay, Mr Trump said he will "work with the Democrats" on the so-called "dreamers" -- the immigrants who've become successful residents by getting good jobs and starting businesses after entering the United States illegally as young children.</p>

<p>"I don't want to be breaking up families, so the only way you don't break up the family is you keep them together and you have to send them all back," he added. If the Trump administration goes ahead with this plan, it would mean expelling legal US citizens, including those who got citizenship through birth, so that they are not separated from their families.</p>

<p>Several Republicans, including Mr Trump, have argued that birthright citizenship gives rise to "birth tourism", in which pregnant women from other countries enter the US illegally, or on tourist visas, to give birth there, before returning to their home countries. This way, their children are born US citizens.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>What Does The Law Say?</strong></h3>

<p>Birthright citizenship is a legal principle under the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution. This principle was confirmed in the US Constitution in 1868, after the four years of the American Civil War, to overturn the Supreme Court decision Dred Scott v. Sandford, which denied basic rights to African Americans. The judgement said that enslaved people were not US citizens and, therefore, could not expect any protection from the federal government or the courts.</p>

<p>Under the law, citizenship is automatically granted to individuals upon birth on US soil. "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside," the 14th Amendment states.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Under the constitution, birthright citizenship is guaranteed to children born on US soil, "regardless of their parent's immigration or citizenship status," according to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/topics/birthright-citizenship" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">American Immigration Council</a>'s website.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"For over a century, the U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted the 14th Amendment as conferring U.S. citizenship automatically to anyone born on U.S. soil," it adds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The US employs a combination of birthright citizenship-- ancestry-based citizenship and birthplace-based citizenship.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Birthplace-based citizenship, which grants citizenship based on place of birth, is formally referred to as jus soli, a Latin term meaning "right of the soil", while restricted ancestry-based citizenship, referred to as jus sanguinis, &nbsp;extends citizenship to children born abroad to US citizens, provided statutory requirements are met.</p>

<h3><strong>How Can Birthright Citizenship Be Halted?</strong></h3>

<p>To implement any changes in the Constitution, Mr Trump's administration will require the support of a two-thirds majority in both chambers of Congress-- the Senate and the House of Representatives. In addition, the amendment must also be ratified by three-fourths of all state legislatures, according to a report by <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-end-birthright-citizenship-explained-b2661867.html" rel="No Follow, No Index" target="_blank">Independent</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Republicans have a 53 to 47 majority in the Senate and a 220 to 215 majority in the House, meaning America's grand old party (GOP) does not have the required number in either chamber.</p>

<p>In a 2011 article, the American Immigration Council noted that if birthright citizenship is ever halted in the US, it would cause parents to have to prove their children's citizenship status. "Our birth certificates are proof of our citizenship. If birthright citizenship were eliminated, U.S. citizens could no longer use their birth certificates as proof of citizenship," the council said.</p>

<h3><strong>What Donald Trump Can Do To End It?</strong></h3>

<p>Though Mr Trump did not give a lot of details on how he was planning to end birthright citizenship in his interview, the matter was extensively discussed in a 2023 post on his campaign website. According to a report by the Associated Press, the website said Mr Trump would issue an executive order on the first day of his presidency, making it clear that federal agencies "require that at least one parent be a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident for their future children to become automatic US citizens."</p>

<p>Per the incoming President, the executive order would make clear that children of illegal immigrants "should not be issued passports, Social Security numbers, or be eligible for certain taxpayer-funded welfare benefits."</p>

<p>However, the law is clear that birthright citizenship can't be ended by executive order and any such move would almost certainly end up in litigation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But, Mr Trump may be inclined to take a shot anyway through the courts, said Alex Nowrasteh, vice president for economic and social policy studies at the pro-immigration Cato Institute.</p>

<p>"I don't take his statements very seriously. He has been saying things like this for almost a decade...He didn't do anything to further this agenda when he was president before. The law and judges are near uniformly opposed to his legal theory that the children of illegal immigrants born in the United States are not citizens," Nowrasteh said.</p>

<p>Mr Trump could steer Congress to pass a law to end birthright citizenship but would still face a legal challenge that it violates the Constitution.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Missing photographer Hannah Kobayashi's ex-boyfriend got "jealous" of her alleged fake husband, a source close to the case revealed. Ms Kobayashi, who vanished after a trip to New York, was travelling with Amun Muniz-Miranda, her ex, and Alan Cacace, an Argentine national she was believed to have secretly married. The FBI is now investigating the case as a potential green card visa scheme gone wrong, <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/10/us-news/hannah-kobayashi-ex-jealous-of-alleged-green-card-husband-source/ " rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">The NY&nbsp;Post</a> reported.<br />
<br />
Sources close to the investigation suggested that Muniz-Miranda, who has a history of legal issues, may have played a role in orchestrating the suspicious marriage. "Maybe [Muniz-Miranda] got jealous of Hannah and Alan," said a colleague who worked with Kobayashi in Haiku, Hawaii. The source added that Ms Kobayashi kept the marriage a secret, and only a few close friends were aware of it.<br />
<br />
Muniz-Miranda's legal history complicates the case. In 2021, police arrested him in Texas for false identification, and he also faced a DUI arrest in Haiku in 2020. These incidents, along with growing suspicions around the marriage, led the FBI to focus on potential marriage fraud, a federal crime punishable by up to five years in prison.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Ms Kobayashi's family was shocked to learn that she never mentioned her marriage to Cacace. The photographer, who seemed to lead a normal life before her disappearance, later claimed that she was "tricked" and swindled out of her funds by someone she thought she loved. After she vanished, authorities discovered that she was in contact with an immigration lawyer, which further gave rise to suspicions that the marriage was part of a larger scheme.<br />
<br />
Ms Kobayashi's behaviour in the days before her disappearance raised alarms. She got off a flight to New York and sent troubling messages to her family. She was reported missing on November 8.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
On November 12, she bought a bus ticket to the Mexican border and was last seen crossing into Tijuana, Mexico, the following day. Police declared her a <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/missing-hannah-kobayashi-seen-crossing-into-mexico-voluntarily-lapd-says-7164325 ">“voluntary missing person”</a> earlier this month.<br />
<br />
Friends and family insist it was unlike Ms Kobayashi to disappear without notice. Ms Kobayashi's father, who had flown to Los Angeles to search for his daughter, died by suicide after being unable to find her.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Damascus has fallen. Once again. One of the oldest cities in the world has fallen. To rise again from its rubble, heralding a new order. In its rise and fall, Damascus has lessons for all civilisations, all rebels, and all regimes.</p>

<p>It was in July 2012 that rebels penetrated Damascus, hitherto considered inviolable. Both the regime and the rebels understood its importance—military and symbolic. The rebels advanced to the heavily militarised capital of Syria but did not make any real gains. A year later, in August 2013, the Syrian regime launched Operation Capital Shield. The capital had to be shielded, and any amount of force was acceptable to thwart any rebel attack. The city was safeguarded through the use of disproportionate force against rebels operating from around Damascus. Only temporarily so. Eleven years later, the regime has fallen. For the sixth time, at least, since the 1st century AD Roman conquest of Damascus's Seleucid empire.</p>

<h2><strong>The Cycle Of Power</strong></h2>

<p>Not only has Damascus seen violent regime changes, it has also experienced ethnic and religious clashes, including the Crusades. But in almost every significant clash—civilisational or political—one thing has stayed common: recapturing of the lost ground. The cyclical nature of power. The centuries-old unabated contestation on the socio-political turf of Damascus has defined its character. The current developments in Syria, therefore, ought to be examined through a more expansive glass of history and culture.</p>

<p>Peter Frankopan's <em>The Silk Roads</em> underscores the importance of Damascus as an emporium adjacent to one of the most thriving trade routes of the world. Despite no easy access to the Mediterranean Sea, it was in the league of great cosmopolitan cities such as the Byzantine Constantinople (Istanbul), the Greco-Roman Antioch, and the old Chinese capital city of Chang'an. Its early embrace of agricultural practices owing to the natural inland water systems of the Barada River and investments in irrigation infrastructure made Damascus a land of plenty.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even at the peak of Christian-Muslim religious clashes around the 10th century AD, traders had a breezy time in Damascus. Muslim traders from Spain, for example, were protected by the Christians of Damascus. For one of the oldest inhabited cities of the world, with no religious underpinnings originating from any religious text, trade was vital. Traders, the outsiders, were therefore immune to the local political and religious strife. Damascene society depended on the “outsiders” to retain its regional power as a seat of sociocultural dominance. Damascus, as perceived today, is essentially a result of four centuries of Ottoman rule that came to an end with the First World War. The city was the seat of the Turkish Wali.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Lands Of 'Outsiders'</strong></h2>

<p>Damascus, curiously, wasn't ruled by a local dynasty ever since the overthrow of the Aram-Damascus kingdom in the eighth century BC. This feature makes Damascus closer to Delhi than its Phoenician, Judean, and Arab neighbours. The “outsiders” soon started becoming the insiders, and the city evolved. Delhi has this in common with Damascus and lessons from the latter are, therefore, pertinent to us.</p>

<p>The Assad regime's rise and fall alerts us to the limitations of liberalism when it stays within the elite confines. It is always prone to crumbling under the weight of popular mobilisation. The mainstay of Syria's multicultural nature was consociational engagements between different ethno-religious groups at different times in history. The Assad regime's politicisation of the Syrian society's multiculturalism was self-serving. After the military coup of 1970 that installed Hafez al-Assad as a totalitarian ruler, all forms of dissent began to be crushed, ironically, by the ruling Ba'ath Party, the regional champion of dissenters in the Arab world.</p>

<p>When liberalism gets weaponised thus, it spells doom for not just the conservatives but also the quintessential liberal values. Bashar al-Assad carried forward this legacy of his father with more zeal and ruthlessness. The rebellion against him, therefore, needs to be seen as not only political but also socio-religious. The Sunni Muslims of Syria, the majority group, clearly had had enough of the marginalisation heaped on them by the Alawite (Shia) Assad family and their acolytes.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Liberalism And Liberals</strong></h2>

<p>This should appear familiar to us. The undermining of liberal values by liberals themselves, the ascent of conservative forces, the politics of exclusion, and the many fires of violent ethno-religious clashes, we have seen it all. Politics of exclusion, even when the most inclusionary players indulge in it, never ends well. The civil war in Syria needs to be seen as another element in the continuum that has the return of the Taliban in Afghanistan, the Islamic Revolution of Iran of 1979, the reactionary overthrow of the Kemalist order in Turkey by Erdogan, and the fall of Sheikh Hasina in Dhaka as landmark events.</p>

<p>Immediately after the fall of Damascus, scenes of celebrations (and looting) started flooding the news and social media. Impervious to them, Israel moved to plant its flag beyond the earlier buffer zone. And this is the lesson Delhi's regime and rebels must pay heed to.</p>

       <description><![CDATA[The Mangione family, long seen as "beloved" royalty in Baltimore, is reeling from the recent arrest of Luigi Mangione, accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Mangione family, long seen as “beloved” royalty in Baltimore, is reeling from the recent arrest of <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/who-is-luigi-mangione-man-behind-unitedhealthcare-ceos-murder-7212585">Luigi Mangione</a>, accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Known for their immense wealth, philanthropy, and a long history in the healthcare sector, the Mangione family's legacy now stands in contrast to the shocking crime allegedly committed by Luigi, a 26-year-old University of Pennsylvania graduate.</p>

<p>Luigi's family history is one of immigrant success. His late grandfather, Nick Mangione Sr, often shared his rags-to-riches story, proudly recounting his rise from humble beginnings. "I didn't have two nickels to rub together when my father died when I was 11, yet I still became a millionaire," Nick had said to <a href="https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/community/criminal-justice/luigi-mangione-family-baltimore-towson-GPRMNCATXRGDJAUZXJQO6RHSHU/ " rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">The Baltimore Sun</a>, recalling his father's struggles as an Italian immigrant and his own determination. "What other country can you do that in? None that I can think of."</p>

<p>Nick Mangione's empire spanned a range of industries, from owning local resorts and country clubs to operating nursing homes and even a radio station. He and his wife, Mary, were also philanthropists, donating millions, including over $1 million to the Greater Baltimore Medical Centre, where all of their 37 grandchildren were born. In honour of their contributions, the hospital even named its obstetrics unit after the Mangione family.</p>

<p>The Mangione Family Foundation has also made significant donations to institutions like St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and St. Joseph Medical Centre at the University of Maryland. Loyola University's pools are named after them, and several family members, including six of Nick and Mary's children, attended the local college.</p>

<p>The family's influence also extends into the political sphere, with Nick's grandson, Nino Mangione, serving in Maryland's House of Delegates.</p>

<p>Despite their sterling reputation, the Mangiones were blindsided by the arrest of Luigi. The motive allegedly comes from Luigi's anger toward the US healthcare system – a sector his family has greatly supported.</p>

<p>According to reports, Luigi Mangione is accused of fatally shooting Brian Thompson in a Midtown sidewalk attack, allegedly fuelled by his disdain for what he viewed as a “mafioso” of greedy healthcare companies. His uncle, Jerry O'Keefe, told the <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/10/us-news/inside-luigi-mangiones-family-of-beloved-baltimore-royalty-its-a-shock-for-all-of-us/ " rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">NY Post</a>, “It's a shock for all of us. I can't say anymore. The statement summed it up for all of us. We don't know anything more than what's been reported in the media.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President-elect Donald Trump has used a photograph of himself sitting next to US First Lady Jill Biden to unveil his new line of fragrances. Called 'Fight, Fight, Fight', the fragrance line includes perfume for women and cologne for men, each retailing at $199.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the GetTrumpFragrances.com website, they are also selling bundles of two or more fragrances, while there is a 50% discount on the second item.</p>

<p>"A fragrance your enemies can't resist!" Trump wrote to introduce his latest product.</p>

<p>"Here are my new Trump Perfumes &amp; Colognes! I call them Fight, Fight, Fight because they represent us WINNING. Great Christmas gifts for the family. Go to&nbsp;<a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://gettrumpfragrances.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1733978143200000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3J03hGRaJS235CSgv_pXQs" href="http://gettrumpfragrances.com/" target="_blank">gettrumpfragrances.com/</a>. Merry Christmas, and Happy New Year," Trump wrote on his <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113618551122258874" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">Truth Social platform</a>.</p>

<p>The image of Trump seated near Jill Biden was taken on December 7 in Paris where they attended the re-opening of Notre Dame Cathedral.</p>

<p>The event was held nearly five years after the prestigious landmark faced a massive fire that toppled its spire.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the viral image, the US First Lady and Trump can be seen in conversation, while there is an empty chair between them, which was marked for Brigitte Macron, French President Emmanuel Macron's wife.</p>

<p>The official website of the brand does not describe the actual scents of both cologne and perfume. "Our fragrances are curated to capture the essence of success and determination, with each scent symbolizing victory and strength," it reads.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-fragrance-jill-biden-fight-fight-fight-perfumes-cologne/" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">CBS News</a>, the fragrances mark the latest merchandise offer from the US President-elect, who over the years has launched a wide range of products branded with his name. Among these include the watches that are being sold for up to $100,000 as well as the "President Donald J. Trump First Edition" silver coins for $100 each.</p>

<p>Trump and Jill Biden's all-smiles picture comes after months of bitter takedowns on the campaign trail, wherein the Republican leader even said that US President Joe Biden was “thrown out like a dog” after he announced his exit from the US presidential race.</p>

<p>After Trump's victory in the November 5 election against US Vice President Kamala Harris, Biden met him for nearly two hours at the Oval Office.&nbsp;During the meeting, he was also handed over a handwritten letter by Jill Biden to deliver to his wife, Melania Trump, who remained absent at Trump's post-election visit to the White House.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Akshay Nanavati, a former US Marine with Indian roots, is pushing the boundaries of human endurance with a solo ski quest across Antarctica. This 110-day expedition, never before attempted, will see him confront temperatures as low as -40 degrees Celsius.</p>

<p>Despite his years as a Marine, accustomed to harsh conditions, Nanavati's mother, based in Bengaluru, had a different concern when she learned of his Antarctica expedition. Four months ago, her only question was, "Do they have good hotels there?" A bemused Akshay had to explain that his accommodations would be far from luxurious - a tent, with a four-minute walk to the nearest toilet, as reported by <em>The Times of India</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a boy studying in Bengaluru, Akshay always had a penchant for swimming and running, his father Ajay told the publication. He added that as a teenager, Akshay was struggling with drugs and alcohol. At that time, &nbsp;a Ridley Scott movie Black Hawk Down inspired him to join the US Marines. Even with a blood disorder that "two doctors said would kill him in Marine Corps boot camp", Akshay not only managed to survive but also served in Iraq.</p>

<p>Nanavati previously achieved a remarkable feat, becoming one of only 26 individuals to successfully ski up the remote Axel Heiberg Glacier in Antarctica. However, this challenging expedition resulted in frostbite, leading to the amputation of two fingers. One finger could not be saved, while the other was preemptively removed, as his wife Melissa explained to the Times of India, "Once you get frostbite, you're always more prone to it in the future."</p>

<p>Akshay, who successfully raised close to Rs 9 crore for his solo ski expedition, confidently stated his readiness to conquer the Antarctic wilderness. He emphasized his rigorous training for extreme conditions and the invaluable support he will receive from Antarctic Logistics and Eric Philips, an experienced polar expedition guide. "Polar travel in Antarctica, while not as inherently dangerous as free soloing or mountaineering, presents a level of suffering that surpasses any other voluntary struggle I've ever experienced," Akshay shared on Instagram.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chronic back pain has emerged as a point of interest in the murder investigation of UnitedHealthcare CEO, who 26-year-old Luigi Mangione allegedly gunned down in New York last week.</p>

<p>Mangione, an Ivy League graduate, yelled and struggled as he was taken into a courtroom in Pennsylvania after he was held from a McDonald's in Altoona on Monday, ending over a week-long nationwide manhunt after Brian Thompson was shot down in Manhattan. He is in custody in Pennsylvania and faces multiple charges there as well as murder charges in New York.</p>

<p>As police say the head of one of US's biggest health insurers was deliberately targeted, a trail of posts on social media by Mangione could point to likely grievances he harboured against the healthcare system. Mangione was also arrested with a manifesto where he accused health insurance companies for putting corporate greed over the well-being of people, according to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/10/us-news/luigi-mangiones-back-pain-was-so-intense-that-he-couldnt-be-physically-intimate-with-anyone-former-landlord-says/"><em>NY Post</em></a>. This has led to theories that the murder could be linked to Mangione's disappointment with the insurance provider.</p>

<p>Mangione lived in Hawaii in 2022 and, according to his former roommate RJ Martin, suffered from back pain, and was hoping to strengthen his back. After a surfing lesson, Mangione was "in bed for about a week" because of the pain, Martin told <em>CNN</em>. Earlier this year, Mangione confirmed he'd had back surgery and sent him photos of the X-rays, Martin said.</p>

<p>He also told the manager of Surfbreak, the co-living residence in Hawaii he resided at, that he had a back problem, and in August of 2023 sent him pictures of a back surgery, according to the New York Times. "His spine was kind of misaligned. He said his lower vertebrae were almost like a half-inch off, and I think it pinched a nerve," Mr Martin told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/nyregion/united-healthcare-ceo-shooting-luigi-mangione.html"><em>New York Times</em></a>.&nbsp;"He knew that dating and being physically intimate with his back condition wasn't possible," he added, while saying that Mangione was a young man yearning a normal lifestyle.</p>

<p>Mr Martin said that Mangione left Hawaii in the summer of 2023, presumably for an operation on his back. In August that year, he checked in via text to see how his friend was doing, "and he sent me back pictures of his back surgery."</p>

<p>On his X profile, he shared a picture of an x-ray of a spinal surgery and on GoodReads, he reviewed a book called "Crooked: Outwitting the Back Pain Industry and Getting on the Road to Recovery."</p>

<p>Another account was narrated by Paul Piek, a 21-year-old software testing professional from Flensburg, Germany, met Mangione in March while watching a muay thai boxing fight in Ao Nang, Thailand. The two and another friend of Piek's met up again in Krabi, Thailand on April 8 and roadtripped through Khao Sok and Bangkok, where they shared a hotel room for four nights and visited temples. "He told us he did (muy thai) before his injury," said Piek.</p>

<p>Piek said Mangione told him he was interested in hiking when they met, with no further mention of his back injury. "It didn't seem like a problem," though he did opt out of one guided hike for an easier walk, saying he was ill.</p>

<p>Mangione had left his previous employer Truecar, a car-purchse platform with offices in California, in 2023, the company said. A colleague he worked with there told Reuters he took leave during the middle of 2023 for about two months, a move the colleague's manager told him was due to back-related issues.</p>

<p>Further, a deleted Reddit account allegedly associated with Mangione wrote multiple comments in a subreddit for people diagnosed with spondylolisthesis, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tylerroush/2024/12/10/unitedhealthcare-shooting-suspect-luigi-mangione-appeared-to-suffer-from-rare-back-condition-heres-what-to-know/"><em>Forbes</em></a>&nbsp;reported. The user wrote the condition "went bad on me" and was "completely devastating as a young athletic person" because they learned the condition would force them into "a desk job for the rest of my life."</p>

<p>In a 14-page handwritten document that Sky News identified as having been uploaded to his Google Drive account in 2021 and which has not been independently verified by Reuters, Mangione said he had a back injury known as an L5-S1 isthmic spondylolisthesis, in which one of the bones in the spine slips forward and presses on the vertebra below it. Mangione's notes mention that his condition involved a stress fracture in the pars bone that connects the vertebrae to the spinal column.</p>

<p>Mangione's profile on X includes an X-ray of a person who has had an L5-S1 spinal operation in which two vertebra are surgically fused together. The surgery has an overall success rate of 80%, according to the National Institutes of Health.</p>]]></content:encoded>

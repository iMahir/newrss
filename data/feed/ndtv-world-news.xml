       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media giants on Friday hit out at a landmark Australian law banning them from signing up under-16s, describing it as a rush job littered with "many unanswered questions".</p>

<p>The UN children's charity UNICEF Australia joined the fray, warning the law was no "silver bullet" against online harm and could push kids into "covert and unregulated" spaces online.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the legislation may not be implemented perfectly -- much like existing age restrictions on alcohol -- but it was "the right thing to do".</p>

<p>The crackdown on sites like Facebook, Instagram and X, approved by parliament late Thursday, will lead to "better outcomes and less harm for young Australians", he told reporters.</p>

<p>Platforms have a "social responsibility" to make children's safety a priority, the prime minister said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We've got your back, is our message to Australian parents."</p>

<p>Social media firms that fail to comply with the law face fines of up to Aus$50 million (US$32.5 million).</p>

<p>TikTok said Friday it was "disappointed" in the law, accusing the government of ignoring mental health, online safety and youth experts who had opposed the ban.</p>

<p>"It's entirely likely the ban could see young people pushed to darker corners of the internet where no community guidelines, safety tools, or protections exist," a TikTok spokesperson said.</p>

<h3><strong>'Unanswered questions'</strong></h3>

<p>Tech companies said that despite the law's perceived shortcomings, they would engage with the government on shaping how it could be implemented in the next 12 months.</p>

<p>The legislation offers almost no details on how the rules will be enforced -- prompting concern among experts that it will simply be a symbolic, unenforceable piece of legislation.</p>

<p>Meta -- owner of Facebook and Instagram -- &nbsp;called for consultation on the rules to ensure a "technically feasible outcome that does not place an onerous burden on parents and teens".</p>

<p>But the company added it was concerned "about the process, which rushed the legislation through while failing to properly consider the evidence, what industry already does to ensure age-appropriate experiences, and the voices of young people".&nbsp;</p>

<p>A Snapchat spokesperson said the company had raised "serious concerns" about the law and that "many unanswered questions" remained about how it would work.</p>

<p>But the company said it would engage closely with government to develop an approach balancing "privacy, safety and practicality".&nbsp;</p>

<p>"As always, Snap will comply with any applicable laws and regulations in Australia," it said.</p>

<p>UNICEF Australia policy chief Katie Maskiell said young people need to be protected online but also need to be included in the digital world.</p>

<p>"This ban risks pushing children into increasingly covert and unregulated online spaces as well as preventing them from accessing aspects of the online world essential to their wellbeing," she said.</p>

<h3><strong>Global attention</strong></h3>

<p>One of the biggest issues will be privacy -- what age-verification information is used, how it is collected and by whom.</p>

<p>Social media companies remain adamant that age-verification should be the job of app stores, but the government believes tech platforms should be responsible.</p>

<p>Exemptions will likely be granted to some companies, such as WhatsApp and YouTube, which teenagers may need to use for recreation, school work or other reasons.</p>

<p>The legislation will be closely monitored by other countries, with many weighing whether to implement similar bans.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lawmakers from Spain to Florida have proposed social media bans for young teens, although none of the measures have been implemented yet.</p>

<p>China has restricted access for minors since 2021, with under-14s not allowed to spend more than 40 minutes a day on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok.</p>

<p>Online gaming time for children is also limited in China.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Boise State women's volleyball team have withdrawn from the Mountain West Conference tournament, alleging that their opponent, San Jose State University (SJSU), had a transgender athlete on their roster. The championship finals started on Wednesday (Nov 27) in Las Vegas as Boise State qualified for the semis after beating Utah State in the quarter-finals. However, the team refused to play against SJSU after a court ruling allowed Blaire Fleming, the transgender athlete in question, to compete in the tournament.</p>

<p>“The decision to not continue to play in the 2024 Mountain West Volleyball Championship tournament was not an easy one,” Boise State said in a statement.</p>

<p>“Our team overcame forfeitures to earn a spot in the tournament field and fought for the win over Utah State in the first round on Wednesday. They should not have to forgo this opportunity while waiting for a more thoughtful and better system that serves all athletes," it added.</p>

<p>Notably, it is not the first time when Boise State have forfeited their matches against SJSU. During the regular season, the team refused to play them on two occasions as other Mountain West teams such as Wyoming, Utah State and Nevada followed suit.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-transgender-volleyball-player-blaire-fleming-allowed-to-compete-in-womens-championship-7107889" rel="noindex, nofollow"><strong>Also Read | US Transgender Volleyball Player Blaire Fleming Allowed To Compete In Women's Championship</strong></a></p>

<h3><strong>SJSU advance</strong></h3>

<p>Boise State's refusal to play means that SJSU have moved unopposed to the tournament final, scheduled to take place on Saturday where the winner of top-seeded Colorado State and No. 5 San Diego State will potentially square off against them.</p>

<p>Reacting to Boise State's stance, SJSU released a statement saying they were 'disappointed' with the decision but added that their team was preparing for the championship final.</p>

<p>“In this time of Thanksgiving, we are especially thankful for those who continue to engage in civil and respectful discourse. We celebrate and support all of our students, including our student-athletes as they compete for our community on this holiday weekend,” SJSU told <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/28/sport/boise-state-mountain-west-volleyball-spt-intl/index.html" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>CNN</em></a>.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, US District Judge S Kato Crews delivered a judgment allowing Ms Fleming to play in the tournament after several opposing players as well as Fleming's teammates filed a lawsuit against the team and the tournament organisers for allowing the transgender athlete to play in the women's tournament.</p>

<p>The plaintiffs claimed that university and conference officials violated their Title IX rights, which ensures that men and women are treated fairly in educational settings, including collegiate sports.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The World Health Organization on Thursday urged countries to step up surveillance for bird flu after the first case was detected in a child in the United States.</p>

<p>A small but growing number of H5N1 avian influenza infections have been detected in humans around the world in recent years, WHO epidemic and pandemic preparedness and prevention director Maria Van Kerkhove told a press conference.</p>

<p>"What we really need globally, in the US and abroad, is much stronger surveillance in animals: in wild birds, in poultry, in animals that are known to be susceptible to infection, which includes swine, which include dairy cattle, to better understand the circulation in these animals," she said.</p>

<p>H5N1 first emerged in 1996 but since 2020, the number of outbreaks in birds has grown exponentially, alongside an increase in the number of infected mammals.</p>

<p>The strain has led to the deaths of tens of millions of poultry, with wild birds and land and marine mammals also infected.</p>

<p>Human cases recorded in Europe and the United States since the virus surged have largely been mild.</p>

<p>In March, infections were detected in several dairy herds across the United States.</p>

<p>US health officials believe the risk for the general public is low -- albeit higher for those working directly with livestock animals including birds, dairy cattle and more.</p>

<p>Last Friday, US authorities said a child in California had become the first in the United States to test positive for bird flu infection. Health officials offered checks and preventive treatment to exposed contacts at the child's day-care centre.</p>

<p>The child had mild symptoms and was said to be recovering at home following treatment with flu antivirals.</p>

<p>"Including this most recent case, 55 human cases of H5 bird flu have now been reported in the United States during 2024, with 29 in California," the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.</p>

<p>Van Kerkhove said all but two of those had known exposure to infected animals.</p>

<p>"We have not seen evidence of human-to-human infection. But again, for each of these human detected cases, we want to see a very thorough investigation taking place," she said.</p>

<p>"We need much stronger efforts in terms of reducing the risk of infection between animals to new species and to humans," she added, notably through testing and proper protective equipment.</p>

<p>Van Kerkhove, who was the WHO's Covid-19 technical lead, stressed the importance of preparing "for when or if we will be in a situation where we are in a flu pandemic".</p>

<p>"We're not in that situation yet, but we do need more vigilance."</p><p><i>(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canada's antitrust regulator is taking Alphabet Inc.'s Google to court for alleged abuse of dominance in web advertising, adding to a mounting pile of legal challenges for the search giant.</p>

<p>Google illegally tied together advertising tools to maintain market supremacy and used this position to skew ad auctions by preferring its own tools, the Competition Bureau alleges.</p>

<p>The agency said Thursday it applied to the Competition Tribunal, a court-like independent body, for three forms of redress:</p>

<p>1. That Google sells two ad tools - publisher ad server DFP and ad exchange AdX</p>

<p>2. That Google pay a penalty worth three times the value of the benefit it derived, or 3% of global gross revenue if that number can't be "reasonably determined"</p>

<p>3. For Google to stop anti-competitive practices.</p>

<p>The case comes one week after the US Justice Department and a group of states proposed major changes to Google including a forced sale of its web browser, claiming it had illegally monopolized online search. Mountain View, California-based parent company Alphabet is one of the world's most valuable companies, with a market capitalization of about $2 trillion.</p>

<p>In an emailed statement, Google's Vice President of Global Ads Dan Taylor said the Canadian complaint ignores "intense competition where ad buyers and sellers have plenty of choice" and the company will make its case in court.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A similar probe into Google's ad practices is advancing in the UK.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Bird flu's spread among dairy cows, poultry, and humans has raised concerns about its adaptability.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A potential health risk has emerged in California after traces of the deadly avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, were found in raw milk. The virus was detected during routine testing of cream-top, whole raw milk produced by Raw Farm LLC. In response, the company has voluntarily recalled the affected batch, which carries a "best by" date of November 27, following a request from state authorities.This discovery has heightened concerns among public health officials, particularly as the bird flu has shown an unusual spread among dairy cows across the United States this year.</p>

<p>This multistate outbreak of the flu, which is technically the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, was first reported in March in dairy cows. The rising frequency and diversity of mammalian infections in recent years have heightened concerns about the virus's adaptability and its potential for cross-species transmission.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR24-039.aspx"><em>California Department of Public Health (CDPH)</em></a>, no illnesses associated with this lot of raw milk have been reported. Out of an abundance of caution, and due to the ongoing spread of bird flu in dairy cows, poultry, and sporadic human cases, consumers should not consume any of the affected raw milk. Customers should immediately return any remaining product to the retail point of purchase. CDPH is also notifying retailers to remove the affected raw milk from their shelves.</p>

<p>The County of Santa Clara Public Health Laboratory has been testing raw milk products from retail stores as a second line of consumer protection. The county identified bird flu in one sample of raw milk purchased at a retail outlet. The testing was then verified by the California Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory System.</p>

<p><strong>Risks Associated with Raw Milk</strong></p>

<p>Public health experts have long warned consumers against consuming raw milk or raw milk products due to elevated risks of foodborne illness. Outbreaks due to Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, toxin producing E. coli, Brucella, Campylobacter, and many other bacteria have all been reported related to consuming raw dairy products. Raw milk products are not pasteurized, a heating process that kills bacteria and viruses such as bird flu.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pasteurized milk and milk products are safe to consume because the heating process kills pathogens, including bird flu, that can cause illness.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Australia's controversial new law barring under-16s from social media is one of the toughest crackdowns yet on platforms including Facebook and TikTok as governments worldwide grasp for ways to protect children from harmful content.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australia's controversial new law barring under-16s from social media is one of the toughest crackdowns yet on platforms including Facebook and TikTok as governments worldwide grasp for ways to protect children from harmful content.</p>

<p>The blanket ban, passed late Thursday night, establishes some of the most stringent internet usage restrictions outside of China and other non-democratic regimes and could provide impetus to other governments to act. From Florida and Texas to France and the UK, authorities have attempted - or are considering - raising social-media age limits or tightening content oversight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lurking behind the debate, and driving the change, are the dark corners of social media that continue to extract a tragic toll. Like the 16-year-old boy, with a social media account filled with videos about hopelessness and death, who stepped in front of a train in Bayport, New York. Or the 15-year-old Australian schoolgirl who hanged herself from a tree at home in February 2022 after suffering years of social-media bullying.</p>

<p>While Australia's ban is wildly popular with voters - 77% support the move, according to a YouGov survey - it has unleashed a maelstrom of criticism from big tech. Major operators including Meta Platforms Inc. say the rules are ineffective or flawed, while X, owned by self-styled free speech absolutist Elon Musk, questioned whether the ban is lawful, heralding a possible court challenge. Academics worry about the unintended consequences of a blunt ban.</p>

<p>Under the new law, which will take effect in around 12 months, digital platforms including Snapchat, Instagram, and X will be responsible for enforcing the age limit, with penalties of as much as A$50 million ($32 million) for breaches. However, it's still unclear how the platforms will verify ages, with the government already ruling out the use of official documents, such as a passport, due to privacy concerns. Kids who find a way past verification controls won't be fined, and nor will their parents.</p>

<p>The law also threatens to upend the business model of some of the world's most valuable companies as they face a global backlash against problems blamed on their services, such as increasing mental health issues, online scams, lower academic performance and grooming. A successful ban would deprive them of a key user group - millions of teenagers who are coveted by advertisers and who the companies want to lock in at an early age.</p>

<p>In a statement, Meta said while it will respect the law, it was "concerned about the process which rushed the legislation through while failing to properly consider the evidence, what industry already does to ensure age-appropriate experiences, and the voices of young people."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The World Health Organization issued one of the clearest warnings in September after studying social-media use among almost 280,000 school-aged children in 44 countries and regions, one of the largest surveys of its kind. The WHO warned of far-reaching consequences for adolescent development and their long-term health stemming from the rise in problematic social-media use.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Geneva-based organization called for "immediate and sustained action."&nbsp;</p>

<p>This week's response from Australia, forcing through age thresholds irrespective of whether the child has parental permission, sets a new precedent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We want Australian children to have a childhood," Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said as he introduced the legislation last week. Social media platforms usually require account holders to be at least 13 years old.</p>

<p>However, the simplicity of Australia's solution has instead highlighted the complexity of the problem.&nbsp;</p>

<p>YouTube, deemed by the Australian government to be a health- and education-related platform, is exempt from the ban, even though the comments section under videos can be as toxic as other corners of the internet. Online gaming and messaging services like WhatsApp and Discord are also exempt, even though they too can be used for bullying and grooming.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Subscribe to The Bloomberg Australia Podcast on Apple, Spotify, on YouTube, or wherever you listen.</p>

<p>One of the biggest weaknesses of a ban on young people is that it doesn't curb the production of harmful content, said Lisa Given, a professor of information sciences at RMIT University in Melbourne. She said platform owners should focus on disabling negative algorithms, which can overwhelm social-media users with content whether they like it or not. At the same time, there should be more investment in digital literacy for children and parents, Given said.</p>

<p>"This legislation is really ill-conceived," she said. "It's a simple proposed fix for something that's actually really complicated. And where did 16 come from? It seems like it was pulled out of the air."</p>

<p>Perhaps inevitably, almost all of the largest social-media companies including TikTok, X and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, expressed concerns about the law in submissions to a truncated Senate inquiry before the bill passed.</p>

<p>TikTok, owned by China's ByteDance Ltd., said the legislation was "rushed" and "unworkable," and riddled with "unanswered questions and unresolved concerns."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Snapchat-owner Snap Inc. said previous international attempts at broad and mandatory age verification had failed. X, known as Twitter before it was bought by Musk, said it had "serious concerns as to the lawfulness of the bill."</p>

<p>Unicef, the United Nations agency for children, said Australia's ban would push young people into darker, unregulated places online. The law also risks compromising children's rights and severing their access to information that's vital to their welfare, Unicef said.</p>

<p>"Instead of banning children, we should hold social media companies accountable for providing age-appropriate, secure, and supportive online environments," Katie Maskiell, head of child rights policy and advocacy at Unicef Australia, said in a submission to the parliament.</p>

<p>Elected officials across the world tasked with overseeing social media find themselves in an uncomfortable squeeze. Many parents feel helpless and angry, and want children spending less time online. Their demands that governments step in are amplified by tragedies of youth suicides caused by social media bullying or sextortion. But it's difficult to isolate the obvious dangers of social media without destroying its benefits.</p>

<p>"It is impossible to be a teen in most parts of the world without social media," Stephen Scheeler, the former head of Facebook in Australia and New Zealand, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. "Controlling that access from a parental point of view or government point of view is not as easy as it sounds."&nbsp;</p>

<p>A number of other nations and US states have attempted to curb children's access to social media, with limited success.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A Florida bill prohibiting children under 14 from having social media accounts has faced legal challenges, as have moves from states such as Arkansas and Ohio that would require minors to secure parental approval to use social media.</p>

<p>Norway wants to impose a minimum age of 15 on social media use after data showed many children under 13, the current age limit, still use popular platforms, the Guardian and other publications reported last month.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even if Australia's ban proves hard or impossible to enforce, more countries are likely to take similar steps as concerns grow about the impact of social media on children, said Simon Kemp, founder of Singapore-based digital consulting firm Kepios Pte., which specializes in analyzing online behaviors.</p>

<p>"I would be very surprised if we don't see more of this," Kemp said.</p>

<p>France has renewed a push to keep under-15s off social media, Politico reported this week. French Education Minister Anne Genetet, a medical doctor by training, told Politico at a meeting of European Union education and youth ministers that the EU should follow Australia's example.</p>

<p>The UK's secretary of state for science and technology, Peter Kyle, has been in contact with the Australian government to learn more about its ban and its reasoning, according to the Guardian. Kyle has said he's not ruling out a ban in future, but any measures must be founded on evidence. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US conservative political commentator Candace Owens has been denied entry to New Zealand for a scheduled speaking engagement, with immigration officials citing her ban from another country as the basis for the decision. This follows Australia's recent rejection of her visa application over controversial comments. Known for her provocative commentary and inflammatory takes on social and political issues, Owens has built a significant following on social media, with over three million followers on YouTube.<br />
<br />
<strong>1) Early life and influences</strong><br />
<br />
According to a report in <a href="http://https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-communications/the-gospel-of-candace-owens" rel="nofollow noindex">The New Yorker</a>, Candace Owens described her early years, spent in low-income housing in Stamford, Connecticut, as “dysfunctional.” At nine, her family moved in with her grandparents, where her grandfather, Robert Owens, became a guiding force in her life. Raised as one of 12 children on a sharecropping farm in North Carolina, Robert worked from the age of five, drying tobacco leaves and frequently shared stories of growing up Black in the Deep South, including harrowing encounters with the Ku Klux Klan. Owens has cited these family experiences to question liberal narratives about white nationalism in modern America. In a 2019 Judiciary Committee hearing on “the spread of white identity ideology,” she criticised Democrats for “fear-mongering” about racism, pointing to her grandfather's experiences under Democratic-led Jim Crow laws as evidence of the shifting political landscape of racial issues.<br />
<br />
<strong>2) Career</strong></p>

<p>Candace Owens, a right-wing political commentator, has drawn attention for her controversial views, including the promotion of antisemitic tropes and anti-Israel rhetoric. She has also propagated conspiracy theories targeting the LGBTQ+ community. Owens rose to prominence between 2016 and 2017 as a vocal supporter of Donald Trump's MAGA movement and a critic of the Black Lives Matter campaign. Her career saw significant growth during her time with Turning Point USA and later with the conservative media platform, The Daily Wire, co-founded by Ben Shapiro. But her tenure at The Daily Wire ended after increasing tensions with its founders over her remarks about Jews and her opposition to US military support for Israel.<br />
<br />
<strong>3) Recent controversies</strong></p>

<p>Candace Owens announced a speaking tour in August, 2024, promising audiences in Australia and New Zealand discussions on free speech and her Christian beliefs. But Australia banned her in October, with Immigration Minister Tony Burke stating that Owens “has the capacity to incite discord in almost every direction,” citing her controversial remarks about the Holocaust and Muslims. In New Zealand, officials denied her an entertainer's work permit based on a legal provision barring visas for individuals already excluded from another country.<br />
<br />
<strong>4) Connection with Kanye West and launch of ‘Blexit'</strong><br />
<br />
Candace Owens gained further visibility when Kanye West (known as Ye) once publicly endorsed her on X, stating, “I love the way Candace Owens thinks.” Following this, Owens joined West on a visit to the TMZ offices, where he made controversial comments about slavery being a “choice” for Black people. Building on the momentum, Owens launched the “Blexit” movement, short for “Black exit,” which encourages Black Americans to leave what she describes as the “Democrat plantation.”<br />
<br />
<strong>5) Personal life</strong><br />
<br />
Candace Owens is married to British businessman George Farmer, the son of Lord Michael Farmer, founder of the trading conglomerate Metal &amp; Commodity Company Ltd. The couple met in 2018 and Farmer proposed to her just 17 days after their first meeting during a FaceTime call on December 29, 2018, according to <a href="http://https://people.com/who-is-george-farmer-candace-owens-husband-8386561">People</a>. They married in 2019 and have since welcomed three children into their family.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A 44-year-old murder case has gotten hope for closure after two skeletal remains were found in a car submerged in a murky pond in the United States last week.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 44-year-old murder case has gotten hope for closure after two skeletal remains were found in a car submerged in a murky pond in the United States last week. The car is believed to belong to a Scarsdale couple that vanished in 1980.</p>

<p>Charles Romer, a retired oil company executive from Scarsdale, and his wife Catherine were driving to the Westchester County suburb from their home in Florida in the spring of 1980. They made a stop at a Holiday Inn, now called the Royal Inn, in Georgia. However, they could not be found after that day even as the police found some of their unpacked belongings in the hotel, reported The New York Times.</p>

<p>The incident left their family searching for answers for decades, with the police suspecting that the couple may have been killed in a robbery as Ms Romer had a large amount of jewellery with her.</p>

<p>Now, nearly 44 years later, the finding of bones and a trove of jewellery, including a Rolex watch and diamond ring, from the submerged car has given hope that the cold case may have been solved.</p>

<p>According to Georgia police spokesperson Lawton Dodd, the human remains in the car "conclusively show the bodies of two people were in the vehicle".</p>

<p>It is yet to be ascertained whether the remains belong to the Romers.</p>

<p>The police have also found a license plate bearing the couple's initials, Ms Romer's granddaughter told The New York Times.</p>

<p>Investigators are also reportedly seeking a VIN number from the car to see if it matches the couple's 1979 Lincoln Continental - in which they were travelling the day they went missing.</p>

<p>Further investigation is underway to determine whether the remains belong to the Romers - who were in their second marriage, officials said.</p>

<p>"While the investigation will take months to complete, this development offers a resolution far better than the endless questions we've faced for so long," another granddaughter of Ms Romer told the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/27/us-news/bombshell-break-in-case-of-scarsdale-couple-who-vanished-in-georgia-44-years-ago-after-cops-pull-car-from-pond/" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">New York Post</a>.</p>

<p>The police have also found another car in the same pond, but it is reportedly not related to the Romers' missing case.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[A massive gold deposit, potentially the world's largest, has been discovered in Hunan Province, Central China, containing an estimated 1,000 metric tonnes of high-quality ore.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A massive gold deposit in Central China is believed to contain 1,000 metric tonnes (1,100 US tonnes) of high-quality ore, according to the state media. The Geological Bureau of Hunan Province confirmed the discovery in Pingjiang County, located in the northeastern region of the province.</p>

<p>According to the <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://english.news.cn/20241121/cc54468169bb4c8c9db21c08885dc2a5/c.html"><em>Chinese State Media</em></a>, with an estimated value of 600 billion yuan, which is approximately Rs 6,91,473 crore, this may well be the world's largest gold reserve, surpassing the 930 metric tonnes found in South Deep Mine, South Africa.</p>

<p>Preliminary explorations revealed 40 gold veins within a depth of 2 kilometres, holding about 300 metric tons of gold. Advanced 3D modelling suggests the presence of additional reserves at greater depths, possibly reaching 3 kilometres. This discovery has significant implications for China's gold industry, potentially boosting the nation's mining and economic capabilities.</p>

<p>"Many drilled rock cores showed visible gold," said Chen Rulin, an ore-prospecting expert at the bureau, adding that a tonne of ore in the 2,000-meter range contained a maximum of 138 grams of gold.</p>

<p>Liu Yongjun, vice head of the bureau, said that new ore prospecting technologies, such as 3D geological modeling, had been used at the Wangu gold field. Gold was also found during drills around the site's peripheral areas, unearthing promising prospects, Liu said.</p>

<p>According to <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.mining-technology.com/features/feature-top-ten-biggest-gold-mines-south-africa/?cf-view"><em>Mining Technology, </em></a>the largest known gold reserves in the world prior to the discovery of the Chinese gold deposit include: &nbsp;</p>

<p>1. South Deep Gold Mine - South Africa &nbsp;<br />
2. Grasberg Gold Mine - Indonesia &nbsp;<br />
3. Olimpiada Gold Mine - Russia &nbsp;<br />
4. Lihir Gold Mine - Papua New Guinea &nbsp;<br />
5. Norte Abierto Gold Mine - Chile &nbsp;<br />
6. Carlin Trend Gold Mine - USA &nbsp;<br />
7. Boddington Gold Mine - Western Australia &nbsp;<br />
8. Mponeng Gold Mine - South Africa &nbsp;<br />
9. Pueblo Viejo Gold Mine - Dominican Republic &nbsp;<br />
10. Cortez Gold Mine - USA &nbsp;</p>

<p>These mines represent the most significant natural gold reserves identified worldwide to date.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Royal New Zealand Navy vessel ran aground and sank off the coast of Samoa last month as a result of human error, a government-initiated inquiry found on Friday.</p>

<p>HMNZS Manawanui, the navy's specialist dive and hydrographic vessel, grounded on a reef on the southern side of Samoa, on Oct. 5 while conducting survey operations. All 75 crew members on board survived.</p>

<p>"The direct cause of the grounding has been determined as a series of human errors which meant the ship's autopilot was not disengaged when it should have been," the head of New Zealand's Navy Rear Admiral Gavin Golding said in a statement on Friday.</p>

<p>The crew did not realise the ship remained in autopilot and consequently thought its failure to respond to direction changes was the result of a thruster control failure.</p>

<p>The reasons why the crew failed to notice the error would be part of a wider inquiry expected to be completed in the first quarter of next year, Golding said.</p>

<p>A separate disciplinary process into those involved would begin once that inquiry had concluded, he added.</p>

<p>New Zealand's Navy has been struggling with a lack of resources, three of its nine ships already idle due to personnel shortages before the sinking of the Manawanui.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The Reykjanes Peninsula had been inactive for 800 years before volcanic activity resumed in 2021.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NASA has captured a satellite image of red-hot lava oozing from Iceland's most recent volcanic eruption. The incredible shot, which also shows a large billow of smoke and gas arising from the eruption, has been snapped by OLI-2 (Operational Land Imager-2) on Landsat 9. The lava has flowed across major roads and closed in on the Blue Lagoon, a popular tourist destination, after erupting from a fissure in the Sundhunkur crater series on Iceland's Reykjanes Peninsula. This is the seventh instance of a volcanic eruption in the area in less than a year.</p>

<p>"This natural color scene [in the picture], acquired by the OLI-2 on November 24, is overlaid with an infrared signal to help distinguish the lava's heat signature," read a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/153630/lava-nears-icelands-blue-lagoon" rel="noindex, nofollow">statement </a>by NASA's Earth Observatory.</p>

<p>"A plume of gas, consisting primarily of sulfur dioxide, streamed from the lava, although the eruption did not affect flights to and from Iceland," it added.</p>

<p>According to the Icelandic Meteorological Office, the eruption's activity had not decreased as quickly as was seen in previous eruptions but had steadied in the last 24 hours.</p>

<p>"Eruptive activity has been steady over the last 24 hours, with lava now flowing predominantly east and southeast, towards and along the base of Fagradalsfjall," read an update, dated November 27.</p>

<p>"The lava field near Fagradalsfjall has expanded slightly but continues to thicken. Volcanic tremor has remained stable alongside eruptive activity in the vent. The rate of subsidence around Svartsengi has significantly reduced," it added.</p>

<p><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/volcano-erupts-in-iceland-seventh-time-in-a-year-7068668" rel="noindex, nofollow"><strong>Video: Red Lava Pours Out As Volcano Erupts 7th Time In A Year In Iceland</strong></a></p>

<h3><strong>What is a fissure eruption?</strong></h3>

<p>As per scientists, Iceland's current eruption is a fissure eruption. A fissure is a fracture through which a sheet of magma flows. When this fracture intersects with the surface, lava erupts onto the surface. According to a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cq521pw0pgjo" rel="noindex, nofollow"><em>BBC </em></a>report, the Reykjanes Peninsula had been inactive for 800 years before volcanic activity resumed in 2021.</p>

<p>Volcanologists have warned that volcanic activity in Iceland had entered a new era. The country is home to 33 active volcanic systems, more than any other European country. It is located on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a fault in the ocean floor that separates the Eurasian and North American tectonic plates and causes earthquakes and eruptions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Jihadist fighters cut the Damascus to Aleppo highway on Thursday during an offensive that a monitor says killed around 200, including civilians hit by Russian air force strikes.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jihadist fighters cut the Damascus to Aleppo highway on Thursday during an offensive that a monitor says killed around 200, including civilians hit by Russian air force strikes.</p>

<p>A day earlier, jihadist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and allied factions launched a surprise attack on government-held areas of northern Aleppo province, triggering the fiercest fighting in years, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.</p>

<p>The toll in ongoing battles "has risen to 182, including 102 fighters from HTS", 19 from allied factions "and 61 regime forces and allied groups", said the Observatory.</p>

<p>"Russian air strikes on the Aleppo countryside killed 19 civilians on Thursday," said Rami Abdel Rahman, who heads the Observatory, adding that another civilian had been killed in Syrian army shelling a day earlier.</p>

<p>Russia is a close ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and first intervened in Syria's civil war in 2015, turning the momentum of the conflict in favour of the president, whose forces once only controlled a fifth of the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p>HTS and its allied factions, including groups backed by neighbouring Turkey, "cut off the Damascus-Aleppo international M5 highway... in addition to controlling the junction between the M4 and M5 highways," said the Britain-based monitor.</p>

<p>"The highway has now been put out of service, after it was reopened by regime forces years ago," said the monitor, which has a network of sources inside Syria.</p>

<p>The junction of the M5 and M4 highways connects the capital and regime coastal stronghold Latakia with second city Aleppo respectively.</p>

<p>The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said "more than 14,000 people - nearly half are children - have been displaced" by the violence.</p>

<p>Syria has been gripped by civil war for more than a decade, although the intensity of the conflict had decreased in recent years.</p>

<h3><strong>'Pre-empt' attack</strong></h3>

<p>Some of the clashes, which are happening in an area straddling Idlib and Aleppo provinces, are less than 10 kilometres (six miles) southwest of the outskirts of Aleppo city.</p>

<p>"This operation aims to repel the sources of fire of the criminal enemy from the frontlines," said Mohamed Bashir, who heads HTS's so-called "Salvation Government", during a press conference.</p>

<p>Analyst Nick Heras of the New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy said the rebels were "trying to preempt the possibility of a Syrian military campaign in the region of Aleppo, which Russian and Syrian government airstrikes against rebel areas has been preparing for".</p>

<p>With some Turkey-backed factions joining the offensive, he said "Ankara is sending a message to both Damascus and Moscow to back down from their military efforts in northwest Syria," he said.</p>

<p>As well as Russia, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has been backed in the civil war by Iran and allied terrorist groups, including Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah.</p>

<p>A general in Iran's Revolutionary Guards was killed in Syria on Thursday during fighting between Syrian government forces and jihadists, an Iranian news agency reported.</p>

<p>Iranian ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei said the deadly offensive was "part of a plan by the diabolical regime (Israel) and the US" and called for "firm and coordinated action to prevent the spread of terrorism in the region".</p>

<p>During more than two months of war with Hezbollah in Lebanon, Israel intensified its strikes on Iran-backed groups in Syria including Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Rebel forces "are in a better position to take and seize villages than Russian-backed Syrian government forces, while the Iranians are focused on Lebanon," Heras said.</p>

<h3><strong>'Heavy losses'</strong></h3>

<p>The Syrian jihadists and their allies launched their attack the day the Lebanon-Israel truce came into effect.</p>

<p>Analyst Haid Haid said the rebels had been "planning for this offensive for quite a while".</p>

<p>But "if the rebel forces waited too long the regime would have been able to reinforce their frontlines as Hezbollah forces are no longer busy with the war in Lebanon".</p>

<p>HTS, led by Al-Qaeda's former Syria branch, controls swathes of the northwest Idlib area as well as small parts of neighbouring Aleppo, Hama and Latakia provinces.</p>

<p>An AFP correspondent reported heavy, uninterrupted clashes east of the city of Idlib since Wednesday morning, including air strikes.</p>

<p>A military statement carried by state news agency SANA said that "armed terrorist organisations grouped under so-called 'Nusra terrorist front' present in Aleppo and Idlib provinces launched a large, broad-fronted attack" Wednesday morning.</p>

<p>It said the attack with "medium and heavy weapons targeted safe villages and towns and our military sites in those areas".</p>

<p>The army "in cooperation with friendly forces" confronted the attack "which is still continuing", inflicting "heavy losses" on the armed groups, the military statement said, without reporting army losses.</p>

<p>Syria's conflict broke out after Assad crushed anti-government protests in 2011, spiralling into a complex conflict that has drawn in foreign armies and jihadists.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It has killed more than 500,000 people, displaced millions and battered the country's infrastructure and industry.</p>

<p>The Idlib region is subject to a ceasefire -- repeatedly violated but which had largely been holding -- brokered by Turkey and Russia after a Syrian government offensive in March 2020.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tech mogul Elon Musk has revealed that his artificial intelligence (AI) startup, xAI, will launch a new AI-powered gaming studio to counter the 'massive corporations' pushing ideologically charged video games. Mr Musk was responding to a post by Dogecoin co-creator Billy Markus where the latter expressed dissatisfaction at the current state of gaming. The billionaire said his gaming studio will "make games great again," referencing the MAGA movement, of which Mr Musk was an essential part during the US presidential election.</p>

<p>"I don't understand how game developers and game journalism got so ideologically captured. Gamers have always been trolls, anti-greedy corporations, anti-bs. Gamers have always rejected dumb manipulative bs, and can tell when someone is an outsider poser. Why lean into the bs?" wrote Mr Markus on X (formerly Twitter).</p>

<p>Replying to the post, Mr Musk said: "Too many game studios that are owned by massive corporations. xAI is going to start an AI game studio to make games great again!"</p>

<p></p>

<p>Earlier, the Tesla CEO also criticised the inclusion of a pronoun selection feature in an upcoming Xbox game called Avowed. "Having pronouns in a fantasy video game is utterly unacceptable," he wrote on X followed by an angry emoji.</p>

<p>Calling AI gaming the "future" of the industry, Mr Musk also reacted to a post complaining about Mcirosoft's gaming division for discriminating against Whites during the hiring process.</p>

<p>"Microsoft's gaming division is excluding whites from being hired to work on their video games. All of their new hires are unqualified queer and black people because the company's executives have an explicit mandate against "crusty old white dudes," read the post, to which Mr Musk responded by tagging Microsoft CEO Nadella: "Um, @satyanadella, this is illegal."</p>

<h3><strong>What is xAI?</strong></h3>

<p>Mr Musk launched xAI in July 2023 as an alternative to OpenAI's ChatGPT. In March, xAI said it would open-source its ChatGPT challenger "Grok", giving the public free access to experiment with the code behind the technology.</p>

<p>xAI managed to raise $6 billion in series B funding in May, reaching a post-money valuation of $24 billion, backed by investors that included Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital. A new $5 billion fundraising round is expected soon which could double xAI's valuation to $50 billion in just six months.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh has sought to pursue deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina's trial in the International Criminal Court even as she faced a trial in a domestic tribunal on charges of crimes against humanity, office of the interim government chief Muhammad Yunus said here on Thursday.</p>

<p>"The Chief Adviser Yunus discussed the issue of Hasina's trial with International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor Karim A Khan who called on him at his official Jamuna residence," an official of the chief adviser's press wing said.</p>

<p>Hasina fled to India on August 5 following widespread protests against her Awami League-led government over a controversial job quota system. Three days later, Yunus, a Nobel laureate, took over as the Chief Adviser of the interim government.</p>

<p>He said Yunus, during his meeting with Khan on Wednesday, told him that Bangladesh intends to pursue the charges against Hasina and her allies particularly on charges of carrying out "massacre" during the July-August mass uprising and enforced disappearances during the past 15 years of her rule.</p>

<p>Dozens of cases are now being processed at the Internal Crimes Tribunal of Bangladesh (ICT-BD) against Hasina, her cabinet colleagues, several of them being in jail or on the run at home and abroad while Dhaka sought Interpol help for her repatriation from India.</p>

<p>Yunus, earlier, said his government would also seek her return from India to stand trial.</p>

<p>The ICC prosecutor, however, said the international court would like to extend cooperation to ICT-BD, which by now, has issued an arrest warrant for Hasina and several top-ranking members of her Awami League party.</p>

<p>According to the press wing, the duo during their discussion, also discussed the Rohingya crisis and humanitarian assistance for them, the Myanmar situation alongside the prosecution and accountability of atrocities during the July-August mass movement in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>Khan informed Yunus that his office had formally sought an arrest warrant for Myanmar's military government chief Min Aung Hlaing for crimes against humanity regarding the treatment of Rohingyas.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden on Thursday said Russia's latest attack on Ukraine shows the "urgency" of backing Kyiv, touting strong support ahead of Donald Trump taking office in January.</p>

<p>"This attack is outrageous and serves as yet another reminder of the urgency and importance of supporting the Ukrainian people in their defense against Russian aggression," Biden said in a statement.</p>

<p>Earlier Thursday, Russia pummelled Ukraine's energy grid with almost 200 missiles and drones in what the American president called an "outrageous" attack that left a million people without power.</p>

<p>"On this day, my message to the Ukrainian people is clear: the United States stands with you," added Biden, who has looked to shore up US support for Ukraine in his final weeks in the White House.</p>

<p>Trump is widely expected to bring a policy shift towards Ukraine, which has received almost $60 billion from Washington for its armed forces since Russia launched a full-scale invasion in February 2022.</p>

<p>Trump has promised to swiftly end the conflict by mediating a ceasefire deal between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian leader Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>But his critics have warned that the incoming Republican will likely leverage US military aid to pressure Kyiv into an agreement that left it ceding occupied territory permanently or agreeing not to join NATO.</p>

<p>Trump on Wednesday named his Ukraine envoy as retired general Keith Kellogg, who co-authored a paper earlier this year calling for Washington to leverage military aid as a means of pushing for peace talks.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Friday a landmark law that bans under-16s from social media will result in "less harm" for children.</p>

<p>The crackdown on sites like Facebook, Instagram and X, which was approved by parliament late Thursday, will lead to "better outcomes and less harm for young Australians", he told reporters.</p>

<p>The government did not expect the new law to be implemented perfectly, Albanese said, likening it to a ban on alcohol for under-18s that can sometimes be circumvented.</p>

<p>"But we know that it's the right thing to do," he said at a news conference in Canberra.</p>

<p>Platforms now have a "social responsibility" to make children's safety a priority, the prime minister said.</p>

<p>"We've got your back, is our message to Australian parents."</p>

<p>Social media firms -- which face fines of up to Aus$50 million (US$32.5 million) for failing to comply -- have described the law as "vague", "problematic" and "rushed".</p>

<p>The legislation will take effect after 12 months, but currently offers almost no details on how the rules will be enforced -- prompting concern among experts that it will simply be a symbolic piece of legislation that is unenforceable.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) on Thursday expressed solidarity with priest Chinmoy Krishna Das, who was arrested on charges of sedition for allegedly raising a flag on a stand displaying Bangladesh's national flag.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari was arrested on charges of sedition for allegedly raising a flag on a stand displaying Bangladesh's national flag. He was presented before a Chittagong court on Tuesday, which denied his bail plea and remanded him in custody.</p>

<p>The arrest has sparked widespread outrage, with many demanding his immediate release.</p>

<p>In a related development, a lawyer filed a petition seeking a ban on ISKCON in Bangladesh, labelling it a "radical organisation" that engages in activities aimed at inciting communal unrest, according to local media reports.</p>

<p>Earlier today, the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina condemned the "unjust" arrest of Das and called for his immediate release.Hasina also voiced concerns about attacks on minorities and their places of worship, urging the authorities to ensure religious freedom and the safety of all communities.</p>

<p>"A senior leader of the Sanatan religious community has been unjustly arrested, and I demand his immediate release. Temples have been set ablaze in Chittagong. Previously, mosques, shrines, churches, monasteries, and homes belonging to the Ahmadiyya community have been attacked, vandalised, looted, and burned. Religious freedom and the safety of all communities must be guaranteed," Sheikh Hasina said in a statement.</p>

<p>Recently, a group of retired judges, bureaucrats, and a sitting MP sent a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging him to intervene and address the rising violence and discrimination against Hindus in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>The arrest has further strained relations between the Bangladesh government and ISKCON, fuelling protests and unrest.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin praised US President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday as an experienced and intelligent politician, but said he did not believe Trump was safe after attempts on his life.</p>

<p>Donald Trump was wounded in an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania in July. In a separate incident in September, a man was charged with attempted assassination after allegedly positioning himself with a rifle at one of Trump's Florida golf courses.</p>

<p>Speaking to reporters in Kazakhstan after a summit, Putin said he had been shocked by the way the US election campaign had unfolded.</p>

<p>He cited "the absolutely uncivilised methods used to battle against Trump, up to and including an assassination attempt - and more than once".</p>

<p>"By the way, in my opinion, he is not safe now," said Putin.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, in the history of the United States various incidents have happened. I think he (Trump) is intelligent and I hope he's cautious and understands this."</p>

<p>Putin, who is himself heavily protected, said he had been even more shocked though by how Trump's family and children had been criticised by political opponents during the US election campaign.</p>

<p>He called such behaviour "revolting" and said in Russia not even "bandits" would resort to such methods.</p>

<p>Talking about what he described as the Biden administration's decision to escalate the war in Ukraine by allowing Kyiv to strike Russia with Western missiles, Putin speculated that it could be a ploy to either help Trump by giving him something to roll back or a way of making his life more difficult with Russia.</p>

<p>Either way, Putin said he thought Trump would "find the solution" and said Moscow was ready for dialogue.<br />

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Satellite images obtained by Reuters on Thursday show a build-up of Chinese civilian vessels near contested Thitu Island, Manila's key outpost in the South China Sea, but a senior Philippine navy officer said they are "not a cause for concern".</p>

<p>One of the images taken by Maxar Technologies on Monday and reviewed by Reuters shows about 60 vessels, some within 2 nautical miles of Thitu, a strategically important island from which Manila monitors Chinese vessels and aircraft in the busy waterway.</p>

<p>Vice Admiral Alfonso Torres, chief of the Philippines' Western Command, said it was common for "maritime militia" ships to gather in the area. Manila, the Pentagon and foreign diplomats say such vessels work with the Chinese coast guard and navy to strengthen Beijing's presence in disputed waters.</p>

<p class="ins_instory_dv_caption"><small><em>Photo Credit: Reuters</em></small></p>
</div>

<p>Rear Admiral Roy Trinidad, Philippines Navy spokesman for the South China Sea, also said maritime militia ships were regularly in the area, adding that Manila was aware of the vessels, which he called an "illegal presence", but there was no need for alarm.</p>

<p>"It's not a cause for concern," Trinidad said. "We don't have to read every action and react to that... What is important for us is to maintain our posture."</p>

<p>Online ship trackers show that many of the vessels in the satellite photos are Chinese-registered fishing craft.</p>

</div>

<p>The Chinese defence ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. China has never confirmed it has a militia of civilian vessels.</p>

<p>The island, which the Philippines calls Pag-Asa, is Manila's biggest and most strategically important in the disputed South China Sea, which is largely claimed by China and through which billions of dollars worth of goods pass each year. A 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague found that Beijing's expansive claims had no basis under international law.</p>

<p>The build-up comes after months of clashes and rammings between Chinese coast guard and fishing vessels and Philippines ships, particularly at the Scarborough and Second Thomas Shoals.</p>

<p>Thitu is close to a Chinese naval base and runway on Subi reef, which has sometimes served as a port for large numbers of Chinese maritime militia vessels, Trinidad said.</p>

<p>"When you go in there (to Subi), when you go out, you will pass through the territorial sea of Pag-Asa," he said.</p>

<p>Regional diplomats and security analysts are watching developments closely, with some noting the Chinese vessels had their transponders on this week, allowing them to be tracked.</p>

<p>Singapore-based security scholar Collin Koh said Beijing could be testing Manila's reactions at a moment of domestic political tension in the Philippines.</p>

<p>Embattled Philippine Vice President Sara Duterte on Wednesday accused President Ferdinand Marcos Jr of seeking to remove her from office, after the national police filed a formal complaint accusing her of assault and coercion.</p>

<p>"This needs to be watched in the days ahead," said Koh, of Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.</p>

<p>If the militia presence continues, Koh said, it could be that China is hoping to delay Philippine construction work on the island.</p>

<p>A new aircraft hangar is reportedly due for completion in the next few weeks, the latest in a several moves to buttress the Philippines' presence on Thitu and improve monitoring capabilities.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[Benjamin NetanyahuPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that Israel would do "everything" to stop Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon after Iran's top diplomat warned it could end its ban on developing one if Western sanctions are reimposed.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that Israel would do "everything" to stop Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon after Iran's top diplomat warned it could end its ban on developing one if Western sanctions are reimposed.</p>

<p>The renewed war of words between the Middle East foes came as Iran prepares to hold key nuclear talks with European governments on Friday which have been overshadowed by their joining with Washington to have Tehran censured by the UN atomic watchdog.</p>

<p>"I will do everything to prevent it from becoming a nuclear (power), I will use all the resources that can be used," Netanyahu told Israeli broadcaster Channel 14 in an interview.</p>

<p>Israel is the region's sole, if undeclared, nuclear-armed state. It has long made preventing any rival from matching it its top defence priority.</p>

<p>Netanyahu said Tuesday that the ceasefire that went into effect in Lebanon the following day would allow Israel to focus on Iran. He did not elaborate on what action he envisaged.</p>

<p>Iran launched two missile barrages at Israel over the past year in retaliation for the killing of leaders from Hamas and Hezbollah, as well as an Iranian general.</p>

<p>Israel responded both times with limited attacks on Iran, most recently bombing several military sites on October 26.</p>

<p>Last week's chiding at the International Atomic Energy Agency prompted a defiant response from Tehran, but its officials have since signalled willingness to engage with others ahead of the return of US president-elect Donald Trump, whose last administration pursued a policy of "maximum pressure" against Iran.</p>

<p><strong>- Current doctrine 'insufficient' -</strong></p>

<p>Iran insists on its right to nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, but according to the IAEA, it is the only non-nuclear-weapon state enriching uranium to 60 percent.</p>

<p>In an interview with The Guardian newspaper, published on the eve of Iran's talks with Britain, France and Germany, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi warned that frustration in Tehran over unmet commitments, such as lifting sanctions, was fuelling debate over whether the country should alter its nuclear policy.</p>

<p>"We have no intention to go further than 60 percent for the time being, and this is our determination right now," he told the British daily.</p>

<p>But, he added, "there is this debate going on in Iran, and mostly among the elites... whether we should change our nuclear doctrine" as so far it has proven to be "insufficient in practice".</p>

<p>A 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and major powers aimed to give Iran relief from crippling Western sanctions in exchange for limiting its nuclear programme to prevent it from developing a weapons capability.</p>

<p>Tehran has consistently denied any such ambition. Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final authority in Iran's decision-making, has issued a religious decree, or fatwa, prohibiting atomic weapons.</p>

<p>Tehran's willingness to sit down with the three European governments so soon after the censure comes just weeks before Trump is set to return to the White House.</p>

<p>During his first term, Trump focused on reimposing heavy sanctions on Iran following his administration's unilateral withdrawal from the 2015 deal three years after it was agreed.</p>

<p>In retaliation for the US withdrawal, Tehran reduced its compliance with the deal, raising its uranium enrichment levels to 60 percent -- closer to the 90 percent required for a nuclear bomb.</p>

<p><strong>- 'Legal obligations' -</strong></p>

<p>Under the 2015 accord -- which will expire in October 2025 -- Iran's enrichment was capped at 3.67 percent.</p>

<p>Iranian diplomat Majid Takht-Ravanchi, who serves as the political deputy to Araghchi, is scheduled to represent Iran in Friday's talks.</p>

<p>He will meet beforehand with Enrique Mora, deputy secretary general of the European Union's foreign affairs arm, according to Iran's official news agency IRNA.</p>

<p>Last week, the 35-nation board of governors of the IAEA adopted a resolution proposed by Britain, France, Germany and the United States condemning Iran for its lack of cooperation on nuclear issues.</p>

<p>Iran described the move as "politically motivated" and in response announced the launch of "new advanced centrifuges" designed to increase its stockpile of enriched uranium.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Australian court upheld an order on Friday for Elon Musk's X to pay a fine of A$610,500 ($418,000) for failing to cooperate with a regulator's request for information about anti-child-abuse practices.</p>

<p>X had challenged the fine but the Federal Court of Australia ruled it was obliged to respond to a notice from the eSafety Commissioner, an internet safety regulator, seeking information about steps to address child sexual exploitation material on the platform.</p>

<p>Musk took X, then called Twitter, private in 2022. But the company had argued it was not bound to respond to the notice in early 2023 because it was folded into a new Musk-controlled corporate entity, removing liability.</p>

<p>"Had X Corp's argument been accepted by the Court it could have set the concerning precedent that a foreign company's merger with another foreign company might enable it to avoid regulatory obligations in Australia," eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said in a statement following the verdict.</p>

<p>eSafety has also started civil proceedings against X because of its non-compliance.</p>

<p>X did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.</p>

<p>This is not the first conflict between Musk and the Australian internet safety regulator. The eSafety Commissioner earlier this year ordered X to remove posts showing a bishop in Australia being stabbed during a sermon.</p>

<p>X challenged the order in court on the grounds that a regulator in one country should not decide what internet users viewed around the world, and ultimately kept the posts up after the Australian regulator withdrew its case.</p>

<p>Musk said at the time the order was censorship and shared posts describing the order, which would have applied globally, as a plot by the World Economic Forum to impose eSafety rules on the world.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[It is the right of every nation which comes under occupation to resist the occupation, said Lebanon's Ambassador to India Rabie Narsh, speaking to NDTV about the ongoing and escalating conflict in West Asia.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is the right of every nation which comes under occupation to resist the occupation, said Lebanon's Ambassador to India Rabie Narsh, speaking to NDTV about the ongoing and escalating conflict in West Asia.</p>

<p>"Lebanon's armed forces have not been pressed into action, because if we do that, then it officially becomes a war between two nations. It is currently the people who are resisting an occupation by Israel," the envoy said.</p>

<p>Explaining his remark, the Ambassador said, "Israel has been attacking us since its formation due to its policy of occupation and expansionism. Resistance groups like the Hezbollah and many others have always resisted this occupation."</p>

<p>Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon is widely considered a militant organisation by many countries in the West and even a terrorist organisation by some, including Israel and the United States. Members of the Hezbollah are part of the Parliament in Lebanon, but are not considered part of the government.</p>

<p>Speaking about "resistance group" Hezbollah, the Ambassador said clearly that Lebanon "does not consider Hezbollah a terrorist group. They are freedom fighters who are resisting an occupation. The are fighting for the freedom and liberty of the people of Lebanon, and their fight is against state terrorism being done by Israel, and against occupation. They are freedom fighters because they are fighting on their own land"</p>

<p>"As for the relationship between Hezbollah and the Lebanese government, it has always been there, and is a debatable issue," he said, adding that "When it comes to domestic issues, Hezbollah is a political party just like any other political party. They play by the same rules as every other political party."</p>

<h2><strong>ROCKETS FIRED AT ISRAEL</strong></h2>

<p>Israel has been targeted by Lebanon for the last 11 month, Tel Aviv has said. As recently as THursday, 230 rockets were fired by Hezbollah on to Israeli territory.</p>

<p>Responding to this, the Ambassador said, "It is not true that Hezbollah has been fighting Israel for the last 11 months. The fight has been on since the formation of Israel in 1947-48. The resistance to occupation has been on since then. The fight has been on since then. Even now Israel is encroaching Lebanese territory."</p>

<p>Pinning the blame on the international community, the envoy said, "It is expected of the international community to put a hold on this situation. Today, we are suffering because the international community has failed to stop Israel's war crimes."</p>

<p>Speaking about the killing of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, the envoy said, "You can see the implications of assassinating him. You can see the fallout. The war is still on. Israel's strikes are even killing civilians in Lebanon. Hundreds of civilians have been killed so far. This is what terrorism really is. If what Israel is doing is not terrorism, then what is."</p>

<h3><strong>'THE PEOPLE ARE HEZBOLLAH'</strong></h3>

<p>Israel has been saying that Hezbollah militants have been taking shelter in civilian areas, residing and hiding in residential colonies and even hiding their weapons, arms and ammunition under civilian buildings.</p>

<p>The envoy however, rubbished these claims as "pure lies" by Israel. He said, "Israel's entire journey has been built up on lies. Their entire narrative is a lie, and these claims are lies," he said, adding that there has been a recent visit organised by Hezbollah for journalists, where they have shown that the areas targeted by Israel are pure civilian areas and no military installations were there."</p>

<p>He went on to say that, "As for Hezbollah members living there, well, the people are Hezbollah. Hezbollah is not an imaginary organisation. It is made of the people of Lebanon. Those who are resisting the occupation. So, yes, people are there. It may be Hezbollah or some other groups, but just because of that is it justified to kill their entire families and their children."</p>

<p>"As for the weapons, I do not know where they hide them," he added.</p>

<h3><strong>THE PRICE FOR THE HOLOCAUST</strong></h3>

<p>The Holocaust was the systematic state-sponsored killing of six million Jewish men, women, and children and several million others by Nazi Germany between 1941 and 1945 during World War-II.</p>

<p>Acknowledging the suffering of the Jewish people, the Ambassador said, "Of course, we do not deny that the Jewish people have suffered from the Holocaust and genocide, but on whose hand? Was it at the hands of the Arabs, or the Lebanese people? Or was it at the hands of the Europeans? So tell me, why should the people of Lebanon or Palestine pay the price for the crimes committed against Jews by another people."</p>

<h3><strong>THE TWO-STATE SOLUTION</strong></h3>

<p>Lebanon does not want war, the Ambassador told NDTV. "A military solution can not be achieved. We have sought for a political and a diplomatic solution. We have agreed that the only solution is a two-state solution. A state of Israel and a state for Palestine, each having defined territories and sovereign rights. But the only one who is opposed to this solution is Israel," he said.</p>

<p>Israel, he said, "seems to be above the international laws and the international community. It is always treated by the West as a spoilt child. This must end. Netanyahu's crazy campaign must stop, his criminal agendas should finish. So, yes, we can only move to peace when the UN resolution for a two-state policy is implemented and Palestine is given its due recognition as a country."</p>

<h3><strong>ANOTHER ISRAELI 'LIMITED INVASION' - HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT</strong></h3>

<p>Speaking about the "limited invasion" by Israel this time - as it has done in 1982 and 2006 - the Ambassador said, "It is the same, nothing&nbsp; will change. It is the mentality of war that Israel has always had."</p>

<p>He went on to say that "The entire foundation of Israel is based on a lie... and what makes it dangerous is that they justify their acts and agendas based on religious doctrines. 'The Promised Land', 'The Chosen People'. It is very dangerous when one builds their entire strategy on a twisted religious doctrine."</p>

<p>"Israel today occupies territories in Palestinian West Bank, they have occupied the Gaza strip, they have occupied Golan Heights in Syria and have also occupied lands in Lebanon. It is very clear who the aggressor is," the Ambassador said.</p>

<p>On Iran's ballistic missile attack on Israel, the envoy told NDTV that "What Iran does is up to them. How I see this is that Israel is left with no friends in the region. They are the aggressor. Be it Iran or Iraq or Yemen, or Lebanon - Israel has no good ties with anyone around it."<br />

       <description><![CDATA[A massive crowd has gathered in Tehran for a rare Friday sermon by supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei that could shed light on Iran's plans after they launched a wave of missile attack on Israel.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed to defeat the country's "enemies" in his rare Friday sermon, backing Palestinians and Lebanese movements against Israel. Addressing a gathering of tens of thousands of supporters at a mosque in Tehran, Khamenei justified its missile strikes on Israel as a "public service".</p>

<p>A gun kept by his side, the Iran leader declared that Israel would not prevail against Hamas or Hezbollah as chants of "we are with you" from the crowd echoed in the vast mosque grounds.</p>

<p>Khamenei's first Friday sermon in five years marks a crucial show of defiance amid threats to the supreme leader's life. He remains a top target for Israel, which has vowed to retaliate after Tuesday's missile attacks.</p>

<p>In his speech, he also praised Hassan Nasrallah, the former chief of the Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah who was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut last week.</p>

<p>"Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah is no longer with us, but his spirit and his path will continue to inspire us forever. He was the high-standing flag against the Zionist enemy. His martyrdom will further increase this influence. The loss of Nasrallah is not in vain. We must stand up against the enemy while strengthening our unwavering faith," Khamenei told the gathering.</p>

<p>Khamenei also called Hezbollah a "blessed tree" that grew steadily under the leadership of Nasrallah.</p>

<p>"It is the duty and responsibility of all Muslims to help the blooded people of Lebanon and to support Lebanon's jihad and the battle for al-Aqsa mosque," he declared.</p>

<p>Iran's supreme leader, who backs the Palestinian Hamas group, called their October 7 attacks on Israel the "correct move".</p>

<p>"No international law has the right to object and protest against the Lebanese and Palestinians for standing up for themselves against the occupation," he told the crowd.</p>

<p>Khamenei, who spoke after a prayer ceremony for Nasrallah, also called Israel a "tool" for the United States "to take control of all the lands and resources in the region."</p>

<p>"There is no doubt that the Zionists and the Americans are dreaming - the Zionist entity will be uprooted from the ground, it has no roots, it is fake, unstable, and exists only because of American support," said Khamenei.</p>

<p>Khamenei, the supreme leader who holds the highest authority in Iran, had last delivered a Friday sermon five years ago. His sermon comes just three days after Iran launched 180 missiles targeting crucial infrastructure in Israel and three days before the first anniversary of the Israel-Gaza war.</p>

<p>The Iran leader had last led Friday prayers in January 2020 after a missile attack on a US army base in Iraq in response to the killing of top Revolutionary Guards commander Qasem Soleimani.</p>

<p>Iran supports both Hamas and Hezbollah, who are fighting Israel on its southern and northern fronts.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UN health agency said on Friday that it had approved the use of the first diagnostic test for mpox, a key tool in countries battling outbreaks.</p>

<p>More than 800 people have died across Africa from mpox, where the disease has been officially detected in 16 countries, according to the African Union's disease control centre.</p>

<p>"The approval for emergency use" of the test "will be pivotal in expanding diagnostic capacity in countries facing mpox outbreaks, where the need for quick and accurate testing has risen sharply", the World Health Organization said in a statement.</p>

<p>The test, called the Alinity m MPXV assay and manufactured by Abbott Molecular Inc., enables the detection of the mpox virus from swabs taken from human lesions.</p>

<p>"By detecting DNA from pustular or vesicular rash samples, laboratory and health workers can confirm suspected mpox cases efficiently and effectively", the WHO said.</p>

<p>"Limited testing capacity and delays in confirming mpox cases persist in Africa, contributing to the continued spread of the virus", it said.</p>

<p>The approval of the test "represents a significant milestone in expanding testing availability in affected countries," the statement quoted Yukiko Nakatani, an assistant director-general of WHO, as saying.</p>

<p>"Increasing access to quality-assured medical products is central to our efforts in assisting countries to contain the spread of the virus and protect their people, especially in underserved regions", Nakatani said.</p>

<p>Mpox, previously known as monkeypox, is caused by a virus transmitted to humans by infected animals but can also be passed from human to human through close physical contact.</p>

<p>It causes fever, muscular aches and large boil-like skin lesions, and can be deadly.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Swing states, electoral college votes, candidates up and down the ballot, and millions of potential voters: here is the US election, broken down by numbers.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Two&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Several independents ran -- and at least one, Robert F. Kennedy Jr, stumbled into a number of eyebrow-raising headlines.</p>

<p>But in the end, the presidential race comes down to a binary choice, with the two candidates from the major parties -- Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump -- seeking to lead a polarized America.</p>

<h3><strong>Five&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>November 5 -- Election Day, traditionally held on the Tuesday following the first Monday in November.</p>

<h3><strong>Seven&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The number of swing states -- states which don't clearly favour one party over the other, meaning they are up for grabs.</p>

<p>Harris and Trump are courting voters in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, concentrating their campaign efforts there in an effort to ensure victory.</p>

<p>In a razor-tight election, just a handful of votes in any of those states could decide the outcome.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>34 and 435&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Voters won't just decide the White House occupant on Election Day -- they will also hit refresh on the US Congress.</p>

<p>Thirty-four Senate seats and all 435 spots in the House of Representatives are up for grabs.</p>

<p>In the House, members serve a two-year term. Republicans currently have the majority, and Harris's Democrats will be hoping for a turnaround.</p>

<p>In the Senate, 34 seats out of 100 are available, for a six-year term. Republicans are hoping to overturn the narrow Democratic majority.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>538</strong></h3>

<p>Welcome to the Electoral College, the indirect system of universal suffrage that governs presidential elections in the United States.</p>

<p>Each state has a different number of electors -- calculated by adding the number of their elected representatives in the House, which varies according to population, to the number of senators (two per state).</p>

<p>Rural Vermont, for example, has just three electoral votes. Giant California, meanwhile, has 54.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are 538 electors in total scattered across the 50 states and the District of Columbia. To take the White House, a candidate must win 270 votes.</p>

<h3><strong>774,000&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The number of poll workers who volunteered to make sure the 2020 election ran smoothly, according to the Pew Research Center.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are three types of election staff in the United States.</p>

<p>Poll workers -- recruited to do things like greet voters, help with languages, set up voting equipment, and verify voter IDs and registrations -- account for the majority of them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Election officials are elected, hired or appointed to carry out more specialized duties such as training poll workers, according to Pew.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Poll watchers are usually appointed by political parties to observe the ballot count -- expected to be particularly contentious this year, thanks to Trump's refusal to agree to unconditionally accept the result.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many election workers have already spoken to AFP about the pressure and threats they are receiving ahead of the November 5 vote.</p>

<h3><strong>244 million&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The number of Americans who will be eligible to vote in 2024, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.&nbsp;</p>

<p>How many of those will actually cast their ballot remains to be seen, of course. But the Pew Research Center says that the midterm elections of 2018 and 2022, and the presidential vote of 2020, produced three of the highest turnouts of their kind seen in the United States in decades.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"About two-thirds (66%) of the voting-eligible population turned out for the 2020 presidential election - the highest rate for any national election since 1900," Pew says on its website.</p>

<p>That translated to nearly 155 million voters, according to the Census Bureau.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel has sworn it will retaliate for Iran's missile barrage on Tuesday, which involved more than 180 ballistic missiles and was largely thwarted by Israel's air defense systems. Below are some ways Israel, backed by the United States, could strike back.</p>

<p><strong>Go After Iran's Military Installations</strong></p>

<p>Some analysts believe Israel is most likely to respond by targeting Iranian military installations, especially those that produce ballistic missiles like the ones used in Tuesday's attacks. It could also take out Iranian air defense systems and missile-launching facilities.</p>

<p>Washington has accused Tehran of supplying short-range ballistic missiles to Russia for use against Ukraine. Both countries deny that allegation.</p>

<p>Analysts said that would be seen as the most in-kind response to Iran's attack.</p>

<p><strong>Attack Iran's Nuclear Facilities</strong></p>

<p>Strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities could delay Tehran's ability to produce a nuclear weapon. Iran's nuclear program is spread over many locations, only some of which are built underground.</p>

<p>However, a major attack on its nuclear infrastructure would likely provoke serious consequences, potentially including a sprint by Iran to build a nuclear weapon. Washington has said it would not support such an action by Israel.</p>

<p>Richard Hooker, a retired US Army officer who served in the US National Security Council under Republican and Democratic presidents, said it was a "distinct possibility" that Israel could strike Iran's nuclear facilities but not a probability "because when you do something like that you put the Iranian leadership in a position to do something pretty dramatic in response."</p>

<p>The Islamic Republic denies ever having had a nuclear weapons program or planning to have one.</p>

<p>The UN nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, and the US intelligence community concluded that Iran pursued a coordinated nuclear weapons program until 2003, and experts say that with the collapse of the 2015 nuclear deal, it could produce enough weapons-grade uranium for a bomb in a matter of weeks.</p>

<p><strong>Attack Iran's Petroleum Production Infrastructure</strong></p>

<p>Israel could also hit Iran's petroleum industry, which would hurt its economy. Such an attack could provoke Iran in turn to strike oil production facilities in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Arab states. That could send the price of fuel, always a major US campaign issue, soaring before Americans pick a new president and Congress in the November 5 elections.</p>

<p>"I'm not sure that (a hike in world oil prices) would restrain the Israelis," said David Des Roches, a former Department of Defense official involved in Gulf policy now with the US National Defense University's Near East-South Asia Centre. Israel, he added, might view a hike in world oil prices as a benefit for former President Donald Trump's re-election campaign.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently has been more aligned with Trump's Republicans than with Democrats.</p>

<p><strong>Economic, Cyber Options</strong></p>

<p>A military response is considered the most likely, but there are options that do not involve missile strikes or commando raids.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden has said he would impose more sanctions on Iran. Washington's sanctions on Iran already ban nearly all US trade with the country, block its government's assets in the US and prohibit US foreign assistance and arms sales.</p>

<p>Analysts said Israel could also use its cyber warfare abilities to respond to the Iranian strikes.</p>

<p>Israel's recent mass pager attack against Hezbollah in Lebanon turned the spotlight on its secretive Unit 8200, the Israel Defense Forces' specialist cyber warfare and intelligence unit, which Western security sources said was involved in planning the operation.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel has sworn it will retaliate for Iran's missile barrage on Tuesday, which involved more than 180 ballistic missiles and was largely thwarted by Israel's air defence systems.</p>

<p>Below are some ways Israel, backed by the United States, could strike back.</p>

<h3><strong>GO AFTER IRAN'S MILITARY INSTALLATIONS</strong></h3>

<p>Some analysts believe Israel is most likely to respond by targeting Iranian military installations, especially those that produce ballistic missiles like the ones used in Tuesday's attacks. It could also take out Iranian air defence systems and missile-launching facilities.</p>

<p>Washington has accused Tehran of supplying short-range ballistic missiles to Russia for use against Ukraine. Both countries deny that allegation.</p>

<p>Analysts said that would be seen as the most in-kind response to Iran's attack.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>ATTACK IRAN'S NUCLEAR FACILITIES</strong></h3>

<p>Strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities could delay Tehran's ability to produce a nuclear weapon. Iran's nuclear program is spread over many locations, only some of which are built underground.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, a major attack on its nuclear infrastructure would likely provoke serious consequences, potentially including a sprint by Iran to build a nuclear weapon. Washington has said it would not support such an action by Israel.</p>

<p>Richard Hooker, a retired US Army officer who served in the US National Security Council under Republican and Democratic presidents, said it was a "distinct possibility" that Israel could strike Iran's nuclear facilities but not a probability "because when you do something like that you put the Iranian leadership in a position to do something pretty dramatic in response."</p>

<p>The Islamic Republic denies ever having had a nuclear weapons program or planning to have one.</p>

<p>The UN nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, and the US intelligence community concluded that Iran pursued a coordinated nuclear weapons program until 2003, and experts say that with the collapse of the 2015 nuclear deal, it could produce enough weapons-grade uranium for a bomb in a matter of weeks. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>ATTACK IRAN'S PETROLEUM PRODUCTION INFRASTRUCTURE</strong></h3>

<p>Israel could also hit Iran's petroleum industry, which would hurt its economy. Such an attack could provoke Iran in turn to strike oil production facilities in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Arab states. That could send the price of fuel, always a major US campaign issue, soaring before Americans pick a new president and Congress in the Nov. 5 elections.</p>

<p>"I'm not sure that (a hike in world oil prices) would restrain the Israelis," said David Des Roches, a former Department of Defense official involved in Gulf policy now with the US National Defense University's Near East-South Asia Center. Israel, he added, might view a hike in world oil prices as a benefit for former President Donald Trump's re-election campaign.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently has been more aligned with Trump's Republicans than with Democrats.</p>

<h3><strong>ECONOMIC, CYBER OPTIONS</strong></h3>

<p>A military response is considered the most likely, but there are options that do not involve missile strikes or commando raids.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden has said he would impose more sanctions on Iran. Washington's sanctions on Iran already ban nearly all US trade with the country, block its government's assets in the US and prohibit US. foreign assistance and arms sales.</p>

<p>Analysts said Israel could also use its cyber warfare abilities to respond to the Iranian strikes.</p>

<p>Israel's recent mass pager attack against Hezbollah in Lebanon turned the spotlight on its secretive Unit 8200, the Israel Defense Forces' specialist cyber warfare and intelligence unit, which Western security sources said was involved in planning the operation.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has claimed that a listening device was found in his bathroom after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu used the facility during their meeting in 2017, The Telegraph reported.</p>

<p>Johnson's new book ‘Unleashed', scheduled for release on October 10, claims the incident took place in the British Foreign Office when Johnson was serving as UK's foreign secretary.</p>

<p>During their meeting, Netanyahu – for whom he uses the nickname Bibi - excused himself to go to the bathroom, which Johnson describes as similar to “the gents in a posh London club” which exists within a “secret annexe”.</p>

<p>Mr Johnson writes: “Thither Bibi repaired for a while, and it may or may not be a coincidence but I am told that later, when they (security) were doing a regular sweep for bugs, they found a listening device in the thunderbox.”</p>

<p>When asked for more details on the incident, Johnson told The Telegraph, “I think everything you need to know about that episode is in the book.”</p>

<p>According to the reports, around the same time, Israel was accused of planting listening devices in the White House.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A spoon, some towel hooks, a piece of kettle and a plastic cap -- that's all you'll need to make a mixing deck if you have the technical and musical skills of DJ Boboss.</p>

<p>The 27-year-old -- real name Paul Mwangi -- has been building up a fanbase online and on the streets of Kenya with the one-of-a-kind deck that he put together himself.</p>

<p>It has even earned him slots at Uganda's Nyege Nyege festival, the largest in East Africa, and on the world-renowned club website Boiler Room.</p>

<p>But his favourite venue is Nairobi's bustling business district, where he set up on a recent Saturday among the stands of miraa (khat) vendors, the smell of grilled corn and the horns of matatus, the colourful minibuses of the Kenyan capital.</p>

<p>In a few minutes, dozens of curious onlookers had gathered, taking out their phones to film the amazing machine that spits out reggae hits.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="ins_instory_dv">
<div class="ins_instory_dv_cont"><img alt="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" id="story_image_main" src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/j9pnm0ro_dj-boboss-kenya-afp-_625x300_04_October_24.jpeg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738" title="Latest and Breaking News on NDTV" /></div>
</div>

<p>The mixing desk consists of a spray-painted wooden board on which are screwed towel racks, switches and printed circuits connected in a tangle of cables -- all connected to an amp, speaker, and car battery.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He scratches using a slider made from a magnetised spoon between two towel hooks, and his fader is cobbled together from a plastic bottle cap.</p>

<p>Fixes are done without breaking the flow -- at one point, DJ Boboss whips out a screwdriver, strips a wire with his teeth and repairs a fault while the music keeps playing.</p>

<h3><strong>'Make my own'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>"I've never seen anything like that in the world," smiled David Meshack, who works in a nearby electronics store that sells professional turntables.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"One day, a customer came in with a photo of it. He wanted the same one but I didn't know what it was," he said. "Today, I see it!"&nbsp;</p>

<p>Boboss is an acronym for "Be your own boss" and Mwangi got his start repairing radios.</p>

<p>"My dad bought me a radio. After some time it stopped 'talking' and he said he wouldn't buy another one. I was stressed because I was addicted to music and listening to radio, so I just opened it using a knife," he said.</p>

<p>Soon he was repairing electronic devices in his village near Meru in central Kenya.</p>

<p>Then one day he saw a DJ in a bar and was inspired.</p>

<p>"I loved how he played music and the way the crowd reacted. I didn't have the money to buy real equipment but I said I could make my own with the available resources."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mwangi moved to the capital and now makes a living from his DJing and occasionally selling specially commissioned turntables.</p>

<p>His favourite venue is the street, especially in the business district or at Gikomba, the largest second-hand clothing market in the country.</p>

<p>"Street shows is a special feeling, you have contact with the people. Many people have never seen a DJ mixing live," he said.</p>

<p>Among the onlookers, 48-year-old ex-soldier Zachary Mibei said he loved how Mwangi illustrates the situation for young people in Kenya.</p>

<p>"He has no training, it's all homemade, he is showing that he has something in him. He is telling us: 'I can do it by myself'," said Mibei.</p>

<p>Boboss admits it is probably time for a more advanced turntable with a few extra functions, but does not plan to part with the one which has made him famous.</p>

<p>"We could combine both and see what we can do with them," he smiled.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Yazidi woman who was kidnapped by ISIS terrorists at age 11 and then held by Hamas for a decade has been rescued by Israeli forces in Gaza after a months-long operation led by the US, officials said.</p>

<p>Fawzia Amin Sido, 21, was rescued earlier this week. A footage of her being embraced tightly by her family soon after reaching Iraq was released by officials.</p>

<p>The Israeli military said Ms Sido was freed after an operation coordinated between Israel, the United States, and other international actors.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Fawzia, a Yazidi girl kidnapped by ISIS from Iraq and brought to Gaza at just 11 years old, has finally been rescued by the Israeli security forces.<br />
<br />
For years, she was held captive by a Palestinian Hamas-ISIS member.<br />

She has now been reunited with her family. Her story is a... <a href="https://t.co/nkVotqYdov">pic.twitter.com/nkVotqYdov</a></p>

<p>When she was 11, Fawzia was trafficked by ISIS to a Hamas terrorist in Gaza, who was presumably killed during IDF strikes, the officials said in a statement. She fled to a hideout in which she was rescued in a secret mission through the Kerem Shalom Crossing, the official release mentioned.</p>

<p>David Saranga, Head of Digital Diplomacy Bureau in the Foreign Ministry of Israel, said her story is a reminder of the brutality faced by Yazidi children.</p>

<p>"Her story is a reminder of the brutality faced by Yazidi children, taken without a choice. Remember, there are still 101 Israelis being held hostage in Gaza," he tweeted.</p>

<p>After the 2014 massacres, some 1,00,000 Yazidis fled to Europe, the United States, Australia and Canada, according to the United Nations.</p>

<p>The Israeli military has been fighting against Hamas in Gaza since its unprecedented attack on Israel almost a year ago which resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, according to an AFP tally.</p>

<p>Israel's retaliatory military offensive in Gaza has killed at least 41,788 people, the majority of them civilians, according to figures provided by the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Japan's new Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba warned in his first policy speech Friday that "today's Ukraine could be tomorrow's East Asia" while also dubbing the country's low birth rate a "quiet emergency".]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japan's new Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba warned in his first policy speech Friday that "today's Ukraine could be tomorrow's East Asia" while also dubbing the country's low birth rate a "quiet emergency".</p>

<p>"Many fear that today's Ukraine could be tomorrow's East Asia. Why did deterrence not work in Ukraine?" Ishiba told parliament.</p>

<p>"Combined with the situation in the Middle East, the international community is becoming increasingly divided and confrontational," the 67-year-old former defence minister said.</p>

<p>Ishiba made no direct reference to China but his country's relations with Beijing have deteriorated in recent years as it asserts its military presence around disputed territories in the region.</p>

<p>Of particular concern is Taiwan. Beijing claims the democratic island as part of its territory and has never renounced the use of force to bring the self-ruled island under its control.</p>

<p>Japan has also irked China with plans for a major increase in defence spending and by boosting security ties with the United States and its allies including the Philippines and South Korea.</p>

<p>In August, a Chinese military aircraft staged the first confirmed incursion by China into Japanese airspace, followed weeks later by a Japanese warship sailing through the Taiwan Strait for the first time.</p>

<p>Ishiba has backed the creation of a regional military alliance along the lines of NATO, saying on Tuesday that the security environment in Asia was "the most severe since the end of World War II".</p>

<h3><strong>Falling population&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Japan, like many developed countries, is facing a looming demographic crisis as its population ages and the birth rate stays stubbornly low.</p>

<p>The country has the world's oldest population after tiny Monaco, according to the World Bank.</p>

<p>Last year, its birth rate -- the average number of children a woman is expected to have in her life -- stood at 1.2, well below the 2.1 needed to maintain the population.</p>

<p>On Friday, Ishiba called the birth rate situation a "quiet emergency", adding the government would promote measures to support families such as flexible working hours.</p>

<h3><strong>Minimum wage</strong></h3>

<p>Kishida was unpopular with voters because of a string of scandals and inflation squeezing earnings in the world's fourth-biggest economy.</p>

<p>Ishiba wants to boost incomes through a new monetary stimulus package as well as support for local governments and low-income households.</p>

<p>Within this decade, he said Friday he wants to hike the average national minimum wage to 1,500 yen ($10.20) per hour, up nearly 43 per cent from the current 1,050 yen.</p>

<p>The yen surged last Friday after the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) voted Ishiba its new leader because he had broadly backed the Bank of Japan's exit from its ultra-loose policies.</p>

<p>But Ishiba told reporters late Wednesday he did not think the environment was right for further interest rate hikes, sending the Japanese currency south again.</p>

<p>On Friday afternoon, one dollar bought 146.02 yen, having slightly recovered from levels past 147 earlier this week.</p>

<h3><strong>Succession&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Ishiba also weighed in on the dearth of eligible male heirs to the imperial throne.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Male-only succession rules mean the imperial family is facing extinction, with only one young heir: Emperor Naruhito's 18-year-old nephew Prince Hisahito.</p>

<p>The emperor's daughter Princess Aiko, 22, is barred from the throne under the Imperial Household Law, in place since 1947.</p>

<p>Royal women must leave the family when they wed a commoner -- as in 2021, when former princess Mako Komuro, Naruhito's niece, married her university sweetheart.</p>

<p>Lawmakers in May began discussing a possible relaxation of the strict succession rules, and a recent Kyodo News poll found 90 per cent public support for female succession.</p>

<p>"Stable royal succession is extremely important. Stabilising the number of members of the Imperial Family is a particularly urgent issue," Ishiba told parliament, calling for active debate on the issue.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The world had been for months expecting the conflict in the Middle East to blow up. That escalation has happened finally. It has been a remarkable turnaround for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was under siege from within and under pressure from the outside. After Iran launched almost 200 missiles towards Israel, most of which were intercepted, Netanyahu has made it clear that Iran had made a "big mistake" and that it would "pay for it". The US is reportedly "discussing" the possibility of Israel striking Iranian oil sites and warnings continue to emanate from Iran that more is coming.</p>

<p>Diplomacy is no longer even in discussion, and like many times in the past, battlefield realities are dictating the behaviour of key protagonists in the never-ending Middle Eastern saga. This time, Israel and Iran are face to face. After an Israeli air strike killed Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, Netanyahu warned Iran - Hezbollah's patron - that it could also become a target, underlining that "those who strike at us [Israel], we will strike at them", and that "there is nowhere in Iran or the Middle East beyond the reach of the long arm of Israel". Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, for his part, responded to the killing of Nasrallah by suggesting that it would be avenged and that his path in fighting Israel would be continued by other militants.</p>

<h2><strong>Israel Is Going For The Jugular</strong></h2>

<p>Israel's ground invasion of southern Lebanon that began last week shows no signs of relenting, with Israel warning more people to evacuate their homes, saying strikes would continue. For many in Israel, like the former prime minister Naftali Bennett, this was "the greatest opportunity in 50 years to change the face of the Middle East", with suggestions that Israel should go after Iran's nuclear facilities in order to "fatally cripple this terrorist regime". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has also reached out directly to the Iranians, with the message that regime change was around the corner. "When Iran is finally free, and that moment will come a lot sooner than people think - everything will be different," Netanyahu said in a video statement addressed to Iranians, adding that "our two ancient peoples, the Jewish people and the Persian people, will finally be at peace".</p>

<p>At the moment, however, no one is planning for peace. Buoyed by its battlefield successes, Israel is keen to go for the jugular. It has had some stunning successes with the decapitation of Hezbollah's top leadership and the destruction of its weapons stockpile. The invasion of Lebanon is aimed at cleaning up the remnants of Hezbollah and its supporters. The veneer of the Iranian deterrent has been blown into smithereens. Iran is feeling the heat, and thus, unlike the very choreographed missile attack on Israel in April, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps made a public display of their recent retaliation by announcing their intent. But with Israel continuing to push through southern Lebanon and Washington moving another carrier battle group to the Mediterranean, difficult decisions await Iran. Much as it would like to draw a line under this, Tehran's entire regional strategy, which till some time back looked like a winning one, suddenly has no legs to stand.</p>

<h2><strong>Iranian Regime Is In A Bind, But Not Going Anywhere</strong></h2>

<p>But it is exactly this which makes this a perilous moment in regional evolution. With its deterrence posture based on regional proxies now lacking credibility, Tehran has all the incentive to accelerate the development of its nuclear weapons capability, a move that will reshape the strategic contours of the Middle East. For all the bombast emanating from Israel about redrawing the political map of the region, a regime change in Iran remains in the realm of fantasy. The Iranian regime is not going anywhere in a hurry, nor is its worldview going to change. The only change that might come would be in the shape of its capabilities.</p>

<p>Even as the region struggles to come to terms with the escalation of violence, India's equities in the region have also come under stress. New Delhi's strong ties with both Israel and Iran will put pressure on Indian diplomacy. But its key priorities will remain ensuring energy security and the safety of its citizens in the region. India's entreaties for restraint, however, are unlikely to have much of an impact on the key players in this conflict, which remain intent on using the present escalation to seek long-term strategic gains. But the Middle East is a curious region where victories and defeats are never permanent and the end of every war spawns a new one.</p>

<p>But why do we have longer days in summer and shorter days in winter?</p>

<h3><strong>It's all about the tilt</strong></h3>

<p>Earth goes around the Sun in an almost circular orbit. But not everything is lined up perfectly. Earth's axis is tilted by 23.44 degrees relative to its orbit around the Sun.</p>

<p>Imagine Earth's orbit as a flat frisbee with the Sun in the middle and Earth as a ball on a stick going around the edge.</p>

<p>If Earth's axis wasn't tilted (if its tilt was zero degrees) the stick would be exactly perpendicular to the frisbee. If you grab that perpendicular stick and tip it 23.44 degrees sideways, that's what Earth's tilt looks like now.</p>

<p>As Earth orbits the Sun, the tilt of the stick does not rotate relative to the Sun. If you were in outer space looking at the Sun and you watched from the exact same position for a whole year, you would see Earth go around the Sun while the stick stayed tilted in the same direction.</p>

<p>In other words, if the top of the stick was pointing to the right when you started watching Earth go around the Sun, it would stay pointing to the right the whole way around.</p>

<p>This tilt gives us longer days in summer and shorter days in winter. Let's set up the scenario so the Northern Hemisphere is the top of the planet and the Southern Hemisphere is the bottom of the planet.</p>

<p>When Earth is on one side of the Sun, the top of the stick is pointed towards the Sun. This is summer in the Northern Hemisphere and winter in the Southern Hemisphere. Six months later, when Earth is on the other side of the Sun, the bottom of the stick is pointed towards the Sun - and the seasons are reversed.</p>

<h3><strong>Solstices and equinoxes</strong></h3>

<p>Those two points, when the top of the stick is pointing directly towards the Sun or directly away from the Sun, are the solstices. They are the longest and shortest days of the year, depending on your hemisphere.</p>

<p>The shortest day of 2024 in Australia was June 21. Looking forward to sunnier times, the longest day of the year in 2024 will be December 21.</p>

<p>In between the summer and winter solstice, we have the equinoxes - when days and nights are almost exactly the same length. Those are the days when the stick through Earth is "side-on" to the Sun. The equinox is also the day when the Sun passes directly over Earth's equator. In 2024 this happened on March 20 at 2:06 pm AEDT and September 22 at 10:43 pm AEST.</p>

<p>That means that since September 22, days have been getting longer than nights in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>

<h3><strong>What does daylight saving do?</strong></h3>

<p>Earth's tilt means the Sun both rises earlier and sets later as we head towards summer. When the clocks (in some states) switch to daylight saving time, people in these states all get one hour less of sleep. However, the total length of the day doesn't change just because we changed our clocks.</p>

<p>For me, daylight saving means I need an extra cup of coffee in the morning for about a week before I adjust to the daylight saving lag (like jet lag, but without the fun of travel).</p>

<p>What it really gives us is more daylight in the evening, instead of more daylight in the morning. If you're already a morning person, this isn't the way to go. But if you prefer to have a long dinner in the summer sun it's ideal.</p>

<h3><strong>Has it always been this way?</strong></h3>

<p>Earth's axis hasn't always been tilted at 23.44 degrees. It cycles from a minimum 22.1-degree tilt to a maximum 24.5-degree tilt and back again once every approximately 41,000 years.</p>

<p>Earth's axis also "precesses", where the stick through it draws a circle once every approximately 26,000 years. You can see this in the animation below.</p>

<p>The length of a day on Earth hasn't always been the same, either.</p>

<p>At the moment, the length of a day is nearly exactly 24 hours. But it's shifting all the time by tiny amounts. This is tracked very closely by a system of telescopes and satellites. These systems measure "Earth orientation parameters" that describe Earth's exact orientation compared to the position of stars in the sky.</p>

<p>These are important to astronomers because the exact location of our telescopes is important for creating accurate maps of the sky. On top of all of this, the gravitational drag from the Moon causes days to become longer by around 2.3 milliseconds every 100 years. A few billion years ago, Earth's day was a lot shorter - only 19 hours long.</p>

<p>Even though some of us are losing an hour of sleep this weekend, at least we get to enjoy 2.3 milliseconds longer every day than our great - and great-great-grandparents did.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A rare Rolex watch that journeyed to the Moon is set to be auctioned, with estimates suggesting a price that could soar beyond $400,000 (3.35 crore), the<a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/03/us-news/rolex-worn-on-the-moon-by-apollo-14-astronaut-up-for-auction/" rel="NoFollowNoIndex"> New York Post reported</a>. The GMT-Master 'Pepsi' model, which belonged to the late astronaut Edgar Mitchell — the sixth man to walk on the Moon —will be offered by RR Auction. The auction house described the timepiece as part of Mitchell's collection, highlighting that it is one of only two Apollo-flown Rolex watches ever to be sold at auction. The auction for the watch will conclude on October 24.</p>

<p>Photographs reveal the iconic watch adorning the wrist of the Texas-born aviator during his historic Apollo 14 mission in 1971. While NASA gave astronauts Omega Speedmaster Professional watches, Mitchell opted for both the official timepiece and his personal 'Pepsi' model. The watch's distinctive name comes from its striking blue and red bezel, designed in collaboration with Pan American to help pilots track both local and Greenwich Mean Time.</p>

<p>Engraved with the words "Worn by Cdr. E. Mitchell on Apollo 14, 1971, To Karlin - My Daughter," the watch's sentimental value is expected to significantly enhance its auction price.</p>

<p>Mitchell, renowned for his role in the Apollo 14 mission, played a significant role in rescuing the crew of the Apollo 13 mission after its electrical system failed. For his lifesaving contributions, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Richard Nixon in 1970.</p>

<p>He passed away on February 4, 2016, at the age of 85, leaving behind a legacy of exploration and inquiry into the mysteries of human experience.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[The discovery was made off the coast of northern California during a recent expedition involving Ocean Infinity.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A team of undersea investigators has <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://searchweb.blob.core.windows.net/hosted/USS%20Stewart%20Press%20Release.pdf " rel="nofollow,noindex">located the wreck</a> of the USS Stewart (DD-224), a historic US Navy destroyer, which served under both American and Japanese flags during World War II. The discovery was made off the coast of northern California during a recent expedition involving Ocean Infinity, the Air/Sea Heritage Foundation, SEARCH, NOAA's Office of National Marine Sanctuaries and the Naval History and Heritage Command (NHHC).<br />
<br />
The wreck, also known as “the ghost ship of the Pacific,” lies within the Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary, matching historical accounts of its final resting place. The Stewart was intentionally sunk in 1946, as part of a naval exercise. Commissioned in September 1920, the Stewart completed its construction too late to participate in World War I. However, it found itself on the front lines at the outset of World War II.<br />
<br />
In 1941, the Stewart was stationed in Manila as part of the US Navy's Asiatic Fleet, tasked with opposing Imperial Japan's aggressive expansion following the attack on Pearl Harbour. The destroyer sustained damage during combat in February 1942, and a freak accident left it trapped in a dry dock on Java. As enemy forces prepared to seize the island, the crew was forced to abandon the ship.<br />
<br />
It was, then, captured by Imperial Japanese forces and pressed into service as Patrol Boat No. 102. Once the war was over, the Stewart was recommissioned into the US Navy in an “emotional” ceremony before being towed back to San Francisco. There, the ship served one last time as a target for naval gunnery exercises, absorbing fire for over two hours before sinking into the depths.<br />
<br />
The story of the USS Stewart has caught the attention of historians, archaeologists and naval enthusiasts for years. On August 1, 2024, Ocean Infinity sent out three underwater drones to find its wreck. Using advanced sonar technology, the drones scanned the seafloor for 24 hours and discovered the sunken ship 3,500 feet below the surface.<br />
<br />
Months earlier, Andy Sherrell, Director of Maritime Operations at Ocean Infinity America, saw a chance to test new technology. He worked with Russ Matthews, President of the Air/Sea Heritage Foundation, and Dr. James Delgado, former NOAA Director of Maritime Heritage, to find important sunken ships to explore. They chose the USS Stewart for this mission and NOAA's Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary gave them a permit for the survey.<br />
<br />
Matthews found details about the Stewart's sinking in 1946 from old logbooks at the National Archives. Early sonar scans showed that the ship was mostly intact and sitting upright on the seafloor. This makes it one of the best-preserved examples of a US Navy “four-stacker” destroyer.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elon Musk said he would attend a rally that Donald Trump is holding on Saturday in Butler, Pennsylvania, the setting of the first assassination attempt on the former president.</p>

<p>In a post late Thursday New York time on his social platform X, the billionaire wrote, "I will be there to support!" in response to the Republican presidential nominee's post about his return to the site.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In South Korea and China, office workers are increasingly turning to intravenous (IV) drips to combat fatigue and regain energy, according to a <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3279770/burned-out-south-korea-and-china-youth-embrace-nutrient-iv-therapy-boost-energy" rel="NoFollowNoIndex">report from MYNews</a>. This practice, known as intravenous nutrient therapy (IVNT), involves a blend of liquid vitamins and saline administered directly into the body.</p>

<p>Initially used for treating cancer, joint health, and growth disorders, IVNT has now found its way into aesthetic medicine, according to a June report from Medical Aesthetics News, a South Korean publication focused on the beauty industry.</p>

<p>The cost of nutrient drips at a clinic in Seoul ranges from 25,000 to 60,000 won (approximately Rs 1,500 to Rs 3,600) per session, lasting about 40 minutes. The clinic recommends a weekly infusion for optimal results.</p>

<p>Another clinic in Seoul lists the Cinderella, garlic, and placenta drips as the most sought-after options among clients. The Cinderella drip, rich in antioxidants like alpha-lipoic acid and Vitamin C, promises to reduce oxidative stress and slow the ageing process.</p>

<p>The garlic drip, which contains Vitamin B1, has a garlicky taste and is believed to help alleviate fatigue, particularly for patients suffering from insomnia. The placenta drip, made from various components of the placenta, including amino acids, aims to enhance skin elasticity in middle-aged women.</p>

<p>A survey by South Korea's Asian Daily found that over half of young people feel mentally and physically drained due to success-related pressures.</p>

<p>Health professionals, however, advise caution regarding IVNT. "Intravenous nutrient infusions bypass the body's filter system, raising the risk of serious reactions like phlebitis," warned Deng Guifang, a nutritionist at Huazhong University of Science and Technology Xiehe Shenzhen Hospital. She recommends focusing on gut-based nutrition and maintaining a balanced diet for better health.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a bitterly contested US election campaign enters its final stretch, misinformation researchers have raised the alarm over threats posed by AI and foreign influence -- but voters appear more concerned about falsehoods from a more familiar source: politicians.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The United States is battling a firehose of misinformation before the November 5 vote -- from fake "news" sites that researchers say were created by Russian and Iranian actors, to manipulated images generated by artificial intelligence tools that have blurred the boundaries between reality and fiction.</p>

<p>More concerning for voters, however, is misinformation spreading the good old-fashioned way, through politicians sowing falsehoods, with researchers saying they face almost no legal consequences for distorting the truth.</p>

<p>"I think when we do a post-mortem on 2024 the most viral misinformation will have either emanated from politicians or will have been amplified by politicians," Joshua Tucker, co-director of the New York University Center for Social Media and Politics, told AFP.</p>

<p>In a survey published last week by Axios, 51 per cent of Americans identified politicians spreading falsehoods as their top concern regarding misinformation.</p>

<p>Thirty-five per cent named "social media companies failing to stop misinformation," and "AI being used to deceive people."</p>

<p>About 30 per cent expressed concern about foreign governments spreading misinformation.</p>

<h3><strong>'Liar's dividend'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>"It's like, 'The call is coming from inside the house,'" said John Gerzema, head of the pollster that conducted the survey, repeating a popular reference from a classic horror movie.</p>

<p>"In past elections, there was always fear of misinformation and election interference coming from abroad. But here we see the most likely source of concern is America's own politicians spreading misinformation."</p>

<p>A flood of photorealistic AI-generated fake images on social media has unleashed what researchers call the "deep doubt" era -- a new age of scepticism that has diminished online trust.</p>

<p>Growing fears about the power of generative AI tools have given politicians a handy incentive to cast doubt about the authenticity of real content -- a tactic popularly dubbed as the "liar's dividend."</p>

<p>Voters saw that play out in August when Republican nominee Donald Trump falsely accused his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, of using AI technology to manipulate a Michigan campaign rally photo to project a larger crowd size.</p>

<p>That claim was easily disproved by photos and videos from AFP journalists who were present at the rally as well as digital forensics experts who told AFP's fact-checkers that the image in question did not carry signs of AI manipulation.</p>

<p>"As people begin to accept the ubiquity of generative AI, it becomes easier to convince yourself that things you don't want to be true aren't," Tucker said.</p>

<p>"Politicians know this, so they now have the option to try to disavow true things as having been produced by AI," he added.</p>

<h3><strong>'Stretching the truth'&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>In the months leading up to the election, AFP's fact-checkers have consistently debunked a litany of false claims by the presidential and vice-presidential candidates on both sides of the political aisle.</p>

<p>Those include baseless rumors amplified by the Trump campaign that Haitian migrants in Ohio were stealing and eating pets and Harris's misleading claim that the former president left the Democrats "the worst unemployment since the Great Depression."</p>

<p>In the Axios survey, eight in 10 voters voiced concern that misinformation can significantly affect election outcomes and more than half the respondents said they had disengaged from politics because they "can't tell what's true."</p>

<p>Republicans are nearly as worried as Democrats and independents about politicians spreading misinformation, according to the survey.</p>

<p>There is little to stop them, experts say, with freedom of speech protected under US First Amendment rights and courts striking down several attempts in the past to regulate false political speech.</p>

<p>Social media content moderation of political falsehoods has also emerged as a lightning rod, with many conservatives calling it "censorship" under the guise of fighting misinformation.</p>

<p>"Every election cycle, we are confronted by the same concern: whether the candidates are telling the truth," Roy Gutterman, a Syracuse University professor, told AFP.</p>

<p>"Aside from not being elected because of untruthful statements, there really are no consequences for candidates stretching the truth or lying about either their own accomplishments or false criticism about their opponents."&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Abortion has never been so close to the heart of an American presidential election, but this is the first to be held after access to the procedure was banned or restricted across much of the country following a landmark Supreme Court ruling.</p>

<p>Ten states are holding referendums on the issue, and those questions will appear on the same ballots used to cast presidential votes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The outcome could have profound implications, with the potential for restrictions affecting millions of women to be overturned. But Democrats also hope the issue will mobilize a broader swath of the electorate in their favor.</p>

<p>"Mobilization is typically what determines the outcome of an election," Samara Klar, a professor of political science at the University of Arizona, told AFP, noting that women voters in states where abortion was under threat helped the Democratic Party exceed expectations in the 2022 midterms.</p>

<p>Harris has made abortion a central theme of her campaign, repeatedly linking her opponent, former president Donald Trump, to tragic stories, such as women forced to cross state lines to terminate their life-threatening pregnancies.</p>

<p>"This is a health care crisis, and Donald Trump is the architect," the vice president said at a recent campaign stop in Georgia, after it was revealed a woman died when medical care was delayed due to the state's restrictive abortion law.</p>

<p>During his term, Trump reshaped the Supreme Court, which in 2022 left the states to decide their own abortion policies by overturning Roe v. Wade -- and thus dismantling five decades of precedent protecting the procedure nationwide.</p>

<p>The Republican has consistently touted his role in this decision, yet he denies Democratic claims that he plans to pursue a national ban on abortion, despite pressure from conservative scholars and activists for such an outcome.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the wake of the Roe decision, Democrats have positioned themselves as the party of reproductive rights, with polls indicating that a majority of Americans support access to abortion.</p>

<p>"They want to ride that wave," Benjamin Case, an assistant professor at Arizona State University, told AFP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Harris, he says, "knows the more people are thinking about that issue, if they associate Democrats with the issue, if they associate her with the issue, it can only help her."</p>

<p>Women, who vote in greater numbers than men in the United States, strongly favor Harris over Trump.</p>

<p>- Key in Arizona? -<br />
The stakes are particularly high in Arizona, which could easily swing either way come November. President Joe Biden won the southwestern state by a whisker in 2020.</p>

<p>Currently, abortion is banned in Arizona after 15 weeks of pregnancy, but a citizen-led ballot measure aims to restore access until fetal viability, around 24 weeks.</p>

<p>Democrats hope the issue will drive voter turnout and work in their favor for the presidential vote too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"When you're talking about such an incredibly close state like Arizona, anything could make a difference," said Klar.</p>

<p>In five states, including New York, Colorado, and battleground state Nevada, voters will decide whether to strengthen protections for abortion, even though it is already legal in those places.</p>

<p>But in the other five states, the referendums could have more radical effects -- overturning bans or extending the window during which pregnant people can access the procedure.</p>

<p>- No easy answers -<br />
In Florida, the third most populous state, health care providers are currently permitted to perform abortions only up to six weeks into pregnancy -- often before many women even realize they are pregnant.</p>

<p>"Amendment 4" aims to restore the right to abortion until fetal viability, a massive step for millions of women in the Sunshine State.</p>

<p>"I would not be shocked if every single abortion rights vote passed," said Case, who studies these types of initiatives.</p>

<p>Since 2022, every time the issue has been put to a direct vote, the right to abortion has prevailed -- even in conservative states like Kansas and Kentucky.</p>

<p>But the overall impact on the general election could be more "complicated," Case cautioned.</p>

<p>The economy and immigration are still ranked as higher priorities for voters than abortion, according to polls.</p>

<p>Being able to protect abortion rights through a referendum could also "free" some voters -- especially those disillusioned by the Democrats' stance on issues like Gaza -- who might then feel less compelled to support the party in the White House race, he said.</p>

<p>"I'm not convinced that this is something that the Democrats can sit back and say we can relax, because the abortion vote will carry us," he concluded.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mark Zuckerberg became the world's second-richest person for the first time Thursday, jumping ahead of Jeff Bezos as shares of Meta Platforms Inc. continue to climb.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Zuckerberg's bet on the metaverse - which initially looked like a huge bust - has paid off in recent months, pushing his net worth to a high-water mark of $206.2 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That puts him $1.1 billion ahead of Amazon.com Inc.'s Bezos and almost $50 billion behind Tesla Inc.'s Elon Musk.</p>

<p>Meta shares have risen 23% since reporting better-than-expected sales in the second quarter and touting its push into the type of large language models that power AI chatbots. The stock closed Thursday at an all-time high of $582.77.</p>

<p>Meta has spent heavily on data centres and computing power as Zuckerberg works to build a leading position in the industry-wide AI race. The company has also moved ahead with other long-term projects, including its Orion augmented reality glasses, which the company introduced last month.</p>

<p>Zuckerberg, who owns a 13% stake in the Menlo Park, California-based company, has seen his fortune grow $78 billion so far this year, the most of any of the world's 500 richest people tracked by the Bloomberg index.</p>

<p>The 40-year-old co-founder and chief executive officer has gained four spots this year on the wealth index.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

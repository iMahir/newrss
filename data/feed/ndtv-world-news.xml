       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On August 15, 2021, the Taliban swiftly took over Kabul following the withdrawal of the US-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), marking a significant diplomatic setback for India. The Taliban were believed to have support from the Tehreek-e-Taliban-e-Pakistan (TTP) operating around the Durand Line, as well as from moderates in Doha.</p>

<p>Amidst the ensuing chaos, India was forced to shut down its embassy in Kabul, evacuating diplomats and citizens. New Delhi had invested heavily in Afghanistan, but the future seemed uncertain under the shadow of conflict. As of August 2020, there were approximately 1,710 Indians in Afghanistan, working in sectors such as banking, IT, construction, healthcare, NGOs, telecom, security, and education, as well as with Afghan and UN missions.</p>

<p><strong>Aid to Afghanistan</strong></p>

<p>The Taliban's return and the subsequent withdrawal of international forces led many countries, including India, to pull out. However, the Taliban leadership soon realized that running a government required more than just military might-it needed external funds and assistance. New Delhi has cautiously responded to Kabul's appeals for aid. Important delegations visited Afghanistan, and a technical mission was established in June 2022 to better understand and coordinate humanitarian efforts.</p>

<p>Since 2001, India has committed over USD 3 billion to development and reconstruction projects in Afghanistan. Bilateral trade between India and Afghanistan was valued at USD 1.5 billion in 2019-20. India has supported projects such as a new Parliament building in Kabul and two major river dams. More than 500 projects span across 34 Afghan provinces, addressing critical areas such as power, water supply, road connectivity, healthcare, education, agriculture, and capacity building.</p>

<p>Various bilateral and multilateral meetings have taken place, and the Union Budget for 2024-25 allocated Rs. 200 crores to Afghanistan. This represents a decrease from Rs. 350 crores in the 2021-22 budget.</p>

<p>The Taliban have urged India to resume development projects, arguing that such initiatives would create job opportunities, alleviate poverty, and support development.</p>

<p><strong>The China Factor</strong></p>

<p>India's outreach to Afghanistan is influenced by the regional dynamics, including China's growing activity. Initially excluded from China's expansive Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in Asia, Afghanistan has seen increased Chinese involvement and funding. A Parliamentary Committee on External Affairs report from last year noted the strategic importance for India to deepen ties with its smaller neighbours in response to China's BRI and America's Indo-Pacific vision.</p>

<p>China is courting the Taliban to counter the Uyghur separatist movement. Beijing wants the Taliban to address the Eastern Turkestan Islamic Movement, which, according to a 2021 UN report, is active in Badakhshan, Faryab, Kabul, and Nuristan provinces. The report indicated that the group seeks to establish a Uyghur state in Xinjiang, China, and facilitates the movement of fighters from Afghanistan to China.</p>

<p>Despite its efforts, Beijing's support for Afghanistan has not met all expectations. China has provided funds, machinery, and technical support, but not as generously as Afghanistan hoped. The country's economic growth was recorded at -6.2% in 2022, according to Afghanistan's National Statistics and Information Authority (NSIA).</p>

<p><strong>Pakistan No Longer a Friend</strong></p>

<p>Pakistan has long served as a training ground and launchpad for the Mujahideen in their struggle against Soviet forces. Reportedly supported by the CIA, Peshawar in Pakistan quickly became a crucial hub for the fighters. This is well-documented in The Bear Trap by Brigadier Mohammed Yousuf and Mark Adkin. Yousuf, who led Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Afghan desk from 1983 to 1987, and Adkin, a major in the British Army, detail the logistical and military support Pakistan received from the CIA during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.</p>

<p>Beyond the USA and the former USSR, several other countries have played strategic games in Afghanistan due to its geopolitical significance. This has resulted in the division of its people along ethnic and cultural lines to serve the interests of these external powers. Peter Hopkirk chronicles this history in The Great Game, a term coined by British intelligence officer Captain Arthur Conolly during the British occupation of the country in the 19th century.</p>

<p>Despite their ethnic differences, Afghans have resisted aggressors for centuries. During the Soviet era, Pashtuns from the south and Tajiks and Uzbeks from the north employed guerrilla tactics, striking and retreating across the country's rugged terrain.</p>

<p>A paper by Amna Puri-Mirza, a researcher specializing in the Middle East, published in September 2022, reveals that as of 2020, Afghanistan's population of approximately 33 million was composed of 42% Pashtuns, 27% Tajiks, and 9% Hazaras. The CIA World Factbook estimates that in 2020, Afghan Persian (Dari) and Pashto were spoken by 77% and 48% of the population, respectively.</p>

<p>The Durand Line, established in November 1893 as the official boundary between undivided India and Afghanistan, remains contentious. Afghanistan has never accepted this boundary, seeking its shift eastward to incorporate Pashtun-majority areas in Pakistan. This disagreement has led to intermittent conflicts.</p>

<p>Relations between Islamabad and Kabul have deteriorated as Pakistan has increased its pressure on Afghanistan for harbouring "Pakistani Taliban" and for alleged strikes on Pakistani soil. Frequent gunfights have led to the closure of the border, causing significant disruptions for Afghan traders. Key border crossings like Torkham and Spin Boldak have been particularly affected, with long queues of stranded vehicles.</p>

<p>India has faced setbacks in its involvement in Afghanistan over the past three decades. In the ongoing great game, countries like China, Russia, and Iran are influential in shaping Afghanistan's future, and India must navigate these shifting alliances carefully.</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Russian government announced Wednesday that it was reintroducing a ban on petrol exports for another six months to "maintain a stable situation" on the domestic fuel market after major price hikes.</p>

<p>The government said in a statement that it has "brought in a restriction on exports of petrol from September 1 to December 31, 2024".</p>

<p>The measure is intended to keep prices stable "during a period of continued seasonal demand and planned repairs on oil refineries", the government said.</p>

<p>Russia in March introduced a six-month ban on petrol exports, but then suspended it temporarily between May and July, saying the domestic market was saturated.</p>

<p>The new restriction will not affect deliveries carried out under intergovernmental agreements including those with the Eurasian Economic Union member countries -- Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Armenia -- the government said.</p>

<p>Despite its massive energy reserves, Russia announced a similar export ban on diesel and petrol last year as pump prices hit Russians' purchasing power, already affected by weakening of the ruble due to sanctions.</p>

<p>In 2023, Russia produced 43.9 million tonnes of petrol, according to official figures.</p>

<p>Revenues from oil and gas sales remain essential to Moscow as it gears its economy towards efforts to sustain the military offensive in Ukraine.</p>

<p>In recent months, Ukrainian forces have targeted fuel depots with drone attacks, cutting off vital resources for Russia's forces.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since the Titanic's wreckage was discovered in 1985, a vast array of over 5,000 artefacts have been recovered from the depths of the Atlantic Ocean. A significant portion of these treasures are stored in a secretive warehouse in Atlanta, Georgia, with limited access for viewing.&nbsp;However, the exact location is not known.</p>

<p>As per <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1vd9k33r00o">BBC</a></em>, the collection includes a range of personal belongings and relics, such as handbags, perfume vials still containing fragrances, and countless other items. In a rare and exclusive opportunity, the BBC was granted access to the secretive storage facility.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, RMS Titanic Inc, a US-based company, holds the exclusive rights to salvage artefacts from the Titanic wreck site, granted by a US court in 1994. However, the company is prohibited from breaking or dividing any of the recovered items, ensuring they remain intact and preserved for historical and cultural significance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Among the treasures in the Titanic collection, is a small, exquisite alligator skin handbag that belonged to Marian Meanwell, a 63-year-old milliner who was travelling in third class, bound for the United States, to be with her daughter who was recently widowed.</p>

<p>''It's a really beautiful, fashionable little bag,'' said Tomasina Ray, director of collections for RMS Titanic Inc.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The handbag endured the unforgiving North Atlantic waters for decades, safeguarding its precious contents. Inside the bag was a faded photograph, yellowed paperwork, and a heartfelt, handwritten reference letter from her former landlord in London. However, the most heartbreaking discovery was her medical inspection card, revealing that she had initially booked passage on the Majestic, but when it failed to sail, her booking was transferred to the ill-fated Titanic.</p>

<p>A collection of miniature perfume vials, that belonged to Adolphe Saalfeld, a second-class passenger and perfume connoisseur, was also found.&nbsp;Miraculously, the vials remained sealed, and their aroma was intact.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other items recovered are a champagne bottle, still sealed with a cork, metal pins used to hold the ship's steel plates together etc.&nbsp;</p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>France has launched a cyberbullying probe following a complaint by Algerian Olympic boxing champion Imane Khelif, who was at the centre of a gender controversy at the Paris Olympic Games, prosecutors said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The investigation was opened Tuesday into "cyberharrassment" following the high-profile gender row at the Games, the Paris public prosecutor's office told AFP.</p>

<p>The athlete's lawyer Nabil Boudi said last week that Khelif, 25, had filed a complaint for online harassment, calling it a "fight for justice."</p>

<p>"The investigation will determine who was behind this misogynist, racist and sexist campaign, but will also have to concern itself with those who fed the online lynching," he said at the time.</p>

<p>Khelif won the women's 66kg final against China's Yang Liu in a unanimous points decision, having been the focus of intense scrutiny in the French capital during the Olympics.</p>

<p>Together with Taiwan's Lin Yu-ting, who won the 57kg women's final, Khelif was disqualified from last year's world championships after they failed gender eligibility testing.</p>

<p>However, they were cleared to compete in Paris, setting the stage for one of the biggest controversies of the Games.</p>

<p>The International Boxing Association's Russian president Umar Kremlev has targeted both athletes, claiming that Khelif and Lin had undergone "genetic testing that shows that these are men".</p>

<p>The IBA was responsible for the world championships in 2023 that Lin and Khelif were thrown out of, but the IOC cleared them to box in Paris.</p>

<p>Khelif said she is "a woman like any other."</p>

<p>"I was born a woman, lived a woman and competed as a woman," she told reporters about her eligibility.</p>

<p>Russia's team has been banned from the Paris Olympics over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Thailand's Constitutional Court removed Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin from office on Wednesday as it ruled against him in an ethics case that threw the kingdom into fresh political turmoil.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thailand's Constitutional Court removed Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin from office on Wednesday, ruling against him in an ethics case that throws the kingdom into fresh political turmoil.</p>

<p>The judges ruled 5-4 that Srettha breached regulations by appointing a lawyer with a criminal conviction to his cabinet, in a case brought by a group of former senators appointed by Thailand's former ruling junta.</p>

<p>The ruling comes a week after the same court dissolved the main opposition Move Forward Party (MFP) and banned its former leader from politics for 10 years.</p>

<p>"The court rules by a majority of five to four that the ministerial position of the prime minister is terminated under the constitution, because he has not shown honesty in appointing this minister," Judge Punya Udchachon said in reading the court's judgment.</p>

<p>Punya said that Srettha must have known about lawyer Pichit Chuenban's 2008 conviction when he appointed him to the cabinet.</p>

<p>"The appointment of the second respondent (Pichit) shows the first respondent (Srettha) has no honesty and breached ethical standards," Punya added.</p>

<p>Srettha leaves office after less than a year in the job -- the third prime minister from the Pheu Thai party to be kicked out by the Constitutional Court.</p>

<p>Thai politics has endured two decades of chronic instability, marked by coups, street protests and court orders, much of it energised by the long-running battle between the military, pro-royalist establishment and progressive parties linked to Pheu Thai patriarch Thaksin Shinawatra.</p>

<p>The court ruling dismisses not only Srettha but also his whole cabinet, and parliament will now have to meet to choose a new prime minister.</p>

<p><strong>Cycle of turmoil</strong></p>

<p>The case against Srettha centred around the appointment of Pichit, a lawyer associated with the family of billionaire former prime minister Thaksin -- former Manchester City owner and longtime bete noire of the kingdom's conservative pro-royalist, pro-military elite.</p>

<p>Pichit, sentenced to six months' jail in 2008 for a graft-related offence, quit the cabinet in a bid to save Srettha, but the court pressed ahead with a case initiated by a complaint by senators appointed by Thailand's former junta.</p>

<p>Srettha came to power less than a year ago at the head of a coalition led by Pheu Thai, after striking a deal with army-linked parties.</p>

<p>The ruling highlights old divisions in Thai politics between the conservative establishment and progressive parties such as Pheu Thai and its new rival MFP.</p>

<p>Thailand has endured a cycle of coups, court rulings, street protests and elections since the early 2000s as the establishment battled Thaksin and his allies for dominance.</p>

<p>The 40 senators who brought the complaint were all appointed by the military junta that ousted the elected Pheu Thai government in a 2014 coup.</p>

<p>The senate also played a crucial role in thwarting MFP's attempt to form a government after it won the most seats in last year's general election.</p>

<p>Senators alarmed by its pledges to reform lese-majeste laws and break up powerful business monopolies refused to endorse MFP's then-leader Pita Limjaroenrat as prime minister and the party was forced into opposition.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A New Zealand charity apologised on Wednesday for distributing dozens of pineapple-flavoured candies that were found to be laced with potentially lethal amounts of <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/lethal-amount-of-meth-found-hidden-in-sweets-in-new-zealand-probe-underway-6332877" target="_blank">methamphetamine.</a></p>

<p>The Auckland City Mission, that donates parcels of essentials to New Zealanders who cannot afford food, said it first became aware of the issue on Tuesday afternoon when some recipients complained about the foul-tasting candies.</p>

<p>Three people - a child, a teenager and a charity worker - sought medical treatment after tasting the boiled sweets, though none are currently in hospital, Detective Inspector Glenn Baldwin from Auckland police told reporters.</p>

<p>There was no suggestion of wrongdoing by the charity, he added.</p>

<p>"To say we are devastated is an understatement," the Mission said in a statement.</p>

<p>The candy, which was donated by an unknown member of the public, was tested by the New Zealand Drug Foundation charity, which found they contained a potentially lethal 3 grams (0.1 oz)of methamphetamine.</p>

<p>"A common dose to swallow is between 10-25mg, so this contaminated lolly contained up to 300 doses," said foundation Executive Director Sarah Helm.</p>

<p>Police believed the candies were the by product of an international drug trafficking operation and have called for them to be handed them over to the authorities. They are also investigating how the candies entered the country, Baldwin said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Starbucks, on Tuesday, announced that Brian Niccol, the CEO of Chipotle, would take over as its new CEO, just over a year after <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/laxman-narasimhan-brian-niccol-starbucks-indian-origin-ceo-who-was-recently-fired-almost-never-worked-past-6-pm-6333521">Laxman Narasimhan</a> assumed the role. Under Mr Narasimhan's leadership, Starbucks struggled with declining sales, partly attributed to a broader consumer backlash due to the corporation's alleged links to Israel. This resulted in growing calls for a boycott of American coffee houses across the Middle East and South Asia.</p>

<h2><strong>Why Starbucks is being boycotted</strong></h2>

<p>Starbucks has come under fire for its alleged connection with Israel. The calls for a boycott intensified, especially after Israel's ongoing war in Gaza killed nearly 40,000 Palestinians and left about 100,000 injured.</p>

<p>The controversy began with a hoax letter that claimed Starbucks was funding the Israeli military. This sparked outrage, particularly in regions sympathetic to the Palestinian cause. The boycott gained traction, especially on social media platforms such as TikTok and X, where the hashtag #boycottstarbucks had millions of views.&nbsp;Many continue to say that Starbucks is either directly or indirectly supporting Israel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But there's more to it. Starbucks is an American company, and the US has been a staunch ally of Israel, providing substantial military aid and diplomatic support for their 10-month-long military campaign in Gaza. Since October 7, in what Israel has described as "retaliatory" action, nearly all schools and hospitals have been targeted and scores of tent camps have been bombed killing thousands -- a vast majority of the children and women. The roughly 360 square km&nbsp;area of Gaza has been reduced to rubble. At least 1.9 million people have been displaced internally, with many forced to move nine to ten times during the course of this war.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Progressive groups in the US and abroad are increasingly vocal about their opposition to Israeli policies, fuelling the boycotts of American companies perceived to be pro-Israel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Starbucks' stance on the Israeli genocide</strong></h2>

<p>Starbucks has firmly denied claims of supporting Israel or any other government or military operation in the Middle East. In a statement, the coffee giant said they "condemned violence" and stressed their commitment to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all customers worldwide.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Starbucks is a global company committed to providing a place where everyone feels welcome and a sense of belonging, anywhere in the world. Our hearts break for all affected by the violence and conflict in the Middle East. We've always condemned violence against the innocent," they <a href="https://stories.starbucks.com/press/2023/what-has-starbucks-said-about-the-conflict-in-israel-and-gaza/ ">wrote</a>.</p>

<p>The company reiterated that it has "never contributed to any government or military operation", but the damage was done, and the brand continues to face backlash, particularly in the Middle East. In response to declining sales, Starbucks' Middle East franchises had to fire 2,000 employees in March.</p>

<h2><strong>Other brands facing calls for boycott</strong></h2>

<p>Starbucks is not alone in facing these challenges. Other global brands have also been targeted for boycotts due to perceived or real connections with Israel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fast food giant McDonalds was boycotted due to its support for Israel. The controversy began when Omri Padan, the CEO of McDonald's Israeli franchise, offered free meals to Israeli forces. This gesture was seen as a show of support for the Israeli military, sparking calls for a boycott. The boycott gained momentum in other countries such as Kuwait, Malaysia and Pakistan, where consumers accused McDonald's of having a pro-Israel stance.</p>

<p>Disney+ has faced boycotts due to its perceived support of Israel, with activists calling for a boycott of the platform. Clothing brand <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/feature/zara-pulls-out-controversial-ad-amid-boycott-calls-4658825#:~:text=People%20on%20X%20(formerly%20Twitter,at%20mass%20graves%20in%20Gaza. ">Zara was boycotted</a>&nbsp;after its marketing campaign featured rubble and body bags, leading to protests outside stores in several countries. Critics called the campaign "tone-deaf", forcing the clothing brand to pull it down from all platforms.</p>

<p>Puma has been targeted by boycotts due to its sponsorship of the Israeli Football Association.</p>

<p>Other fast-food chains have also faced boycotts in the Middle East due to their perceived support of Israel. Domino's, Pizza Hut, and KFC have all faced challenges in the region, while Burger King has faced boycotts in Turkey due to its perceived support of Israel. Coca-Cola, too, has faced similar boycotts in Turkey and parts of South Asia.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In December 2021, Tesla officially moved its corporate headquarters from Silicon Valley to a large factory in Austin, Texas. The announcement was made by the company in a filing with US securities regulators.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The company has relocated from Palo Alto, California, to what it has called a “Gigafactory” on Harold Green Road near Austin, Texas. Before that, Musk, in October 2021, at the company's annual meeting, hinted at the imminent move.<br />
<br />
In April this year, Reuters, citing an internal memo, &nbsp;reported that Tesla would lay off over 10% of its global workforce. This came as the company reportedly grappled with falling sales and an intensified price war for electric vehicles (EVs).<br />
<br />
In a post on X, Elon Musk earlier said, "About every five years, we need to reorganize and streamline the company for the next phase of growth".<br />
<br />
According to filings with the US regulators, the company's strength has jumped from around 1,00,000 in late 2021 to more than 140,000 in late 2023.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Afghanistan's Taliban rulers celebrated three years in power on Wednesday with a military parade paying homage to their homemade bombs used in war, fighter aircraft and goose-stepping security forces.</p>

<p>The Taliban's armed forces towed Soviet-era tanks and artillery pieces through the former US air base in Bagram, where Chinese and Iranian diplomats were among hundreds who gathered for the parade and speeches.</p>

<p>The former Bagram base once served as the linchpin for US-led operations against the Taliban for two decades.</p>

<p>A swarm of motorbikes strapped with yellow jerry cans, often used to carry homemade bombs during the fight against international forces, also rumbled past assembled officials.</p>

<p>There were also US-made armoured personnel carriers, the black-and-white flag of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan -- the Taliban government's formal name for the country -- fluttering above them.</p>

<p>Helicopters and fighter aircraft flew over the base, where Taliban fighters were once imprisoned, about 40 kilometres (25 miles) north of Kabul.</p>

<p>Taliban forces seized the capital on August 15, 2021, after the US-backed government collapsed and its leaders fled into exile. The anniversary is marked a day earlier on the Afghan calendar.</p>

<p>Their government remains unrecognised by any other state, with restrictions on women, who bear the brunt of policies the United Nations has called "gender apartheid", remaining a key sticking point.</p>

<p>"Three years have passed since the dreams of girls have been buried," Madina, a 20-year-old university student in Kabul, told AFP.</p>

<p>"It's a bitter feeling that every year, the celebration of this day reminds us of the efforts, memories, and goals we had for our future."</p>

<p>Prime Minister Mohammad Hassan Akhund, who had been scheduled to appear at Bagram, praised the Taliban authorities' victory over "Western occupiers" in a statement read by his chief of staff.</p>

<p>The Taliban government has "the responsibility to maintain Islamic rule, protect property, people's lives and the respect of our nation", he said.</p>

<h3><strong>'Victory'</strong></h3>

<p>Security has been a key priority for Taliban authorities as they consolidated their grip on power over the past three years, implementing laws based on their strict interpretation of Islam.</p>

<p>However, attacks by the Islamic State group remain a threat and extra security was deployed in Kabul and the Taliban's spiritual home of Kandahar in southern Afghanistan ahead of the "day of victory".</p>

<p>Helicopters also flew over the Ghazi stadium in Kabul, where hundreds of men gathered to watch an exhibition of athletics and performances of Taliban anthems.</p>

<p>The Taliban takeover is marked both in mid-August around the date Kabul fell and at the end of the month, when the last foreign troops left Afghanistan after a chaotic withdrawal.</p>

<p>The black-and-white standard decorated streets and trucks full of young men that choked Kabul streets.</p>

<p>Happy young boys carried a large flag in the Green Zone, once a secure enclave of foreign embassies, saying "We're ready to do a suicide attack!"</p>

<p>While many Afghans expressed relief at the end of 40 years of successive conflicts, the economy remains stagnant and the population mired in a worsening humanitarian crisis.</p>

<p>A joint statement from international non-governmental groups warned of the growing aid funding gap, with 23.7 million people in need of humanitarian assistance.</p>

<p>Women have been squeezed from public life -- banned from many jobs as well as parks and gyms -- and barred from secondary and higher education.</p>

<p>Human Rights Watch (HRW) reiterated calls for pressure on the Taliban government to lift restrictions on women.</p>

<p>"The third anniversary of the Taliban's takeover is a grim reminder of Afghanistan's human rights crisis, but it should also be a call for action," said Fereshta Abbasi, HRW's Afghanistan researcher.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Blindfolded, handcuffed and bundled out of his secret prison for the first time in eight years, Bangladeshi barrister Ahmad Bin Quasem held his breath and listened for the sound of a cocked pistol.</p>

<p>Instead, he was tossed from a car and into a muddy ditch on Dhaka's outskirts -- alive, at liberty, and with no knowledge of the national upheaval that had prompted his abrupt release.</p>

<p>"That's the first time I got fresh air in eight years," Quasem, 40, told AFP. "I thought they were going to kill me."</p>

<p>Sheikh Hasina, the premier responsible for Quasem's abduction and disappearance, had fled the country hours earlier.</p>

<p>Her August 5 departure brought a sudden curtain down on 15 years of autocracy that included the mass detention and extrajudicial killing of her political opponents.</p>

<p>But Quasem was in the dark.</p>

<p>He had been confined in the "House of Mirrors" (Aynaghar), a facility run by army intelligence, given its name because its detainees were never supposed to see any other person besides themselves.</p>

<p>Throughout his long incarceration, Quasem was shackled around the clock in windowless solitary confinement.</p>

<p>His jailers were under strict instruction not to relay news from the outside world.</p>

<h3><strong>Screaming</strong></h3>

<p>Elsewhere in the detention centre, guards blared music throughout the day that drowned out the Islamic call to prayer from nearby mosques.</p>

<p>It prevented Quasem, a devout Muslim, from knowing when he should offer his prayers -- and from keeping track of how long had elapsed since his abduction.</p>

<p>When the music was off, he heard the anguished sounds of other detainees.</p>

<p>"Slowly, slowly, I could realise that I am not alone," he said. "I could hear people crying, I could hear people being tortured, I could hear people screaming."</p>

<p>Human Rights Watch last year said security forces had committed "over 600 enforced disappearances" since Hasina came to power in 2009.</p>

<p>Rumours abounded of a secret black site housing some of that number, but Aynaghar was unknown to the public until the publication abroad of a 2022 whistleblower report.</p>

<p>Hasina's government consistently maintained afterwards that it did not exist.</p>

<p>It also denied committing enforced disappearances, claiming some of those reported missing had drowned in the Mediterranean while trying to reach Europe.</p>

<h3><strong>Days before my father's execution</strong></h3>

<p>Quasem is certain of the reason for his abduction.</p>

<p>His father, Mir Quasem Ali, a senior member of Bangladesh's largest Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami, was on trial that year.</p>

<p>Ali was accused of running a paramilitary group that tortured pro-independence Bangladeshis during the country's 1971 liberation war against Pakistan.</p>

<p>He and several others were indicted by a war crimes tribunal, ostensibly to bring justice to the victims of that devastating conflict, but widely seen as a means for Hasina to eliminate political opponents.</p>

<p>Whether or not Ali was guilty, there was no way of knowing from the mockery of justice that accompanied his prosecution.</p>

<p>Quasem, called to the bar in London and then aged 32, was running his father's defence.</p>

<p>His regular media briefings on procedural lapses and judicial bias at the tribunal, echoed by rights groups and UN experts, put a target on his back.</p>

<p>Plainclothes men entered his house one night, snatched him from his family, dragged him down the stairs and threw him in a waiting car.</p>

<p>"I never could believe in my wildest dreams that they would subject me to disappearance just days before my father's execution," Quasem said.</p>

<p>"I kept telling them, "Do you know who I am? I need to be there to conduct my case. I need to be there with my family.'"</p>

<p>Quasem's father was hanged four weeks later. Quasem did not know until about three more years had passed, when one of his jailers accidentally let it slip.</p>

<h3><strong>It felt like eight lifetimes</strong></h3>

<p>After the car that had carried him out of prison sped away, Quasem walked through the night to try and find his way home.</p>

<p>By sheer coincidence, he came across a medical clinic operated by a charity for which his father had once been a trustee.</p>

<p>He was recognised by a staff member and a phone number was frantically tracked down to contact his family, who came rushing to be with him.</p>

<p>But first, the excited chatter of those around him filled Quasem in on the weeks of student protests that had resulted in his release.</p>

<p>"This entire thing, it was made possible by few teenagers," he said.</p>

<p>"When I see these children, these kids, leading the way," he added. "I am really hopeful this will be the opportunity where Bangladesh finds a new direction."</p>

<p>Quasem and his family received AFP warmly into their home -- but the trauma of his detention was immediately apparent.</p>

<p>The thick, coiffed hairdo he sported before his detention has receded into a few wild tufts, and he has lost an alarming amount of weight.</p>

<p>His wife Tahmina Akhter said the publicity around Quasem's case left her feeling ostracised by other mothers at their children's school.</p>

<p>The family was reliably hounded every anniversary of his disappearance and warned to stop publicising it.</p>

<p>His two young daughters were three and four years old when he was taken away.</p>

<p>The elder witnessed his abduction and is still scared of certain authority figures, such as the private security guard posted outside her school.</p>

<p>The younger did not remember him at all.</p>

<p>"It didn't feel like eight years for us," Quasem's mother Ayesha Khatoon told AFP.</p>

<p>"It felt like eight lifetimes."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When girls complain to Gaza paediatrician Lobna al-Azaiza that they have no comb, she tells them to cut off their hair.</p>

<p>It's not just combs. Israel's blockade of the territory, ravaged by 10 months of war, means there is little or no shampoo, soap, period products or household cleaning materials.</p>

<p>Waste collection and sewage treatment have also collapsed, and it's easy to see why contagious diseases that thrive on overcrowding and lack of cleanliness - such as scabies or fungal infections - are on the rise.</p>

<p>"In the past period, the most common disease we have seen was skin rashes, skin diseases, which have many causes, including the overcrowding in the camps, the increased heat inside the tents, the sweating among children, and the lack of sufficient water for bathing," the doctor said.</p>

<p>Azaiza used to work at Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahia until Israeli tanks separated the north of the besieged enclave from the south.</p>

<p>Like most of Gaza's medics, she has adapted and continues to treat patients, walking to work past her own ruined house, demolished by an Israeli strike.</p>

<p>The tent clinic she set up with a small team began by treating children but has by necessity become a practice for whole families, most of whom have also been ordered or bombed out of their homes, like the vast majority of Gaza's 2.3 million people.</p>

<p>Even the medication that is available is often unaffordable; a tube of simple burn ointment can now cost 200 shekels ($53).</p>

<p>International aid deliveries have been dramatically reduced since Israel seized control of the Rafah border crossing from Egypt, exacerbating a humanitarian crisis.</p>

<p>Israel denies responsibility for delays in getting urgent humanitarian aid in, saying that the UN and others are responsible for its distribution inside the enclave.</p>

<p>Azaiza has little doubt about where the immediate solution lies:</p>

<p>"The border crossing must be opened so that we can bring in medications, as most of the current ones are ineffective: zero effect, there is no effect on the skin diseases that we see."</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Billionaire venture capitalist Vinod Khosla today slammed Elon Musk over his climate-talk tutorial to Republican Party Presidential candidate Donald Trump, saying his thoughts about CO2 ppm (parts per million) levels and their consequences were simply "dumb".</p>

<p>In a thread on X social media platform, Khosla said that regarding Trump's point of the temperature going up in some places and down in others, "you know as well as I that's a dumb way to look at it. The aggregate macro trends are indisputable. The earth is warming".</p>

<p>He said that he does not expect former US President "to know the nuances of various CO2 ppm levels and their consequences, and him reaching out to the person who has arguably done more for climate than anyone else is pretty sensible".</p>

<p>"You had a responsibility that I think you largely abdicated by downplaying the reality of things," Khosla told Musk.</p>

<p>Musk tried to educate Trump about climate change, greenhouse gases, and the future of renewable energy. Making the case for renewable energy, he spoke to Trump as if he were tutoring a kid, that there are two reasons for adopting it - the finite petroleum resources and carbon dioxide (CO2) build-up's impact on health.</p>

<p>The Tesla CEO said: "People don't realise this: If you go past a thousand parts of CO2 per a million in the atmosphere, you start getting headaches and nausea. So even without global warming, it's not a comfortable place. So you don't want to get too close to that number".</p>

<p>Khosla argued, saying that focusing on 1,000 ppm because that's when things start to get "uncomfortable" for humans (nausea and headaches) is "totally off".</p>

<p>"At 500 ppm, the likelihood of catastrophic climate impacts, such as large-scale disruptions to ecosystems, accelerated ice melt, and extreme weather events, becomes much higher. Some have warned that exceeding 500 ppm could lead to irreversible damage and tipping points in the Earth's climate system. You know this," the serial investor told the Tesla CEO.</p>

<p>"We're at 420 ppm so even at the pace of 2-3 ppm increase per year. we could be 25-40 years away from a climate disaster. Which brings me to my next point -- we absolutely should be vilifying oil and gas companies. They have been hiding research on climate, and rather than engaging transparently on what's needed for a 30-year transition (while opposing electric mind you!) they've been behaving in bad faith despite knowing full well what they're doing," Khosla further posted.<br />

       <description><![CDATA[The incident has raised concerns about the safety of tourist attractions in China and an inquiry has been launched to determine the cause of the malfunction.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tragedy struck at the Detian waterfall in Southern China on Saturday when the 'Magic Carpet' ride, a popular tourist attraction, malfunctioned, resulting in a tourist's death.&nbsp;60 tourists were also injured as a result of the incident.&nbsp; According to the <em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/at-least-one-dead-60-others-injured-at-guangxi-tourist-spot">Straits Times</a></em>, the ride, a conveyor belt that transports visitors uphill while taking in the scenic view, suddenly reversed direction at 1:56 pm, sending passengers tumbling downhill and crashing into each other.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Emergency services rushed to the scene to treat the injured, with many being transported to nearby hospitals for further medical attention. Meanwhile, the attraction has been suspended&nbsp;and the scenic area has been closed&nbsp;following the incident.&nbsp;Visitors with online ticket bookings will receive full refunds through the original purchase platform.</p>

<p>A witness who was on board the Magic Carpet ride took to social media to share her harrowing experience. In an interview with the<em><a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202408/1317772.shtml"> Global Times</a></em>, she revealed that the conveyor belt was moving upwards when the accident occurred, with passengers seated just two feet apart.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She said, ''It suddenly stopped and started sliding down. The crowd in front and behind collided due to inertia and piled up together. The safety panels on both sides were also broken at that time.''</p>

<p>Another witness described how her mobile phone was flung out of her hands as the ride rapidly descended backwards, leaving her with multiple abrasions on her body.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the aftermath of the tragedy, the management of the Detian Waterfall attraction issued a statement expressing their "deepest condolences" to the family of the dead and apologising to those injured.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The incident has raised concerns about the safety of tourist attractions in China and an inquiry has been launched to determine the cause of the malfunction.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, the Detian Waterfall is a large transnational waterfall on the border between China and Vietnam. Renowned for its majestic natural beauty, this stunning wonder attracts visitors from both countries.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In January 2023, the ride experienced a similar malfunction, sparking concerns about its safety.&nbsp;The accident resulted in injuries to some people on site without serious issues. The ride was swiftly repaired and resumed operation within two hours.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <description><![CDATA[Japan's unpopular Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is set to quit after announcing on Wednesday he will not seek re-election as party chief.]]></description>
       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japan's unpopular Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is set to quit after announcing on Wednesday he will not seek re-election as party chief.</p>

<p>The ruling Liberal Democratic Party, which has governed almost uninterrupted since 1945, is due to hold a leadership contest next month, with the winner to become prime minister.</p>

<p>"In this (party) presidential election, it is necessary to show the people that the LDP is changing and the party is a new LDP," Kishida told reporters in Tokyo.</p>

<p>"For this, transparent and open elections and free and vigorous debate are important. The most obvious first step to show that the LDP will change is for me to step aside," he said.</p>

<p>Kishida, 67, in office since October 2021, has seen his and his party's poll ratings slide sharply in response to rising prices hitting Japanese incomes and several scandals.</p>

<p>In November, Kishida announced a stimulus package worth 17 trillion yen (more than $100 billion at the time) as he tried to ease the pressure from inflation and rescue his premiership.</p>

<p>But this failed to make him any less unpopular, both among voters in the world's fourth-largest economy and within his own party.</p>

<p>Along with inflation -- for Japanese voters an unfamiliar and unwelcome phenomenon -- growth has spluttered, shrinking by 0.7 percent in the first quarter.</p>

<p>Despite some recovery in recent weeks, the yen has been one of the world's worst-performing currencies, making life easier for exporters but pushing up import prices.</p>

<h3><strong>Early exit</strong></h3>

<p>Kishida could in theory have governed until 2025, and there had been speculation he might call a snap election to shore up his position.</p>

<p>But NHK reported that growing voices inside the LDP believed it would fare badly in elections under Kishida. In April, the party lost three by-elections.</p>

<p>Kishida, who last year escaped a pipe-bomb attack unscathed, has also faced severe criticism over a major kickback scandal linked to fundraising parties.</p>

<p>Kishida decided to jump because he knew he would lose the leadership battle, said Koichi Nakano, a political science professor at Sophia University.</p>

<p>"He has failed to close ranks within the LDP," Nakano told AFP.</p>

<p>But he added: "For an LDP leader, staying in power for three years is longer than the average."</p>

<p>Before Wednesday, several figures were mooted in local media as possible challengers to Kishida including digital minister Taro Kono and economic security minister Sanae Takaichi.</p>

<p>The Yomiuri Shimbun daily reported that some LDP members have high hopes for Shigeru Ishiba, former party number two, and Shinjiro Koizumi, former environment minister and son of ex-premier Junichiro Koizumi.</p>

<h3><strong>Muscular defence</strong></h3>

<p>Kishida has sided decisively with Ukraine since Russia's invasion, welcoming President Volodymyr Zelensky to a G7 summit in Hiroshima and visiting Kyiv.</p>

<p>Under Kishida, Japan also pledged to double its defence spending to the NATO standard of two percent of GDP by 2027.</p>

<p>Encouraged by the United States as the two countries seek to confront an increasingly assertive China, this marked a major change for Japan from decades of strict pacifism.</p>

<p>US President Joe Biden hosted Kishida at the White House in April when the two countries announced a "new era" in cooperation.</p>

<p>Japan and the Philippines in July signed a defence pact allowing for the deployment of troops on each other's territory.</p>

<p>On climate, Kishida promised at COP 28 in December that Japan would build no new coal power stations that were "unabated", or lacked measures to reduce emissions.</p>

<p>Critics said that the necessary technologies, such as "co-firing" coal with ammonia or capturing and storing emissions, were unproven on a large scale.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United Auto Workers Union said on Tuesday it has filed complaints with the National Labor Relations Board against Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk over attempts to threaten and intimidate workers.</p>

<p>It is unclear whether the NLRB would take action against Trump for his comments on Monday during a two-hour conversation with Musk that was broadcast on social media platform X.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="zxx"><a href="https://t.co/47H3HLczZL">pic.twitter.com/47H3HLczZL</a></p>
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1823430600872878321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 13, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The UAW seized upon Trump's remarks as the union rallies behind Democratic presidential candidate and Vice President Kamala Harris and encourages its nearly 400,000 workers to vote for her over Trump. The issue is especially pertinent in battleground states like Michigan which could determine who wins the White House in November. The UAW endorsed Harris at the end of July.</p>

<p>"You're the greatest cutter," Trump said to Musk during Monday's conversation, complimenting the CEO's ability to cut costs by saying he would not tolerate workers going on strike. "I mean, I look at what you do. You walk in, you just say: 'You want to quit?' They go on strike - I won't mention the name of the company - but they go on strike. And you say: 'That's okay, you're all gone.'"</p>

<p>Musk chuckled but did not respond to Trump's comments, making it harder for the NLRB to find him liable for making illegal threats to workers at his companies, said Wilma Liebman, chair of the NLRB under former President Barack Obama.</p>

<p>Under federal law, workers cannot be fired for going on strike, and threatening to do so is illegal under the National Labor Relations Act, the UAW said in a statement.</p>

<p>After the union's action on Tuesday, Musk criticised UAW President Shawn Fain in a social media post, alluding to two past union presidents who went to prison for bribery and corruption. "Based on recent news, it looks like this guy will join them!" Musk said.</p>

<p>A court-appointed monitor of the UAW is investigating several union executives, including allegations that Fain retaliated against a member of his board when the person did not take actions that would have benefitted Fain's domestic partner and her sister. The UAW could not immediately be reached to comment on Musk's response.</p>

<p>Trump campaign officials said his pledged 100% tariff on Chinese imports would strengthen the industry, while Harris' EV policies are hurting American manufacturing.</p>

<p>"This frivolous lawsuit is a shameless political stunt intended to erode President Trump's overwhelming support among America's workers," Trump campaign senior adviser Brian Hughes said in a statement.</p>

<p>The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment after the UAW's action.</p>

<p>Fain and Trump have exchanged barbs in the past.</p>

<p>"Both Trump and Musk want working-class people to sit down and shut up, and they laugh about it openly. It's disgusting, illegal, and totally predictable from these two clowns," Fain said in a statement on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Trump has called for the union leader to be fired, saying he is responsible for US auto manufacturing becoming weaker.</p>

<p>UAW members in Michigan tend to side with Democrats, but pro-Trump workers have organised their own rallies in recent weeks.</p>

<p>In the 2020 presidential race, 62% of Michigan households with a union member voted for President Joe Biden, helping him win the state, according to Edison Research. By contrast, union households split 53% to 40% for Hillary Clinton in 2016, when she narrowly lost the state and the national race.</p>

<p>Sean O'Brien, president of the Teamsters, another key labour group, said of Trump's comments, "Firing workers for organising, striking, and exercising their rights as Americans is economic terrorism."</p>

<p>The Teamsters have traditionally endorsed a candidate after party conventions. O'Brien spoke at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in July.</p>

<p>The union had also requested a speaking opportunity at the upcoming Democratic National Convention but it had not heard back, spokesperson Kara Deniz said. It had also invited Harris to a roundtable but had not heard back.</p>

<h3><strong>Sending a message</strong></h3>

<p>The NLRB has limited power to punish unlawful labor practices and the process often lasts years. In cases involving illegal threats, the board can order employers to cease and desist from such conduct and to post notices in the workplace informing workers of their rights. Unions can also use favourable rulings from the NLRB to engage workers they are trying to organise.</p>

<p>"Everyone knows the NLRB remedies are toothless to start with, but it's not so much for the remedy as for sending both a political message and an organising message," former NLRB head Liebman said, referring to the UAW's action on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Fain filed separate complaints with the NLRB against the Trump campaign and Tesla citing Trump and Musk as the employers' representatives, claiming both men had made statements suggesting they "would fire employees engaged in protected concerted activity, including striking." The complaints did not provide further detail.</p>

<p>The NLRB has jurisdiction over the Trump campaign as an employer, but not Trump himself.</p>

<p>The UAW led a six-week strike against Detroit's Big Three automakers last autumn, before winning record contracts.</p>

<h3><strong>Musk and the NLRB</strong></h3>

<p>Musk, who has endorsed Trump for president, has had numerous run-ins with the labour board. His rocket company SpaceX is currently challenging the entire structure of the agency in a pair of pending lawsuits. Those cases stemmed from NLRB complaints accusing SpaceX of firing engineers who were critical of Musk and forcing employees to sign severance agreements with unlawful terms.</p>

<p>In March, a US appeals court upheld an NLRB decision that said Musk illegally threatened Tesla employees by tweeting in 2018: "Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union ... But why pay union dues &amp; give up stock options for nothing?"</p>

<p>Tesla is separately facing allegations from the board that it illegally discouraged unionising at a Buffalo, New York, plant.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Starbucks on Tuesday replaced its Indian-origin CEO <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://stories.starbucks.com/press/2024/starbucks-names-brian-niccol-as-chairman-and-chief-executive-officer/" target="_blank">Laxman Narasimhan with Brian Niccol</a>, chief executive at Chipotle. Narasimhan steps down as chief executive and as a member of the Starbucks board "with immediate effect," the coffee giant said in an official statement.</p>

<p>A veteran of PepsiCo and other consumer brands, <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/starbucks-indian-origin-ceo-laxman-narasimhan-to-work-as-barista-in-stores-every-month-3889617" target="_blank">Laxman Narasimhan</a> took over the top spot in March 2023 after a period of working with longtime Starbucks CEO and interim boss Howard Schultz.</p>

<p>Last month, Narasimhan spoke about the importance of work-life balance in an interview with Fortune magazine, and declared that he "almost never" worked past 6 pm.</p>

<p>Narasimhan said he finished his work by 6 pm, adding that if anyone got a minute of his time after 6 pm, they "better be sure that it's important".</p>

<p>"I am very disciplined about balance. If there's anything after 6 pm and I am in town, it's got to be a pretty high bar to keep me away from the family. Anybody who gets a minute of time after that better be sure that it's important... Because if not it will just wait for another day," the 57-year-old had said.</p>

<p>This quote from his July 7 interview has now gone viral on social media with several users claiming that he was "fired".</p>

<h3><strong>Starbucks Praises Laxman Narasimhan</strong></h3>

<p>In its statement, Starbucks praised <a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/why-starbucks-fired-laxman-narasimhan-a-year-after-his-appointment-as-ceo-6333478" target="_blank">Laxman Narasimhan</a>, saying he drove innovation in the brand's supply chains and boosted its store operations during his tenure.</p>

<p>"In the face of some challenging headwinds, Laxman has been laser focused on improving the business to meet the needs of our customers and partners. We all wish him the very best and know he will do great things in the future," Mellody Hobson, Starbucks board chair, said. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>"On behalf of the board, I want to sincerely thank Laxman for his contributions to Starbucks, and his dedication to our people and brand," Hobson added.</p>

<p>The leadership shifts at Starbucks come at a time when the American multinational chain of coffeehouses is pushing to turn around its business while contending with broad-based sales declines in its most recent financial results.</p>

<p>Starbucks has cited weakening consumer sentiment and difficult market conditions in China as factors in its troubles.</p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Starbucks said Tuesday that Brian Niccol, chief executive at Chipotle, would be the coffee chain's new CEO -- just over a year after current boss Laxman Narasimhan took over the role.</p>

<p>Narasimhan steps down as chief executive and as a member of the Starbucks board "with immediate effect," said the company in a statement.</p>

<p>Starbucks shares were around 21 percent higher in early afternoon trading, while Chipotle Mexican Grill shares fell by about eight percent.</p>

<p>The leadership shifts come as Starbucks pushes to turn around its business, while contending with broad-based sales declines in its most recent financial results.</p>

<p>The company also saw a bruising April earnings report, battering its shares and prompting Narasimhan to promise a reset.</p>

<p>Starbucks previously cited weakening consumer sentiment and tough market conditions in China as factors in its troubles.</p>

<p>The company has also been contending with pressure from activist fund Elliott Investment Management, which took a stake in the chain and had been seeking ways to boost the share price.</p>

<p>The coffee giant is working meanwhile to finalize contracts with unionized stores.</p>

<p>Lynne Fox, president of the Workers United union, said in a statement Tuesday: "We look forward to continuing to work with Starbucks to resolve massive outstanding litigation and reach fair collective bargaining agreements in the coming months."</p>

<p>"The replacement of Laxman Narasimhan as Starbucks CEO is the result of growing dissatisfaction, particularly from activist investors, over the way the chain has been run," said Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData, in a statement.</p>

<p>"While some of the slowdown can be attributed to a more sluggish consumer cutting back, much is also the result of a worsening store experience and a lack of innovation in areas like food," he added.</p>

<p>Investors could be hoping for improvements in day-to-day operations by bringing Niccol on board.</p>

<p>"Brian is a culture carrier who brings a wealth of experience and a proven track record of driving innovation and growth," said Starbucks board chair Mellody Hobson in a statement as the company announced the leadership changes.</p>

<p>Niccol has served as Chipotle's CEO since 2018.</p>

<p>In naming him Starbucks' new CEO, the company noted that his work at Chipotle had "driven significant growth and value creation," citing revenue that has nearly doubled and higher profit.</p>

<p>Narasimhan, a veteran of PepsiCo and other consumer brands, had taken over the top spot in 2023 after a period working with longtime Starbucks CEO and interim boss Howard Schultz.</p>

<p>The statement noted that Narasimhan, during his tenure, drove innovation in the brand's supply chains and boosted its store operations.</p>

<p>Niccol will start in his new role on September 9, with Starbucks chief financial officer Rachel Ruggeri serving as interim CEO until then.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite three years of improved security following the end of the Taliban's insurgency, Afghanistan's economy remains stagnant and its population is in the grips of a worsening humanitarian crisis.</p>

<p>A third of Afghanistan's roughly 40 million people live on bread and tea, according to the United Nations, there is massive unemployment, and the World Bank warns of zero growth over the next three years.</p>

<p>But there have been some positive changes since the Taliban takeover in 2021 -- even if their government remains unrecognised by any other country.</p>

<p>The currency has been resilient, corruption is no longer ubiquitous, and tax collection has improved.</p>

<p>Authorities have also built "economic, commercial, transit and investment" ties in the region, according to Ahmad Zahid, deputy commerce and industry minister.</p>

<p>Afghanistan has great mineral and agricultural potential, which the Taliban government is attempting to exploit, but they are impeded by poor infrastructure and a lack of domestic and foreign expertise and capital.</p>

<p>Though Afghans welcome the improved security in their lives, many are just trying to make ends meet.</p>

<p>AFP spoke to four people from different parts of the country ahead of the anniversary of the fall of Kabul this week:</p>

<h3><strong>The optimistic businessman&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>For 54-year-old Azizullah Rehmati, business is booming -- his saffron company in the western province of Herat is set to double production this year.</p>

<p>Until 2021, his "Red Gold Saffron Company" hired armed guards to escort the valuable spice from the factory to the airport, but the improved security climate has done away with the need for such overt protection.</p>

<p>"Now there is no problem," said Rehmati, who exports to 27 countries.</p>

<p>At his processing facility, women sort the red stigmas of the precious saffron spice with tongs.</p>

<p>Taliban government restrictions on women have slashed their participation in the workforce, but Rehmati's company is among the 50 per cent of Afghan employers who still hire women.</p>

<p>Still, a key challenge for Rehmati -- and Afghanistan as a whole -- is the crippled banking sector.</p>

<p>"It is so important that we have the banking channels reopened," said Sulaiman Bin Shah, deputy trade minister under the previous government.</p>

<p>The sector has been blocked by international sanctions and the freezing of central bank assets.</p>

<p>Rehmati's bank can't send money abroad -- or receive transfers -- meaning he has to resort to more expensive private money changers in Dubai.</p>

<p>Getting visas for foreign trips is also a major problem.</p>

<p>Many foreign nations shuttered their embassies in the wake of the Taliban takeover and Afghan passports are rated the worst in the world by the Henley Index, which tracks global ease of travel.</p>

<p>"We will fall back from the world market," Rehmati said.</p>

<h3><strong>The out-of-work musician&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Wahid Nekzai Logari played in Afghanistan's national orchestra and performed concerts on the sarinda, a traditional stringed instrument, as well as the harmonium.</p>

<p>"I supported my whole family. We had a good life," said the 46-year-old in his modest home in a Kabul suburb.</p>

<p>But the Taliban government has prohibited public performances of music, deeming it un-Islamic, leaving thousands involved in the industry destitute.</p>

<p>"Now I'm unemployed," Logari said.</p>

<p>To feed his family of seven he sometimes drives a cab -- earning just 5,000 afghanis a month ($70), a fifth of what he used to earn from his concerts.</p>

<p>"Nobody told us, 'You can't play music anymore, but we'll find you a way to feed your family'," he said.</p>

<h3><strong>The insurgent-turned-bureaucrat&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Abdul Wali Shaheen wanted to "die a martyr's death" in the Taliban ranks, but after their victory, he swapped his rocket launcher for a computer at the Department of Information and Culture in Ghazni province.</p>

<p>"I wasn't as stressed (then) as I am today," the 31-year-old said wryly.</p>

<p>"All we did was wage jihad, now it's harder. I have more responsibilities in regards to the people."</p>

<p>Still, Shaheen's monthly salary of 10,000 Afghanis is enough to feed his family of five, and he is happy with the direction the country is going.</p>

<p>"I give the Emirate a 10/10 for these three years," he said.</p>

<p>"Everything is going well and we have hope for the future."</p>

<h3><strong>The Hidden Beautician&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The order to close beauty salons last year "broke her heart", but Sayeda -- not her real name -- reopened in secret four months ago elsewhere in Kabul.</p>

<p>"We found this place to rent, with the condition that customers come very discreetly and that some of our employees sleep here so that neighbours think a family lives here," said the 21-year-old manager.</p>

<p>"Before, we had 30 to 40 customers a day, now it's six or seven," said Sayeda, who has nevertheless kept her 25 employees so that "everyone has an income".</p>

<p>Sayeda's salary has dropped from 25,000 afghanis per month to between 8,000 and 12,000.</p>

<p>"We're working in hiding and we don't know for how much longer," she said, noting the risk of being shut down by the police.</p>

<p>When they've "found some (underground) salons, they broke the equipment, mistreated the staff" and imposed fines, she said.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>]]></content:encoded>
